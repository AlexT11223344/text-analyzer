103: Outside Dorlcote Mill
104: 
105: A wide plain, where the broadening Floss hurries on between its green
106: banks to the sea, and the loving tide, rushing to meet it, checks its
107: passage with an impetuous embrace. On this mighty tide the black
108: ships—laden with the fresh-scented fir-planks, with rounded sacks of
109: oil-bearing seed, or with the dark glitter of coal—are borne along to
110: the town of St Ogg’s, which shows its aged, fluted red roofs and the
111: broad gables of its wharves between the low wooded hill and the
112: river-brink, tingeing the water with a soft purple hue under the
113: transient glance of this February sun. Far away on each hand stretch
114: the rich pastures, and the patches of dark earth made ready for the
115: seed of broad-leaved green crops, or touched already with the tint of
116: the tender-bladed autumn-sown corn. There is a remnant still of last
117: year’s golden clusters of beehive-ricks rising at intervals beyond the
118: hedgerows; and everywhere the hedgerows are studded with trees; the
119: distant ships seem to be lifting their masts and stretching their
120: red-brown sails close among the branches of the spreading ash. Just by
121: the red-roofed town the tributary Ripple flows with a lively current
122: into the Floss. How lovely the little river is, with its dark changing
123: wavelets! It seems to me like a living companion while I wander along
124: the bank, and listen to its low, placid voice, as to the voice of one
125: who is deaf and loving. I remember those large dipping willows. I
126: remember the stone bridge.
127: 
128: And this is Dorlcote Mill. I must stand a minute or two here on the
129: bridge and look at it, though the clouds are threatening, and it is far
130: on in the afternoon. Even in this leafless time of departing February
131: it is pleasant to look at,—perhaps the chill, damp season adds a charm
132: to the trimly kept, comfortable dwelling-house, as old as the elms and
133: chestnuts that shelter it from the northern blast. The stream is
134: brimful now, and lies high in this little withy plantation, and half
135: drowns the grassy fringe of the croft in front of the house. As I look
136: at the full stream, the vivid grass, the delicate bright-green powder
137: softening the outline of the great trunks and branches that gleam from
138: under the bare purple boughs, I am in love with moistness, and envy the
139: white ducks that are dipping their heads far into the water here among
140: the withes, unmindful of the awkward appearance they make in the drier
141: world above.
142: 
143: The rush of the water and the booming of the mill bring a dreamy
144: deafness, which seems to heighten the peacefulness of the scene. They
145: are like a great curtain of sound, shutting one out from the world
146: beyond. And now there is the thunder of the huge covered wagon coming
147: home with sacks of grain. That honest wagoner is thinking of his
148: dinner, getting sadly dry in the oven at this late hour; but he will
149: not touch it till he has fed his horses,—the strong, submissive,
150: meek-eyed beasts, who, I fancy, are looking mild reproach at him from
151: between their blinkers, that he should crack his whip at them in that
152: awful manner as if they needed that hint! See how they stretch their
153: shoulders up the slope toward the bridge, with all the more energy
154: because they are so near home. Look at their grand shaggy feet that
155: seem to grasp the firm earth, at the patient strength of their necks,
156: bowed under the heavy collar, at the mighty muscles of their struggling
157: haunches! I should like well to hear them neigh over their
158: hardly-earned feed of corn, and see them, with their moist necks freed
159: from the harness, dipping their eager nostrils into the muddy pond. Now
160: they are on the bridge, and down they go again at a swifter pace, and
161: the arch of the covered wagon disappears at the turning behind the
162: trees.
163: 
164: Now I can turn my eyes toward the mill again, and watch the unresting
165: wheel sending out its diamond jets of water. That little girl is
166: watching it too; she has been standing on just the same spot at the
167: edge of the water ever since I paused on the bridge. And that queer
168: white cur with the brown ear seems to be leaping and barking in
169: ineffectual remonstrance with the wheel; perhaps he is jealous because
170: his playfellow in the beaver bonnet is so rapt in its movement. It is
171: time the little playfellow went in, I think; and there is a very bright
172: fire to tempt her: the red light shines out under the deepening gray of
173: the sky. It is time, too, for me to leave off resting my arms on the
174: cold stone of this bridge....
175: 
176: Ah, my arms are really benumbed. I have been pressing my elbows on the
177: arms of my chair, and dreaming that I was standing on the bridge in
178: front of Dorlcote Mill, as it looked one February afternoon many years
179: ago. Before I dozed off, I was going to tell you what Mr and Mrs
180: Tulliver were talking about, as they sat by the bright fire in the
181: left-hand parlour, on that very afternoon I have been dreaming of.
182: 
183: 
184: Chapter II.
185: 
186: Mr Tulliver, of Dorlcote Mill, Declares His Resolution about Tom
187: 
188: “What I want, you know,” said Mr Tulliver,—“what I want is to give Tom
189: a good eddication; an eddication as’ll be a bread to him. That was what
190: I was thinking of when I gave notice for him to leave the academy at
191: Lady-day. I mean to put him to a downright good school at Midsummer.
192: The two years at th’ academy ’ud ha’ done well enough, if I’d meant to
193: make a miller and farmer of him, for he’s had a fine sight more
194: schoolin’ nor _I_ ever got. All the learnin’ _my_ father ever paid for
195: was a bit o’ birch at one end and the alphabet at th’ other. But I
196: should like Tom to be a bit of a scholard, so as he might be up to the
197: tricks o’ these fellows as talk fine and write with a flourish. It ’ud
198: be a help to me wi’ these lawsuits, and arbitrations, and things. I
199: wouldn’t make a downright lawyer o’ the lad,—I should be sorry for him
200: to be a raskill,—but a sort o’ engineer, or a surveyor, or an
201: auctioneer and vallyer, like Riley, or one o’ them smartish businesses
202: as are all profits and no outlay, only for a big watch-chain and a high
203: stool. They’re pretty nigh all one, and they’re not far off being even
204: wi’ the law, _I_ believe; for Riley looks Lawyer Wakem i’ the face as
205: hard as one cat looks another. _He’s_ none frightened at him.”
206: 
207: Mr Tulliver was speaking to his wife, a blond comely woman in a
208: fan-shaped cap (I am afraid to think how long it is since fan-shaped
209: caps were worn, they must be so near coming in again. At that time,
210: when Mrs Tulliver was nearly forty, they were new at St Ogg’s, and
211: considered sweet things).
212: 
213: “Well, Mr Tulliver, you know best: _I’ve_ no objections. But hadn’t I
214: better kill a couple o’ fowl, and have th’ aunts and uncles to dinner
215: next week, so as you may hear what sister Glegg and sister Pullet have
216: got to say about it? There’s a couple o’ fowl _wants_ killing!”
217: 
218: “You may kill every fowl i’ the yard if you like, Bessy; but I shall
219: ask neither aunt nor uncle what I’m to do wi’ my own lad,” said Mr
220: Tulliver, defiantly.
221: 
222: “Dear heart!” said Mrs Tulliver, shocked at this sanguinary rhetoric,
223: “how can you talk so, Mr Tulliver? But it’s your way to speak
224: disrespectful o’ my family; and sister Glegg throws all the blame upo’
225: me, though I’m sure I’m as innocent as the babe unborn. For nobody’s
226: ever heard me say as it wasn’t lucky for my children to have aunts and
227: uncles as can live independent. Howiver, if Tom’s to go to a new
228: school, I should like him to go where I can wash him and mend him; else
229: he might as well have calico as linen, for they’d be one as yallow as
230: th’ other before they’d been washed half-a-dozen times. And then, when
231: the box is goin’ back’ard and forrard, I could send the lad a cake, or
232: a pork-pie, or an apple; for he can do with an extry bit, bless him!
233: whether they stint him at the meals or no. My children can eat as much
234: victuals as most, thank God!”
235: 
236: “Well, well, we won’t send him out o’ reach o’ the carrier’s cart, if
237: other things fit in,” said Mr Tulliver. “But you mustn’t put a spoke i’
238: the wheel about the washin,’ if we can’t get a school near enough.
239: That’s the fault I have to find wi’ you, Bessy; if you see a stick i’
240: the road, you’re allays thinkin’ you can’t step over it. You’d want me
241: not to hire a good wagoner, ’cause he’d got a mole on his face.”
242: 
243: “Dear heart!” said Mrs Tulliver, in mild surprise, “when did I iver
244: make objections to a man because he’d got a mole on his face? I’m sure
245: I’m rether fond o’ the moles; for my brother, as is dead an’ gone, had
246: a mole on his brow. But I can’t remember your iver offering to hire a
247: wagoner with a mole, Mr Tulliver. There was John Gibbs hadn’t a mole on
248: his face no more nor you have, an’ I was all for having you hire _him_;
249: an’ so you did hire him, an’ if he hadn’t died o’ th’ inflammation, as
250: we paid Dr Turnbull for attending him, he’d very like ha’ been drivin’
251: the wagon now. He might have a mole somewhere out o’ sight, but how was
252: I to know that, Mr Tulliver?”
253: 
254: “No, no, Bessy; I didn’t mean justly the mole; I meant it to stand for
255: summat else; but niver mind—it’s puzzling work, talking is. What I’m
256: thinking on, is how to find the right sort o’ school to send Tom to,
257: for I might be ta’en in again, as I’ve been wi’ th’ academy. I’ll have
258: nothing to do wi’ a ’cademy again: whativer school I send Tom to, it
259: sha’n’t be a ’cademy; it shall be a place where the lads spend their
260: time i’ summat else besides blacking the family’s shoes, and getting up
261: the potatoes. It’s an uncommon puzzling thing to know what school to
262: pick.”
263: 
264: Mr Tulliver paused a minute or two, and dived with both hands into his
265: breeches pockets as if he hoped to find some suggestion there.
266: Apparently he was not disappointed, for he presently said, “I know what
267: I’ll do: I’ll talk it over wi’ Riley; he’s coming to-morrow, t’
268: arbitrate about the dam.”
269: 
270: “Well, Mr Tulliver, I’ve put the sheets out for the best bed, and
271: Kezia’s got ’em hanging at the fire. They aren’t the best sheets, but
272: they’re good enough for anybody to sleep in, be he who he will; for as
273: for them best Holland sheets, I should repent buying ’em, only they’ll
274: do to lay us out in. An’ if you was to die to-morrow, Mr Tulliver,
275: they’re mangled beautiful, an’ all ready, an’ smell o’ lavender as it
276: ’ud be a pleasure to lay ’em out; an’ they lie at the left-hand corner
277: o’ the big oak linen-chest at the back: not as I should trust anybody
278: to look ’em out but myself.”
279: 
280: As Mrs Tulliver uttered the last sentence, she drew a bright bunch of
281: keys from her pocket, and singled out one, rubbing her thumb and finger
282: up and down it with a placid smile while she looked at the clear fire.
283: If Mr Tulliver had been a susceptible man in his conjugal relation, he
284: might have supposed that she drew out the key to aid her imagination in
285: anticipating the moment when he would be in a state to justify the
286: production of the best Holland sheets. Happily he was not so; he was
287: only susceptible in respect of his right to water-power; moreover, he
288: had the marital habit of not listening very closely, and since his
289: mention of Mr Riley, had been apparently occupied in a tactile
290: examination of his woollen stockings.
291: 
292: “I think I’ve hit it, Bessy,” was his first remark after a short
293: silence. “Riley’s as likely a man as any to know o’ some school; he’s
294: had schooling himself, an’ goes about to all sorts o’ places,
295: arbitratin’ and vallyin’ and that. And we shall have time to talk it
296: over to-morrow night when the business is done. I want Tom to be such a
297: sort o’ man as Riley, you know,—as can talk pretty nigh as well as if
298: it was all wrote out for him, and knows a good lot o’ words as don’t
299: mean much, so as you can’t lay hold of ’em i’ law; and a good solid
300: knowledge o’ business too.”
301: 
302: “Well,” said Mrs Tulliver, “so far as talking proper, and knowing
303: everything, and walking with a bend in his back, and setting his hair
304: up, I shouldn’t mind the lad being brought up to that. But them
305: fine-talking men from the big towns mostly wear the false shirt-fronts;
306: they wear a frill till it’s all a mess, and then hide it with a bib; I
307: know Riley does. And then, if Tom’s to go and live at Mudport, like
308: Riley, he’ll have a house with a kitchen hardly big enough to turn in,
309: an’ niver get a fresh egg for his breakfast, an’ sleep up three pair o’
310: stairs,—or four, for what I know,—and be burnt to death before he can
311: get down.”
312: 
313: “No, no,” said Mr Tulliver, “I’ve no thoughts of his going to Mudport:
314: I mean him to set up his office at St Ogg’s, close by us, an’ live at
315: home. But,” continued Mr Tulliver after a pause, “what I’m a bit afraid
316: on is, as Tom hasn’t got the right sort o’ brains for a smart fellow. I
317: doubt he’s a bit slowish. He takes after your family, Bessy.”
318: 
319: “Yes, that he does,” said Mrs Tulliver, accepting the last proposition
320: entirely on its own merits; “he’s wonderful for liking a deal o’ salt
321: in his broth. That was my brother’s way, and my father’s before him.”
322: 
323: “It seems a bit a pity, though,” said Mr Tulliver, “as the lad should
324: take after the mother’s side instead o’ the little wench. That’s the
325: worst on’t wi’ crossing o’ breeds: you can never justly calkilate
326: what’ll come on’t. The little un takes after my side, now: she’s twice
327: as ’cute as Tom. Too ’cute for a woman, I’m afraid,” continued Mr
328: Tulliver, turning his head dubiously first on one side and then on the
329: other. “It’s no mischief much while she’s a little un; but an
330: over-’cute woman’s no better nor a long-tailed sheep,—she’ll fetch none
331: the bigger price for that.”
332: 
333: “Yes, it _is_ a mischief while she’s a little un, Mr Tulliver, for it
334: runs to naughtiness. How to keep her in a clean pinafore two hours
335: together passes my cunning. An’ now you put me i’ mind,” continued Mrs
336: Tulliver, rising and going to the window, “I don’t know where she is
337: now, an’ it’s pretty nigh tea-time. Ah, I thought so,—wanderin’ up an’
338: down by the water, like a wild thing: She’ll tumble in some day.”
339: 
340: Mrs Tulliver rapped the window sharply, beckoned, and shook her head,—a
341: process which she repeated more than once before she returned to her
342: chair.
343: 
344: “You talk o’ ’cuteness, Mr Tulliver,” she observed as she sat down,
345: “but I’m sure the child’s half an idiot i’ some things; for if I send
346: her upstairs to fetch anything, she forgets what she’s gone for, an’
347: perhaps ’ull sit down on the floor i’ the sunshine an’ plait her hair
348: an’ sing to herself like a Bedlam creatur’, all the while I’m waiting
349: for her downstairs. That niver run i’ my family, thank God! no more nor
350: a brown skin as makes her look like a mulatter. I don’t like to fly i’
351: the face o’ Providence, but it seems hard as I should have but one
352: gell, an’ her so comical.”
353: 
354: “Pooh, nonsense!” said Mr Tulliver; “she’s a straight, black-eyed wench
355: as anybody need wish to see. I don’t know i’ what she’s behind other
356: folks’s children; and she can read almost as well as the parson.”
357: 
358: “But her hair won’t curl all I can do with it, and she’s so franzy
359: about having it put i’ paper, and I’ve such work as never was to make
360: her stand and have it pinched with th’ irons.”
361: 
362: “Cut it off—cut it off short,” said the father, rashly.
363: 
364: “How can you talk so, Mr Tulliver? She’s too big a gell—gone nine, and
365: tall of her age—to have her hair cut short; an’ there’s her cousin
366: Lucy’s got a row o’ curls round her head, an’ not a hair out o’ place.
367: It seems hard as my sister Deane should have that pretty child; I’m
368: sure Lucy takes more after me nor my own child does. Maggie, Maggie,”
369: continued the mother, in a tone of half-coaxing fretfulness, as this
370: small mistake of nature entered the room, “where’s the use o’ my
371: telling you to keep away from the water? You’ll tumble in and be
372: drownded some day, an’ then you’ll be sorry you didn’t do as mother
373: told you.”
374: 
375: Maggie’s hair, as she threw off her bonnet, painfully confirmed her
376: mother’s accusation. Mrs Tulliver, desiring her daughter to have a
377: curled crop, “like other folks’s children,” had had it cut too short in
378: front to be pushed behind the ears; and as it was usually straight an
379: hour after it had been taken out of paper, Maggie was incessantly
380: tossing her head to keep the dark, heavy locks out of her gleaming
381: black eyes,—an action which gave her very much the air of a small
382: Shetland pony.
383: 
384: “Oh, dear, oh, dear, Maggie, what are you thinkin’ of, to throw your
385: bonnet down there? Take it upstairs, there’s a good gell, an’ let your
386: hair be brushed, an’ put your other pinafore on, an’ change your shoes,
387: do, for shame; an’ come an’ go on with your patchwork, like a little
388: lady.”
389: 
390: “Oh, mother,” said Maggie, in a vehemently cross tone, “I don’t _want_
391: to do my patchwork.”
392: 
393: “What! not your pretty patchwork, to make a counterpane for your aunt
394: Glegg?”
395: 
396: “It’s foolish work,” said Maggie, with a toss of her mane,—“tearing
397: things to pieces to sew ’em together again. And I don’t want to do
398: anything for my aunt Glegg. I don’t like her.”
399: 
400: Exit Maggie, dragging her bonnet by the string, while Mr Tulliver
401: laughs audibly.
402: 
403: “I wonder at you, as you’ll laugh at her, Mr Tulliver,” said the
404: mother, with feeble fretfulness in her tone. “You encourage her i’
405: naughtiness. An’ her aunts will have it as it’s me spoils her.”
406: 
407: Mrs Tulliver was what is called a good-tempered person,—never cried,
408: when she was a baby, on any slighter ground than hunger and pins; and
409: from the cradle upward had been healthy, fair, plump, and dull-witted;
410: in short, the flower of her family for beauty and amiability. But milk
411: and mildness are not the best things for keeping, and when they turn
412: only a little sour, they may disagree with young stomachs seriously. I
413: have often wondered whether those early Madonnas of Raphael, with the
414: blond faces and somewhat stupid expression, kept their placidity
415: undisturbed when their strong-limbed, strong-willed boys got a little
416: too old to do without clothing. I think they must have been given to
417: feeble remonstrance, getting more and more peevish as it became more
418: and more ineffectual.

425: The gentleman in the ample white cravat and shirt-frill, taking his
426: brandy-and-water so pleasantly with his good friend Tulliver, is Mr
427: Riley, a gentleman with a waxen complexion and fat hands, rather highly
428: educated for an auctioneer and appraiser, but large-hearted enough to
429: show a great deal of _bonhomie_ toward simple country acquaintances of
430: hospitable habits. Mr Riley spoke of such acquaintances kindly as
431: “people of the old school.”
432: 
433: The conversation had come to a pause. Mr Tulliver, not without a
434: particular reason, had abstained from a seventh recital of the cool
435: retort by which Riley had shown himself too many for Dix, and how Wakem
436: had had his comb cut for once in his life, now the business of the dam
437: had been settled by arbitration, and how there never would have been
438: any dispute at all about the height of water if everybody was what they
439: should be, and Old Harry hadn’t made the lawyers. Mr Tulliver was, on
440: the whole, a man of safe traditional opinions; but on one or two points
441: he had trusted to his unassisted intellect, and had arrived at several
442: questionable conclusions; amongst the rest, that rats, weevils, and
443: lawyers were created by Old Harry. Unhappily he had no one to tell him
444: that this was rampant Manichæism, else he might have seen his error.
445: But to-day it was clear that the good principle was triumphant: this
446: affair of the water-power had been a tangled business somehow, for all
447: it seemed—look at it one way—as plain as water’s water; but, big a
448: puzzle as it was, it hadn’t got the better of Riley. Mr Tulliver took
449: his brandy-and-water a little stronger than usual, and, for a man who
450: might be supposed to have a few hundreds lying idle at his banker’s,
451: was rather incautiously open in expressing his high estimate of his
452: friend’s business talents.
453: 
454: But the dam was a subject of conversation that would keep; it could
455: always be taken up again at the same point, and exactly in the same
456: condition; and there was another subject, as you know, on which Mr
457: Tulliver was in pressing want of Mr Riley’s advice. This was his
458: particular reason for remaining silent for a short space after his last
459: draught, and rubbing his knees in a meditative manner. He was not a man
460: to make an abrupt transition. This was a puzzling world, as he often
461: said, and if you drive your wagon in a hurry, you may light on an
462: awkward corner. Mr Riley, meanwhile, was not impatient. Why should he
463: be? Even Hotspur, one would think, must have been patient in his
464: slippers on a warm hearth, taking copious snuff, and sipping gratuitous
465: brandy-and-water.
466: 
467: “There’s a thing I’ve got i’ my head,” said Mr Tulliver at last, in
468: rather a lower tone than usual, as he turned his head and looked
469: steadfastly at his companion.
470: 
471: “Ah!” said Mr Riley, in a tone of mild interest. He was a man with
472: heavy waxen eyelids and high-arched eyebrows, looking exactly the same
473: under all circumstances. This immovability of face, and the habit of
474: taking a pinch of snuff before he gave an answer, made him trebly
475: oracular to Mr Tulliver.
476: 
477: “It’s a very particular thing,” he went on; “it’s about my boy Tom.”
478: 
479: At the sound of this name, Maggie, who was seated on a low stool close
480: by the fire, with a large book open on her lap, shook her heavy hair
481: back and looked up eagerly. There were few sounds that roused Maggie
482: when she was dreaming over her book, but Tom’s name served as well as
483: the shrillest whistle; in an instant she was on the watch, with
484: gleaming eyes, like a Skye terrier suspecting mischief, or at all
485: events determined to fly at any one who threatened it toward Tom.
486: 
487: “You see, I want to put him to a new school at Midsummer,” said Mr
488: Tulliver; “he’s comin’ away from the ’cademy at Lady-day, an’ I shall
489: let him run loose for a quarter; but after that I want to send him to a
490: downright good school, where they’ll make a scholard of him.”
491: 
492: “Well,” said Mr Riley, “there’s no greater advantage you can give him
493: than a good education. Not,” he added, with polite significance,—“not
494: that a man can’t be an excellent miller and farmer, and a shrewd,
495: sensible fellow into the bargain, without much help from the
496: schoolmaster.”
497: 
498: “I believe you,” said Mr Tulliver, winking, and turning his head on one
499: side; “but that’s where it is. I don’t _mean_ Tom to be a miller and
500: farmer. I see no fun i’ that. Why, if I made him a miller an’ farmer,
501: he’d be expectin’ to take to the mill an’ the land, an’ a-hinting at me
502: as it was time for me to lay by an’ think o’ my latter end. Nay, nay,
503: I’ve seen enough o’ that wi’ sons. I’ll never pull my coat off before I
504: go to bed. I shall give Tom an eddication an’ put him to a business, as
505: he may make a nest for himself, an’ not want to push me out o’ mine.
506: Pretty well if he gets it when I’m dead an’ gone. I sha’n’t be put off
507: wi’ spoon-meat afore I’ve lost my teeth.”
508: 
509: This was evidently a point on which Mr Tulliver felt strongly; and the
510: impetus which had given unusual rapidity and emphasis to his speech
511: showed itself still unexhausted for some minutes afterward in a defiant
512: motion of the head from side to side, and an occasional “Nay, nay,”
513: like a subsiding growl.
514: 
515: These angry symptoms were keenly observed by Maggie, and cut her to the
516: quick. Tom, it appeared, was supposed capable of turning his father out
517: of doors, and of making the future in some way tragic by his
518: wickedness. This was not to be borne; and Maggie jumped up from her
519: stool, forgetting all about her heavy book, which fell with a bang
520: within the fender, and going up between her father’s knees, said, in a
521: half-crying, half-indignant voice,—
522: 
523: “Father, Tom wouldn’t be naughty to you ever; I know he wouldn’t.”
524: 
525: Mrs Tulliver was out of the room superintending a choice supper-dish,
526: and Mr Tulliver’s heart was touched; so Maggie was not scolded about
527: the book. Mr Riley quietly picked it up and looked at it, while the
528: father laughed, with a certain tenderness in his hard-lined face, and
529: patted his little girl on the back, and then held her hands and kept
530: her between his knees.
531: 
532: “What! they mustn’t say any harm o’ Tom, eh?” said Mr Tulliver, looking
533: at Maggie with a twinkling eye. Then, in a lower voice, turning to Mr
534: Riley, as though Maggie couldn’t hear, “She understands what one’s
535: talking about so as never was. And you should hear her read,—straight
536: off, as if she knowed it all beforehand. And allays at her book! But
537: it’s bad—it’s bad,” Mr Tulliver added sadly, checking this blamable
538: exultation. “A woman’s no business wi’ being so clever; it’ll turn to
539: trouble, I doubt. But bless you!”—here the exultation was clearly
540: recovering the mastery,—“she’ll read the books and understand ’em
541: better nor half the folks as are growed up.”
542: 
543: Maggie’s cheeks began to flush with triumphant excitement. She thought
544: Mr Riley would have a respect for her now; it had been evident that he
545: thought nothing of her before.
546: 
547: Mr Riley was turning over the leaves of the book, and she could make
548: nothing of his face, with its high-arched eyebrows; but he presently
549: looked at her, and said,—
550: 
551: “Come, come and tell me something about this book; here are some
552: pictures,—I want to know what they mean.”
553: 
554: Maggie, with deepening colour, went without hesitation to Mr Riley’s
555: elbow and looked over the book, eagerly seizing one corner, and tossing
556: back her mane, while she said,—
557: 
558: “Oh, I’ll tell you what that means. It’s a dreadful picture, isn’t it?
559: But I can’t help looking at it. That old woman in the water’s a
560: witch,—they’ve put her in to find out whether she’s a witch or no; and
561: if she swims she’s a witch, and if she’s drowned—and killed, you
562: know—she’s innocent, and not a witch, but only a poor silly old woman.
563: But what good would it do her then, you know, when she was drowned?
564: Only, I suppose, she’d go to heaven, and God would make it up to her.
565: And this dreadful blacksmith with his arms akimbo, laughing,—oh, isn’t
566: he ugly?—I’ll tell you what he is. He’s the Devil _really_” (here
567: Maggie’s voice became louder and more emphatic), “and not a right
568: blacksmith; for the Devil takes the shape of wicked men, and walks
569: about and sets people doing wicked things, and he’s oftener in the
570: shape of a bad man than any other, because, you know, if people saw he
571: was the Devil, and he roared at ’em, they’d run away, and he couldn’t
572: make ’em do what he pleased.”
573: 
574: Mr Tulliver had listened to this exposition of Maggie’s with petrifying
575: wonder.
576: 
577: “Why, what book is it the wench has got hold on?” he burst out at last.
578: 
579: “‘The History of the Devil,’ by Daniel Defoe,—not quite the right book
580: for a little girl,” said Mr Riley. “How came it among your books, Mr
581: Tulliver?”
582: 
583: Maggie looked hurt and discouraged, while her father said,—
584: 
585: “Why, it’s one o’ the books I bought at Partridge’s sale. They was all
586: bound alike,—it’s a good binding, you see,—and I thought they’d be all
587: good books. There’s Jeremy Taylor’s ‘Holy Living and Dying’ among ’em.
588: I read in it often of a Sunday” (Mr Tulliver felt somehow a familiarity
589: with that great writer, because his name was Jeremy); “and there’s a
590: lot more of ’em,—sermons mostly, I think,—but they’ve all got the same
591: covers, and I thought they were all o’ one sample, as you may say. But
592: it seems one mustn’t judge by th’ outside. This is a puzzlin’ world.”
593: 
594: “Well,” said Mr Riley, in an admonitory, patronizing tone as he patted
595: Maggie on the head, “I advise you to put by the ‘History of the Devil,’
596: and read some prettier book. Have you no prettier books?”
597: 
598: “Oh, yes,” said Maggie, reviving a little in the desire to vindicate
599: the variety of her reading. “I know the reading in this book isn’t
600: pretty; but I like the pictures, and I make stories to the pictures out
601: of my own head, you know. But I’ve got ‘Æsop’s Fables,’ and a book
602: about Kangaroos and things, and the ‘Pilgrim’s Progress....’”
603: 
604: “Ah, a beautiful book,” said Mr Riley; “you can’t read a better.”
605: 
606: “Well, but there’s a great deal about the Devil in that,” said Maggie,
607: triumphantly, “and I’ll show you the picture of him in his true shape,
608: as he fought with Christian.”
609: 
610: Maggie ran in an instant to the corner of the room, jumped on a chair,
611: and reached down from the small bookcase a shabby old copy of Bunyan,
612: which opened at once, without the least trouble of search, at the
613: picture she wanted.
614: 
615: “Here he is,” she said, running back to Mr Riley, “and Tom coloured him
616: for me with his paints when he was at home last holidays,—the body all
617: black, you know, and the eyes red, like fire, because he’s all fire
618: inside, and it shines out at his eyes.”
619: 
620: “Go, go!” said Mr Tulliver, peremptorily, beginning to feel rather
621: uncomfortable at these free remarks on the personal appearance of a
622: being powerful enough to create lawyers; “shut up the book, and let’s
623: hear no more o’ such talk. It is as I thought—the child ’ull learn more
624: mischief nor good wi’ the books. Go, go and see after your mother.”
625: 
626: Maggie shut up the book at once, with a sense of disgrace, but not
627: being inclined to see after her mother, she compromised the matter by
628: going into a dark corner behind her father’s chair, and nursing her
629: doll, toward which she had an occasional fit of fondness in Tom’s
630: absence, neglecting its toilet, but lavishing so many warm kisses on it
631: that the waxen cheeks had a wasted, unhealthy appearance.
632: 
633: “Did you ever hear the like on’t?” said Mr Tulliver, as Maggie retired.
634: “It’s a pity but what she’d been the lad,—she’d ha’ been a match for
635: the lawyers, _she_ would. It’s the wonderful’st thing”—here he lowered
636: his voice—“as I picked the mother because she wasn’t o’er ’cute—bein’ a
637: good-looking woman too, an’ come of a rare family for managing; but I
638: picked her from her sisters o’ purpose, ’cause she was a bit weak like;
639: for I wasn’t agoin’ to be told the rights o’ things by my own fireside.
640: But you see when a man’s got brains himself, there’s no knowing where
641: they’ll run to; an’ a pleasant sort o’ soft woman may go on breeding
642: you stupid lads and ’cute wenches, till it’s like as if the world was
643: turned topsy-turvy. It’s an uncommon puzzlin’ thing.”
644: 
645: Mr Riley’s gravity gave way, and he shook a little under the
646: application of his pinch of snuff before he said,—
647: 
648: “But your lad’s not stupid, is he? I saw him, when I was here last,
649: busy making fishing-tackle; he seemed quite up to it.”
650: 
651: “Well, he isn’t not to say stupid,—he’s got a notion o’ things out o’
652: door, an’ a sort o’ common sense, as he’d lay hold o’ things by the
653: right handle. But he’s slow with his tongue, you see, and he reads but
654: poorly, and can’t abide the books, and spells all wrong, they tell me,
655: an’ as shy as can be wi’ strangers, an’ you never hear him say ’cute
656: things like the little wench. Now, what I want is to send him to a
657: school where they’ll make him a bit nimble with his tongue and his pen,
658: and make a smart chap of him. I want my son to be even wi’ these
659: fellows as have got the start o’ me with having better schooling. Not
660: but what, if the world had been left as God made it, I could ha’ seen
661: my way, and held my own wi’ the best of ’em; but things have got so
662: twisted round and wrapped up i’ unreasonable words, as aren’t a bit
663: like ’em, as I’m clean at fault, often an’ often. Everything winds
664: about so—the more straightforrad you are, the more you’re puzzled.”
665: 
666: Mr Tulliver took a draught, swallowed it slowly, and shook his head in
667: a melancholy manner, conscious of exemplifying the truth that a
668: perfectly sane intellect is hardly at home in this insane world.
669: 
670: “You’re quite in the right of it, Tulliver,” observed Mr Riley. “Better
671: spend an extra hundred or two on your son’s education, than leave it
672: him in your will. I know I should have tried to do so by a son of mine,
673: if I’d had one, though, God knows, I haven’t your ready money to play
674: with, Tulliver; and I have a houseful of daughters into the bargain.”
675: 
676: “I dare say, now, you know of a school as ’ud be just the thing for
677: Tom,” said Mr Tulliver, not diverted from his purpose by any sympathy
678: with Mr Riley’s deficiency of ready cash.
679: 
680: Mr Riley took a pinch of snuff, and kept Mr Tulliver in suspense by a
681: silence that seemed deliberative, before he said,—
682: 
683: “I know of a very fine chance for any one that’s got the necessary
684: money and that’s what you have, Tulliver. The fact is, I wouldn’t
685: recommend any friend of mine to send a boy to a regular school, if he
686: could afford to do better. But if any one wanted his boy to get
687: superior instruction and training, where he would be the companion of
688: his master, and that master a first rate fellow, I know his man. I
689: wouldn’t mention the chance to everybody, because I don’t think
690: everybody would succeed in getting it, if he were to try; but I mention
691: it to you, Tulliver, between ourselves.”
692: 
693: The fixed inquiring glance with which Mr Tulliver had been watching his
694: friend’s oracular face became quite eager.
695: 
696: “Ay, now, let’s hear,” he said, adjusting himself in his chair with the
697: complacency of a person who is thought worthy of important
698: communications.
699: 
700: “He’s an Oxford man,” said Mr Riley, sententiously, shutting his mouth
701: close, and looking at Mr Tulliver to observe the effect of this
702: stimulating information.
703: 
704: “What! a parson?” said Mr Tulliver, rather doubtfully.
705: 
706: “Yes, and an M.A. The bishop, I understand, thinks very highly of him:
707: why, it was the bishop who got him his present curacy.”
708: 
709: “Ah?” said Mr Tulliver, to whom one thing was as wonderful as another
710: concerning these unfamiliar phenomena. “But what can he want wi’ Tom,
711: then?”
712: 
713: “Why, the fact is, he’s fond of teaching, and wishes to keep up his
714: studies, and a clergyman has but little opportunity for that in his
715: parochial duties. He’s willing to take one or two boys as pupils to
716: fill up his time profitably. The boys would be quite of the family,—the
717: finest thing in the world for them; under Stelling’s eye continually.”
718: 
719: “But do you think they’d give the poor lad twice o’ pudding?” said Mrs
720: Tulliver, who was now in her place again. “He’s such a boy for pudding
721: as never was; an’ a growing boy like that,—it’s dreadful to think o’
722: their stintin’ him.”
723: 
724: “And what money ’ud he want?” said Mr Tulliver, whose instinct told him
725: that the services of this admirable M.A. would bear a high price.
726: 
727: “Why, I know of a clergyman who asks a hundred and fifty with his
728: youngest pupils, and he’s not to be mentioned with Stelling, the man I
729: speak of. I know, on good authority, that one of the chief people at
730: Oxford said, Stelling might get the highest honours if he chose. But he
731: didn’t care about university honours; he’s a quiet man—not noisy.”
732: 
733: “Ah, a deal better—a deal better,” said Mr Tulliver; “but a hundred and
734: fifty’s an uncommon price. I never thought o’ paying so much as that.”
735: 
736: “A good education, let me tell you, Tulliver,—a good education is cheap
737: at the money. But Stelling is moderate in his terms; he’s not a
738: grasping man. I’ve no doubt he’d take your boy at a hundred, and that’s
739: what you wouldn’t get many other clergymen to do. I’ll write to him
740: about it, if you like.”
741: 
742: Mr Tulliver rubbed his knees, and looked at the carpet in a meditative
743: manner.
744: 
745: “But belike he’s a bachelor,” observed Mrs Tulliver, in the interval;
746: “an’ I’ve no opinion o’ housekeepers. There was my brother, as is dead
747: an’ gone, had a housekeeper once, an’ she took half the feathers out o’
748: the best bed, an’ packed ’em up an’ sent ’em away. An’ it’s unknown the
749: linen she made away with—Stott her name was. It ’ud break my heart to
750: send Tom where there’s a housekeeper, an’ I hope you won’t think of it,
751: Mr Tulliver.”
752: 
753: “You may set your mind at rest on that score, Mrs Tulliver,” said Mr
754: Riley, “for Stelling is married to as nice a little woman as any man
755: need wish for a wife. There isn’t a kinder little soul in the world; I
756: know her family well. She has very much your complexion,—light curly
757: hair. She comes of a good Mudport family, and it’s not every offer that
758: would have been acceptable in that quarter. But Stelling’s not an
759: everyday man; rather a particular fellow as to the people he chooses to
760: be connected with. But I _think_ he would have no objection to take
761: your son; I _think_ he would not, on my representation.”
762: 
763: “I don’t know what he could have _against_ the lad,” said Mrs Tulliver,
764: with a slight touch of motherly indignation; “a nice fresh-skinned lad
765: as anybody need wish to see.”
766: 
767: “But there’s one thing I’m thinking on,” said Mr Tulliver, turning his
768: head on one side and looking at Mr Riley, after a long perusal of the
769: carpet. “Wouldn’t a parson be almost too high-learnt to bring up a lad
770: to be a man o’ business? My notion o’ the parsons was as they’d got a
771: sort o’ learning as lay mostly out o’ sight. And that isn’t what I want
772: for Tom. I want him to know figures, and write like print, and see into
773: things quick, and know what folks mean, and how to wrap things up in
774: words as aren’t actionable. It’s an uncommon fine thing, that is,”
775: concluded Mr Tulliver, shaking his head, “when you can let a man know
776: what you think of him without paying for it.”
777: 
778: “Oh, my dear Tulliver,” said Mr Riley, “you’re quite under a mistake
779: about the clergy; all the best schoolmasters are of the clergy. The
780: schoolmasters who are not clergymen are a very low set of men
781: generally.”
782: 
783: “Ay, that Jacobs is, at the ’cademy,” interposed Mr Tulliver.
784: 
785: “To be sure,—men who have failed in other trades, most likely. Now, a
786: clergyman is a gentleman by profession and education; and besides that,
787: he has the knowledge that will ground a boy, and prepare him for
788: entering on any career with credit. There may be some clergymen who are
789: mere bookmen; but you may depend upon it, Stelling is not one of
790: them,—a man that’s wide awake, let me tell you. Drop him a hint, and
791: that’s enough. You talk of figures, now; you have only to say to
792: Stelling, ‘I want my son to be a thorough arithmetician,’ and you may
793: leave the rest to him.”
794: 
795: Mr Riley paused a moment, while Mr Tulliver, somewhat reassured as to
796: clerical tutorship, was inwardly rehearsing to an imaginary Mr Stelling
797: the statement, “I want my son to know ’rethmetic.”
798: 
799: “You see, my dear Tulliver,” Mr Riley continued, “when you get a
800: thoroughly educated man, like Stelling, he’s at no loss to take up any
801: branch of instruction. When a workman knows the use of his tools, he
802: can make a door as well as a window.”
803: 
804: “Ay, that’s true,” said Mr Tulliver, almost convinced now that the
805: clergy must be the best of schoolmasters.
806: 
807: “Well, I’ll tell you what I’ll do for you,” said Mr Riley, “and I
808: wouldn’t do it for everybody. I’ll see Stelling’s father-in-law, or
809: drop him a line when I get back to Mudport, to say that you wish to
810: place your boy with his son-in-law, and I dare say Stelling will write
811: to you, and send you his terms.”
812: 
813: “But there’s no hurry, is there?” said Mrs Tulliver; “for I hope, Mr
814: Tulliver, you won’t let Tom begin at his new school before Midsummer.
815: He began at the ’cademy at the Lady-day quarter, and you see what
816: good’s come of it.”
817: 
818: “Ay, ay, Bessy, never brew wi’ bad malt upo’ Michaelmas day, else
819: you’ll have a poor tap,” said Mr Tulliver, winking and smiling at Mr
820: Riley, with the natural pride of a man who has a buxom wife
821: conspicuously his inferior in intellect. “But it’s true there’s no
822: hurry; you’ve hit it there, Bessy.”
823: 
824: “It might be as well not to defer the arrangement too long,” said Mr
825: Riley, quietly, “for Stelling may have propositions from other parties,
826: and I know he would not take more than two or three boarders, if so
827: many. If I were you, I think I would enter on the subject with Stelling
828: at once: there’s no necessity for sending the boy before Midsummer, but
829: I would be on the safe side, and make sure that nobody forestalls you.”
830: 
831: “Ay, there’s summat in that,” said Mr Tulliver.
832: 
833: “Father,” broke in Maggie, who had stolen unperceived to her father’s
834: elbow again, listening with parted lips, while she held her doll
835: topsy-turvy, and crushed its nose against the wood of the
836: chair,—“father, is it a long way off where Tom is to go? Sha’n’t we
837: ever go to see him?”
838: 
839: “I don’t know, my wench,” said the father, tenderly. “Ask Mr Riley; he
840: knows.”
841: 
842: Maggie came round promptly in front of Mr Riley, and said, “How far is
843: it, please, sir?”
844: 
845: “Oh, a long, long way off,” that gentleman answered, being of opinion
846: that children, when they are not naughty, should always be spoken to
847: jocosely. “You must borrow the seven-leagued boots to get to him.”
848: 
849: “That’s nonsense!” said Maggie, tossing her head haughtily, and turning
850: away, with the tears springing in her eyes. She began to dislike Mr
851: Riley; it was evident he thought her silly and of no consequence.
852: 
853: “Hush, Maggie! for shame of you, asking questions and chattering,” said
854: her mother. “Come and sit down on your little stool, and hold your
855: tongue, do. But,” added Mrs Tulliver, who had her own alarm awakened,
856: “is it so far off as I couldn’t wash him and mend him?”
857: 
858: “About fifteen miles; that’s all,” said Mr Riley. “You can drive there
859: and back in a day quite comfortably. Or—Stelling is a hospitable,
860: pleasant man—he’d be glad to have you stay.”
861: 
862: “But it’s too far off for the linen, I doubt,” said Mrs Tulliver,
863: sadly.
864: 
865: The entrance of supper opportunely adjourned this difficulty, and
866: relieved Mr Riley from the labour of suggesting some solution or
867: compromise,—a labour which he would otherwise doubtless have
868: undertaken; for, as you perceive, he was a man of very obliging
869: manners. And he had really given himself the trouble of recommending Mr
870: Stelling to his friend Tulliver without any positive expectation of a
871: solid, definite advantage resulting to himself, notwithstanding the
872: subtle indications to the contrary which might have misled a too
873: sagacious observer. For there is nothing more widely misleading than
874: sagacity if it happens to get on a wrong scent; and sagacity, persuaded
875: that men usually act and speak from distinct motives, with a
876: consciously proposed end in view, is certain to waste its energies on
877: imaginary game.
878: 
879: Plotting covetousness and deliberate contrivance, in order to compass a
880: selfish end, are nowhere abundant but in the world of the dramatist:
881: they demand too intense a mental action for many of our
882: fellow-parishioners to be guilty of them. It is easy enough to spoil
883: the lives of our neighbours without taking so much trouble; we can do
884: it by lazy acquiescence and lazy omission, by trivial falsities for
885: which we hardly know a reason, by small frauds neutralised by small
886: extravagances, by maladroit flatteries, and clumsily improvised
887: insinuations. We live from hand to mouth, most of us, with a small
888: family of immediate desires; we do little else than snatch a morsel to
889: satisfy the hungry brood, rarely thinking of seed-corn or the next
890: year’s crop.
891: 
892: Mr Riley was a man of business, and not cold toward his own interest,
893: yet even he was more under the influence of small promptings than of
894: far-sighted designs. He had no private understanding with the Rev.
895: Walter Stelling; on the contrary, he knew very little of that M.A. and
896: his acquirements,—not quite enough, perhaps, to warrant so strong a
897: recommendation of him as he had given to his friend Tulliver. But he
898: believed Mr Stelling to be an excellent classic, for Gadsby had said
899: so, and Gadsby’s first cousin was an Oxford tutor; which was better
900: ground for the belief even than his own immediate observation would
901: have been, for though Mr Riley had received a tincture of the classics
902: at the great Mudport Free School, and had a sense of understanding
903: Latin generally, his comprehension of any particular Latin was not
904: ready. Doubtless there remained a subtle aroma from his juvenile
905: contact with the _De Senectute_ and the fourth book of the _Æneid_, but
906: it had ceased to be distinctly recognisable as classical, and was only
907: perceived in the higher finish and force of his auctioneering style.
908: Then, Stelling was an Oxford man, and the Oxford men were always—no,
909: no, it was the Cambridge men who were always good mathematicians. But a
910: man who had had a university education could teach anything he liked;
911: especially a man like Stelling, who had made a speech at a Mudport
912: dinner on a political occasion, and had acquitted himself so well that
913: it was generally remarked, this son-in-law of Timpson’s was a sharp
914: fellow. It was to be expected of a Mudport man, from the parish of St
915: Ursula, that he would not omit to do a good turn to a son-in-law of
916: Timpson’s, for Timpson was one of the most useful and influential men
917: in the parish, and had a good deal of business, which he knew how to
918: put into the right hands. Mr Riley liked such men, quite apart from any
919: money which might be diverted, through their good judgment, from less
920: worthy pockets into his own; and it would be a satisfaction to him to
921: say to Timpson on his return home, “I’ve secured a good pupil for your
922: son-in-law.” Timpson had a large family of daughters; Mr Riley felt for
923: him; besides, Louisa Timpson’s face, with its light curls, had been a
924: familiar object to him over the pew wainscot on a Sunday for nearly
925: fifteen years; it was natural her husband should be a commendable
926: tutor. Moreover, Mr Riley knew of no other schoolmaster whom he had any
927: ground for recommending in preference; why, then, should he not
928: recommend Stelling? His friend Tulliver had asked him for an opinion;
929: it is always chilling, in friendly intercourse, to say you have no
930: opinion to give. And if you deliver an opinion at all, it is mere
931: stupidity not to do it with an air of conviction and well-founded
932: knowledge. You make it your own in uttering it, and naturally get fond
933: of it. Thus Mr Riley, knowing no harm of Stelling to begin with, and
934: wishing him well, so far as he had any wishes at all concerning him,
935: had no sooner recommended him than he began to think with admiration of
936: a man recommended on such high authority, and would soon have gathered
937: so warm an interest on the subject, that if Mr Tulliver had in the end
938: declined to send Tom to Stelling, Mr Riley would have thought his
939: “friend of the old school” a thoroughly pig-headed fellow.
940: 
941: If you blame Mr Riley very severely for giving a recommendation on such
942: slight grounds, I must say you are rather hard upon him. Why should an
943: auctioneer and appraiser thirty years ago, who had as good as forgotten
944: his free-school Latin, be expected to manifest a delicate scrupulosity
945: which is not always exhibited by gentlemen of the learned professions,
946: even in our present advanced stage of morality?
947: 
948: Besides, a man with the milk of human kindness in him can scarcely
949: abstain from doing a good-natured action, and one cannot be
950: good-natured all round. Nature herself occasionally quarters an
951: inconvenient parasite on an animal toward whom she has otherwise no ill
952: will. What then? We admire her care for the parasite. If Mr Riley had
953: shrunk from giving a recommendation that was not based on valid
954: evidence, he would not have helped Mr Stelling to a paying pupil, and
955: that would not have been so well for the reverend gentleman. Consider,
956: too, that all the pleasant little dim ideas and complacencies—of
957: standing well with Timpson, of dispensing advice when he was asked for
958: it, of impressing his friend Tulliver with additional respect, of
959: saying something, and saying it emphatically, with other inappreciably
960: minute ingredients that went along with the warm hearth and the
961: brandy-and-water to make up Mr Riley’s consciousness on this
962: occasion—would have been a mere blank.
963: 
964: 
965: Chapter IV.
966: 
967: Tom Is Expected
968: 
969: It was a heavy disappointment to Maggie that she was not allowed to go
970: with her father in the gig when he went to fetch Tom home from the
971: academy; but the morning was too wet, Mrs Tulliver said, for a little
972: girl to go out in her best bonnet. Maggie took the opposite view very
973: strongly, and it was a direct consequence of this difference of opinion
974: that when her mother was in the act of brushing out the reluctant black
975: crop Maggie suddenly rushed from under her hands and dipped her head in
976: a basin of water standing near, in the vindictive determination that
977: there should be no more chance of curls that day.
978: 
979: “Maggie, Maggie!” exclaimed Mrs Tulliver, sitting stout and helpless
980: with the brushes on her lap, “what is to become of you if you’re so
981: naughty? I’ll tell your aunt Glegg and your aunt Pullet when they come
982: next week, and they’ll never love you any more. Oh dear, oh dear! look
983: at your clean pinafore, wet from top to bottom. Folks ’ull think it’s a
984: judgment on me as I’ve got such a child,—they’ll think I’ve done summat
985: wicked.”
986: 
987: Before this remonstrance was finished, Maggie was already out of
988: hearing, making her way toward the great attic that ran under the old
989: high-pitched roof, shaking the water from her black locks as she ran,
990: like a Skye terrier escaped from his bath. This attic was Maggie’s
991: favourite retreat on a wet day, when the weather was not too cold; here
992: she fretted out all her ill humours, and talked aloud to the worm-eaten
993: floors and the worm-eaten shelves, and the dark rafters festooned with
994: cobwebs; and here she kept a Fetish which she punished for all her
995: misfortunes. This was the trunk of a large wooden doll, which once
996: stared with the roundest of eyes above the reddest of cheeks; but was
997: now entirely defaced by a long career of vicarious suffering. Three
998: nails driven into the head commemorated as many crises in Maggie’s nine
999: years of earthly struggle; that luxury of vengeance having been
1000: suggested to her by the picture of Jael destroying Sisera in the old
1001: Bible. The last nail had been driven in with a fiercer stroke than
1002: usual, for the Fetish on that occasion represented aunt Glegg. But
1003: immediately afterward Maggie had reflected that if she drove many nails
1004: in she would not be so well able to fancy that the head was hurt when
1005: she knocked it against the wall, nor to comfort it, and make believe to
1006: poultice it, when her fury was abated; for even aunt Glegg would be
1007: pitiable when she had been hurt very much, and thoroughly humiliated,
1008: so as to beg her niece’s pardon. Since then she had driven no more
1009: nails in, but had soothed herself by alternately grinding and beating
1010: the wooden head against the rough brick of the great chimneys that made
1011: two square pillars supporting the roof. That was what she did this
1012: morning on reaching the attic, sobbing all the while with a passion
1013: that expelled every other form of consciousness,—even the memory of the
1014: grievance that had caused it. As at last the sobs were getting quieter,
1015: and the grinding less fierce, a sudden beam of sunshine, falling
1016: through the wire lattice across the worm-eaten shelves, made her throw
1017: away the Fetish and run to the window. The sun was really breaking out;
1018: the sound of the mill seemed cheerful again; the granary doors were
1019: open; and there was Yap, the queer white-and-brown terrier, with one
1020: ear turned back, trotting about and sniffing vaguely, as if he were in
1021: search of a companion. It was irresistible. Maggie tossed her hair back
1022: and ran downstairs, seized her bonnet without putting it on, peeped,
1023: and then dashed along the passage lest she should encounter her mother,
1024: and was quickly out in the yard, whirling round like a Pythoness, and
1025: singing as she whirled, “Yap, Yap, Tom’s coming home!” while Yap danced
1026: and barked round her, as much as to say, if there was any noise wanted
1027: he was the dog for it.
1028: 
1029: “Hegh, hegh, Miss! you’ll make yourself giddy, an’ tumble down i’ the
1030: dirt,” said Luke, the head miller, a tall, broad-shouldered man of
1031: forty, black-eyed and black-haired, subdued by a general mealiness,
1032: like an auricula.
1033: 
1034: Maggie paused in her whirling and said, staggering a little, “Oh no, it
1035: doesn’t make me giddy, Luke; may I go into the mill with you?”
1036: 
1037: Maggie loved to linger in the great spaces of the mill, and often came
1038: out with her black hair powdered to a soft whiteness that made her dark
1039: eyes flash out with new fire. The resolute din, the unresting motion of
1040: the great stones, giving her a dim, delicious awe as at the presence of
1041: an uncontrollable force; the meal forever pouring, pouring; the fine
1042: white powder softening all surfaces, and making the very spidernets
1043: look like a faery lace-work; the sweet, pure scent of the meal,—all
1044: helped to make Maggie feel that the mill was a little world apart from
1045: her outside everyday life. The spiders were especially a subject of
1046: speculation with her. She wondered if they had any relatives outside
1047: the mill, for in that case there must be a painful difficulty in their
1048: family intercourse,—a fat and floury spider, accustomed to take his fly
1049: well dusted with meal, must suffer a little at a cousin’s table where
1050: the fly was _au naturel_, and the lady spiders must be mutually shocked
1051: at each other’s appearance. But the part of the mill she liked best was
1052: the topmost story,—the corn-hutch, where there were the great heaps of
1053: grain, which she could sit on and slide down continually. She was in
1054: the habit of taking this recreation as she conversed with Luke, to whom
1055: she was very communicative, wishing him to think well of her
1056: understanding, as her father did.
1057: 
1058: Perhaps she felt it necessary to recover her position with him on the
1059: present occasion for, as she sat sliding on the heap of grain near
1060: which he was busying himself, she said, at that shrill pitch which was
1061: requisite in mill-society,—
1062: 
1063: “I think you never read any book but the Bible, did you, Luke?”
1064: 
1065: “Nay, Miss, an’ not much o’ that,” said Luke, with great frankness.
1066: “I’m no reader, I aren’t.”
1067: 
1068: “But if I lent you one of my books, Luke? I’ve not got any _very_
1069: pretty books that would be easy for you to read; but there’s ‘Pug’s
1070: Tour of Europe,’—that would tell you all about the different sorts of
1071: people in the world, and if you didn’t understand the reading, the
1072: pictures would help you; they show the looks and ways of the people,
1073: and what they do. There are the Dutchmen, very fat, and smoking, you
1074: know, and one sitting on a barrel.”
1075: 
1076: “Nay, Miss, I’n no opinion o’ Dutchmen. There ben’t much good i’
1077: knowin’ about _them_.”
1078: 
1079: “But they’re our fellow-creatures, Luke; we ought to know about our
1080: fellow-creatures.”
1081: 
1082: “Not much o’ fellow-creaturs, I think, Miss; all I know—my old master,
1083: as war a knowin’ man, used to say, says he, ‘If e’er I sow my wheat
1084: wi’out brinin’, I’m a Dutchman,’ says he; an’ that war as much as to
1085: say as a Dutchman war a fool, or next door. Nay, nay, I aren’t goin’ to
1086: bother mysen about Dutchmen. There’s fools enoo, an’ rogues enoo,
1087: wi’out lookin’ i’ books for ’em.”
1088: 
1089: “Oh, well,” said Maggie, rather foiled by Luke’s unexpectedly decided
1090: views about Dutchmen, “perhaps you would like ‘Animated Nature’ better;
1091: that’s not Dutchmen, you know, but elephants and kangaroos, and the
1092: civet-cat, and the sunfish, and a bird sitting on its tail,—I forget
1093: its name. There are countries full of those creatures, instead of
1094: horses and cows, you know. Shouldn’t you like to know about them,
1095: Luke?”
1096: 
1097: “Nay, Miss, I’n got to keep count o’ the flour an’ corn; I can’t do wi’
1098: knowin’ so many things besides my work. That’s what brings folks to the
1099: gallows,—knowin’ everything but what they’n got to get their bread by.
1100: An’ they’re mostly lies, I think, what’s printed i’ the books: them
1101: printed sheets are, anyhow, as the men cry i’ the streets.”
1102: 
1103: “Why, you’re like my brother Tom, Luke,” said Maggie, wishing to turn
1104: the conversation agreeably; “Tom’s not fond of reading. I love Tom so
1105: dearly, Luke,—better than anybody else in the world. When he grows up I
1106: shall keep his house, and we shall always live together. I can tell him
1107: everything he doesn’t know. But I think Tom’s clever, for all he
1108: doesn’t like books; he makes beautiful whipcord and rabbit-pens.”
1109: 
1110: “Ah,” said Luke, “but he’ll be fine an’ vexed, as the rabbits are all
1111: dead.”
1112: 
1113: “Dead!” screamed Maggie, jumping up from her sliding seat on the corn.
1114: “Oh dear, Luke! What! the lop-eared one, and the spotted doe that Tom
1115: spent all his money to buy?”
1116: 
1117: “As dead as moles,” said Luke, fetching his comparison from the
1118: unmistakable corpses nailed to the stable wall.
1119: 
1120: “Oh dear, Luke,” said Maggie, in a piteous tone, while the big tears
1121: rolled down her cheek; “Tom told me to take care of ’em, and I forgot.
1122: What _shall_ I do?”
1123: 
1124: “Well, you see, Miss, they were in that far tool-house, an’ it was
1125: nobody’s business to see to ’em. I reckon Master Tom told Harry to feed
1126: ’em, but there’s no countin’ on Harry; _he’s_ a offal creatur as iver
1127: come about the primises, he is. He remembers nothing but his own
1128: inside—an’ I wish it ’ud gripe him.”
1129: 
1130: “Oh, Luke, Tom told me to be sure and remember the rabbits every day;
1131: but how could I, when they didn’t come into my head, you know? Oh, he
1132: will be so angry with me, I know he will, and so sorry about his
1133: rabbits, and so am I sorry. Oh, what _shall_ I do?”
1134: 
1135: “Don’t you fret, Miss,” said Luke, soothingly; “they’re nash things,
1136: them lop-eared rabbits; they’d happen ha’ died, if they’d been fed.
1137: Things out o’ natur niver thrive: God A’mighty doesn’t like ’em. He
1138: made the rabbits’ ears to lie back, an’ it’s nothin’ but contrairiness
1139: to make ’em hing down like a mastiff dog’s. Master Tom ’ull know better
1140: nor buy such things another time. Don’t you fret, Miss. Will you come
1141: along home wi’ me, and see my wife? I’m a-goin’ this minute.”
1142: 
1143: The invitation offered an agreeable distraction to Maggie’s grief, and
1144: her tears gradually subsided as she trotted along by Luke’s side to his
1145: pleasant cottage, which stood with its apple and pear trees, and with
1146: the added dignity of a lean-to pigsty, at the other end of the Mill
1147: fields. Mrs Moggs, Luke’s wife, was a decidedly agreeable acquaintance.
1148: She exhibited her hospitality in bread and treacle, and possessed
1149: various works of art. Maggie actually forgot that she had any special
1150: cause of sadness this morning, as she stood on a chair to look at a
1151: remarkable series of pictures representing the Prodigal Son in the
1152: costume of Sir Charles Grandison, except that, as might have been
1153: expected from his defective moral character, he had not, like that
1154: accomplished hero, the taste and strength of mind to dispense with a
1155: wig. But the indefinable weight the dead rabbits had left on her mind
1156: caused her to feel more than usual pity for the career of this weak
1157: young man, particularly when she looked at the picture where he leaned
1158: against a tree with a flaccid appearance, his knee-breeches unbuttoned
1159: and his wig awry, while the swine apparently of some foreign breed,
1160: seemed to insult him by their good spirits over their feast of husks.
1161: 
1162: “I’m very glad his father took him back again, aren’t you, Luke?” she
1163: said. “For he was very sorry, you know, and wouldn’t do wrong again.”
1164: 
1165: “Eh, Miss,” said Luke, “he’d be no great shakes, I doubt, let’s feyther
1166: do what he would for him.”
1167: 
1168: That was a painful thought to Maggie, and she wished much that the
1169: subsequent history of the young man had not been left a blank.
1170: 
1171: 
1172: Chapter V.
1173: 
1174: Tom Comes Home
1175: 
1176: Tom was to arrive early in the afternoon, and there was another
1177: fluttering heart besides Maggie’s when it was late enough for the sound
1178: of the gig-wheels to be expected; for if Mrs Tulliver had a strong
1179: feeling, it was fondness for her boy. At last the sound came,—that
1180: quick light bowling of the gig-wheels,—and in spite of the wind, which
1181: was blowing the clouds about, and was not likely to respect Mrs
1182: Tulliver’s curls and cap-strings, she came outside the door, and even
1183: held her hand on Maggie’s offending head, forgetting all the griefs of
1184: the morning.
1185: 
1186: “There he is, my sweet lad! But, Lord ha’ mercy! he’s got never a
1187: collar on; it’s been lost on the road, I’ll be bound, and spoilt the
1188: set.”
1189: 
1190: Mrs Tulliver stood with her arms open; Maggie jumped first on one leg
1191: and then on the other; while Tom descended from the gig, and said, with
1192: masculine reticence as to the tender emotions, “Hallo! Yap—what! are
1193: you there?”
1194: 
1195: Nevertheless he submitted to be kissed willingly enough, though Maggie
1196: hung on his neck in rather a strangling fashion, while his blue-gray
1197: eyes wandered toward the croft and the lambs and the river, where he
1198: promised himself that he would begin to fish the first thing to-morrow
1199: morning. He was one of those lads that grow everywhere in England, and
1200: at twelve or thirteen years of age look as much alike as goslings,—a
1201: lad with light-brown hair, cheeks of cream and roses, full lips,
1202: indeterminate nose and eyebrows,—a physiognomy in which it seems
1203: impossible to discern anything but the generic character to boyhood; as
1204: different as possible from poor Maggie’s phiz, which Nature seemed to
1205: have moulded and coloured with the most decided intention. But that
1206: same Nature has the deep cunning which hides itself under the
1207: appearance of openness, so that simple people think they can see
1208: through her quite well, and all the while she is secretly preparing a
1209: refutation of their confident prophecies. Under these average boyish
1210: physiognomies that she seems to turn off by the gross, she conceals
1211: some of her most rigid, inflexible purposes, some of her most
1212: unmodifiable characters; and the dark-eyed, demonstrative, rebellious
1213: girl may after all turn out to be a passive being compared with this
1214: pink-and-white bit of masculinity with the indeterminate features.
1215: 
1216: “Maggie,” said Tom, confidentially, taking her into a corner, as soon
1217: as his mother was gone out to examine his box and the warm parlour had
1218: taken off the chill he had felt from the long drive, “you don’t know
1219: what I’ve got in _my_ pockets,” nodding his head up and down as a means
1220: of rousing her sense of mystery.
1221: 
1222: “No,” said Maggie. “How stodgy they look, Tom! Is it marls (marbles) or
1223: cobnuts?” Maggie’s heart sank a little, because Tom always said it was
1224: “no good” playing with _her_ at those games, she played so badly.
1225: 
1226: “Marls! no; I’ve swopped all my marls with the little fellows, and
1227: cobnuts are no fun, you silly, only when the nuts are green. But see
1228: here!” He drew something half out of his right-hand pocket.
1229: 
1230: “What is it?” said Maggie, in a whisper. “I can see nothing but a bit
1231: of yellow.”
1232: 
1233: “Why, it’s—a—new—guess, Maggie!”
1234: 
1235: “Oh, I _can’t_ guess, Tom,” said Maggie, impatiently.
1236: 
1237: “Don’t be a spitfire, else I won’t tell you,” said Tom, thrusting his
1238: hand back into his pocket and looking determined.
1239: 
1240: “No, Tom,” said Maggie, imploringly, laying hold of the arm that was
1241: held stiffly in the pocket. “I’m not cross, Tom; it was only because I
1242: can’t bear guessing. _Please_ be good to me.”
1243: 
1244: Tom’s arm slowly relaxed, and he said, “Well, then, it’s a new
1245: fish-line—two new uns,—one for you, Maggie, all to yourself. I wouldn’t
1246: go halves in the toffee and gingerbread on purpose to save the money;
1247: and Gibson and Spouncer fought with me because I wouldn’t. And here’s
1248: hooks; see here—I say, _won’t_ we go and fish to-morrow down by the
1249: Round Pool? And you shall catch your own fish, Maggie and put the worms
1250: on, and everything; won’t it be fun?”
1251: 
1252: Maggie’s answer was to throw her arms round Tom’s neck and hug him, and
1253: hold her cheek against his without speaking, while he slowly unwound
1254: some of the line, saying, after a pause,—
1255: 
1256: “Wasn’t I a good brother, now, to buy you a line all to yourself? You
1257: know, I needn’t have bought it, if I hadn’t liked.”
1258: 
1259: “Yes, very, very good—I _do_ love you, Tom.”
1260: 
1261: Tom had put the line back in his pocket, and was looking at the hooks
1262: one by one, before he spoke again.
1263: 
1264: “And the fellows fought me, because I wouldn’t give in about the
1265: toffee.”
1266: 
1267: “Oh, dear! I wish they wouldn’t fight at your school, Tom. Didn’t it
1268: hurt you?”
1269: 
1270: “Hurt me? no,” said Tom, putting up the hooks again, taking out a large
1271: pocket-knife, and slowly opening the largest blade, which he looked at
1272: meditatively as he rubbed his finger along it. Then he added,—
1273: 
1274: “I gave Spouncer a black eye, I know; that’s what he got by wanting to
1275: leather _me;_ I wasn’t going to go halves because anybody leathered
1276: me.”
1277: 
1278: “Oh, how brave you are, Tom! I think you’re like Samson. If there came
1279: a lion roaring at me, I think you’d fight him, wouldn’t you, Tom?”
1280: 
1281: “How can a lion come roaring at you, you silly thing? There’s no lions,
1282: only in the shows.”
1283: 
1284: “No; but if we were in the lion countries—I mean in Africa, where it’s
1285: very hot; the lions eat people there. I can show it you in the book
1286: where I read it.”
1287: 
1288: “Well, I should get a gun and shoot him.”
1289: 
1290: “But if you hadn’t got a gun,—we might have gone out, you know, not
1291: thinking, just as we go fishing; and then a great lion might run
1292: towards us roaring, and we couldn’t get away from him. What should you
1293: do, Tom?”
1294: 
1295: Tom paused, and at last turned away contemptuously, saying, “But the
1296: lion _isn’t_ coming. What’s the use of talking?”
1297: 
1298: “But I like to fancy how it would be,” said Maggie, following him.
1299: “Just think what you would do, Tom.”
1300: 
1301: “Oh, don’t bother, Maggie! you’re such a silly. I shall go and see my
1302: rabbits.”
1303: 
1304: Maggie’s heart began to flutter with fear. She dared not tell the sad
1305: truth at once, but she walked after Tom in trembling silence as he went
1306: out, thinking how she could tell him the news so as to soften at once
1307: his sorrow and his anger; for Maggie dreaded Tom’s anger of all things;
1308: it was quite a different anger from her own.
1309: 
1310: “Tom,” she said, timidly, when they were out of doors, “how much money
1311: did you give for your rabbits?”
1312: 
1313: “Two half-crowns and a sixpence,” said Tom, promptly.
1314: 
1315: “I think I’ve got a great deal more than that in my steel purse
1316: upstairs. I’ll ask mother to give it you.”
1317: 
1318: “What for?” said Tom. “I don’t want _your_ money, you silly thing. I’ve
1319: got a great deal more money than you, because I’m a boy. I always have
1320: half-sovereigns and sovereigns for my Christmas boxes because I shall
1321: be a man, and you only have five-shilling pieces, because you’re only a
1322: girl.”
1323: 
1324: “Well, but, Tom—if mother would let me give you two half-crowns and a
1325: sixpence out of my purse to put into your pocket and spend, you know,
1326: and buy some more rabbits with it?”
1327: 
1328: “More rabbits? I don’t want any more.”
1329: 
1330: “Oh, but, Tom, they’re all dead.”
1331: 
1332: Tom stopped immediately in his walk and turned round toward Maggie.
1333: “You forgot to feed ’em, then, and Harry forgot?” he said, his colour
1334: heightening for a moment, but soon subsiding. “I’ll pitch into Harry.
1335: I’ll have him turned away. And I don’t love you, Maggie. You sha’n’t go
1336: fishing with me to-morrow. I told you to go and see the rabbits every
1337: day.” He walked on again.
1338: 
1339: “Yes, but I forgot—and I couldn’t help it, indeed, Tom. I’m so very
1340: sorry,” said Maggie, while the tears rushed fast.
1341: 
1342: “You’re a naughty girl,” said Tom, severely, “and I’m sorry I bought
1343: you the fish-line. I don’t love you.”
1344: 
1345: “Oh, Tom, it’s very cruel,” sobbed Maggie. “I’d forgive you, if _you_
1346: forgot anything—I wouldn’t mind what you did—I’d forgive you and love
1347: you.”
1348: 
1349: “Yes, you’re silly; but I never _do_ forget things, _I_ don’t.”
1350: 
1351: “Oh, please forgive me, Tom; my heart will break,” said Maggie, shaking
1352: with sobs, clinging to Tom’s arm, and laying her wet cheek on his
1353: shoulder.
1354: 
1355: Tom shook her off, and stopped again, saying in a peremptory tone,
1356: “Now, Maggie, you just listen. Aren’t I a good brother to you?”
1357: 
1358: “Ye-ye-es,” sobbed Maggie, her chin rising and falling convulsedly.
1359: 
1360: “Didn’t I think about your fish-line all this quarter, and mean to buy
1361: it, and saved my money o’ purpose, and wouldn’t go halves in the
1362: toffee, and Spouncer fought me because I wouldn’t?”
1363: 
1364: “Ye-ye-es—and I—lo-lo-love you so, Tom.”
1365: 
1366: “But you’re a naughty girl. Last holidays you licked the paint off my
1367: lozenge-box, and the holidays before that you let the boat drag my
1368: fish-line down when I’d set you to watch it, and you pushed your head
1369: through my kite, all for nothing.”
1370: 
1371: “But I didn’t mean,” said Maggie; “I couldn’t help it.”
1372: 
1373: “Yes, you could,” said Tom, “if you’d minded what you were doing. And
1374: you’re a naughty girl, and you sha’n’t go fishing with me to-morrow.”
1375: 
1376: With this terrible conclusion, Tom ran away from Maggie toward the
1377: mill, meaning to greet Luke there, and complain to him of Harry.
1378: 
1379: Maggie stood motionless, except from her sobs, for a minute or two;
1380: then she turned round and ran into the house, and up to her attic,
1381: where she sat on the floor and laid her head against the worm-eaten
1382: shelf, with a crushing sense of misery. Tom was come home, and she had
1383: thought how happy she should be; and now he was cruel to her. What use
1384: was anything if Tom didn’t love her? Oh, he was very cruel! Hadn’t she
1385: wanted to give him the money, and said how very sorry she was? She knew
1386: she was naughty to her mother, but she had never been naughty to
1387: Tom—had never _meant_ to be naughty to him.
1388: 
1389: “Oh, he is cruel!” Maggie sobbed aloud, finding a wretched pleasure in
1390: the hollow resonance that came through the long empty space of the
1391: attic. She never thought of beating or grinding her Fetish; she was too
1392: miserable to be angry.
1393: 
1394: These bitter sorrows of childhood! when sorrow is all new and strange,
1395: when hope has not yet got wings to fly beyond the days and weeks, and
1396: the space from summer to summer seems measureless.
1397: 
1398: Maggie soon thought she had been hours in the attic, and it must be
1399: tea-time, and they were all having their tea, and not thinking of her.
1400: Well, then, she would stay up there and starve herself,—hide herself
1401: behind the tub, and stay there all night,—and then they would all be
1402: frightened, and Tom would be sorry. Thus Maggie thought in the pride of
1403: her heart, as she crept behind the tub; but presently she began to cry
1404: again at the idea that they didn’t mind her being there. If she went
1405: down again to Tom now—would he forgive her? Perhaps her father would be
1406: there, and he would take her part. But then she wanted Tom to forgive
1407: her because he loved her, not because his father told him. No, she
1408: would never go down if Tom didn’t come to fetch her. This resolution
1409: lasted in great intensity for five dark minutes behind the tub; but
1410: then the need of being loved—the strongest need in poor Maggie’s
1411: nature—began to wrestle with her pride, and soon threw it. She crept
1412: from behind her tub into the twilight of the long attic, but just then
1413: she heard a quick foot-step on the stairs.
1414: 
1415: Tom had been too much interested in his talk with Luke, in going the
1416: round of the premises, walking in and out where he pleased, and
1417: whittling sticks without any particular reason,—except that he didn’t
1418: whittle sticks at school,—to think of Maggie and the effect his anger
1419: had produced on her. He meant to punish her, and that business having
1420: been performed, he occupied himself with other matters, like a
1421: practical person. But when he had been called in to tea, his father
1422: said, “Why, where’s the little wench?” and Mrs Tulliver, almost at the
1423: same moment, said, “Where’s your little sister?”—both of them having
1424: supposed that Maggie and Tom had been together all the afternoon.
1425: 
1426: “I don’t know,” said Tom. He didn’t want to “tell” of Maggie, though he
1427: was angry with her; for Tom Tulliver was a lad of honour.
1428: 
1429: “What! hasn’t she been playing with you all this while?” said the
1430: father. “She’d been thinking o’ nothing but your coming home.”
1431: 
1432: “I haven’t seen her this two hours,” says Tom, commencing on the
1433: plumcake.
1434: 
1435: “Goodness heart; she’s got drownded!” exclaimed Mrs Tulliver, rising
1436: from her seat and running to the window.
1437: 
1438: “How could you let her do so?” she added, as became a fearful woman,
1439: accusing she didn’t know whom of she didn’t know what.
1440: 
1441: “Nay, nay, she’s none drownded,” said Mr Tulliver. “You’ve been naughty
1442: to her, I doubt, Tom?”
1443: 
1444: “I’m sure I haven’t, father,” said Tom, indignantly. “I think she’s in
1445: the house.”
1446: 
1447: “Perhaps up in that attic,” said Mrs Tulliver, “a-singing and talking
1448: to herself, and forgetting all about meal-times.”
1449: 
1450: “You go and fetch her down, Tom,” said Mr Tulliver, rather sharply,—his
1451: perspicacity or his fatherly fondness for Maggie making him suspect
1452: that the lad had been hard upon “the little un,” else she would never
1453: have left his side. “And be good to her, do you hear? Else I’ll let you
1454: know better.”
1455: 
1456: Tom never disobeyed his father, for Mr Tulliver was a peremptory man,
1457: and, as he said, would never let anybody get hold of his whip-hand; but
1458: he went out rather sullenly, carrying his piece of plumcake, and not
1459: intending to reprieve Maggie’s punishment, which was no more than she
1460: deserved. Tom was only thirteen, and had no decided views in grammar
1461: and arithmetic, regarding them for the most part as open questions, but
1462: he was particularly clear and positive on one point,—namely, that he
1463: would punish everybody who deserved it. Why, he wouldn’t have minded
1464: being punished himself if he deserved it; but, then, he never _did_
1465: deserve it.
1466: 
1467: It was Tom’s step, then, that Maggie heard on the stairs, when her need
1468: of love had triumphed over her pride, and she was going down with her
1469: swollen eyes and dishevelled hair to beg for pity. At least her father
1470: would stroke her head and say, “Never mind, my wench.” It is a
1471: wonderful subduer, this need of love,—this hunger of the heart,—as
1472: peremptory as that other hunger by which Nature forces us to submit to
1473: the yoke, and change the face of the world.
1474: 
1475: But she knew Tom’s step, and her heart began to beat violently with the
1476: sudden shock of hope. He only stood still at the top of the stairs and
1477: said, “Maggie, you’re to come down.” But she rushed to him and clung
1478: round his neck, sobbing, “Oh, Tom, please forgive me—I can’t bear it—I
1479: will always be good—always remember things—do love me—please, dear
1480: Tom!”
1481: 
1482: We learn to restrain ourselves as we get older. We keep apart when we
1483: have quarrelled, express ourselves in well-bred phrases, and in this
1484: way preserve a dignified alienation, showing much firmness on one side,
1485: and swallowing much grief on the other. We no longer approximate in our
1486: behaviour to the mere impulsiveness of the lower animals, but conduct
1487: ourselves in every respect like members of a highly civilised society.
1488: Maggie and Tom were still very much like young animals, and so she
1489: could rub her cheek against his, and kiss his ear in a random sobbing
1490: way; and there were tender fibres in the lad that had been used to
1491: answer to Maggie’s fondling, so that he behaved with a weakness quite
1492: inconsistent with his resolution to punish her as much as she deserved.
1493: He actually began to kiss her in return, and say,—
1494: 
1495: “Don’t cry, then, Magsie; here, eat a bit o’ cake.”
1496: 
1497: Maggie’s sobs began to subside, and she put out her mouth for the cake
1498: and bit a piece; and then Tom bit a piece, just for company, and they
1499: ate together and rubbed each other’s cheeks and brows and noses
1500: together, while they ate, with a humiliating resemblance to two
1501: friendly ponies.
1502: 
1503: “Come along, Magsie, and have tea,” said Tom at last, when there was no
1504: more cake except what was down-stairs.
1505: 
1506: So ended the sorrows of this day, and the next morning Maggie was
1507: trotting with her own fishing-rod in one hand and a handle of the
1508: basket in the other, stepping always, by a peculiar gift, in the
1509: muddiest places, and looking darkly radiant from under her
1510: beaver-bonnet because Tom was good to her. She had told Tom, however,
1511: that she should like him to put the worms on the hook for her, although
1512: she accepted his word when he assured her that worms couldn’t feel (it
1513: was Tom’s private opinion that it didn’t much matter if they did). He
1514: knew all about worms, and fish, and those things; and what birds were
1515: mischievous, and how padlocks opened, and which way the handles of the
1516: gates were to be lifted. Maggie thought this sort of knowledge was very
1517: wonderful,—much more difficult than remembering what was in the books;
1518: and she was rather in awe of Tom’s superiority, for he was the only
1519: person who called her knowledge “stuff,” and did not feel surprised at
1520: her cleverness. Tom, indeed, was of opinion that Maggie was a silly
1521: little thing; all girls were silly,—they couldn’t throw a stone so as
1522: to hit anything, couldn’t do anything with a pocket-knife, and were
1523: frightened at frogs. Still, he was very fond of his sister, and meant
1524: always to take care of her, make her his housekeeper, and punish her
1525: when she did wrong.
1526: 
1527: They were on their way to the Round Pool,—that wonderful pool, which
1528: the floods had made a long while ago. No one knew how deep it was; and
1529: it was mysterious, too, that it should be almost a perfect round,
1530: framed in with willows and tall reeds, so that the water was only to be
1531: seen when you got close to the brink. The sight of the old favourite
1532: spot always heightened Tom’s good humour, and he spoke to Maggie in the
1533: most amicable whispers, as he opened the precious basket and prepared
1534: their tackle. He threw her line for her, and put the rod into her hand.
1535: Maggie thought it probable that the small fish would come to her hook,
1536: and the large ones to Tom’s. But she had forgotten all about the fish,
1537: and was looking dreamily at the glassy water, when Tom said, in a loud
1538: whisper, “Look, look, Maggie!” and came running to prevent her from
1539: snatching her line away.
1540: 
1541: Maggie was frightened lest she had been doing something wrong, as
1542: usual, but presently Tom drew out her line and brought a large tench
1543: bouncing on the grass.
1544: 
1545: Tom was excited.
1546: 
1547: “O Magsie, you little duck! Empty the basket.”
1548: 
1549: Maggie was not conscious of unusual merit, but it was enough that Tom
1550: called her Magsie, and was pleased with her. There was nothing to mar
1551: her delight in the whispers and the dreamy silences, when she listened
1552: to the light dripping sounds of the rising fish, and the gentle
1553: rustling, as if the willows and the reeds and the water had their happy
1554: whisperings also. Maggie thought it would make a very nice heaven to
1555: sit by the pool in that way, and never be scolded. She never knew she
1556: had a bite till Tom told her; but she liked fishing very much.
1557: 
1558: It was one of their happy mornings. They trotted along and sat down
1559: together, with no thought that life would ever change much for them;
1560: they would only get bigger and not go to school, and it would always be
1561: like the holidays; they would always live together and be fond of each
1562: other. And the mill with its booming; the great chestnut-tree under
1563: which they played at houses; their own little river, the Ripple, where
1564: the banks seemed like home, and Tom was always seeing the water-rats,
1565: while Maggie gathered the purple plumy tops of the reeds, which she
1566: forgot and dropped afterward; above all, the great Floss, along which
1567: they wandered with a sense of travel, to see the rushing spring-tide,
1568: the awful Eagre, come up like a hungry monster, or to see the Great Ash
1569: which had once wailed and groaned like a man, these things would always
1570: be just the same to them. Tom thought people were at a disadvantage who
1571: lived on any other spot of the globe; and Maggie, when she read about
1572: Christiana passing “the river over which there is no bridge,” always
1573: saw the Floss between the green pastures by the Great Ash.
1574: 
1575: Life did change for Tom and Maggie; and yet they were not wrong in
1576: believing that the thoughts and loves of these first years would always
1577: make part of their lives. We could never have loved the earth so well
1578: if we had had no childhood in it,—if it were not the earth where the
1579: same flowers come up again every spring that we used to gather with our
1580: tiny fingers as we sat lisping to ourselves on the grass; the same hips
1581: and haws on the autumn’s hedgerows; the same redbreasts that we used to
1582: call “God’s birds,” because they did no harm to the precious crops.
1583: What novelty is worth that sweet monotony where everything is known,
1584: and _loved_ because it is known?
1585: 
1586: The wood I walk in on this mild May day, with the young yellow-brown
1587: foliage of the oaks between me and the blue sky, the white star-flowers
1588: and the blue-eyed speedwell and the ground ivy at my feet, what grove
1589: of tropic palms, what strange ferns or splendid broad-petalled
1590: blossoms, could ever thrill such deep and delicate fibres within me as
1591: this home scene? These familiar flowers, these well-remembered
1592: bird-notes, this sky, with its fitful brightness, these furrowed and
1593: grassy fields, each with a sort of personality given to it by the
1594: capricious hedgerows,—such things as these are the mother-tongue of our
1595: imagination, the language that is laden with all the subtle,
1596: inextricable associations the fleeting hours of our childhood left
1597: behind them. Our delight in the sunshine on the deep-bladed grass
1598: to-day might be no more than the faint perception of wearied souls, if
1599: it were not for the sunshine and the grass in the far-off years which
1600: still live in us, and transform our perception into love.
1601:

1603: Chapter VI.
1604: 
1605: The Aunts and Uncles Are Coming
1606: 
1607: It was Easter week, and Mrs Tulliver’s cheesecakes were more
1608: exquisitely light than usual. “A puff o’ wind ’ud make ’em blow about
1609: like feathers,” Kezia the housemaid said, feeling proud to live under a
1610: mistress who could make such pastry; so that no season or circumstances
1611: could have been more propitious for a family party, even if it had not
1612: been advisable to consult sister Glegg and sister Pullet about Tom’s
1613: going to school.
1614: 
1615: “I’d as lief not invite sister Deane this time,” said Mrs Tulliver,
1616: “for she’s as jealous and having as can be, and’s allays trying to make
1617: the worst o’ my poor children to their aunts and uncles.”
1618: 
1619: “Yes, yes,” said Mr Tulliver, “ask her to come. I never hardly get a
1620: bit o’ talk with Deane now; we haven’t had him this six months. What’s
1621: it matter what she says? My children need be beholding to nobody.”
1622: 
1623: “That’s what you allays say, Mr Tulliver; but I’m sure there’s nobody
1624: o’ _your_ side, neither aunt nor uncle, to leave ’em so much as a
1625: five-pound note for a leggicy. And there’s sister Glegg, and sister
1626: Pullet too, saving money unknown, for they put by all their own
1627: interest and butter-money too; their husbands buy ’em everything.” Mrs
1628: Tulliver was a mild woman, but even a sheep will face about a little
1629: when she has lambs.
1630: 
1631: “Tchuh!” said Mr Tulliver. “It takes a big loaf when there’s many to
1632: breakfast. What signifies your sisters’ bits o’ money when they’ve got
1633: half-a-dozen nevvies and nieces to divide it among? And your sister
1634: Deane won’t get ’em to leave all to one, I reckon, and make the country
1635: cry shame on ’em when they are dead?”
1636: 
1637: “I don’t know what she won’t get ’em to do,” said Mrs Tulliver, “for my
1638: children are so awk’ard wi’ their aunts and uncles. Maggie’s ten times
1639: naughtier when they come than she is other days, and Tom doesn’t like
1640: ’em, bless him!—though it’s more nat’ral in a boy than a gell. And
1641: there’s Lucy Deane’s such a good child,—you may set her on a stool, and
1642: there she’ll sit for an hour together, and never offer to get off. I
1643: can’t help loving the child as if she was my own; and I’m sure she’s
1644: more like _my_ child than sister Deane’s, for she’d allays a very poor
1645: colour for one of our family, sister Deane had.”
1646: 
1647: “Well, well, if you’re fond o’ the child, ask her father and mother to
1648: bring her with ’em. And won’t you ask their aunt and uncle Moss too,
1649: and some o’ _their_ children?”
1650: 
1651: “Oh, dear, Mr Tulliver, why, there’d be eight people besides the
1652: children, and I must put two more leaves i’ the table, besides reaching
1653: down more o’ the dinner-service; and you know as well as I do as _my_
1654: sisters and _your_ sister don’t suit well together.”
1655: 
1656: “Well, well, do as you like, Bessy,” said Mr Tulliver, taking up his
1657: hat and walking out to the mill. Few wives were more submissive than
1658: Mrs Tulliver on all points unconnected with her family relations; but
1659: she had been a Miss Dodson, and the Dodsons were a very respectable
1660: family indeed,—as much looked up to as any in their own parish, or the
1661: next to it. The Miss Dodsons had always been thought to hold up their
1662: heads very high, and no one was surprised the two eldest had married so
1663: well,—not at an early age, for that was not the practice of the Dodson
1664: family. There were particular ways of doing everything in that family:
1665: particular ways of bleaching the linen, of making the cowslip wine,
1666: curing the hams, and keeping the bottled gooseberries; so that no
1667: daughter of that house could be indifferent to the privilege of having
1668: been born a Dodson, rather than a Gibson or a Watson. Funerals were
1669: always conducted with peculiar propriety in the Dodson family: the
1670: hat-bands were never of a blue shade, the gloves never split at the
1671: thumb, everybody was a mourner who ought to be, and there were always
1672: scarfs for the bearers. When one of the family was in trouble or
1673: sickness, all the rest went to visit the unfortunate member, usually at
1674: the same time, and did not shrink from uttering the most disagreeable
1675: truths that correct family feeling dictated; if the illness or trouble
1676: was the sufferer’s own fault, it was not in the practice of the Dodson
1677: family to shrink from saying so. In short, there was in this family a
1678: peculiar tradition as to what was the right thing in household
1679: management and social demeanour, and the only bitter circumstance
1680: attending this superiority was a painful inability to approve the
1681: condiments or the conduct of families ungoverned by the Dodson
1682: tradition. A female Dodson, when in “strange houses,” always ate dry
1683: bread with her tea, and declined any sort of preserves, having no
1684: confidence in the butter, and thinking that the preserves had probably
1685: begun to ferment from want of due sugar and boiling. There were some
1686: Dodsons less like the family than others, that was admitted; but in so
1687: far as they were “kin,” they were of necessity better than those who
1688: were “no kin.” And it is remarkable that while no individual Dodson was
1689: satisfied with any other individual Dodson, each was satisfied, not
1690: only with him or herself, but with the Dodsons collectively. The
1691: feeblest member of a family—the one who has the least character—is
1692: often the merest epitome of the family habits and traditions; and Mrs
1693: Tulliver was a thorough Dodson, though a mild one, as small-beer, so
1694: long as it is anything, is only describable as very weak ale: and
1695: though she had groaned a little in her youth under the yoke of her
1696: elder sisters, and still shed occasional tears at their sisterly
1697: reproaches, it was not in Mrs Tulliver to be an innovator on the family
1698: ideas. She was thankful to have been a Dodson, and to have one child
1699: who took after her own family, at least in his features and complexion,
1700: in liking salt and in eating beans, which a Tulliver never did.
1701: 
1702: In other respects the true Dodson was partly latent in Tom, and he was
1703: as far from appreciating his “kin” on the mother’s side as Maggie
1704: herself, generally absconding for the day with a large supply of the
1705: most portable food, when he received timely warning that his aunts and
1706: uncles were coming,—a moral symptom from which his aunt Glegg deduced
1707: the gloomiest views of his future. It was rather hard on Maggie that
1708: Tom always absconded without letting her into the secret, but the
1709: weaker sex are acknowledged to be serious _impedimenta_ in cases of
1710: flight.
1711: 
1712: On Wednesday, the day before the aunts and uncles were coming, there
1713: were such various and suggestive scents, as of plumcakes in the oven
1714: and jellies in the hot state, mingled with the aroma of gravy, that it
1715: was impossible to feel altogether gloomy: there was hope in the air.
1716: Tom and Maggie made several inroads into the kitchen, and, like other
1717: marauders, were induced to keep aloof for a time only by being allowed
1718: to carry away a sufficient load of booty.
1719: 
1720: “Tom,” said Maggie, as they sat on the boughs of the elder-tree, eating
1721: their jam-puffs, “shall you run away to-morrow?”
1722: 
1723: “No,” said Tom, slowly, when he had finished his puff, and was eying
1724: the third, which was to be divided between them,—“no, I sha’n’t.”
1725: 
1726: “Why, Tom? Because Lucy’s coming?”
1727: 
1728: “No,” said Tom, opening his pocket-knife and holding it over the puff,
1729: with his head on one side in a dubitative manner. (It was a difficult
1730: problem to divide that very irregular polygon into two equal parts.)
1731: “What do _I_ care about Lucy? She’s only a girl,—_she_ can’t play at
1732: bandy.”
1733: 
1734: “Is it the tipsy-cake, then?” said Maggie, exerting her hypothetic
1735: powers, while she leaned forward toward Tom with her eyes fixed on the
1736: hovering knife.
1737: 
1738: “No, you silly, that’ll be good the day after. It’s the pudden. I know
1739: what the pudden’s to be,—apricot roll-up—O my buttons!”
1740: 
1741: With this interjection, the knife descended on the puff, and it was in
1742: two, but the result was not satisfactory to Tom, for he still eyed the
1743: halves doubtfully. At last he said,—
1744: 
1745: “Shut your eyes, Maggie.”
1746: 
1747: “What for?”
1748: 
1749: “You never mind what for. Shut ’em when I tell you.”
1750: 
1751: Maggie obeyed.
1752: 
1753: “Now, which’ll you have, Maggie,—right hand or left?”
1754: 
1755: “I’ll have that with the jam run out,” said Maggie, keeping her eyes
1756: shut to please Tom.
1757: 
1758: “Why, you don’t like that, you silly. You may have it if it comes to
1759: you fair, but I sha’n’t give it you without. Right or left,—you choose,
1760: now. Ha-a-a!” said Tom, in a tone of exasperation, as Maggie peeped.
1761: “You keep your eyes shut, now, else you sha’n’t have any.”
1762: 
1763: Maggie’s power of sacrifice did not extend so far; indeed, I fear she
1764: cared less that Tom should enjoy the utmost possible amount of puff,
1765: than that he should be pleased with her for giving him the best bit. So
1766: she shut her eyes quite close, till Tom told her to “say which,” and
1767: then she said, “Left hand.”
1768: 
1769: “You’ve got it,” said Tom, in rather a bitter tone.
1770: 
1771: “What! the bit with the jam run out?”
1772: 
1773: “No; here, take it,” said Tom, firmly, handing, decidedly the best
1774: piece to Maggie.
1775: 
1776: “Oh, please, Tom, have it; I don’t mind—I like the other; please take
1777: this.”
1778: 
1779: “No, I sha’n’t,” said Tom, almost crossly, beginning on his own
1780: inferior piece.
1781: 
1782: Maggie, thinking it was no use to contend further, began too, and ate
1783: up her half puff with considerable relish as well as rapidity. But Tom
1784: had finished first, and had to look on while Maggie ate her last morsel
1785: or two, feeling in himself a capacity for more. Maggie didn’t know Tom
1786: was looking at her; she was seesawing on the elder-bough, lost to
1787: almost everything but a vague sense of jam and idleness.
1788: 
1789: “Oh, you greedy thing!” said Tom, when she had swallowed the last
1790: morsel. He was conscious of having acted very fairly, and thought she
1791: ought to have considered this, and made up to him for it. He would have
1792: refused a bit of hers beforehand, but one is naturally at a different
1793: point of view before and after one’s own share of puff is swallowed.
1794: 
1795: Maggie turned quite pale. “Oh, Tom, why didn’t you ask me?”
1796: 
1797: “_I_ wasn’t going to ask you for a bit, you greedy. You might have
1798: thought of it without, when you knew I gave you the best bit.”
1799: 
1800: “But I wanted you to have it; you know I did,” said Maggie, in an
1801: injured tone.
1802: 
1803: “Yes, but I wasn’t going to do what wasn’t fair, like Spouncer. He
1804: always takes the best bit, if you don’t punch him for it; and if you
1805: choose the best with your eyes shut, he changes his hands. But if I go
1806: halves, I’ll go ’em fair; only I wouldn’t be a greedy.”
1807: 
1808: With this cutting innuendo, Tom jumped down from his bough, and threw a
1809: stone with a “hoigh!” as a friendly attention to Yap, who had also been
1810: looking on while the eatables vanished, with an agitation of his ears
1811: and feelings which could hardly have been without bitterness. Yet the
1812: excellent dog accepted Tom’s attention with as much alacrity as if he
1813: had been treated quite generously.
1814: 
1815: But Maggie, gifted with that superior power of misery which
1816: distinguishes the human being, and places him at a proud distance from
1817: the most melancholy chimpanzee, sat still on her bough, and gave
1818: herself up to the keen sense of unmerited reproach. She would have
1819: given the world not to have eaten all her puff, and to have saved some
1820: of it for Tom. Not but that the puff was very nice, for Maggie’s palate
1821: was not at all obtuse, but she would have gone without it many times
1822: over, sooner than Tom should call her greedy and be cross with her. And
1823: he had said he wouldn’t have it, and she ate it without thinking; how
1824: could she help it? The tears flowed so plentifully that Maggie saw
1825: nothing around her for the next ten minutes; but by that time
1826: resentment began to give way to the desire of reconciliation, and she
1827: jumped from her bough to look for Tom. He was no longer in the paddock
1828: behind the rickyard; where was he likely to be gone, and Yap with him?
1829: Maggie ran to the high bank against the great holly-tree, where she
1830: could see far away toward the Floss. There was Tom; but her heart sank
1831: again as she saw how far off he was on his way to the great river, and
1832: that he had another companion besides Yap,—naughty Bob Jakin, whose
1833: official, if not natural, function of frightening the birds was just
1834: now at a standstill. Maggie felt sure that Bob was wicked, without very
1835: distinctly knowing why; unless it was because Bob’s mother was a
1836: dreadfully large fat woman, who lived at a queer round house down the
1837: river; and once, when Maggie and Tom had wandered thither, there rushed
1838: out a brindled dog that wouldn’t stop barking; and when Bob’s mother
1839: came out after it, and screamed above the barking to tell them not to
1840: be frightened, Maggie thought she was scolding them fiercely, and her
1841: heart beat with terror. Maggie thought it very likely that the round
1842: house had snakes on the floor, and bats in the bedroom; for she had
1843: seen Bob take off his cap to show Tom a little snake that was inside
1844: it, and another time he had a handful of young bats: altogether, he was
1845: an irregular character, perhaps even slightly diabolical, judging from
1846: his intimacy with snakes and bats; and to crown all, when Tom had Bob
1847: for a companion, he didn’t mind about Maggie, and would never let her
1848: go with him.
1849: 
1850: It must be owned that Tom was fond of Bob’s company. How could it be
1851: otherwise? Bob knew, directly he saw a bird’s egg, whether it was a
1852: swallow’s, or a tomtit’s, or a yellow-hammer’s; he found out all the
1853: wasps’ nests, and could set all sorts of traps; he could climb the trees
1854: like a squirrel, and had quite a magical power of detecting hedgehogs
1855: and stoats; and he had courage to do things that were rather naughty,
1856: such as making gaps in the hedgerows, throwing stones after the sheep,
1857: and killing a cat that was wandering _incognito_. Such qualities in an
1858: inferior, who could always be treated with authority in spite of his
1859: superior knowingness, had necessarily a fatal fascination for Tom; and
1860: every holiday-time Maggie was sure to have days of grief because he had
1861: gone off with Bob.
1862: 
1863: Well! there was no hope for it; he was gone now, and Maggie could think
1864: of no comfort but to sit down by the hollow, or wander by the hedgerow,
1865: and fancy it was all different, refashioning her little world into just
1866: what she should like it to be.
1867: 
1868: Maggie’s was a troublous life, and this was the form in which she took
1869: her opium.
1870: 
1871: Meanwhile Tom, forgetting all about Maggie and the sting of reproach
1872: which he had left in her heart, was hurrying along with Bob, whom he
1873: had met accidentally, to the scene of a great rat-catching in a
1874: neighbouring barn. Bob knew all about this particular affair, and spoke
1875: of the sport with an enthusiasm which no one who is not either divested
1876: of all manly feeling, or pitiably ignorant of rat-catching, can fail to
1877: imagine. For a person suspected of preternatural wickedness, Bob was
1878: really not so very villanous-looking; there was even something
1879: agreeable in his snub-nosed face, with its close-curled border of red
1880: hair. But then his trousers were always rolled up at the knee, for the
1881: convenience of wading on the slightest notice; and his virtue,
1882: supposing it to exist, was undeniably “virtue in rags,” which, on the
1883: authority even of bilious philosophers, who think all well-dressed
1884: merit overpaid, is notoriously likely to remain unrecognised (perhaps
1885: because it is seen so seldom).
1886: 
1887: “I know the chap as owns the ferrets,” said Bob, in a hoarse treble
1888: voice, as he shuffled along, keeping his blue eyes fixed on the river,
1889: like an amphibious animal who foresaw occasion for darting in. “He
1890: lives up the Kennel Yard at Sut Ogg’s, he does. He’s the biggest
1891: rot-catcher anywhere, he is. I’d sooner, be a rot-catcher nor anything,
1892: I would. The moles is nothing to the rots. But Lors! you mun ha’
1893: ferrets. Dogs is no good. Why, there’s that dog, now!” Bob continued,
1894: pointing with an air of disgust toward Yap, “he’s no more good wi’ a
1895: rot nor nothin’. I see it myself, I did, at the rot-catchin’ i’ your
1896: feyther’s barn.”
1897: 
1898: Yap, feeling the withering influence of this scorn, tucked his tail in
1899: and shrank close to Tom’s leg, who felt a little hurt for him, but had
1900: not the superhuman courage to seem behindhand with Bob in contempt for
1901: a dog who made so poor a figure.
1902: 
1903: “No, no,” he said, “Yap’s no good at sport. I’ll have regular good dogs
1904: for rats and everything, when I’ve done school.”
1905: 
1906: “Hev ferrets, Measter Tom,” said Bob, eagerly,—“them white ferrets wi’
1907: pink eyes; Lors, you might catch your own rots, an’ you might put a rot
1908: in a cage wi’ a ferret, an’ see ’em fight, you might. That’s what I’d
1909: do, I know, an’ it ’ud be better fun a’most nor seein’ two chaps
1910: fight,—if it wasn’t them chaps as sold cakes an’ oranges at the Fair,
1911: as the things flew out o’ their baskets, an’ some o’ the cakes was
1912: smashed—But they tasted just as good,” added Bob, by way of note or
1913: addendum, after a moment’s pause.
1914: 
1915: “But, I say, Bob,” said Tom, in a tone of deliberation, “ferrets are
1916: nasty biting things,—they’ll bite a fellow without being set on.”
1917: 
1918: “Lors! why that’s the beauty on ’em. If a chap lays hold o’ your
1919: ferret, he won’t be long before he hollows out a good un, _he_ won’t.”
1920: 
1921: At this moment a striking incident made the boys pause suddenly in
1922: their walk. It was the plunging of some small body in the water from
1923: among the neighbouring bulrushes; if it was not a water-rat, Bob
1924: intimated that he was ready to undergo the most unpleasant
1925: consequences.
1926: 
1927: “Hoigh! Yap,—hoigh! there he is,” said Tom, clapping his hands, as the
1928: little black snout made its arrowy course to the opposite bank. “Seize
1929: him, lad! seize him!”
1930: 
1931: Yap agitated his ears and wrinkled his brows, but declined to plunge,
1932: trying whether barking would not answer the purpose just as well.
1933: 
1934: “Ugh! you coward!” said Tom, and kicked him over, feeling humiliated as
1935: a sportsman to possess so poor-spirited an animal. Bob abstained from
1936: remark and passed on, choosing, however, to walk in the shallow edge of
1937: the overflowing river by way of change.
1938: 
1939: “He’s none so full now, the Floss isn’t,” said Bob, as he kicked the
1940: water up before him, with an agreeable sense of being insolent to it.
1941: “Why, last ’ear, the meadows was all one sheet o’ water, they was.”
1942: 
1943: “Ay, but,” said Tom, whose mind was prone to see an opposition between
1944: statements that were really accordant,—“but there was a big flood once,
1945: when the Round Pool was made. _I_ know there was, ’cause father says
1946: so. And the sheep and cows all drowned, and the boats went all over the
1947: fields ever such a way.”
1948: 
1949: “_I_ don’t care about a flood comin’,” said Bob; “I don’t mind the
1950: water, no more nor the land. I’d swim, _I_ would.”
1951: 
1952: “Ah, but if you got nothing to eat for ever so long?” said Tom, his
1953: imagination becoming quite active under the stimulus of that dread.
1954: “When I’m a man, I shall make a boat with a wooden house on the top of
1955: it, like Noah’s ark, and keep plenty to eat in it,—rabbits and
1956: things,—all ready. And then if the flood came, you know, Bob, I
1957: shouldn’t mind. And I’d take you in, if I saw you swimming,” he added,
1958: in the tone of a benevolent patron.
1959: 
1960: “I aren’t frighted,” said Bob, to whom hunger did not appear so
1961: appalling. “But I’d get in an’ knock the rabbits on th’ head when you
1962: wanted to eat ’em.”
1963: 
1964: “Ah, and I should have halfpence, and we’d play at heads-and-tails,”
1965: said Tom, not contemplating the possibility that this recreation might
1966: have fewer charms for his mature age. “I’d divide fair to begin with,
1967: and then we’d see who’d win.”
1968: 
1969: “I’ve got a halfpenny o’ my own,” said Bob, proudly, coming out of the
1970: water and tossing his halfpenny in the air. “Yeads or tails?”
1971: 
1972: “Tails,” said Tom, instantly fired with the desire to win.
1973: 
1974: “It’s yeads,” said Bob, hastily, snatching up the halfpenny as it fell.
1975: 
1976: “It wasn’t,” said Tom, loudly and peremptorily. “You give me the
1977: halfpenny; I’ve won it fair.”
1978: 
1979: “I sha’n’t,” said Bob, holding it tight in his pocket.
1980: 
1981: “Then I’ll make you; see if I don’t,” said Tom.
1982: 
1983: “You can’t make me do nothing, you can’t,” said Bob.
1984: 
1985: “Yes, I can.”
1986: 
1987: “No, you can’t.”
1988: 
1989: “I’m master.”
1990: 
1991: “I don’t care for you.”
1992: 
1993: “But I’ll make you care, you cheat,” said Tom, collaring Bob and
1994: shaking him.
1995: 
1996: “You get out wi’ you,” said Bob, giving Tom a kick.
1997: 
1998: Tom’s blood was thoroughly up: he went at Bob with a lunge and threw
1999: him down, but Bob seized hold and kept it like a cat, and pulled Tom
2000: down after him. They struggled fiercely on the ground for a moment or
2001: two, till Tom, pinning Bob down by the shoulders, thought he had the
2002: mastery.
2003: 
2004: “_You_, say you’ll give me the halfpenny now,” he said, with
2005: difficulty, while he exerted himself to keep the command of Bob’s arms.
2006: 
2007: But at this moment Yap, who had been running on before, returned
2008: barking to the scene of action, and saw a favourable opportunity for
2009: biting Bob’s bare leg not only with inpunity but with honour. The pain
2010: from Yap’s teeth, instead of surprising Bob into a relaxation of his
2011: hold, gave it a fiercer tenacity, and with a new exertion of his force
2012: he pushed Tom backward and got uppermost. But now Yap, who could get no
2013: sufficient purchase before, set his teeth in a new place, so that Bob,
2014: harassed in this way, let go his hold of Tom, and, almost throttling
2015: Yap, flung him into the river. By this time Tom was up again, and
2016: before Bob had quite recovered his balance after the act of swinging
2017: Yap, Tom fell upon him, threw him down, and got his knees firmly on
2018: Bob’s chest.
2019: 
2020: “You give me the halfpenny now,” said Tom.
2021: 
2022: “Take it,” said Bob, sulkily.
2023: 
2024: “No, I sha’n’t take it; you give it me.”
2025: 
2026: Bob took the halfpenny out of his pocket, and threw it away from him on
2027: the ground.
2028: 
2029: Tom loosed his hold, and left Bob to rise.
2030: 
2031: “There the halfpenny lies,” he said. “I don’t want your halfpenny; I
2032: wouldn’t have kept it. But you wanted to cheat; I hate a cheat. I
2033: sha’n’t go along with you any more,” he added, turning round homeward,
2034: not without casting a regret toward the rat-catching and other
2035: pleasures which he must relinquish along with Bob’s society.
2036: 
2037: “You may let it alone, then,” Bob called out after him. “I shall cheat
2038: if I like; there’s no fun i’ playing else; and I know where there’s a
2039: goldfinch’s nest, but I’ll take care _you_ don’t. An’ you’re a nasty
2040: fightin’ turkey-cock, you are——”
2041: 
2042: Tom walked on without looking around, and Yap followed his example, the
2043: cold bath having moderated his passions.
2044: 
2045: “Go along wi’ you, then, wi’ your drowned dog; I wouldn’t own such a
2046: dog—_I_ wouldn’t,” said Bob, getting louder, in a last effort to
2047: sustain his defiance. But Tom was not to be provoked into turning
2048: round, and Bob’s voice began to falter a little as he said,—
2049: 
2050: “An’ I’n gi’en you everything, an’ showed you everything, an’ niver
2051: wanted nothin’ from you. An’ there’s your horn-handed knife, then as
2052: you gi’en me.” Here Bob flung the knife as far as he could after Tom’s
2053: retreating footsteps. But it produced no effect, except the sense in
2054: Bob’s mind that there was a terrible void in his lot, now that knife
2055: was gone.
2056: 
2057: He stood still till Tom had passed through the gate and disappeared
2058: behind the hedge. The knife would do no good on the ground there; it
2059: wouldn’t vex Tom; and pride or resentment was a feeble passion in Bob’s
2060: mind compared with the love of a pocket-knife. His very fingers sent
2061: entreating thrills that he would go and clutch that familiar rough
2062: buck’s-horn handle, which they had so often grasped for mere affection,
2063: as it lay idle in his pocket. And there were two blades, and they had
2064: just been sharpened! What is life without a pocket-knife to him who has
2065: once tasted a higher existence? No; to throw the handle after the
2066: hatchet is a comprehensible act of desperation, but to throw one’s
2067: pocket-knife after an implacable friend is clearly in every sense a
2068: hyperbole, or throwing beyond the mark. So Bob shuffled back to the
2069: spot where the beloved knife lay in the dirt, and felt quite a new
2070: pleasure in clutching it again after the temporary separation, in
2071: opening one blade after the other, and feeling their edge with his
2072: well-hardened thumb. Poor Bob! he was not sensitive on the point of
2073: honour, not a chivalrous character. That fine moral aroma would not
2074: have been thought much of by the public opinion of Kennel Yard, which
2075: was the very focus or heart of Bob’s world, even if it could have made
2076: itself perceptible there; yet, for all that, he was not utterly a sneak
2077: and a thief as our friend Tom had hastily decided.
2078: 
2079: But Tom, you perceive, was rather a Rhadamanthine personage, having
2080: more than the usual share of boy’s justice in him,—the justice that
2081: desires to hurt culprits as much as they deserve to be hurt, and is
2082: troubled with no doubts concerning the exact amount of their deserts.
2083: Maggie saw a cloud on his brow when he came home, which checked her joy
2084: at his coming so much sooner than she had expected, and she dared
2085: hardly speak to him as he stood silently throwing the small
2086: gravel-stones into the mill-dam. It is not pleasant to give up a
2087: rat-catching when you have set your mind on it. But if Tom had told his
2088: strongest feeling at that moment, he would have said, “I’d do just the
2089: same again.” That was his usual mode of viewing his past actions;
2090: whereas Maggie was always wishing she had done something different.

2093: Chapter VII.
2094: 
2095: Enter the Aunts and Uncles
2096: 
2097: The Dodsons were certainly a handsome family, and Mrs Glegg was not the
2098: least handsome of the sisters. As she sat in Mrs Tulliver’s arm-chair,
2099: no impartial observer could have denied that for a woman of fifty she
2100: had a very comely face and figure, though Tom and Maggie considered
2101: their aunt Glegg as the type of ugliness. It is true she despised the
2102: advantages of costume, for though, as she often observed, no woman had
2103: better clothes, it was not her way to wear her new things out before
2104: her old ones. Other women, if they liked, might have their best
2105: thread-lace in every wash; but when Mrs Glegg died, it would be found
2106: that she had better lace laid by in the right-hand drawer of her
2107: wardrobe in the Spotted Chamber than ever Mrs Wooll of St Ogg’s had
2108: bought in her life, although Mrs Wooll wore her lace before it was paid
2109: for. So of her curled fronts: Mrs Glegg had doubtless the glossiest and
2110: crispest brown curls in her drawers, as well as curls in various
2111: degrees of fuzzy laxness; but to look out on the week-day world from
2112: under a crisp and glossy front would be to introduce a most dreamlike
2113: and unpleasant confusion between the sacred and the secular.
2114: Occasionally, indeed, Mrs Glegg wore one of her third-best fronts on a
2115: week-day visit, but not at a sister’s house; especially not at Mrs
2116: Tulliver’s, who, since her marriage, had hurt her sister’s feelings
2117: greatly by wearing her own hair, though, as Mrs Glegg observed to Mrs
2118: Deane, a mother of a family, like Bessy, with a husband always going to
2119: law, might have been expected to know better. But Bessy was always
2120: weak!
2121: 
2122: So if Mrs Glegg’s front to-day was more fuzzy and lax than usual, she
2123: had a design under it: she intended the most pointed and cutting
2124: allusion to Mrs Tulliver’s bunches of blond curls, separated from each
2125: other by a due wave of smoothness on each side of the parting. Mrs
2126: Tulliver had shed tears several times at sister Glegg’s unkindness on
2127: the subject of these unmatronly curls, but the consciousness of looking
2128: the handsomer for them naturally administered support. Mrs Glegg chose
2129: to wear her bonnet in the house to-day,—untied and tilted slightly, of
2130: course—a frequent practice of hers when she was on a visit, and
2131: happened to be in a severe humour: she didn’t know what draughts there
2132: might be in strange houses. For the same reason she wore a small sable
2133: tippet, which reached just to her shoulders, and was very far from
2134: meeting across her well-formed chest, while her long neck was protected
2135: by a _chevaux-de-frise_ of miscellaneous frilling. One would need to be
2136: learned in the fashions of those times to know how far in the rear of
2137: them Mrs Glegg’s slate-coloured silk gown must have been; but from
2138: certain constellations of small yellow spots upon it, and a mouldy odor
2139: about it suggestive of a damp clothes-chest, it was probable that it
2140: belonged to a stratum of garments just old enough to have come recently
2141: into wear.
2142: 
2143: Mrs Glegg held her large gold watch in her hand with the many-doubled
2144: chain round her fingers, and observed to Mrs Tulliver, who had just
2145: returned from a visit to the kitchen, that whatever it might be by
2146: other people’s clocks and watches, it was gone half-past twelve by
2147: hers.
2148: 
2149: “I don’t know what ails sister Pullet,” she continued. “It used to be
2150: the way in our family for one to be as early as another,—I’m sure it
2151: was so in my poor father’s time,—and not for one sister to sit half an
2152: hour before the others came. But if the ways o’ the family are altered,
2153: it sha’n’t be _my_ fault; _I’ll_ never be the one to come into a house
2154: when all the rest are going away. I wonder _at_ sister Deane,—she used
2155: to be more like me. But if you’ll take my advice, Bessy, you’ll put the
2156: dinner forrard a bit, sooner than put it back, because folks are late
2157: as ought to ha’ known better.”
2158: 
2159: “Oh dear, there’s no fear but what they’ll be all here in time,
2160: sister,” said Mrs Tulliver, in her mild-peevish tone. “The dinner won’t
2161: be ready till half-past one. But if it’s long for you to wait, let me
2162: fetch you a cheesecake and a glass o’ wine.”
2163: 
2164: “Well, Bessy!” said Mrs Glegg, with a bitter smile and a scarcely
2165: perceptible toss of her head, “I should ha’ thought you’d known your
2166: own sister better. I never _did_ eat between meals, and I’m not going
2167: to begin. Not but what I hate that nonsense of having your dinner at
2168: half-past one, when you might have it at one. You was never brought up
2169: in that way, Bessy.”
2170: 
2171: “Why, Jane, what can I do? Mr Tulliver doesn’t like his dinner before
2172: two o’clock, but I put it half an hour earlier because o’ you.”
2173: 
2174: “Yes, yes, I know how it is with husbands,—they’re for putting
2175: everything off; they’ll put the dinner off till after tea, if they’ve
2176: got wives as are weak enough to give in to such work; but it’s a pity
2177: for you, Bessy, as you haven’t got more strength o’ mind. It’ll be well
2178: if your children don’t suffer for it. And I hope you’ve not gone and
2179: got a great dinner for us,—going to expense for your sisters, as ’ud
2180: sooner eat a crust o’ dry bread nor help to ruin you with extravagance.
2181: I wonder you don’t take pattern by your sister Deane; she’s far more
2182: sensible. And here you’ve got two children to provide for, and your
2183: husband’s spent your fortin i’ going to law, and’s likely to spend his
2184: own too. A boiled joint, as you could make broth of for the kitchen,”
2185: Mrs Glegg added, in a tone of emphatic protest, “and a plain pudding,
2186: with a spoonful o’ sugar, and no spice, ’ud be far more becoming.”
2187: 
2188: With sister Glegg in this humour, there was a cheerful prospect for the
2189: day. Mrs Tulliver never went the length of quarrelling with her, any
2190: more than a water-fowl that puts out its leg in a deprecating manner
2191: can be said to quarrel with a boy who throws stones. But this point of
2192: the dinner was a tender one, and not at all new, so that Mrs Tulliver
2193: could make the same answer she had often made before.
2194: 
2195: “Mr Tulliver says he always _will_ have a good dinner for his friends
2196: while he can pay for it,” she said; “and he’s a right to do as he likes
2197: in his own house, sister.”
2198: 
2199: “Well, Bessy, _I_ can’t leave your children enough out o’ my savings to
2200: keep ’em from ruin. And you mustn’t look to having any o’ Mr Glegg’s
2201: money, for it’s well if I don’t go first,—he comes of a long-lived
2202: family; and if he was to die and leave me well for my life, he’d tie
2203: all the money up to go back to his own kin.”
2204: 
2205: The sound of wheels while Mrs Glegg was speaking was an interruption
2206: highly welcome to Mrs Tulliver, who hastened out to receive sister
2207: Pullet; it must be sister Pullet, because the sound was that of a
2208: four-wheel.
2209: 
2210: Mrs Glegg tossed her head and looked rather sour about the mouth at the
2211: thought of the “four-wheel.” She had a strong opinion on that subject.
2212: 
2213: Sister Pullet was in tears when the one-horse chaise stopped before Mrs
2214: Tulliver’s door, and it was apparently requisite that she should shed a
2215: few more before getting out; for though her husband and Mrs Tulliver
2216: stood ready to support her, she sat still and shook her head sadly, as
2217: she looked through her tears at the vague distance.
2218: 
2219: “Why, whativer is the matter, sister?” said Mrs Tulliver. She was not
2220: an imaginative woman, but it occurred to her that the large
2221: toilet-glass in sister Pullet’s best bedroom was possibly broken for
2222: the second time.
2223: 
2224: There was no reply but a further shake of the head, as Mrs Pullet
2225: slowly rose and got down from the chaise, not without casting a glance
2226: at Mr Pullet to see that he was guarding her handsome silk dress from
2227: injury. Mr Pullet was a small man, with a high nose, small twinkling
2228: eyes, and thin lips, in a fresh-looking suit of black and a white
2229: cravat, that seemed to have been tied very tight on some higher
2230: principle than that of mere personal ease. He bore about the same
2231: relation to his tall, good-looking wife, with her balloon sleeves,
2232: abundant mantle, and a large befeathered and beribboned bonnet, as a
2233: small fishing-smack bears to a brig with all its sails spread.
2234: 
2235: It is a pathetic sight and a striking example of the complexity
2236: introduced into the emotions by a high state of civilisation, the sight
2237: of a fashionably dressed female in grief. From the sorrow of a
2238: Hottentot to that of a woman in large buckram sleeves, with several
2239: bracelets on each arm, an architectural bonnet, and delicate ribbon
2240: strings, what a long series of gradations! In the enlightened child of
2241: civilisation the abandonment characteristic of grief is checked and
2242: varied in the subtlest manner, so as to present an interesting problem
2243: to the analytic mind. If, with a crushed heart and eyes half blinded by
2244: the mist of tears, she were to walk with a too devious step through a
2245: door-place, she might crush her buckram sleeves too, and the deep
2246: consciousness of this possibility produces a composition of forces by
2247: which she takes a line that just clears the door-post. Perceiving that
2248: the tears are hurrying fast, she unpins her strings and throws them
2249: languidly backward, a touching gesture, indicative, even in the deepest
2250: gloom, of the hope in future dry moments when cap-strings will once
2251: more have a charm. As the tears subside a little, and with her head
2252: leaning backward at the angle that will not injure her bonnet, she
2253: endures that terrible moment when grief, which has made all things else
2254: a weariness, has itself become weary; she looks down pensively at her
2255: bracelets, and adjusts their clasps with that pretty studied fortuity
2256: which would be gratifying to her mind if it were once more in a calm
2257: and healthy state.
2258: 
2259: Mrs Pullet brushed each door-post with great nicety, about the latitude
2260: of her shoulders (at that period a woman was truly ridiculous to an
2261: instructed eye if she did not measure a yard and a half across the
2262: shoulders), and having done that sent the muscles of her face in quest
2263: of fresh tears as she advanced into the parlour where Mrs Glegg was
2264: seated.
2265: 
2266: “Well, sister, you’re late; what’s the matter?” said Mrs Glegg, rather
2267: sharply, as they shook hands.
2268: 
2269: Mrs Pullet sat down, lifting up her mantle carefully behind, before she
2270: answered,—
2271: 
2272: “She’s gone,” unconsciously using an impressive figure of rhetoric.
2273: 
2274: “It isn’t the glass this time, then,” thought Mrs Tulliver.
2275: 
2276: “Died the day before yesterday,” continued Mrs Pullet; “an’ her legs
2277: was as thick as my body,” she added, with deep sadness, after a pause.
2278: “They’d tapped her no end o’ times, and the water—they say you might
2279: ha’ swum in it, if you’d liked.”
2280: 
2281: “Well, Sophy, it’s a mercy she’s gone, then, whoever she may be,” said
2282: Mrs Glegg, with the promptitude and emphasis of a mind naturally clear
2283: and decided; “but I can’t think who you’re talking of, for my part.”
2284: 
2285: “But _I_ know,” said Mrs Pullet, sighing and shaking her head; “and
2286: there isn’t another such a dropsy in the parish. _I_ know as it’s old
2287: Mrs Sutton o’ the Twentylands.”
2288: 
2289: “Well, she’s no kin o’ yours, nor much acquaintance as I’ve ever heared
2290: of,” said Mrs Glegg, who always cried just as much as was proper when
2291: anything happened to her own “kin,” but not on other occasions.
2292: 
2293: “She’s so much acquaintance as I’ve seen her legs when they was like
2294: bladders. And an old lady as had doubled her money over and over again,
2295: and kept it all in her own management to the last, and had her pocket
2296: with her keys in under her pillow constant. There isn’t many old
2297: _par_ish’ners like her, I doubt.”
2298: 
2299: “And they say she’d took as much physic as ’ud fill a wagon,” observed
2300: Mr Pullet.
2301: 
2302: “Ah!” sighed Mrs Pullet, “she’d another complaint ever so many years
2303: before she had the dropsy, and the doctors couldn’t make out what it
2304: was. And she said to me, when I went to see her last Christmas, she
2305: said, ‘Mrs Pullet, if ever you have the dropsy, you’ll think o’ me.’
2306: She _did_ say so,” added Mrs Pullet, beginning to cry bitterly again;
2307: “those were her very words. And she’s to be buried o’ Saturday, and
2308: Pullet’s bid to the funeral.”
2309: 
2310: “Sophy,” said Mrs Glegg, unable any longer to contain her spirit of
2311: rational remonstrance,—“Sophy, I wonder _at_ you, fretting and injuring
2312: your health about people as don’t belong to you. Your poor father never
2313: did so, nor your aunt Frances neither, nor any o’ the family as I ever
2314: heard of. You couldn’t fret no more than this, if we’d heared as our
2315: cousin Abbott had died sudden without making his will.”
2316: 
2317: Mrs Pullet was silent, having to finish her crying, and rather
2318: flattered than indignant at being upbraided for crying too much. It was
2319: not everybody who could afford to cry so much about their neighbours
2320: who had left them nothing; but Mrs Pullet had married a gentleman
2321: farmer, and had leisure and money to carry her crying and everything
2322: else to the highest pitch of respectability.
2323: 
2324: “Mrs Sutton didn’t die without making her will, though,” said Mr
2325: Pullet, with a confused sense that he was saying something to sanction
2326: his wife’s tears; “ours is a rich parish, but they say there’s nobody
2327: else to leave as many thousands behind ’em as Mrs Sutton. And she’s
2328: left no leggicies to speak on,—left it all in a lump to her husband’s
2329: nevvy.”
2330: 
2331: “There wasn’t much good i’ being so rich, then,” said Mrs Glegg, “if
2332: she’d got none but husband’s kin to leave it to. It’s poor work when
2333: that’s all you’ve got to pinch yourself for. Not as I’m one o’ those as
2334: ’ud like to die without leaving more money out at interest than other
2335: folks had reckoned; but it’s a poor tale when it must go out o’ your
2336: own family.”
2337: 
2338: “I’m sure, sister,” said Mrs Pullet, who had recovered sufficiently to
2339: take off her veil and fold it carefully, “it’s a nice sort o’ man as
2340: Mrs Sutton has left her money to, for he’s troubled with the asthmy,
2341: and goes to bed every night at eight o’clock. He told me about it
2342: himself—as free as could be—one Sunday when he came to our church. He
2343: wears a hareskin on his chest, and has a trembling in his talk,—quite a
2344: gentleman sort o’ man. I told him there wasn’t many months in the year
2345: as I wasn’t under the doctor’s hands. And he said, ‘Mrs Pullet, I can
2346: feel for you.’ That was what he said,—the very words. Ah!” sighed Mrs
2347: Pullet, shaking her head at the idea that there were but few who could
2348: enter fully into her experiences in pink mixture and white mixture,
2349: strong stuff in small bottles, and weak stuff in large bottles, damp
2350: boluses at a shilling, and draughts at eighteenpence. “Sister, I may as
2351: well go and take my bonnet off now. Did you see as the cap-box was put
2352: out?” she added, turning to her husband.
2353: 
2354: Mr Pullet, by an unaccountable lapse of memory, had forgotten it, and
2355: hastened out, with a stricken conscience, to remedy the omission.
2356: 
2357: “They’ll bring it upstairs, sister,” said Mrs Tulliver, wishing to go
2358: at once, lest Mrs Glegg should begin to explain her feelings about
2359: Sophy’s being the first Dodson who ever ruined her constitution with
2360: doctor’s stuff.
2361: 
2362: Mrs Tulliver was fond of going upstairs with her sister Pullet, and
2363: looking thoroughly at her cap before she put it on her head, and
2364: discussing millinery in general. This was part of Bessy’s weakness that
2365: stirred Mrs Glegg’s sisterly compassion: Bessy went far too well
2366: dressed, considering; and she was too proud to dress her child in the
2367: good clothing her sister Glegg gave her from the primeval strata of her
2368: wardrobe; it was a sin and a shame to buy anything to dress that child,
2369: if it wasn’t a pair of shoes. In this particular, however, Mrs Glegg
2370: did her sister Bessy some injustice, for Mrs Tulliver had really made
2371: great efforts to induce Maggie to wear a leghorn bonnet and a dyed silk
2372: frock made out of her aunt Glegg’s, but the results had been such that
2373: Mrs Tulliver was obliged to bury them in her maternal bosom; for
2374: Maggie, declaring that the frock smelt of nasty dye, had taken an
2375: opportunity of basting it together with the roast beef the first Sunday
2376: she wore it, and finding this scheme answer, she had subsequently
2377: pumped on the bonnet with its green ribbons, so as to give it a general
2378: resemblance to a sage cheese garnished with withered lettuces. I must
2379: urge in excuse for Maggie, that Tom had laughed at her in the bonnet,
2380: and said she looked like an old Judy. Aunt Pullet, too, made presents
2381: of clothes, but these were always pretty enough to please Maggie as
2382: well as her mother. Of all her sisters, Mrs Tulliver certainly
2383: preferred her sister Pullet, not without a return of preference; but
2384: Mrs Pullet was sorry Bessy had those naughty, awkward children; she
2385: would do the best she could by them, but it was a pity they weren’t as
2386: good and as pretty as sister Deane’s child. Maggie and Tom, on their
2387: part, thought their aunt Pullet tolerable, chiefly because she was not
2388: their aunt Glegg. Tom always declined to go more than once during his
2389: holidays to see either of them. Both his uncles tipped him that once,
2390: of course; but at his aunt Pullet’s there were a great many toads to
2391: pelt in the cellar-area, so that he preferred the visit to her. Maggie
2392: shuddered at the toads, and dreamed of them horribly, but she liked her
2393: uncle Pullet’s musical snuff-box. Still, it was agreed by the sisters,
2394: in Mrs Tulliver’s absence, that the Tulliver blood did not mix well
2395: with the Dodson blood; that, in fact, poor Bessy’s children were
2396: Tullivers, and that Tom, notwithstanding he had the Dodson complexion,
2397: was likely to be as “contrairy” as his father. As for Maggie, she was
2398: the picture of her aunt Moss, Mr Tulliver’s sister,—a large-boned
2399: woman, who had married as poorly as could be; had no china, and had a
2400: husband who had much ado to pay his rent. But when Mrs Pullet was alone
2401: with Mrs Tulliver upstairs, the remarks were naturally to the
2402: disadvantage of Mrs Glegg, and they agreed, in confidence, that there
2403: was no knowing what sort of fright sister Jane would come out next. But
2404: their _tête-à-tête_ was curtailed by the appearance of Mrs Deane with
2405: little Lucy; and Mrs Tulliver had to look on with a silent pang while
2406: Lucy’s blond curls were adjusted. It was quite unaccountable that Mrs
2407: Deane, the thinnest and sallowest of all the Miss Dodsons, should have
2408: had this child, who might have been taken for Mrs Tulliver’s any day.
2409: And Maggie always looked twice as dark as usual when she was by the
2410: side of Lucy.
2411: 
2412: She did to-day, when she and Tom came in from the garden with their
2413: father and their uncle Glegg. Maggie had thrown her bonnet off very
2414: carelessly, and coming in with her hair rough as well as out of curl,
2415: rushed at once to Lucy, who was standing by her mother’s knee.
2416: Certainly the contrast between the cousins was conspicuous, and to
2417: superficial eyes was very much to the disadvantage of Maggie though a
2418: connoisseur might have seen “points” in her which had a higher promise
2419: for maturity than Lucy’s natty completeness. It was like the contrast
2420: between a rough, dark, overgrown puppy and a white kitten. Lucy put up
2421: the neatest little rosebud mouth to be kissed; everything about her was
2422: neat,—her little round neck, with the row of coral beads; her little
2423: straight nose, not at all snubby; her little clear eyebrows, rather
2424: darker than her curls, to match hazel eyes, which looked up with shy
2425: pleasure at Maggie, taller by the head, though scarcely a year older.
2426: Maggie always looked at Lucy with delight.
2427: 
2428: She was fond of fancying a world where the people never got any larger
2429: than children of their own age, and she made the queen of it just like
2430: Lucy, with a little crown on her head, and a little sceptre in her
2431: hand—only the queen was Maggie herself in Lucy’s form.
2432: 
2433: “Oh, Lucy,” she burst out, after kissing her, “you’ll stay with Tom and
2434: me, won’t you? Oh, kiss her, Tom.”
2435: 
2436: Tom, too, had come up to Lucy, but he was not going to kiss her—no; he
2437: came up to her with Maggie, because it seemed easier, on the whole,
2438: than saying, “How do you do?” to all those aunts and uncles. He stood
2439: looking at nothing in particular, with the blushing, awkward air and
2440: semi-smile which are common to shy boys when in company,—very much as
2441: if they had come into the world by mistake, and found it in a degree of
2442: undress that was quite embarrassing.
2443: 
2444: “Heyday!” said aunt Glegg, with loud emphasis. “Do little boys and
2445: gells come into a room without taking notice of their uncles and aunts?
2446: That wasn’t the way when _I_ was a little gell.”
2447: 
2448: “Go and speak to your aunts and uncles, my dears,” said Mrs Tulliver,
2449: looking anxious and melancholy. She wanted to whisper to Maggie a
2450: command to go and have her hair brushed.
2451: 
2452: “Well, and how do you do? And I hope you’re good children, are you?”
2453: said Aunt Glegg, in the same loud, emphatic way, as she took their
2454: hands, hurting them with her large rings, and kissing their cheeks much
2455: against their desire. “Look up, Tom, look up. Boys as go to
2456: boarding-schools should hold their heads up. Look at me now.” Tom
2457: declined that pleasure apparently, for he tried to draw his hand away.
2458: “Put your hair behind your ears, Maggie, and keep your frock on your
2459: shoulder.”
2460: 
2461: Aunt Glegg always spoke to them in this loud, emphatic way, as if she
2462: considered them deaf, or perhaps rather idiotic; it was a means, she
2463: thought, of making them feel that they were accountable creatures, and
2464: might be a salutary check on naughty tendencies. Bessy’s children were
2465: so spoiled—they’d need have somebody to make them feel their duty.
2466: 
2467: “Well, my dears,” said aunt Pullet, in a compassionate voice, “you grow
2468: wonderful fast. I doubt they’ll outgrow their strength,” she added,
2469: looking over their heads, with a melancholy expression, at their
2470: mother. “I think the gell has too much hair. I’d have it thinned and
2471: cut shorter, sister, if I was you; it isn’t good for her health. It’s
2472: that as makes her skin so brown, I shouldn’t wonder. Don’t you think
2473: so, sister Deane?”
2474: 
2475: “I can’t say, I’m sure, sister,” said Mrs Deane, shutting her lips
2476: close again, and looking at Maggie with a critical eye.
2477: 
2478: “No, no,” said Mr Tulliver, “the child’s healthy enough; there’s
2479: nothing ails her. There’s red wheat as well as white, for that matter,
2480: and some like the dark grain best. But it ’ud be as well if Bessy ’ud
2481: have the child’s hair cut, so as it ’ud lie smooth.”
2482: 
2483: A dreadful resolve was gathering in Maggie’s breast, but it was
2484: arrested by the desire to know from her aunt Deane whether she would
2485: leave Lucy behind. Aunt Deane would hardly ever let Lucy come to see
2486: them. After various reasons for refusal, Mrs Deane appealed to Lucy
2487: herself.
2488: 
2489: “You wouldn’t like to stay behind without mother, should you, Lucy?”
2490: 
2491: “Yes, please, mother,” said Lucy, timidly, blushing very pink all over
2492: her little neck.
2493: 
2494: “Well done, Lucy! Let her stay, Mrs Deane, let her stay,” said Mr
2495: Deane, a large but alert-looking man, with a type of _physique_ to be
2496: seen in all ranks of English society,—bald crown, red whiskers, full
2497: forehead, and general solidity without heaviness. You may see noblemen
2498: like Mr Deane, and you may see grocers or day-labourers like him; but
2499: the keenness of his brown eyes was less common than his contour.
2500: 
2501: He held a silver snuff-box very tightly in his hand, and now and then
2502: exchanged a pinch with Mr Tulliver, whose box was only silver-mounted,
2503: so that it was naturally a joke between them that Mr Tulliver wanted to
2504: exchange snuff-boxes also. Mr Deane’s box had been given him by the
2505: superior partners in the firm to which he belonged, at the same time
2506: that they gave him a share in the business, in acknowledgment of his
2507: valuable services as manager. No man was thought more highly of in St
2508: Ogg’s than Mr Deane; and some persons were even of opinion that Miss
2509: Susan Dodson, who was once held to have made the worst match of all the
2510: Dodson sisters, might one day ride in a better carriage, and live in a
2511: better house, even than her sister Pullet. There was no knowing where a
2512: man would stop, who had got his foot into a great mill-owning,
2513: ship-owning business like that of Guest & Co., with a banking concern
2514: attached. And Mrs Deane, as her intimate female friends observed, was
2515: proud and “having” enough; _she_ wouldn’t let her husband stand still
2516: in the world for want of spurring.
2517: 
2518: “Maggie,” said Mrs Tulliver, beckoning Maggie to her, and whispering in
2519: her ear, as soon as this point of Lucy’s staying was settled, “go and
2520: get your hair brushed, do, for shame. I told you not to come in without
2521: going to Martha first, you know I did.”
2522: 
2523: “Tom come out with me,” whispered Maggie, pulling his sleeve as she
2524: passed him; and Tom followed willingly enough.
2525: 
2526: “Come upstairs with me, Tom,” she whispered, when they were outside the
2527: door. “There’s something I want to do before dinner.”
2528: 
2529: “There’s no time to play at anything before dinner,” said Tom, whose
2530: imagination was impatient of any intermediate prospect.
2531: 
2532: “Oh yes, there is time for this; _do_ come, Tom.”
2533: 
2534: Tom followed Maggie upstairs into her mother’s room, and saw her go at
2535: once to a drawer, from which she took out a large pair of scissors.
2536: 
2537: “What are they for, Maggie?” said Tom, feeling his curiosity awakened.
2538: 
2539: Maggie answered by seizing her front locks and cutting them straight
2540: across the middle of her forehead.
2541: 
2542: “Oh, my buttons! Maggie, you’ll catch it!” exclaimed Tom; “you’d better
2543: not cut any more off.”
2544: 
2545: Snip! went the great scissors again while Tom was speaking, and he
2546: couldn’t help feeling it was rather good fun; Maggie would look so
2547: queer.
2548: 
2549: “Here, Tom, cut it behind for me,” said Maggie, excited by her own
2550: daring, and anxious to finish the deed.
2551: 
2552: “You’ll catch it, you know,” said Tom, nodding his head in an
2553: admonitory manner, and hesitating a little as he took the scissors.
2554: 
2555: “Never mind, make haste!” said Maggie, giving a little stamp with her
2556: foot. Her cheeks were quite flushed.
2557: 
2558: The black locks were so thick, nothing could be more tempting to a lad
2559: who had already tasted the forbidden pleasure of cutting the pony’s
2560: mane. I speak to those who know the satisfaction of making a pair of
2561: scissors meet through a duly resisting mass of hair. One delicious
2562: grinding snip, and then another and another, and the hinder-locks fell
2563: heavily on the floor, and Maggie stood cropped in a jagged, uneven
2564: manner, but with a sense of clearness and freedom, as if she had
2565: emerged from a wood into the open plain.
2566: 
2567: “Oh, Maggie,” said Tom, jumping round her, and slapping his knees as he
2568: laughed, “Oh, my buttons! what a queer thing you look! Look at yourself
2569: in the glass; you look like the idiot we throw out nutshells to at
2570: school.”
2571: 
2572: Maggie felt an unexpected pang. She had thought beforehand chiefly at
2573: her own deliverance from her teasing hair and teasing remarks about it,
2574: and something also of the triumph she should have over her mother and
2575: her aunts by this very decided course of action; she didn’t want her
2576: hair to look pretty,—that was out of the question,—she only wanted
2577: people to think her a clever little girl, and not to find fault with
2578: her. But now, when Tom began to laugh at her, and say she was like an
2579: idiot, the affair had quite a new aspect. She looked in the glass, and
2580: still Tom laughed and clapped his hands, and Maggie’s cheeks began to
2581: pale, and her lips to tremble a little.
2582: 
2583: “Oh, Maggie, you’ll have to go down to dinner directly,” said Tom. “Oh,
2584: my!”
2585: 
2586: “Don’t laugh at me, Tom,” said Maggie, in a passionate tone, with an
2587: outburst of angry tears, stamping, and giving him a push.
2588: 
2589: “Now, then, spitfire!” said Tom. “What did you cut it off for, then? I
2590: shall go down: I can smell the dinner going in.”
2591: 
2592: He hurried downstairs and left poor Maggie to that bitter sense of the
2593: irrevocable which was almost an everyday experience of her small soul.
2594: She could see clearly enough, now the thing was done, that it was very
2595: foolish, and that she should have to hear and think more about her hair
2596: than ever; for Maggie rushed to her deeds with passionate impulse, and
2597: then saw not only their consequences, but what would have happened if
2598: they had not been done, with all the detail and exaggerated
2599: circumstance of an active imagination. Tom never did the same sort of
2600: foolish things as Maggie, having a wonderful instinctive discernment of
2601: what would turn to his advantage or disadvantage; and so it happened,
2602: that though he was much more wilful and inflexible than Maggie, his
2603: mother hardly ever called him naughty. But if Tom did make a mistake of
2604: that sort, he espoused it, and stood by it: he “didn’t mind.” If he
2605: broke the lash of his father’s gigwhip by lashing the gate, he couldn’t
2606: help it,—the whip shouldn’t have got caught in the hinge. If Tom
2607: Tulliver whipped a gate, he was convinced, not that the whipping of
2608: gates by all boys was a justifiable act, but that he, Tom Tulliver, was
2609: justifiable in whipping that particular gate, and he wasn’t going to be
2610: sorry. But Maggie, as she stood crying before the glass, felt it
2611: impossible that she should go down to dinner and endure the severe eyes
2612: and severe words of her aunts, while Tom and Lucy, and Martha, who
2613: waited at table, and perhaps her father and her uncles, would laugh at
2614: her; for if Tom had laughed at her, of course every one else would; and
2615: if she had only let her hair alone, she could have sat with Tom and
2616: Lucy, and had the apricot pudding and the custard! What could she do
2617: but sob? She sat as helpless and despairing among her black locks as
2618: Ajax among the slaughtered sheep. Very trivial, perhaps, this anguish
2619: seems to weather-worn mortals who have to think of Christmas bills,
2620: dead loves, and broken friendships; but it was not less bitter to
2621: Maggie—perhaps it was even more bitter—than what we are fond of calling
2622: antithetically the real troubles of mature life. “Ah, my child, you
2623: will have real troubles to fret about by and by,” is the consolation we
2624: have almost all of us had administered to us in our childhood, and have
2625: repeated to other children since we have been grown up. We have all of
2626: us sobbed so piteously, standing with tiny bare legs above our little
2627: socks, when we lost sight of our mother or nurse in some strange place;
2628: but we can no longer recall the poignancy of that moment and weep over
2629: it, as we do over the remembered sufferings of five or ten years ago.
2630: Every one of those keen moments has left its trace, and lives in us
2631: still, but such traces have blent themselves irrecoverably with the
2632: firmer texture of our youth and manhood; and so it comes that we can
2633: look on at the troubles of our children with a smiling disbelief in the
2634: reality of their pain. Is there any one who can recover the experience
2635: of his childhood, not merely with a memory of what he did and what
2636: happened to him, of what he liked and disliked when he was in frock and
2637: trousers, but with an intimate penetration, a revived consciousness of
2638: what he felt then, when it was so long from one Midsummer to another;
2639: what he felt when his school fellows shut him out of their game because
2640: he would pitch the ball wrong out of mere wilfulness; or on a rainy day
2641: in the holidays, when he didn’t know how to amuse himself, and fell
2642: from idleness into mischief, from mischief into defiance, and from
2643: defiance into sulkiness; or when his mother absolutely refused to let
2644: him have a tailed coat that “half,” although every other boy of his age
2645: had gone into tails already? Surely if we could recall that early
2646: bitterness, and the dim guesses, the strangely perspectiveless
2647: conception of life, that gave the bitterness its intensity, we should
2648: not pooh-pooh the griefs of our children.
2649: 
2650: “Miss Maggie, you’re to come down this minute,” said Kezia, entering
2651: the room hurriedly. “Lawks! what have you been a-doing? I never _see_
2652: such a fright!”
2653: 
2654: “Don’t, Kezia,” said Maggie, angrily. “Go away!”
2655: 
2656: “But I tell you you’re to come down, Miss, this minute; your mother
2657: says so,” said Kezia, going up to Maggie and taking her by the hand to
2658: raise her from the floor.
2659: 
2660: “Get away, Kezia; I don’t want any dinner,” said Maggie, resisting
2661: Kezia’s arm. “I sha’n’t come.”
2662: 
2663: “Oh, well, I can’t stay. I’ve got to wait at dinner,” said Kezia, going
2664: out again.
2665: 
2666: “Maggie, you little silly,” said Tom, peeping into the room ten minutes
2667: after, “why don’t you come and have your dinner? There’s lots o’
2668: goodies, and mother says you’re to come. What are you crying for, you
2669: little spooney?”
2670: 
2671: Oh, it was dreadful! Tom was so hard and unconcerned; if _he_ had been
2672: crying on the floor, Maggie would have cried too. And there was the
2673: dinner, so nice; and she was _so_ hungry. It was very bitter.
2674: 
2675: But Tom was not altogether hard. He was not inclined to cry, and did
2676: not feel that Maggie’s grief spoiled his prospect of the sweets; but he
2677: went and put his head near her, and said in a lower, comforting tone,—
2678: 
2679: “Won’t you come, then, Magsie? Shall I bring you a bit o’ pudding when
2680: I’ve had mine, and a custard and things?”
2681: 
2682: “Ye-e-es,” said Maggie, beginning to feel life a little more tolerable.
2683: 
2684: “Very well,” said Tom, going away. But he turned again at the door and
2685: said, “But you’d better come, you know. There’s the dessert,—nuts, you
2686: know, and cowslip wine.”
2687: 
2688: Maggie’s tears had ceased, and she looked reflective as Tom left her.
2689: His good nature had taken off the keenest edge of her suffering, and
2690: nuts with cowslip wine began to assert their legitimate influence.
2691: 
2692: Slowly she rose from amongst her scattered locks, and slowly she made
2693: her way downstairs. Then she stood leaning with one shoulder against
2694: the frame of the dining-parlour door, peeping in when it was ajar. She
2695: saw Tom and Lucy with an empty chair between them, and there were the
2696: custards on a side-table; it was too much. She slipped in and went
2697: toward the empty chair. But she had no sooner sat down than she
2698: repented and wished herself back again.
2699: 
2700: Mrs Tulliver gave a little scream as she saw her, and felt such a
2701: “turn” that she dropped the large gravy-spoon into the dish, with the
2702: most serious results to the table-cloth. For Kezia had not betrayed the
2703: reason of Maggie’s refusal to come down, not liking to give her
2704: mistress a shock in the moment of carving, and Mrs Tulliver thought
2705: there was nothing worse in question than a fit of perverseness, which
2706: was inflicting its own punishment by depriving Maggie of half her
2707: dinner.
2708: 
2709: Mrs Tulliver’s scream made all eyes turn towards the same point as her
2710: own, and Maggie’s cheeks and ears began to burn, while uncle Glegg, a
2711: kind-looking, white-haired old gentleman, said,—
2712: 
2713: “Heyday! what little gell’s this? Why, I don’t know her. Is it some
2714: little gell you’ve picked up in the road, Kezia?”
2715: 
2716: “Why, she’s gone and cut her hair herself,” said Mr Tulliver in an
2717: undertone to Mr Deane, laughing with much enjoyment. “Did you ever know
2718: such a little hussy as it is?”
2719: 
2720: “Why, little miss, you’ve made yourself look very funny,” said Uncle
2721: Pullet, and perhaps he never in his life made an observation which was
2722: felt to be so lacerating.
2723: 
2724: “Fie, for shame!” said aunt Glegg, in her loudest, severest tone of
2725: reproof. “Little gells as cut their own hair should be whipped and fed
2726: on bread and water,—not come and sit down with their aunts and uncles.”
2727: 
2728: “Ay, ay,” said uncle Glegg, meaning to give a playful turn to this
2729: denunciation, “she must be sent to jail, I think, and they’ll cut the
2730: rest of her hair off there, and make it all even.”
2731: 
2732: “She’s more like a gypsy nor ever,” said aunt Pullet, in a pitying
2733: tone; “it’s very bad luck, sister, as the gell should be so brown; the
2734: boy’s fair enough. I doubt it’ll stand in her way i’ life to be so
2735: brown.”
2736: 
2737: “She’s a naughty child, as’ll break her mother’s heart,” said Mrs
2738: Tulliver, with the tears in her eyes.
2739: 
2740: Maggie seemed to be listening to a chorus of reproach and derision. Her
2741: first flush came from anger, which gave her a transient power of
2742: defiance, and Tom thought she was braving it out, supported by the
2743: recent appearance of the pudding and custard. Under this impression, he
2744: whispered, “Oh, my! Maggie, I told you you’d catch it.” He meant to be
2745: friendly, but Maggie felt convinced that Tom was rejoicing in her
2746: ignominy. Her feeble power of defiance left her in an instant, her
2747: heart swelled, and getting up from her chair, she ran to her father,
2748: hid her face on his shoulder, and burst out into loud sobbing.
2749: 
2750: “Come, come, my wench,” said her father, soothingly, putting his arm
2751: round her, “never mind; you was i’ the right to cut it off if it
2752: plagued you; give over crying; father’ll take your part.”
2753: 
2754: Delicious words of tenderness! Maggie never forgot any of these moments
2755: when her father “took her part”; she kept them in her heart, and
2756: thought of them long years after, when every one else said that her
2757: father had done very ill by his children.
2758: 
2759: “How your husband does spoil that child, Bessy!” said Mrs Glegg, in a
2760: loud “aside,” to Mrs Tulliver. “It’ll be the ruin of her, if you don’t
2761: take care. _My_ father never brought his children up so, else we should
2762: ha’ been a different sort o’ family to what we are.”
2763: 
2764: Mrs Tulliver’s domestic sorrows seemed at this moment to have reached
2765: the point at which insensibility begins. She took no notice of her
2766: sister’s remark, but threw back her capstrings and dispensed the
2767: pudding, in mute resignation.
2768: 
2769: With the dessert there came entire deliverance for Maggie, for the
2770: children were told they might have their nuts and wine in the
2771: summer-house, since the day was so mild; and they scampered out among
2772: the budding bushes of the garden with the alacrity of small animals
2773: getting from under a burning glass.
2774: 
2775: Mrs Tulliver had her special reason for this permission: now the dinner
2776: was despatched, and every one’s mind disengaged, it was the right
2777: moment to communicate Mr Tulliver’s intention concerning Tom, and it
2778: would be as well for Tom himself to be absent. The children were used
2779: to hear themselves talked of as freely as if they were birds, and could
2780: understand nothing, however they might stretch their necks and listen;
2781: but on this occasion Mrs Tulliver manifested an unusual discretion,
2782: because she had recently had evidence that the going to school to a
2783: clergyman was a sore point with Tom, who looked at it as very much on a
2784: par with going to school to a constable. Mrs Tulliver had a sighing
2785: sense that her husband would do as he liked, whatever sister Glegg
2786: said, or sister Pullet either; but at least they would not be able to
2787: say, if the thing turned out ill, that Bessy had fallen in with her
2788: husband’s folly without letting her own friends know a word about it.
2789: 
2790: “Mr Tulliver,” she said, interrupting her husband in his talk with Mr
2791: Deane, “it’s time now to tell the children’s aunts and uncles what
2792: you’re thinking of doing with Tom, isn’t it?”
2793: 
2794: “Very well,” said Mr Tulliver, rather sharply, “I’ve no objections to
2795: tell anybody what I mean to do with him. I’ve settled,” he added,
2796: looking toward Mr Glegg and Mr Deane,—“I’ve settled to send him to a Mr
2797: Stelling, a parson, down at King’s Lorton, there,—an uncommon clever
2798: fellow, I understand, as’ll put him up to most things.”
2799: 
2800: There was a rustling demonstration of surprise in the company, such as
2801: you may have observed in a country congregation when they hear an
2802: allusion to their week-day affairs from the pulpit. It was equally
2803: astonishing to the aunts and uncles to find a parson introduced into Mr
2804: Tulliver’s family arrangements. As for uncle Pullet, he could hardly
2805: have been more thoroughly obfuscated if Mr Tulliver had said that he
2806: was going to send Tom to the Lord Chancellor; for uncle Pullet belonged
2807: to that extinct class of British yeoman who, dressed in good
2808: broadcloth, paid high rates and taxes, went to church, and ate a
2809: particularly good dinner on Sunday, without dreaming that the British
2810: constitution in Church and State had a traceable origin any more than
2811: the solar system and the fixed stars.
2812: 
2813: It is melancholy, but true, that Mr Pullet had the most confused idea
2814: of a bishop as a sort of a baronet, who might or might not be a
2815: clergyman; and as the rector of his own parish was a man of high family
2816: and fortune, the idea that a clergyman could be a schoolmaster was too
2817: remote from Mr Pullet’s experience to be readily conceivable. I know it
2818: is difficult for people in these instructed times to believe in uncle
2819: Pullet’s ignorance; but let them reflect on the remarkable results of a
2820: great natural faculty under favouring circumstances. And uncle Pullet
2821: had a great natural faculty for ignorance. He was the first to give
2822: utterance to his astonishment.
2823: 
2824: “Why, what can you be going to send him to a parson for?” he said, with
2825: an amazed twinkling in his eyes, looking at Mr Glegg and Mr Deane, to
2826: see if they showed any signs of comprehension.
2827: 
2828: “Why, because the parsons are the best schoolmasters, by what I can
2829: make out,” said poor Mr Tulliver, who, in the maze of this puzzling
2830: world, laid hold of any clue with great readiness and tenacity. “Jacobs
2831: at th’ academy’s no parson, and he’s done very bad by the boy; and I
2832: made up my mind, if I send him to school again, it should be to
2833: somebody different to Jacobs. And this Mr Stelling, by what I can make
2834: out, is the sort o’ man I want. And I mean my boy to go to him at
2835: Midsummer,” he concluded, in a tone of decision, tapping his snuff-box
2836: and taking a pinch.
2837: 
2838: “You’ll have to pay a swinging half-yearly bill, then, eh, Tulliver?
2839: The clergymen have highish notions, in general,” said Mr Deane, taking
2840: snuff vigorously, as he always did when wishing to maintain a neutral
2841: position.
2842: 
2843: “What! do you think the parson’ll teach him to know a good sample o’
2844: wheat when he sees it, neighbour Tulliver?” said Mr Glegg, who was fond
2845: of his jest, and having retired from business, felt that it was not
2846: only allowable but becoming in him to take a playful view of things.
2847: 
2848: “Why, you see, I’ve got a plan i’ my head about Tom,” said Mr Tulliver,
2849: pausing after that statement and lifting up his glass.
2850: 
2851: “Well, if I may be allowed to speak, and it’s seldom as I am,” said Mrs
2852: Glegg, with a tone of bitter meaning, “I should like to know what good
2853: is to come to the boy by bringin’ him up above his fortin.”
2854: 
2855: “Why,” said Mr Tulliver, not looking at Mrs Glegg, but at the male part
2856: of his audience, “you see, I’ve made up my mind not to bring Tom up to
2857: my own business. I’ve had my thoughts about it all along, and I made up
2858: my mind by what I saw with Garnett and _his_ son. I mean to put him to
2859: some business as he can go into without capital, and I want to give him
2860: an eddication as he’ll be even wi’ the lawyers and folks, and put me up
2861: to a notion now an’ then.”
2862: 
2863: Mrs Glegg emitted a long sort of guttural sound with closed lips, that
2864: smiled in mingled pity and scorn.
2865: 
2866: “It ’ud be a fine deal better for some people,” she said, after that
2867: introductory note, “if they’d let the lawyers alone.”
2868: 
2869: “Is he at the head of a grammar school, then, this clergyman, such as
2870: that at Market Bewley?” said Mr Deane.
2871: 
2872: “No, nothing of that,” said Mr Tulliver. “He won’t take more than two
2873: or three pupils, and so he’ll have the more time to attend to ’em, you
2874: know.”
2875: 
2876: “Ah, and get his eddication done the sooner; they can’t learn much at a
2877: time when there’s so many of ’em,” said uncle Pullet, feeling that he
2878: was getting quite an insight into this difficult matter.
2879: 
2880: “But he’ll want the more pay, I doubt,” said Mr Glegg.
2881: 
2882: “Ay, ay, a cool hundred a year, that’s all,” said Mr Tulliver, with
2883: some pride at his own spirited course. “But then, you know, it’s an
2884: investment; Tom’s eddication ’ull be so much capital to him.”
2885: 
2886: “Ay, there’s something in that,” said Mr Glegg. “Well well, neighbour
2887: Tulliver, you may be right, you may be right:
2888: 
2889:      ‘When land is gone and money’s spent,
2890:      Then learning is most excellent.’
2891: 
2892: 
2893: “I remember seeing those two lines wrote on a window at Buxton. But us
2894: that have got no learning had better keep our money, eh, neighbour
2895: Pullet?” Mr Glegg rubbed his knees, and looked very pleasant.
2896: 
2897: “Mr Glegg, I wonder _at_ you,” said his wife. “It’s very unbecoming in
2898: a man o’ your age and belongings.”
2899: 
2900: “What’s unbecoming, Mrs G.?” said Mr Glegg, winking pleasantly at the
2901: company. “My new blue coat as I’ve got on?”
2902: 
2903: “I pity your weakness, Mr Glegg. I say it’s unbecoming to be making a
2904: joke when you see your own kin going headlongs to ruin.”
2905: 
2906: “If you mean me by that,” said Mr Tulliver, considerably nettled, “you
2907: needn’t trouble yourself to fret about me. I can manage my own affairs
2908: without troubling other folks.”
2909: 
2910: “Bless me!” said Mr Deane, judiciously introducing a new idea, “why,
2911: now I come to think of it, somebody said Wakem was going to send _his_
2912: son—the deformed lad—to a clergyman, didn’t they, Susan?” (appealing to
2913: his wife).
2914: 
2915: “I can give no account of it, I’m sure,” said Mrs Deane, closing her
2916: lips very tightly again. Mrs Deane was not a woman to take part in a
2917: scene where missiles were flying.
2918: 
2919: “Well,” said Mr Tulliver, speaking all the more cheerfully, that Mrs
2920: Glegg might see he didn’t mind her, “if Wakem thinks o’ sending his son
2921: to a clergyman, depend on it I shall make no mistake i’ sending Tom to
2922: one. Wakem’s as big a scoundrel as Old Harry ever made, but he knows
2923: the length of every man’s foot he’s got to deal with. Ay, ay, tell me
2924: who’s Wakem’s butcher, and I’ll tell you where to get your meat.”
2925: 
2926: “But lawyer Wakem’s son’s got a hump-back,” said Mrs Pullet, who felt
2927: as if the whole business had a funereal aspect; “it’s more nat’ral to
2928: send _him_ to a clergyman.”
2929: 
2930: “Yes,” said Mr Glegg, interpreting Mrs Pullet’s observation with
2931: erroneous plausibility, “you must consider that, neighbour Tulliver;
2932: Wakem’s son isn’t likely to follow any business. Wakem ’ull make a
2933: gentleman of him, poor fellow.”
2934: 
2935: “Mr Glegg,” said Mrs G., in a tone which implied that her indignation
2936: would fizz and ooze a little, though she was determined to keep it
2937: corked up, “you’d far better hold your tongue. Mr Tulliver doesn’t want
2938: to know your opinion nor mine either. There’s folks in the world as
2939: know better than everybody else.”
2940: 
2941: “Why, I should think that’s you, if we’re to trust your own tale,” said
2942: Mr Tulliver, beginning to boil up again.
2943: 
2944: “Oh, _I_ say nothing,” said Mrs Glegg, sarcastically. “My advice has
2945: never been asked, and I don’t give it.”
2946: 
2947: “It’ll be the first time, then,” said Mr Tulliver. “It’s the only thing
2948: you’re over-ready at giving.”
2949: 
2950: “I’ve been over-ready at lending, then, if I haven’t been over-ready at
2951: giving,” said Mrs Glegg. “There’s folks I’ve lent money to, as perhaps
2952: I shall repent o’ lending money to kin.”
2953: 
2954: “Come, come, come,” said Mr Glegg, soothingly. But Mr Tulliver was not
2955: to be hindered of his retort.
2956: 
2957: “You’ve got a bond for it, I reckon,” he said; “and you’ve had your
2958: five per cent, kin or no kin.”
2959: 
2960: “Sister,” said Mrs Tulliver, pleadingly, “drink your wine, and let me
2961: give you some almonds and raisins.”
2962: 
2963: “Bessy, I’m sorry for you,” said Mrs Glegg, very much with the feeling
2964: of a cur that seizes the opportunity of diverting his bark toward the
2965: man who carries no stick. “It’s poor work talking o’ almonds and
2966: raisins.”
2967: 
2968: “Lors, sister Glegg, don’t be so quarrelsome,” said Mrs Pullet,
2969: beginning to cry a little. “You may be struck with a fit, getting so
2970: red in the face after dinner, and we are but just out o’ mourning, all
2971: of us,—and all wi’ gowns craped alike and just put by; it’s very bad
2972: among sisters.”
2973: 
2974: “I should think it _is_ bad,” said Mrs Glegg. “Things are come to a
2975: fine pass when one sister invites the other to her house o’ purpose to
2976: quarrel with her and abuse her.”
2977: 
2978: “Softly, softly, Jane; be reasonable, be reasonable,” said Mr Glegg.
2979: 
2980: But while he was speaking, Mr Tulliver, who had by no means said enough
2981: to satisfy his anger, burst out again.
2982: 
2983: “Who wants to quarrel with you?” he said. “It’s you as can’t let people
2984: alone, but must be gnawing at ’em forever. _I_ should never want to
2985: quarrel with any woman if she kept her place.”
2986: 
2987: “My place, indeed!” said Mrs Glegg, getting rather more shrill.
2988: “There’s your betters, Mr Tulliver, as are dead and in their grave,
2989: treated me with a different sort o’ respect to what you do; _though_
2990: I’ve got a husband as’ll sit by and see me abused by them as ’ud never
2991: ha’ had the chance if there hadn’t been them in our family as married
2992: worse than they might ha’ done.”
2993: 
2994: “If you talk o’ that,” said Mr Tulliver, “my family’s as good as yours,
2995: and better, for it hasn’t got a damned ill-tempered woman in it!”
2996: 
2997: “Well,” said Mrs Glegg, rising from her chair, “I don’t know whether
2998: you think it’s a fine thing to sit by and hear me swore at, Mr Glegg;
2999: but I’m not going to stay a minute longer in this house. You can stay
3000: behind, and come home with the gig, and I’ll walk home.”
3001: 
3002: “Dear heart, dear heart!” said Mr Glegg in a melancholy tone, as he
3003: followed his wife out of the room.
3004: 
3005: “Mr Tulliver, how could you talk so?” said Mrs Tulliver, with the tears
3006: in her eyes.
3007: 
3008: “Let her go,” said Mr Tulliver, too hot to be damped by any amount of
3009: tears. “Let her go, and the sooner the better; she won’t be trying to
3010: domineer over _me_ again in a hurry.”
3011: 
3012: “Sister Pullet,” said Mrs Tulliver, helplessly, “do you think it ’ud be
3013: any use for you to go after her and try to pacify her?”
3014: 
3015: “Better not, better not,” said Mr Deane. “You’ll make it up another
3016: day.”
3017: 
3018: “Then, sisters, shall we go and look at the children?” said Mrs
3019: Tulliver, drying her eyes.
3020: 
3021: No proposition could have been more seasonable. Mr Tulliver felt very
3022: much as if the air had been cleared of obtrusive flies now the women
3023: were out of the room. There were few things he liked better than a chat
3024: with Mr Deane, whose close application to business allowed the pleasure
3025: very rarely. Mr Deane, he considered, was the “knowingest” man of his
3026: acquaintance, and he had besides a ready causticity of tongue that made
3027: an agreeable supplement to Mr Tulliver’s own tendency that way, which
3028: had remained in rather an inarticulate condition. And now the women
3029: were gone, they could carry on their serious talk without frivolous
3030: interruption. They could exchange their views concerning the Duke of
3031: Wellington, whose conduct in the Catholic Question had thrown such an
3032: entirely new light on his character; and speak slightingly of his
3033: conduct at the battle of Waterloo, which he would never have won if
3034: there hadn’t been a great many Englishmen at his back, not to speak of
3035: Blucher and the Prussians, who, as Mr Tulliver had heard from a person
3036: of particular knowledge in that matter, had come up in the very nick of
3037: time; though here there was a slight dissidence, Mr Deane remarking
3038: that he was not disposed to give much credit to the Prussians,—the
3039: build of their vessels, together with the unsatisfactory character of
3040: transactions in Dantzic beer, inclining him to form rather a low view
3041: of Prussian pluck generally. Rather beaten on this ground, Mr Tulliver
3042: proceeded to express his fears that the country could never again be
3043: what it used to be; but Mr Deane, attached to a firm of which the
3044: returns were on the increase, naturally took a more lively view of the
3045: present, and had some details to give concerning the state of the
3046: imports, especially in hides and spelter, which soothed Mr Tulliver’s
3047: imagination by throwing into more distant perspective the period when
3048: the country would become utterly the prey of Papists and Radicals, and
3049: there would be no more chance for honest men.
3050: 
3051: Uncle Pullet sat by and listened with twinkling eyes to these high
3052: matters. He didn’t understand politics himself,—thought they were a
3053: natural gift,—but by what he could make out, this Duke of Wellington
3054: was no better than he should be.
3055: 
3056: 
3057: Chapter VIII.
3058: 
3059: Mr Tulliver Shows His Weaker Side
3060: 
3061: “Suppose sister Glegg should call her money in; it ’ud be very awkward
3062: for you to have to raise five hundred pounds now,” said Mrs Tulliver to
3063: her husband that evening, as she took a plaintive review of the day.
3064: 
3065: Mrs Tulliver had lived thirteen years with her husband, yet she
3066: retained in all the freshness of her early married life a facility of
3067: saying things which drove him in the opposite direction to the one she
3068: desired. Some minds are wonderful for keeping their bloom in this way,
3069: as a patriarchal goldfish apparently retains to the last its youthful
3070: illusion that it can swim in a straight line beyond the encircling
3071: glass. Mrs Tulliver was an amiable fish of this kind, and after running
3072: her head against the same resisting medium for thirteen years would go
3073: at it again to-day with undulled alacrity.
3074: 
3075: This observation of hers tended directly to convince Mr Tulliver that
3076: it would not be at all awkward for him to raise five hundred pounds;
3077: and when Mrs Tulliver became rather pressing to know _how_ he would
3078: raise it without mortgaging the mill and the house which he had said he
3079: never _would_ mortgage, since nowadays people were none so ready to
3080: lend money without security, Mr Tulliver, getting warm, declared that
3081: Mrs Glegg might do as she liked about calling in her money, he should
3082: pay it in whether or not. He was not going to be beholden to his wife’s
3083: sisters. When a man had married into a family where there was a whole
3084: litter of women, he might have plenty to put up with if he chose. But
3085: Mr Tulliver did _not_ choose.
3086: 
3087: Mrs Tulliver cried a little in a trickling, quiet way as she put on her
3088: nightcap; but presently sank into a comfortable sleep, lulled by the
3089: thought that she would talk everything over with her sister Pullet
3090: to-morrow, when she was to take the children to Garum Firs to tea. Not
3091: that she looked forward to any distinct issue from that talk; but it
3092: seemed impossible that past events should be so obstinate as to remain
3093: unmodified when they were complained against.
3094: 
3095: Her husband lay awake rather longer, for he too was thinking of a visit
3096: he would pay on the morrow; and his ideas on the subject were not of so
3097: vague and soothing a kind as those of his amiable partner.
3098: 
3099: Mr Tulliver, when under the influence of a strong feeling, had a
3100: promptitude in action that may seem inconsistent with that painful
3101: sense of the complicated, puzzling nature of human affairs under which
3102: his more dispassionate deliberations were conducted; but it is really
3103: not improbable that there was a direct relation between these
3104: apparently contradictory phenomena, since I have observed that for
3105: getting a strong impression that a skein is tangled there is nothing
3106: like snatching hastily at a single thread. It was owing to this
3107: promptitude that Mr Tulliver was on horseback soon after dinner the
3108: next day (he was not dyspeptic) on his way to Basset to see his sister
3109: Moss and her husband. For having made up his mind irrevocably that he
3110: would pay Mrs Glegg her loan of five hundred pounds, it naturally
3111: occurred to him that he had a promissory note for three hundred pounds
3112: lent to his brother-in-law Moss; and if the said brother-in-law could
3113: manage to pay in the money within a given time, it would go far to
3114: lessen the fallacious air of inconvenience which Mr Tulliver’s spirited
3115: step might have worn in the eyes of weak people who require to know
3116: precisely _how_ a thing is to be done before they are strongly
3117: confident that it will be easy.
3118: 
3119: For Mr Tulliver was in a position neither new nor striking, but, like
3120: other everyday things, sure to have a cumulative effect that will be
3121: felt in the long run: he was held to be a much more substantial man
3122: than he really was. And as we are all apt to believe what the world
3123: believes about us, it was his habit to think of failure and ruin with
3124: the same sort of remote pity with which a spare, long-necked man hears
3125: that his plethoric short-necked neighbour is stricken with apoplexy. He
3126: had been always used to hear pleasant jokes about his advantages as a
3127: man who worked his own mill, and owned a pretty bit of land; and these
3128: jokes naturally kept up his sense that he was a man of considerable
3129: substance. They gave a pleasant flavour to his glass on a market-day,
3130: and if it had not been for the recurrence of half-yearly payments, Mr
3131: Tulliver would really have forgotten that there was a mortgage of two
3132: thousand pounds on his very desirable freehold. That was not altogether
3133: his own fault, since one of the thousand pounds was his sister’s
3134: fortune, which he had to pay on her marriage; and a man who has
3135: neighbours that _will_ go to law with him is not likely to pay off his
3136: mortgages, especially if he enjoys the good opinion of acquaintances
3137: who want to borrow a hundred pounds on security too lofty to be
3138: represented by parchment. Our friend Mr Tulliver had a good-natured
3139: fibre in him, and did not like to give harsh refusals even to his
3140: sister, who had not only come in to the world in that superfluous way
3141: characteristic of sisters, creating a necessity for mortgages, but had
3142: quite thrown herself away in marriage, and had crowned her mistakes by
3143: having an eighth baby. On this point Mr Tulliver was conscious of being
3144: a little weak; but he apologised to himself by saying that poor Gritty
3145: had been a good-looking wench before she married Moss; he would
3146: sometimes say this even with a slight tremulousness in his voice. But
3147: this morning he was in a mood more becoming a man of business, and in
3148: the course of his ride along the Basset lanes, with their deep
3149: ruts,—lying so far away from a market-town that the labour of drawing
3150: produce and manure was enough to take away the best part of the profits
3151: on such poor land as that parish was made of,—he got up a due amount of
3152: irritation against Moss as a man without capital, who, if murrain and
3153: blight were abroad, was sure to have his share of them, and who, the
3154: more you tried to help him out of the mud, would sink the further in.
3155: It would do him good rather than harm, now, if he were obliged to raise
3156: this three hundred pounds; it would make him look about him better, and
3157: not act so foolishly about his wool this year as he did the last; in
3158: fact, Mr Tulliver had been too easy with his brother-in-law, and
3159: because he had let the interest run on for two years, Moss was likely
3160: enough to think that he should never be troubled about the principal.
3161: But Mr Tulliver was determined not to encourage such shuffling people
3162: any longer; and a ride along the Basset lanes was not likely to
3163: enervate a man’s resolution by softening his temper. The deep-trodden
3164: hoof-marks, made in the muddiest days of winter, gave him a shake now
3165: and then which suggested a rash but stimulating snarl at the father of
3166: lawyers, who, whether by means of his hoof or otherwise, had doubtless
3167: something to do with this state of the roads; and the abundance of foul
3168: land and neglected fences that met his eye, though they made no part of
3169: his brother Moss’s farm, strongly contributed to his dissatisfaction
3170: with that unlucky agriculturist. If this wasn’t Moss’s fallow, it might
3171: have been; Basset was all alike; it was a beggarly parish, in Mr
3172: Tulliver’s opinion, and his opinion was certainly not groundless.
3173: Basset had a poor soil, poor roads, a poor non-resident landlord, a
3174: poor non-resident vicar, and rather less than half a curate, also poor.
3175: If any one strongly impressed with the power of the human mind to
3176: triumph over circumstances will contend that the parishioners of Basset
3177: might nevertheless have been a very superior class of people, I have
3178: nothing to urge against that abstract proposition; I only know that, in
3179: point of fact, the Basset mind was in strict keeping with its
3180: circumstances. The muddy lanes, green or clayey, that seemed to the
3181: unaccustomed eye to lead nowhere but into each other, did really lead,
3182: with patience, to a distant high-road; but there were many feet in
3183: Basset which they led more frequently to a centre of dissipation,
3184: spoken of formerly as the “Markis o’ Granby,” but among intimates as
3185: “Dickison’s.” A large low room with a sanded floor; a cold scent of
3186: tobacco, modified by undetected beer-dregs; Mr Dickison leaning against
3187: the door-post with a melancholy pimpled face, looking as irrelevant to
3188: the daylight as a last night’s guttered candle,—all this may not seem a
3189: very seductive form of temptation; but the majority of men in Basset
3190: found it fatally alluring when encountered on their road toward four
3191: o’clock on a wintry afternoon; and if any wife in Basset wished to
3192: indicate that her husband was not a pleasure-seeking man, she could
3193: hardly do it more emphatically than by saying that he didn’t spend a
3194: shilling at Dickison’s from one Whitsuntide to another. Mrs Moss had
3195: said so of _her_ husband more than once, when her brother was in a mood
3196: to find fault with him, as he certainly was to-day. And nothing could
3197: be less pacifying to Mr Tulliver than the behaviour of the farmyard
3198: gate, which he no sooner attempted to push open with his riding-stick
3199: than it acted as gates without the upper hinge are known to do, to the
3200: peril of shins, whether equine or human. He was about to get down and
3201: lead his horse through the damp dirt of the hollow farmyard, shadowed
3202: drearily by the large half-timbered buildings, up to the long line of
3203: tumble-down dwelling-houses standing on a raised causeway; but the
3204: timely appearance of a cowboy saved him that frustration of a plan he
3205: had determined on,—namely, not to get down from his horse during this
3206: visit. If a man means to be hard, let him keep in his saddle and speak
3207: from that height, above the level of pleading eyes, and with the
3208: command of a distant horizon. Mrs Moss heard the sound of the horse’s
3209: feet, and, when her brother rode up, was already outside the kitchen
3210: door, with a half-weary smile on her face, and a black-eyed baby in her
3211: arms. Mrs Moss’s face bore a faded resemblance to her brother’s; baby’s
3212: little fat hand, pressed against her cheek, seemed to show more
3213: strikingly that the cheek was faded.
3214: 
3215: “Brother, I’m glad to see you,” she said, in an affectionate tone. “I
3216: didn’t look for you to-day. How do you do?”
3217: 
3218: “Oh, pretty well, Mrs Moss, pretty well,” answered the brother, with
3219: cool deliberation, as if it were rather too forward of her to ask that
3220: question. She knew at once that her brother was not in a good humour;
3221: he never called her Mrs Moss except when he was angry, and when they
3222: were in company. But she thought it was in the order of nature that
3223: people who were poorly off should be snubbed. Mrs Moss did not take her
3224: stand on the equality of the human race; she was a patient, prolific,
3225: loving-hearted woman.
3226: 
3227: “Your husband isn’t in the house, I suppose?” added Mr Tulliver after a
3228: grave pause, during which four children had run out, like chickens
3229: whose mother has been suddenly in eclipse behind the hen-coop.
3230: 
3231: “No,” said Mrs Moss, “but he’s only in the potato-field yonders.
3232: Georgy, run to the Far Close in a minute, and tell father your uncle’s
3233: come. You’ll get down, brother, won’t you, and take something?”
3234: 
3235: “No, no; I can’t get down. I must be going home again directly,” said
3236: Mr Tulliver, looking at the distance.
3237: 
3238: “And how’s Mrs Tulliver and the children?” said Mrs Moss, humbly, not
3239: daring to press her invitation.
3240: 
3241: “Oh, pretty well. Tom’s going to a new school at Midsummer,—a deal of
3242: expense to me. It’s bad work for me, lying out o’ my money.”
3243: 
3244: “I wish you’d be so good as let the children come and see their cousins
3245: some day. My little uns want to see their cousin Maggie so as never
3246: was. And me her godmother, and so fond of her; there’s nobody ’ud make
3247: a bigger fuss with her, according to what they’ve got. And I know she
3248: likes to come, for she’s a loving child, and how quick and clever she
3249: is, to be sure!”
3250: 
3251: If Mrs Moss had been one of the most astute women in the world, instead
3252: of being one of the simplest, she could have thought of nothing more
3253: likely to propitiate her brother than this praise of Maggie. He seldom
3254: found any one volunteering praise of “the little wench”; it was usually
3255: left entirely to himself to insist on her merits. But Maggie always
3256: appeared in the most amiable light at her aunt Moss’s; it was her
3257: Alsatia, where she was out of the reach of law,—if she upset anything,
3258: dirtied her shoes, or tore her frock, these things were matters of
3259: course at her aunt Moss’s. In spite of himself, Mr Tulliver’s eyes got
3260: milder, and he did not look away from his sister as he said,—
3261: 
3262: “Ay; she’s fonder o’ you than o’ the other aunts, I think. She takes
3263: after our family: not a bit of her mother’s in her.”
3264: 
3265: “Moss says she’s just like what I used to be,” said Mrs Moss, “though I
3266: was never so quick and fond o’ the books. But I think my Lizzy’s like
3267: her; _she’s_ sharp. Come here, Lizzy, my dear, and let your uncle see
3268: you; he hardly knows you, you grow so fast.”
3269: 
3270: Lizzy, a black-eyed child of seven, looked very shy when her mother
3271: drew her forward, for the small Mosses were much in awe of their uncle
3272: from Dorlcote Mill. She was inferior enough to Maggie in fire and
3273: strength of expression to make the resemblance between the two entirely
3274: flattering to Mr Tulliver’s fatherly love.
3275: 
3276: “Ay, they’re a bit alike,” he said, looking kindly at the little figure
3277: in the soiled pinafore. “They both take after our mother. You’ve got
3278: enough o’ gells, Gritty,” he added, in a tone half compassionate, half
3279: reproachful.
3280: 
3281: “Four of ’em, bless ’em!” said Mrs Moss, with a sigh, stroking Lizzy’s
3282: hair on each side of her forehead; “as many as there’s boys. They’ve
3283: got a brother apiece.”
3284: 
3285: “Ah, but they must turn out and fend for themselves,” said Mr Tulliver,
3286: feeling that his severity was relaxing and trying to brace it by
3287: throwing out a wholesome hint “They mustn’t look to hanging on their
3288: brothers.”
3289: 
3290: “No; but I hope their brothers ’ull love the poor things, and remember
3291: they came o’ one father and mother; the lads ’ull never be the poorer
3292: for that,” said Mrs Moss, flashing out with hurried timidity, like a
3293: half-smothered fire.
3294: 
3295: Mr Tulliver gave his horse a little stroke on the flank, then checked
3296: it, and said angrily, “Stand still with you!” much to the astonishment
3297: of that innocent animal.
3298: 
3299: “And the more there is of ’em, the more they must love one another,”
3300: Mrs Moss went on, looking at her children with a didactic purpose. But
3301: she turned toward her brother again to say, “Not but what I hope your
3302: boy ’ull allays be good to his sister, though there’s but two of ’em,
3303: like you and me, brother.”
3304: 
3305: The arrow went straight to Mr Tulliver’s heart. He had not a rapid
3306: imagination, but the thought of Maggie was very near to him, and he was
3307: not long in seeing his relation to his own sister side by side with
3308: Tom’s relation to Maggie. Would the little wench ever be poorly off,
3309: and Tom rather hard upon her?
3310: 
3311: “Ay, ay, Gritty,” said the miller, with a new softness in his tone;
3312: “but I’ve allays done what I could for you,” he added, as if
3313: vindicating himself from a reproach.
3314: 
3315: “I’m not denying that, brother, and I’m noways ungrateful,” said poor
3316: Mrs Moss, too fagged by toil and children to have strength left for any
3317: pride. “But here’s the father. What a while you’ve been, Moss!”
3318: 
3319: “While, do you call it?” said Mr Moss, feeling out of breath and
3320: injured. “I’ve been running all the way. Won’t you ’light, Mr
3321: Tulliver?”
3322: 
3323: “Well, I’ll just get down and have a bit o’ talk with you in the
3324: garden,” said Mr Tulliver, thinking that he should be more likely to
3325: show a due spirit of resolve if his sister were not present.
3326: 
3327: He got down, and passed with Mr Moss into the garden, toward an old
3328: yew-tree arbour, while his sister stood tapping her baby on the back
3329: and looking wistfully after them.
3330: 
3331: Their entrance into the yew-tree arbour surprised several fowls that
3332: were recreating themselves by scratching deep holes in the dusty
3333: ground, and at once took flight with much pother and cackling. Mr
3334: Tulliver sat down on the bench, and tapping the ground curiously here
3335: and there with his stick, as if he suspected some hollowness, opened
3336: the conversation by observing, with something like a snarl in his
3337: tone,—
3338: 
3339: “Why, you’ve got wheat again in that Corner Close, I see; and never a
3340: bit o’ dressing on it. You’ll do no good with it this year.”
3341: 
3342: Mr Moss, who, when he married Miss Tulliver, had been regarded as the
3343: buck of Basset, now wore a beard nearly a week old, and had the
3344: depressed, unexpectant air of a machine-horse. He answered in a
3345: patient-grumbling tone, “Why, poor farmers like me must do as they can;
3346: they must leave it to them as have got money to play with, to put half
3347: as much into the ground as they mean to get out of it.”
3348: 
3349: “I don’t know who should have money to play with, if it isn’t them as
3350: can borrow money without paying interest,” said Mr Tulliver, who wished
3351: to get into a slight quarrel; it was the most natural and easy
3352: introduction to calling in money.
3353: 
3354: “I know I’m behind with the interest,” said Mr Moss, “but I was so
3355: unlucky wi’ the wool last year; and what with the Missis being laid up
3356: so, things have gone awk’arder nor usual.”
3357: 
3358: “Ay,” snarled Mr Tulliver, “there’s folks as things ’ull allays go
3359: awk’ard with; empty sacks ’ull never stand upright.”
3360: 
3361: “Well, I don’t know what fault you’ve got to find wi’ me, Mr Tulliver,”
3362: said Mr Moss, deprecatingly; “I know there isn’t a day-labourer works
3363: harder.”
3364: 
3365: “What’s the use o’ that,” said Mr Tulliver, sharply, “when a man
3366: marries, and’s got no capital to work his farm but his wife’s bit o’
3367: fortin? I was against it from the first; but you’d neither of you
3368: listen to me. And I can’t lie out o’ my money any longer, for I’ve got
3369: to pay five hundred o’ Mrs Glegg’s, and there’ll be Tom an expense to
3370: me. I should find myself short, even saying I’d got back all as is my
3371: own. You must look about and see how you can pay me the three hundred
3372: pound.”
3373: 
3374: “Well, if that’s what you mean,” said Mr Moss, looking blankly before
3375: him, “we’d better be sold up, and ha’ done with it; I must part wi’
3376: every head o’ stock I’ve got, to pay you and the landlord too.”
3377: 
3378: Poor relations are undeniably irritating,—their existence is so
3379: entirely uncalled for on our part, and they are almost always very
3380: faulty people. Mr Tulliver had succeeded in getting quite as much
3381: irritated with Mr Moss as he had desired, and he was able to say
3382: angrily, rising from his seat,—
3383: 
3384: “Well, you must do as you can. _I_ can’t find money for everybody else
3385: as well as myself. I must look to my own business and my own family. I
3386: can’t lie out o’ my money any longer. You must raise it as quick as you
3387: can.”
3388: 
3389: Mr Tulliver walked abruptly out of the arbour as he uttered the last
3390: sentence, and, without looking round at Mr Moss, went on to the kitchen
3391: door, where the eldest boy was holding his horse, and his sister was
3392: waiting in a state of wondering alarm, which was not without its
3393: alleviations, for baby was making pleasant gurgling sounds, and
3394: performing a great deal of finger practice on the faded face. Mrs Moss
3395: had eight children, but could never overcome her regret that the twins
3396: had not lived. Mr Moss thought their removal was not without its
3397: consolations. “Won’t you come in, brother?” she said, looking anxiously
3398: at her husband, who was walking slowly up, while Mr Tulliver had his
3399: foot already in the stirrup.
3400: 
3401: “No, no; good-by,” said he, turning his horse’s head, and riding away.
3402: 
3403: No man could feel more resolute till he got outside the yard gate, and
3404: a little way along the deep-rutted lane; but before he reached the next
3405: turning, which would take him out of sight of the dilapidated
3406: farm-buildings, he appeared to be smitten by some sudden thought. He
3407: checked his horse, and made it stand still in the same spot for two or
3408: three minutes, during which he turned his head from side to side in a
3409: melancholy way, as if he were looking at some painful object on more
3410: sides than one. Evidently, after his fit of promptitude, Mr Tulliver
3411: was relapsing into the sense that this is a puzzling world. He turned
3412: his horse, and rode slowly back, giving vent to the climax of feeling
3413: which had determined this movement by saying aloud, as he struck his
3414: horse, “Poor little wench! she’ll have nobody but Tom, belike, when I’m
3415: gone.”
3416: 
3417: Mr Tulliver’s return into the yard was descried by several young
3418: Mosses, who immediately ran in with the exciting news to their mother,
3419: so that Mrs Moss was again on the door-step when her brother rode up.
3420: She had been crying, but was rocking baby to sleep in her arms now, and
3421: made no ostentatious show of sorrow as her brother looked at her, but
3422: merely said:
3423: 
3424: “The father’s gone to the field, again, if you want him, brother.”
3425: 
3426: “No, Gritty, no,” said Mr Tulliver, in a gentle tone. “Don’t you
3427: fret,—that’s all,—I’ll make a shift without the money a bit, only you
3428: must be as clever and contriving as you can.”
3429: 
3430: Mrs Moss’s tears came again at this unexpected kindness, and she could
3431: say nothing.
3432: 
3433: “Come, come!—the little wench shall come and see you. I’ll bring her
3434: and Tom some day before he goes to school. You mustn’t fret. I’ll
3435: allays be a good brother to you.”
3436: 
3437: “Thank you for that word, brother,” said Mrs Moss, drying her tears;
3438: then turning to Lizzy, she said, “Run now, and fetch the coloured egg
3439: for cousin Maggie.” Lizzy ran in, and quickly reappeared with a small
3440: paper parcel.
3441: 
3442: “It’s boiled hard, brother, and coloured with thrums, very pretty; it
3443: was done o’ purpose for Maggie. Will you please to carry it in your
3444: pocket?”
3445: 
3446: “Ay, ay,” said Mr Tulliver, putting it carefully in his side pocket.
3447: “Good-by.”
3448: 
3449: 
3450: 
3451: And so the respectable miller returned along the Basset lanes rather
3452: more puzzled than before as to ways and means, but still with the sense
3453: of a danger escaped. It had come across his mind that if he were hard
3454: upon his sister, it might somehow tend to make Tom hard upon Maggie at
3455: some distant day, when her father was no longer there to take her part;
3456: for simple people, like our friend Mr Tulliver, are apt to clothe
3457: unimpeachable feelings in erroneous ideas, and this was his confused
3458: way of explaining to himself that his love and anxiety for “the little
3459: wench” had given him a new sensibility toward his sister.
3460: 
3461: 
3462: Chapter IX.
3463: 
3464: To Garum Firs
3465: 
3466: While the possible troubles of Maggie’s future were occupying her
3467: father’s mind, she herself was tasting only the bitterness of the
3468: present. Childhood has no forebodings; but then, it is soothed by no
3469: memories of outlived sorrow.
3470: 
3471: The fact was, the day had begun ill with Maggie. The pleasure of having
3472: Lucy to look at, and the prospect of the afternoon visit to Garum Firs,
3473: where she would hear uncle Pullet’s musical box, had been marred as
3474: early as eleven o’clock by the advent of the hair-dresser from St
3475: Ogg’s, who had spoken in the severest terms of the condition in which
3476: he had found her hair, holding up one jagged lock after another and
3477: saying, “See here! tut, tut, tut!” in a tone of mingled disgust and
3478: pity, which to Maggie’s imagination was equivalent to the strongest
3479: expression of public opinion. Mr Rappit, the hair-dresser, with his
3480: well-anointed coronal locks tending wavily upward, like the simulated
3481: pyramid of flame on a monumental urn, seemed to her at that moment the
3482: most formidable of her contemporaries, into whose street at St Ogg’s
3483: she would carefully refrain from entering through the rest of her life.
3484: 
3485: Moreover, the preparation for a visit being always a serious affair in
3486: the Dodson family, Martha was enjoined to have Mrs Tulliver’s room
3487: ready an hour earlier than usual, that the laying out of the best
3488: clothes might not be deferred till the last moment, as was sometimes
3489: the case in families of lax views, where the ribbon-strings were never
3490: rolled up, where there was little or no wrapping in silver paper, and
3491: where the sense that the Sunday clothes could be got at quite easily
3492: produced no shock to the mind. Already, at twelve o’clock, Mrs Tulliver
3493: had on her visiting costume, with a protective apparatus of brown
3494: holland, as if she had been a piece of satin furniture in danger of
3495: flies; Maggie was frowning and twisting her shoulders, that she might
3496: if possible shrink away from the prickliest of tuckers, while her
3497: mother was remonstrating, “Don’t, Maggie, my dear; don’t make yourself
3498: so ugly!” and Tom’s cheeks were looking particularly brilliant as a
3499: relief to his best blue suit, which he wore with becoming calmness,
3500: having, after a little wrangling, effected what was always the one
3501: point of interest to him in his toilet: he had transferred all the
3502: contents of his everyday pockets to those actually in wear.
3503: 
3504: As for Lucy, she was just as pretty and neat as she had been yesterday;
3505: no accidents ever happened to her clothes, and she was never
3506: uncomfortable in them, so that she looked with wondering pity at
3507: Maggie, pouting and writhing under the exasperating tucker. Maggie
3508: would certainly have torn it off, if she had not been checked by the
3509: remembrance of her recent humiliation about her hair; as it was, she
3510: confined herself to fretting and twisting, and behaving peevishly about
3511: the card-houses which they were allowed to build till dinner, as a
3512: suitable amusement for boys and girls in their best clothes. Tom could
3513: build perfect pyramids of houses; but Maggie’s would never bear the
3514: laying on the roof. It was always so with the things that Maggie made;
3515: and Tom had deduced the conclusion that no girls could ever make
3516: anything. But it happened that Lucy proved wonderfully clever at
3517: building; she handled the cards so lightly, and moved so gently, that
3518: Tom condescended to admire her houses as well as his own, the more
3519: readily because she had asked him to teach her. Maggie, too, would have
3520: admired Lucy’s houses, and would have given up her own unsuccessful
3521: building to contemplate them, without ill temper, if her tucker had not
3522: made her peevish, and if Tom had not inconsiderately laughed when her
3523: houses fell, and told her she was “a stupid.”
3524: 
3525: “Don’t laugh at me, Tom!” she burst out angrily; “I’m not a stupid. I
3526: know a great many things you don’t.”
3527: 
3528: “Oh, I dare say, Miss Spitfire! I’d never be such a cross thing as you,
3529: making faces like that. Lucy doesn’t do so. I like Lucy better than
3530: you; _I_ wish Lucy was _my_ sister.”
3531: 
3532: “Then it’s very wicked and cruel of you to wish so,” said Maggie,
3533: starting up hurriedly from her place on the floor, and upsetting Tom’s
3534: wonderful pagoda. She really did not mean it, but the circumstantial
3535: evidence was against her, and Tom turned white with anger, but said
3536: nothing; he would have struck her, only he knew it was cowardly to
3537: strike a girl, and Tom Tulliver was quite determined he would never do
3538: anything cowardly.
3539: 
3540: Maggie stood in dismay and terror, while Tom got up from the floor and
3541: walked away, pale, from the scattered ruins of his pagoda, and Lucy
3542: looked on mutely, like a kitten pausing from its lapping.
3543: 
3544: “Oh, Tom,” said Maggie, at last, going half-way toward him, “I didn’t
3545: mean to knock it down, indeed, indeed I didn’t.”
3546: 
3547: Tom took no notice of her, but took, instead, two or three hard peas
3548: out of his pocket, and shot them with his thumbnail against the window,
3549: vaguely at first, but presently with the distinct aim of hitting a
3550: superannuated blue-bottle which was exposing its imbecility in the
3551: spring sunshine, clearly against the views of Nature, who had provided
3552: Tom and the peas for the speedy destruction of this weak individual.
3553: 
3554: Thus the morning had been made heavy to Maggie, and Tom’s persistent
3555: coldness to her all through their walk spoiled the fresh air and
3556: sunshine for her. He called Lucy to look at the half-built bird’s nest
3557: without caring to show it Maggie, and peeled a willow switch for Lucy
3558: and himself, without offering one to Maggie. Lucy had said, “Maggie,
3559: shouldn’t _you_ like one?” but Tom was deaf.
3560: 
3561: Still, the sight of the peacock opportunely spreading his tail on the
3562: stackyard wall, just as they reached Garum Firs, was enough to divert
3563: the mind temporarily from personal grievances. And this was only the
3564: beginning of beautiful sights at Garum Firs. All the farmyard life was
3565: wonderful there,—bantams, speckled and top-knotted; Friesland hens,
3566: with their feathers all turned the wrong way; Guinea-fowls that flew
3567: and screamed and dropped their pretty spotted feathers; pouter-pigeons
3568: and a tame magpie; nay, a goat, and a wonderful brindled dog, half
3569: mastiff, half bull-dog, as large as a lion. Then there were white
3570: railings and white gates all about, and glittering weathercocks of
3571: various design, and garden-walks paved with pebbles in beautiful
3572: patterns,—nothing was quite common at Garum Firs; and Tom thought that
3573: the unusual size of the toads there was simply due to the general
3574: unusualness which characterised uncle Pullet’s possessions as a
3575: gentleman farmer. Toads who paid rent were naturally leaner. As for the
3576: house, it was not less remarkable; it had a receding centre, and two
3577: wings with battlemented turrets, and was covered with glittering white
3578: stucco.
3579: 
3580: Uncle Pullet had seen the expected party approaching from the window,
3581: and made haste to unbar and unchain the front door, kept always in this
3582: fortified condition from fear of tramps, who might be supposed to know
3583: of the glass case of stuffed birds in the hall, and to contemplate
3584: rushing in and carrying it away on their heads. Aunt Pullet, too,
3585: appeared at the doorway, and as soon as her sister was within hearing
3586: said, “Stop the children, for God’s sake! Bessy; don’t let ’em come up
3587: the door-steps; Sally’s bringing the old mat and the duster, to rub
3588: their shoes.”
3589: 
3590: Mrs Pullet’s front-door mats were by no means intended to wipe shoes
3591: on; the very scraper had a deputy to do its dirty work. Tom rebelled
3592: particularly against this shoewiping, which he always considered in the
3593: light of an indignity to his sex. He felt it as the beginning of the
3594: disagreeables incident to a visit at aunt Pullet’s, where he had once
3595: been compelled to sit with towels wrapped round his boots; a fact which
3596: may serve to correct the too hasty conclusion that a visit to Garum
3597: Firs must have been a great treat to a young gentleman fond of
3598: animals,—fond, that is, of throwing stones at them.
3599: 
3600: The next disagreeable was confined to his feminine companions; it was
3601: the mounting of the polished oak stairs, which had very handsome
3602: carpets rolled up and laid by in a spare bedroom, so that the ascent of
3603: these glossy steps might have served, in barbarous times, as a trial by
3604: ordeal from which none but the most spotless virtue could have come off
3605: with unbroken limbs. Sophy’s weakness about these polished stairs was
3606: always a subject of bitter remonstrance on Mrs Glegg’s part; but Mrs
3607: Tulliver ventured on no comment, only thinking to herself it was a
3608: mercy when she and the children were safe on the landing.
3609: 
3610: “Mrs Gray has sent home my new bonnet, Bessy,” said Mrs Pullet, in a
3611: pathetic tone, as Mrs Tulliver adjusted her cap.
3612: 
3613: “Has she, sister?” said Mrs Tulliver, with an air of much interest.
3614: “And how do you like it?”
3615: 
3616: “It’s apt to make a mess with clothes, taking ’em out and putting ’em
3617: in again,” said Mrs Pullet, drawing a bunch of keys from her pocket and
3618: looking at them earnestly, “but it ’ud be a pity for you to go away
3619: without seeing it. There’s no knowing what may happen.”
3620: 
3621: Mrs Pullet shook her head slowly at this last serious consideration,
3622: which determined her to single out a particular key.
3623: 
3624: “I’m afraid it’ll be troublesome to you getting it out, sister,” said
3625: Mrs Tulliver; “but I _should_ like to see what sort of a crown she’s
3626: made you.”
3627: 
3628: Mrs Pullet rose with a melancholy air and unlocked one wing of a very
3629: bright wardrobe, where you may have hastily supposed she would find a
3630: new bonnet. Not at all. Such a supposition could only have arisen from
3631: a too superficial acquaintance with the habits of the Dodson family. In
3632: this wardrobe Mrs Pullet was seeking something small enough to be
3633: hidden among layers of linen,—it was a door-key.
3634: 
3635: “You must come with me into the best room,” said Mrs Pullet.
3636: 
3637: “May the children come too, sister?” inquired Mrs Tulliver, who saw
3638: that Maggie and Lucy were looking rather eager.
3639: 
3640: “Well,” said aunt Pullet, reflectively, “it’ll perhaps be safer for ’em
3641: to come; they’ll be touching something if we leave ’em behind.”
3642: 
3643: So they went in procession along the bright and slippery corridor,
3644: dimly lighted by the semi-lunar top of the window which rose above the
3645: closed shutter; it was really quite solemn. Aunt Pullet paused and
3646: unlocked a door which opened on something still more solemn than the
3647: passage,—a darkened room, in which the outer light, entering feebly,
3648: showed what looked like the corpses of furniture in white shrouds.
3649: Everything that was not shrouded stood with its legs upward. Lucy laid
3650: hold of Maggie’s frock, and Maggie’s heart beat rapidly.
3651: 
3652: Aunt Pullet half-opened the shutter and then unlocked the wardrobe,
3653: with a melancholy deliberateness which was quite in keeping with the
3654: funereal solemnity of the scene. The delicious scent of rose-leaves
3655: that issued from the wardrobe made the process of taking out sheet
3656: after sheet of silver paper quite pleasant to assist at, though the
3657: sight of the bonnet at last was an anticlimax to Maggie, who would have
3658: preferred something more strikingly preternatural. But few things could
3659: have been more impressive to Mrs Tulliver. She looked all round it in
3660: silence for some moments, and then said emphatically, “Well, sister,
3661: I’ll never speak against the full crowns again!”
3662: 
3663: It was a great concession, and Mrs Pullet felt it; she felt something
3664: was due to it.
3665: 
3666: “You’d like to see it on, sister?” she said sadly. “I’ll open the
3667: shutter a bit further.”
3668: 
3669: “Well, if you don’t mind taking off your cap, sister,” said Mrs
3670: Tulliver.
3671: 
3672: Mrs Pullet took off her cap, displaying the brown silk scalp with a
3673: jutting promontory of curls which was common to the more mature and
3674: judicious women of those times, and placing the bonnet on her head,
3675: turned slowly round, like a draper’s lay-figure, that Mrs Tulliver
3676: might miss no point of view.
3677: 
3678: “I’ve sometimes thought there’s a loop too much o’ ribbon on this left
3679: side, sister; what do you think?” said Mrs Pullet.
3680: 
3681: Mrs Tulliver looked earnestly at the point indicated, and turned her
3682: head on one side. “Well, I think it’s best as it is; if you meddled
3683: with it, sister, you might repent.”
3684: 
3685: “That’s true,” said aunt Pullet, taking off the bonnet and looking at
3686: it contemplatively.
3687: 
3688: “How much might she charge you for that bonnet, sister?” said Mrs
3689: Tulliver, whose mind was actively engaged on the possibility of getting
3690: a humble imitation of this _chef-d’œuvre_ made from a piece of silk she
3691: had at home.
3692: 
3693: Mrs Pullet screwed up her mouth and shook her head, and then whispered,
3694: “Pullet pays for it; he said I was to have the best bonnet at Garum
3695: Church, let the next best be whose it would.”
3696: 
3697: She began slowly to adjust the trimmings, in preparation for returning
3698: it to its place in the wardrobe, and her thoughts seemed to have taken
3699: a melancholy turn, for she shook her head.
3700: 
3701: “Ah,” she said at last, “I may never wear it twice, sister; who knows?”
3702: 
3703: “Don’t talk o’ that sister,” answered Mrs Tulliver. “I hope you’ll have
3704: your health this summer.”
3705: 
3706: “Ah! but there may come a death in the family, as there did soon after
3707: I had my green satin bonnet. Cousin Abbott may go, and we can’t think
3708: o’ wearing crape less nor half a year for him.”
3709: 
3710: “That _would_ be unlucky,” said Mrs Tulliver, entering thoroughly into
3711: the possibility of an inopportune decease. “There’s never so much
3712: pleasure i’ wearing a bonnet the second year, especially when the
3713: crowns are so chancy,—never two summers alike.”
3714: 
3715: “Ah, it’s the way i’ this world,” said Mrs Pullet, returning the bonnet
3716: to the wardrobe and locking it up. She maintained a silence
3717: characterised by head-shaking, until they had all issued from the
3718: solemn chamber and were in her own room again. Then, beginning to cry,
3719: she said, “Sister, if you should never see that bonnet again till I’m
3720: dead and gone, you’ll remember I showed it you this day.”
3721: 
3722: Mrs Tulliver felt that she ought to be affected, but she was a woman of
3723: sparse tears, stout and healthy; she couldn’t cry so much as her sister
3724: Pullet did, and had often felt her deficiency at funerals. Her effort
3725: to bring tears into her eyes issued in an odd contraction of her face.
3726: Maggie, looking on attentively, felt that there was some painful
3727: mystery about her aunt’s bonnet which she was considered too young to
3728: understand; indignantly conscious, all the while, that she could have
3729: understood that, as well as everything else, if she had been taken into
3730: confidence.
3731: 
3732: When they went down, uncle Pullet observed, with some acumen, that he
3733: reckoned the missis had been showing her bonnet,—that was what had made
3734: them so long upstairs. With Tom the interval had seemed still longer,
3735: for he had been seated in irksome constraint on the edge of a sofa
3736: directly opposite his uncle Pullet, who regarded him with twinkling
3737: gray eyes, and occasionally addressed him as “Young sir.”
3738: 
3739: “Well, young sir, what do you learn at school?” was a standing question
3740: with uncle Pullet; whereupon Tom always looked sheepish, rubbed his
3741: hands across his face, and answered, “I don’t know.” It was altogether
3742: so embarrassing to be seated _tête-à-tête_ with uncle Pullet, that Tom
3743: could not even look at the prints on the walls, or the flycages, or the
3744: wonderful flower-pots; he saw nothing but his uncle’s gaiters. Not that
3745: Tom was in awe of his uncle’s mental superiority; indeed, he had made
3746: up his mind that he didn’t want to be a gentleman farmer, because he
3747: shouldn’t like to be such a thin-legged, silly fellow as his uncle
3748: Pullet,—a molly-coddle, in fact. A boy’s sheepishness is by no means a
3749: sign of overmastering reverence; and while you are making encouraging
3750: advances to him under the idea that he is overwhelmed by a sense of
3751: your age and wisdom, ten to one he is thinking you extremely queer. The
3752: only consolation I can suggest to you is, that the Greek boys probably
3753: thought the same of Aristotle. It is only when you have mastered a
3754: restive horse, or thrashed a drayman, or have got a gun in your hand,
3755: that these shy juniors feel you to be a truly admirable and enviable
3756: character. At least, I am quite sure of Tom Tulliver’s sentiments on
3757: these points. In very tender years, when he still wore a lace border
3758: under his outdoor cap, he was often observed peeping through the bars
3759: of a gate and making minatory gestures with his small forefinger while
3760: he scolded the sheep with an inarticulate burr, intended to strike
3761: terror into their astonished minds; indicating thus early that desire
3762: for mastery over the inferior animals, wild and domestic, including
3763: cockchafers, neighbours’ dogs, and small sisters, which in all ages has
3764: been an attribute of so much promise for the fortunes of our race. Now,
3765: Mr Pullet never rode anything taller than a low pony, and was the least
3766: predatory of men, considering firearms dangerous, as apt to go off of
3767: themselves by nobody’s particular desire. So that Tom was not without
3768: strong reasons when, in confidential talk with a chum, he had described
3769: uncle Pullet as a nincompoop, taking care at the same time to observe
3770: that he was a very “rich fellow.”
3771: 
3772: The only alleviating circumstance in a _tête-à-tête_ with uncle Pullet
3773: was that he kept a variety of lozenges and peppermint-drops about his
3774: person, and when at a loss for conversation, he filled up the void by
3775: proposing a mutual solace of this kind.
3776: 
3777: “Do you like peppermints, young sir?” required only a tacit answer when
3778: it was accompanied by a presentation of the article in question.
3779: 
3780: The appearance of the little girls suggested to uncle Pullet the
3781: further solace of small sweet-cakes, of which he also kept a stock
3782: under lock and key for his own private eating on wet days; but the
3783: three children had no sooner got the tempting delicacy between their
3784: fingers, than aunt Pullet desired them to abstain from eating it till
3785: the tray and the plates came, since with those crisp cakes they would
3786: make the floor “all over” crumbs. Lucy didn’t mind that much, for the
3787: cake was so pretty, she thought it was rather a pity to eat it; but
3788: Tom, watching his opportunity while the elders were talking, hastily
3789: stowed it in his mouth at two bites, and chewed it furtively. As for
3790: Maggie, becoming fascinated, as usual, by a print of Ulysses and
3791: Nausicaa, which uncle Pullet had bought as a “pretty Scripture thing,”
3792: she presently let fall her cake, and in an unlucky movement crushed it
3793: beneath her foot,—a source of so much agitation to aunt Pullet and
3794: conscious disgrace to Maggie, that she began to despair of hearing the
3795: musical snuff-box to-day, till, after some reflection, it occurred to
3796: her that Lucy was in high favour enough to venture on asking for a
3797: tune. So she whispered to Lucy; and Lucy, who always did what she was
3798: desired to do, went up quietly to her uncle’s knee, and blushing all
3799: over her neck while she fingered her necklace, said, “Will you please
3800: play us a tune, uncle?”
3801: 
3802: Lucy thought it was by reason of some exceptional talent in uncle
3803: Pullet that the snuff-box played such beautiful tunes, and indeed the
3804: thing was viewed in that light by the majority of his neighbours in
3805: Garum. Mr Pullet had _bought_ the box, to begin with, and he understood
3806: winding it up, and knew which tune it was going to play beforehand;
3807: altogether the possession of this unique “piece of music” was a proof
3808: that Mr Pullet’s character was not of that entire nullity which might
3809: otherwise have been attributed to it. But uncle Pullet, when entreated
3810: to exhibit his accomplishment, never depreciated it by a too ready
3811: consent. “We’ll see about it,” was the answer he always gave, carefully
3812: abstaining from any sign of compliance till a suitable number of
3813: minutes had passed. Uncle Pullet had a programme for all great social
3814: occasions, and in this way fenced himself in from much painful
3815: confusion and perplexing freedom of will.
3816: 
3817: Perhaps the suspense did heighten Maggie’s enjoyment when the fairy
3818: tune began; for the first time she quite forgot that she had a load on
3819: her mind, that Tom was angry with her; and by the time “Hush, ye pretty
3820: warbling choir,” had been played, her face wore that bright look of
3821: happiness, while she sat immovable with her hands clasped, which
3822: sometimes comforted her mother with the sense that Maggie could look
3823: pretty now and then, in spite of her brown skin. But when the magic
3824: music ceased, she jumped up, and running toward Tom, put her arm round
3825: his neck and said, “Oh, Tom, isn’t it pretty?”
3826: 
3827: Lest you should think it showed a revolting insensibility in Tom that
3828: he felt any new anger toward Maggie for this uncalled-for and, to him,
3829: inexplicable caress, I must tell you that he had his glass of cowslip
3830: wine in his hand, and that she jerked him so as to make him spill half
3831: of it. He must have been an extreme milksop not to say angrily, “Look
3832: there, now!” especially when his resentment was sanctioned, as it was,
3833: by general disapprobation of Maggie’s behaviour.
3834: 
3835: “Why don’t you sit still, Maggie?” her mother said peevishly.
3836: 
3837: “Little gells mustn’t come to see me if they behave in that way,” said
3838: aunt Pullet.
3839: 
3840: “Why, you’re too rough, little miss,” said uncle Pullet.
3841: 
3842: Poor Maggie sat down again, with the music all chased out of her soul,
3843: and the seven small demons all in again.
3844: 
3845: Mrs Tulliver, foreseeing nothing but misbehaviour while the children
3846: remained indoors, took an early opportunity of suggesting that, now
3847: they were rested after their walk, they might go and play out of doors;
3848: and aunt Pullet gave permission, only enjoining them not to go off the
3849: paved walks in the garden, and if they wanted to see the poultry fed,
3850: to view them from a distance on the horse-block; a restriction which
3851: had been imposed ever since Tom had been found guilty of running after
3852: the peacock, with an illusory idea that fright would make one of its
3853: feathers drop off.
3854: 
3855: Mrs Tulliver’s thoughts had been temporarily diverted from the quarrel
3856: with Mrs Glegg by millinery and maternal cares, but now the great theme
3857: of the bonnet was thrown into perspective, and the children were out of
3858: the way, yesterday’s anxieties recurred.
3859: 
3860: “It weighs on my mind so as never was,” she said, by way of opening the
3861: subject, “sister Glegg’s leaving the house in that way. I’m sure I’d no
3862: wish t’ offend a sister.”
3863: 
3864: “Ah,” said aunt Pullet, “there’s no accounting for what Jane ’ull do. I
3865: wouldn’t speak of it out o’ the family, if it wasn’t to Dr Turnbull;
3866: but it’s my belief Jane lives too low. I’ve said so to Pullet often and
3867: often, and he knows it.”
3868: 
3869: “Why, you said so last Monday was a week, when we came away from
3870: drinking tea with ’em,” said Mr Pullet, beginning to nurse his knee and
3871: shelter it with his pocket handkerchief, as was his way when the
3872: conversation took an interesting turn.
3873: 
3874: “Very like I did,” said Mrs Pullet, “for you remember when I said
3875: things, better than I can remember myself. He’s got a wonderful memory,
3876: Pullet has,” she continued, looking pathetically at her sister. “I
3877: should be poorly off if he was to have a stroke, for he always
3878: remembers when I’ve got to take my doctor’s stuff; and I’m taking three
3879: sorts now.”
3880: 
3881: “There’s the ‘pills as before’ every other night, and the new drops at
3882: eleven and four, and the ’fervescing mixture ‘when agreeable,’”
3883: rehearsed Mr Pullet, with a punctuation determined by a lozenge on his
3884: tongue.
3885: 
3886: “Ah, perhaps it ’ud be better for sister Glegg if _she’d_ go to the
3887: doctor sometimes, instead o’ chewing Turkey rhubarb whenever there’s
3888: anything the matter with her,” said Mrs Tulliver, who naturally saw the
3889: wide subject of medicine chiefly in relation to Mrs Glegg.
3890: 
3891: “It’s dreadful to think on,” said aunt Pullet, raising her hands and
3892: letting them fall again, “people playing with their own insides in that
3893: way! And it’s flying i’ the face o’ Providence; for what are the
3894: doctors for, if we aren’t to call ’em in? And when folks have got the
3895: money to pay for a doctor, it isn’t respectable, as I’ve told Jane many
3896: a time. I’m ashamed of acquaintance knowing it.”
3897: 
3898: “Well, _we’ve_ no call to be ashamed,” said Mr Pullet, “for Doctor
3899: Turnbull hasn’t got such another patient as you i’ this parish, now old
3900: Mrs Sutton’s gone.”
3901: 
3902: “Pullet keeps all my physic-bottles, did you know, Bessy?” said Mrs
3903: Pullet. “He won’t have one sold. He says it’s nothing but right folks
3904: should see ’em when I’m gone. They fill two o’ the long store-room
3905: shelves a’ready; but,” she added, beginning to cry a little, “it’s well
3906: if they ever fill three. I may go before I’ve made up the dozen o’
3907: these last sizes. The pill-boxes are in the closet in my room,—you’ll
3908: remember that, sister,—but there’s nothing to show for the boluses, if
3909: it isn’t the bills.”
3910: 
3911: “Don’t talk o’ your going, sister,” said Mrs Tulliver; “I should have
3912: nobody to stand between me and sister Glegg if you was gone. And
3913: there’s nobody but you can get her to make it up with Mr Tulliver, for
3914: sister Deane’s never o’ my side, and if she was, it’s not to be looked
3915: for as she can speak like them as have got an independent fortin.”
3916: 
3917: “Well, your husband _is_ awk’ard, you know, Bessy,” said Mrs Pullet,
3918: good-naturedly ready to use her deep depression on her sister’s account
3919: as well as her own. “He’s never behaved quite so pretty to our family
3920: as he should do, and the children take after him,—the boy’s very
3921: mischievous, and runs away from his aunts and uncles, and the gell’s
3922: rude and brown. It’s your bad luck, and I’m sorry for you, Bessy; for
3923: you was allays my favourite sister, and we allays liked the same
3924: patterns.”
3925: 
3926: “I know Tulliver’s hasty, and says odd things,” said Mrs Tulliver,
3927: wiping away one small tear from the corner of her eye; “but I’m sure
3928: he’s never been the man, since he married me, to object to my making
3929: the friends o’ my side o’ the family welcome to the house.”
3930: 
3931: “_I_ don’t want to make the worst of you, Bessy,” said Mrs Pullet,
3932: compassionately, “for I doubt you’ll have trouble enough without that;
3933: and your husband’s got that poor sister and her children hanging on
3934: him,—and so given to lawing, they say. I doubt he’ll leave you poorly
3935: off when he dies. Not as I’d have it said out o’ the family.”
3936: 
3937: This view of her position was naturally far from cheering to Mrs
3938: Tulliver. Her imagination was not easily acted on, but she could not
3939: help thinking that her case was a hard one, since it appeared that
3940: other people thought it hard.
3941: 
3942: “I’m sure, sister, I can’t help myself,” she said, urged by the fear
3943: lest her anticipated misfortunes might be held retributive, to take
3944: comprehensive review of her past conduct. “There’s no woman strives
3945: more for her children; and I’m sure at scouring-time this Lady-day as
3946: I’ve had all the bedhangings taken down I did as much as the two gells
3947: put together; and there’s the last elder-flower wine I’ve
3948: made—beautiful! I allays offer it along with the sherry, though sister
3949: Glegg will have it I’m so extravagant; and as for liking to have my
3950: clothes tidy, and not go a fright about the house, there’s nobody in
3951: the parish can say anything against me in respect o’ backbiting and
3952: making mischief, for I don’t wish anybody any harm; and nobody loses by
3953: sending me a porkpie, for my pies are fit to show with the best o’ my
3954: neighbours’; and the linen’s so in order as if I was to die to-morrow I
3955: shouldn’t be ashamed. A woman can do no more nor she can.”
3956: 
3957: “But it’s all o’ no use, you know, Bessy,” said Mrs Pullet, holding her
3958: head on one side, and fixing her eyes pathetically on her sister, “if
3959: your husband makes away with his money. Not but what if you was sold
3960: up, and other folks bought your furniture, it’s a comfort to think as
3961: you’ve kept it well rubbed. And there’s the linen, with your maiden
3962: mark on, might go all over the country. It ’ud be a sad pity for our
3963: family.” Mrs Pullet shook her head slowly.
3964: 
3965: “But what can I do, sister?” said Mrs Tulliver. “Mr Tulliver’s not a
3966: man to be dictated to,—not if I was to go to the parson and get by
3967: heart what I should tell my husband for the best. And I’m sure I don’t
3968: pretend to know anything about putting out money and all that. I could
3969: never see into men’s business as sister Glegg does.”
3970: 
3971: “Well, you’re like me in that, Bessy,” said Mrs Pullet; “and I think it
3972: ’ud be a deal more becoming o’ Jane if she’d have that pier-glass
3973: rubbed oftener,—there was ever so many spots on it last week,—instead
3974: o’ dictating to folks as have more comings in than she ever had, and
3975: telling ’em what they’re to do with their money. But Jane and me were
3976: allays contrairy; she _would_ have striped things, and I like spots.
3977: You like a spot too, Bessy; we allays hung together i’ that.”
3978: 
3979: “Yes, Sophy,” said Mrs Tulliver, “I remember our having a blue ground
3980: with a white spot both alike,—I’ve got a bit in a bed-quilt now; and if
3981: you would but go and see sister Glegg, and persuade her to make it up
3982: with Tulliver, I should take it very kind of you. You was allays a good
3983: sister to me.”
3984: 
3985: “But the right thing ’ud be for Tulliver to go and make it up with her
3986: himself, and say he was sorry for speaking so rash. If he’s borrowed
3987: money of her, he shouldn’t be above that,” said Mrs Pullet, whose
3988: partiality did not blind her to principles; she did not forget what was
3989: due to people of independent fortune.
3990: 
3991: “It’s no use talking o’ that,” said poor Mrs Tulliver, almost
3992: peevishly. “If I was to go down on my bare knees on the gravel to
3993: Tulliver, he’d never humble himself.”
3994: 
3995: “Well, you can’t expect me to persuade _Jane_ to beg pardon,” said Mrs
3996: Pullet. “Her temper’s beyond everything; it’s well if it doesn’t carry
3997: her off her mind, though there never _was_ any of our family went to a
3998: madhouse.”
3999: 
4000: “I’m not thinking of her begging pardon,” said Mrs Tulliver. “But if
4001: she’d just take no notice, and not call her money in; as it’s not so
4002: much for one sister to ask of another; time ’ud mend things, and
4003: Tulliver ’ud forget all about it, and they’d be friends again.”
4004: 
4005: Mrs Tulliver, you perceive, was not aware of her husband’s irrevocable
4006: determination to pay in the five hundred pounds; at least such a
4007: determination exceeded her powers of belief.
4008: 
4009: “Well, Bessy,” said Mrs Pullet, mournfully, “_I_ don’t want to help you
4010: on to ruin. I won’t be behindhand i’ doing you a good turn, if it is to
4011: be done. And I don’t like it said among acquaintance as we’ve got
4012: quarrels in the family. I shall tell Jane that; and I don’t mind
4013: driving to Jane’s tomorrow, if Pullet doesn’t mind. What do you say, Mr
4014: Pullet?”
4015: 
4016: “I’ve no objections,” said Mr Pullet, who was perfectly contented with
4017: any course the quarrel might take, so that Mr Tulliver did not apply to
4018: _him_ for money. Mr Pullet was nervous about his investments, and did
4019: not see how a man could have any security for his money unless he
4020: turned it into land.
4021: 
4022: After a little further discussion as to whether it would not be better
4023: for Mrs Tulliver to accompany them on a visit to sister Glegg, Mrs
4024: Pullet, observing that it was tea-time, turned to reach from a drawer a
4025: delicate damask napkin, which she pinned before her in the fashion of
4026: an apron. The door did, in fact, soon open, but instead of the
4027: tea-tray, Sally introduced an object so startling that both Mrs Pullet
4028: and Mrs Tulliver gave a scream, causing uncle Pullet to swallow his
4029: lozenge—for the fifth time in his life, as he afterward noted.
4030: 
4031: 
4032: Chapter X.
4033: 
4034: Maggie Behaves Worse Than She Expected
4035: 
4036: The startling object which thus made an epoch for uncle Pullet was no
4037: other than little Lucy, with one side of her person, from her small
4038: foot to her bonnet-crown, wet and discoloured with mud, holding out two
4039: tiny blackened hands, and making a very piteous face. To account for
4040: this unprecedented apparition in aunt Pullet’s parlour, we must return
4041: to the moment when the three children went to play out of doors, and
4042: the small demons who had taken possession of Maggie’s soul at an early
4043: period of the day had returned in all the greater force after a
4044: temporary absence. All the disagreeable recollections of the morning
4045: were thick upon her, when Tom, whose displeasure toward her had been
4046: considerably refreshed by her foolish trick of causing him to upset his
4047: cowslip wine, said, “Here, Lucy, you come along with me,” and walked
4048: off to the area where the toads were, as if there were no Maggie in
4049: existence. Seeing this, Maggie lingered at a distance, looking like a
4050: small Medusa with her snakes cropped. Lucy was naturally pleased that
4051: cousin Tom was so good to her, and it was very amusing to see him
4052: tickling a fat toad with a piece of string when the toad was safe down
4053: the area, with an iron grating over him. Still Lucy wished Maggie to
4054: enjoy the spectacle also, especially as she would doubtless find a name
4055: for the toad, and say what had been his past history; for Lucy had a
4056: delighted semi-belief in Maggie’s stories about the live things they
4057: came upon by accident,—how Mrs Earwig had a wash at home, and one of
4058: her children had fallen into the hot copper, for which reason she was
4059: running so fast to fetch the doctor. Tom had a profound contempt for
4060: this nonsense of Maggie’s, smashing the earwig at once as a superfluous
4061: yet easy means of proving the entire unreality of such a story; but
4062: Lucy, for the life of her, could not help fancying there was something
4063: in it, and at all events thought it was very pretty make-believe. So
4064: now the desire to know the history of a very portly toad, added to her
4065: habitual affectionateness, made her run back to Maggie and say, “Oh,
4066: there is such a big, funny toad, Maggie! Do come and see!”
4067: 
4068: Maggie said nothing, but turned away from her with a deeper frown. As
4069: long as Tom seemed to prefer Lucy to her, Lucy made part of his
4070: unkindness. Maggie would have thought a little while ago that she could
4071: never be cross with pretty little Lucy, any more than she could be
4072: cruel to a little white mouse; but then, Tom had always been quite
4073: indifferent to Lucy before, and it had been left to Maggie to pet and
4074: make much of her. As it was, she was actually beginning to think that
4075: she should like to make Lucy cry by slapping or pinching her,
4076: especially as it might vex Tom, whom it was of no use to slap, even if
4077: she dared, because he didn’t mind it. And if Lucy hadn’t been there,
4078: Maggie was sure he would have got friends with her sooner.
4079: 
4080: Tickling a fat toad who is not highly sensitive is an amusement that it
4081: is possible to exhaust, and Tom by and by began to look round for some
4082: other mode of passing the time. But in so prim a garden, where they
4083: were not to go off the paved walks, there was not a great choice of
4084: sport. The only great pleasure such a restriction suggested was the
4085: pleasure of breaking it, and Tom began to meditate an insurrectionary
4086: visit to the pond, about a field’s length beyond the garden.
4087: 
4088: “I say, Lucy,” he began, nodding his head up and down with great
4089: significance, as he coiled up his string again, “what do you think I
4090: mean to do?”
4091: 
4092: “What, Tom?” said Lucy, with curiosity.
4093: 
4094: “I mean to go to the pond and look at the pike. You may go with me if
4095: you like,” said the young sultan.
4096: 
4097: “Oh, Tom, _dare_ you?” said Lucy. “Aunt said we mustn’t go out of the
4098: garden.”
4099: 
4100: “Oh, I shall go out at the other end of the garden,” said Tom. “Nobody
4101: ’ull see us. Besides, I don’t care if they do,—I’ll run off home.”
4102: 
4103: “But _I_ couldn’t run,” said Lucy, who had never before been exposed to
4104: such severe temptation.
4105: 
4106: “Oh, never mind; they won’t be cross with _you_,” said Tom. “You say I
4107: took you.”
4108: 
4109: Tom walked along, and Lucy trotted by his side, timidly enjoying the
4110: rare treat of doing something naughty,—excited also by the mention of
4111: that celebrity, the pike, about which she was quite uncertain whether
4112: it was a fish or a fowl.
4113: 
4114: Maggie saw them leaving the garden, and could not resist the impulse to
4115: follow. Anger and jealousy can no more bear to lose sight of their
4116: objects than love, and that Tom and Lucy should do or see anything of
4117: which she was ignorant would have been an intolerable idea to Maggie.
4118: So she kept a few yards behind them, unobserved by Tom, who was
4119: presently absorbed in watching for the pike,—a highly interesting
4120: monster; he was said to be so very old, so very large, and to have such
4121: a remarkable appetite. The pike, like other celebrities, did not show
4122: when he was watched for, but Tom caught sight of something in rapid
4123: movement in the water, which attracted him to another spot on the brink
4124: of the pond.
4125: 
4126: “Here, Lucy!” he said in a loud whisper, “come here! take care! keep on
4127: the grass!—don’t step where the cows have been!” he added, pointing to
4128: a peninsula of dry grass, with trodden mud on each side of it; for
4129: Tom’s contemptuous conception of a girl included the attribute of being
4130: unfit to walk in dirty places.
4131: 
4132: Lucy came carefully as she was bidden, and bent down to look at what
4133: seemed a golden arrow-head darting through the water. It was a
4134: water-snake, Tom told her; and Lucy at last could see the serpentine
4135: wave of its body, very much wondering that a snake could swim. Maggie
4136: had drawn nearer and nearer; she _must_ see it too, though it was
4137: bitter to her, like everything else, since Tom did not care about her
4138: seeing it. At last she was close by Lucy; and Tom, who had been aware
4139: of her approach, but would not notice it till he was obliged, turned
4140: round and said,—
4141: 
4142: “Now, get away, Maggie; there’s no room for you on the grass here.
4143: Nobody asked _you_ to come.”
4144: 
4145: There were passions at war in Maggie at that moment to have made a
4146: tragedy, if tragedies were made by passion only; but the essential τι
4147: μέγεθος which was present in the passion was wanting to the action; the
4148: utmost Maggie could do, with a fierce thrust of her small brown arm,
4149: was to push poor little pink-and-white Lucy into the cow-trodden mud.
4150: 
4151: Then Tom could not restrain himself, and gave Maggie two smart slaps on
4152: the arm as he ran to pick up Lucy, who lay crying helplessly. Maggie
4153: retreated to the roots of a tree a few yards off, and looked on
4154: impenitently. Usually her repentance came quickly after one rash deed,
4155: but now Tom and Lucy had made her so miserable, she was glad to spoil
4156: their happiness,—glad to make everybody uncomfortable. Why should she
4157: be sorry? Tom was very slow to forgive _her_, however sorry she might
4158: have been.
4159: 
4160: “I shall tell mother, you know, Miss Mag,” said Tom, loudly and
4161: emphatically, as soon as Lucy was up and ready to walk away. It was not
4162: Tom’s practice to “tell,” but here justice clearly demanded that Maggie
4163: should be visited with the utmost punishment; not that Tom had learned
4164: to put his views in that abstract form; he never mentioned “justice,”
4165: and had no idea that his desire to punish might be called by that fine
4166: name. Lucy was too entirely absorbed by the evil that had befallen
4167: her,—the spoiling of her pretty best clothes, and the discomfort of
4168: being wet and dirty,—to think much of the cause, which was entirely
4169: mysterious to her. She could never have guessed what she had done to
4170: make Maggie angry with her; but she felt that Maggie was very unkind
4171: and disagreeable, and made no magnanimous entreaties to Tom that he
4172: would not “tell,” only running along by his side and crying piteously,
4173: while Maggie sat on the roots of the tree and looked after them with
4174: her small Medusa face.
4175: 
4176: “Sally,” said Tom, when they reached the kitchen door, and Sally looked
4177: at them in speechless amaze, with a piece of bread-and-butter in her
4178: mouth and a toasting-fork in her hand,—“Sally, tell mother it was
4179: Maggie pushed Lucy into the mud.”
4180: 
4181: “But Lors ha’ massy, how did you get near such mud as that?” said
4182: Sally, making a wry face, as she stooped down and examined the _corpus
4183: delicti_.
4184: 
4185: Tom’s imagination had not been rapid and capacious enough to include
4186: this question among the foreseen consequences, but it was no sooner put
4187: than he foresaw whither it tended, and that Maggie would not be
4188: considered the only culprit in the case. He walked quietly away from
4189: the kitchen door, leaving Sally to that pleasure of guessing which
4190: active minds notoriously prefer to ready-made knowledge.
4191: 
4192: Sally, as you are aware, lost no time in presenting Lucy at the parlour
4193: door, for to have so dirty an object introduced into the house at Garum
4194: Firs was too great a weight to be sustained by a single mind.
4195: 
4196: “Goodness gracious!” aunt Pullet exclaimed, after preluding by an
4197: inarticulate scream; “keep her at the door, Sally! Don’t bring her off
4198: the oil-cloth, whatever you do.”
4199: 
4200: “Why, she’s tumbled into some nasty mud,” said Mrs Tulliver, going up
4201: to Lucy to examine into the amount of damage to clothes for which she
4202: felt herself responsible to her sister Deane.
4203: 
4204: “If you please, ’um, it was Miss Maggie as pushed her in,” said Sally;
4205: “Master Tom’s been and said so, and they must ha’ been to the pond, for
4206: it’s only there they could ha’ got into such dirt.”
4207: 
4208: “There it is, Bessy; it’s what I’ve been telling you,” said Mrs Pullet,
4209: in a tone of prophetic sadness; “it’s your children,—there’s no knowing
4210: what they’ll come to.”
4211: 
4212: Mrs Tulliver was mute, feeling herself a truly wretched mother. As
4213: usual, the thought pressed upon her that people would think she had
4214: done something wicked to deserve her maternal troubles, while Mrs
4215: Pullet began to give elaborate directions to Sally how to guard the
4216: premises from serious injury in the course of removing the dirt.
4217: Meantime tea was to be brought in by the cook, and the two naughty
4218: children were to have theirs in an ignominious manner in the kitchen.
4219: Mrs Tulliver went out to speak to these naughty children, supposing
4220: them to be close at hand; but it was not until after some search that
4221: she found Tom leaning with rather a hardened, careless air against the
4222: white paling of the poultry-yard, and lowering his piece of string on
4223: the other side as a means of exasperating the turkey-cock.
4224: 
4225: “Tom, you naughty boy, where’s your sister?” said Mrs Tulliver, in a
4226: distressed voice.
4227: 
4228: “I don’t know,” said Tom; his eagerness for justice on Maggie had
4229: diminished since he had seen clearly that it could hardly be brought
4230: about without the injustice of some blame on his own conduct.
4231: 
4232: “Why, where did you leave her?” said the mother, looking round.
4233: 
4234: “Sitting under the tree, against the pond,” said Tom, apparently
4235: indifferent to everything but the string and the turkey-cock.
4236: 
4237: “Then go and fetch her in this minute, you naughty boy. And how could
4238: you think o’ going to the pond, and taking your sister where there was
4239: dirt? You know she’ll do mischief if there’s mischief to be done.”
4240: 
4241: It was Mrs Tulliver’s way, if she blamed Tom, to refer his
4242: misdemeanour, somehow or other, to Maggie.
4243: 
4244: The idea of Maggie sitting alone by the pond roused an habitual fear in
4245: Mrs Tulliver’s mind, and she mounted the horse-block to satisfy herself
4246: by a sight of that fatal child, while Tom walked—not very quickly—on
4247: his way toward her.
4248: 
4249: “They’re such children for the water, mine are,” she said aloud,
4250: without reflecting that there was no one to hear her; “they’ll be
4251: brought in dead and drownded some day. I wish that river was far
4252: enough.”
4253: 
4254: But when she not only failed to discern Maggie, but presently saw Tom
4255: returning from the pool alone, this hovering fear entered and took
4256: complete possession of her, and she hurried to meet him.
4257: 
4258: “Maggie’s nowhere about the pond, mother,” said Tom; “she’s gone away.”
4259: 
4260: You may conceive the terrified search for Maggie, and the difficulty of
4261: convincing her mother that she was not in the pond. Mrs Pullet observed
4262: that the child might come to a worse end if she lived, there was no
4263: knowing; and Mr Pullet, confused and overwhelmed by this revolutionary
4264: aspect of things,—the tea deferred and the poultry alarmed by the
4265: unusual running to and fro,—took up his spud as an instrument of
4266: search, and reached down a key to unlock the goose-pen, as a likely
4267: place for Maggie to lie concealed in.
4268: 
4269: Tom, after a while, started the idea that Maggie was gone home (without
4270: thinking it necessary to state that it was what he should have done
4271: himself under the circumstances), and the suggestion was seized as a
4272: comfort by his mother.
4273: 
4274: “Sister, for goodness’ sake let ’em put the horse in the carriage and
4275: take me home; we shall perhaps find her on the road. Lucy can’t walk in
4276: her dirty clothes,” she said, looking at that innocent victim, who was
4277: wrapped up in a shawl, and sitting with naked feet on the sofa.
4278: 
4279: Aunt Pullet was quite willing to take the shortest means of restoring
4280: her premises to order and quiet, and it was not long before Mrs
4281: Tulliver was in the chaise, looking anxiously at the most distant point
4282: before her. What the father would say if Maggie was lost, was a
4283: question that predominated over every other.
4284: 
4285: 
4286: Chapter XI.
4287: 
4288: Maggie Tries to Run away from Her Shadow
4289: 
4290: Maggie’s intentions, as usual, were on a larger scale than Tom
4291: imagined. The resolution that gathered in her mind, after Tom and Lucy
4292: had walked away, was not so simple as that of going home. No! she would
4293: run away and go to the gypsies, and Tom should never see her any more.
4294: That was by no means a new idea to Maggie; she had been so often told
4295: she was like a gypsy, and “half wild,” that when she was miserable it
4296: seemed to her the only way of escaping opprobrium, and being entirely
4297: in harmony with circumstances, would be to live in a little brown tent
4298: on the commons; the gypsies, she considered, would gladly receive her
4299: and pay her much respect on account of her superior knowledge. She had
4300: once mentioned her views on this point to Tom and suggested that he
4301: should stain his face brown, and they should run away together; but Tom
4302: rejected the scheme with contempt, observing that gypsies were thieves,
4303: and hardly got anything to eat and had nothing to drive but a donkey.
4304: To-day however, Maggie thought her misery had reached a pitch at which
4305: gypsydom was her refuge, and she rose from her seat on the roots of the
4306: tree with the sense that this was a great crisis in her life; she would
4307: run straight away till she came to Dunlow Common, where there would
4308: certainly be gypsies; and cruel Tom, and the rest of her relations who
4309: found fault with her, should never see her any more. She thought of her
4310: father as she ran along, but she reconciled herself to the idea of
4311: parting with him, by determining that she would secretly send him a
4312: letter by a small gypsy, who would run away without telling where she
4313: was, and just let him know that she was well and happy, and always
4314: loved him very much.
4315: 
4316: Maggie soon got out of breath with running, but by the time Tom got to
4317: the pond again she was at the distance of three long fields, and was on
4318: the edge of the lane leading to the highroad. She stopped to pant a
4319: little, reflecting that running away was not a pleasant thing until one
4320: had got quite to the common where the gypsies were, but her resolution
4321: had not abated; she presently passed through the gate into the lane,
4322: not knowing where it would lead her, for it was not this way that they
4323: came from Dorlcote Mill to Garum Firs, and she felt all the safer for
4324: that, because there was no chance of her being overtaken. But she was
4325: soon aware, not without trembling, that there were two men coming along
4326: the lane in front of her; she had not thought of meeting strangers, she
4327: had been too much occupied with the idea of her friends coming after
4328: her. The formidable strangers were two shabby-looking men with flushed
4329: faces, one of them carrying a bundle on a stick over his shoulder; but
4330: to her surprise, while she was dreading their disapprobation as a
4331: runaway, the man with the bundle stopped, and in a half-whining,
4332: half-coaxing tone asked her if she had a copper to give a poor man.
4333: Maggie had a sixpence in her pocket,—her uncle Glegg’s present,—which
4334: she immediately drew out and gave this poor man with a polite smile,
4335: hoping he would feel very kindly toward her as a generous person.
4336: “That’s the only money I’ve got,” she said apologetically. “Thank you,
4337: little miss,” said the man, in a less respectful and grateful tone than
4338: Maggie anticipated, and she even observed that he smiled and winked at
4339: his companion. She walked on hurriedly, but was aware that the two men
4340: were standing still, probably to look after her, and she presently
4341: heard them laughing loudly. Suddenly it occurred to her that they might
4342: think she was an idiot; Tom had said that her cropped hair made her
4343: look like an idiot, and it was too painful an idea to be readily
4344: forgotten. Besides, she had no sleeves on,—only a cape and bonnet. It
4345: was clear that she was not likely to make a favourable impression on
4346: passengers, and she thought she would turn into the fields again, but
4347: not on the same side of the lane as before, lest they should still be
4348: uncle Pullet’s fields. She turned through the first gate that was not
4349: locked, and felt a delightful sense of privacy in creeping along by the
4350: hedgerows, after her recent humiliating encounter. She was used to
4351: wandering about the fields by herself, and was less timid there than on
4352: the highroad. Sometimes she had to climb over high gates, but that was
4353: a small evil; she was getting out of reach very fast, and she should
4354: probably soon come within sight of Dunlow Common, or at least of some
4355: other common, for she had heard her father say that you couldn’t go
4356: very far without coming to a common. She hoped so, for she was getting
4357: rather tired and hungry, and until she reached the gypsies there was no
4358: definite prospect of bread and butter. It was still broad daylight, for
4359: aunt Pullet, retaining the early habits of the Dodson family, took tea
4360: at half-past four by the sun, and at five by the kitchen clock; so,
4361: though it was nearly an hour since Maggie started, there was no
4362: gathering gloom on the fields to remind her that the night would come.
4363: Still, it seemed to her that she had been walking a very great distance
4364: indeed, and it was really surprising that the common did not come
4365: within sight. Hitherto she had been in the rich parish of Garum, where
4366: was a great deal of pasture-land, and she had only seen one labourer at
4367: a distance. That was fortunate in some respects, as labourers might be
4368: too ignorant to understand the propriety of her wanting to go to Dunlow
4369: Common; yet it would have been better if she could have met some one
4370: who would tell her the way without wanting to know anything about her
4371: private business. At last, however, the green fields came to an end,
4372: and Maggie found herself looking through the bars of a gate into a lane
4373: with a wide margin of grass on each side of it. She had never seen such
4374: a wide lane before, and, without her knowing why, it gave her the
4375: impression that the common could not be far off; perhaps it was because
4376: she saw a donkey with a log to his foot feeding on the grassy margin,
4377: for she had seen a donkey with that pitiable encumbrance on Dunlow
4378: Common when she had been across it in her father’s gig. She crept
4379: through the bars of the gate and walked on with new spirit, though not
4380: without haunting images of Apollyon, and a highwayman with a pistol,
4381: and a blinking dwarf in yellow with a mouth from ear to ear, and other
4382: miscellaneous dangers. For poor little Maggie had at once the timidity
4383: of an active imagination and the daring that comes from overmastering
4384: impulse. She had rushed into the adventure of seeking her unknown
4385: kindred, the gypsies; and now she was in this strange lane, she hardly
4386: dared look on one side of her, lest she should see the diabolical
4387: blacksmith in his leathern apron grinning at her with arms akimbo. It
4388: was not without a leaping of the heart that she caught sight of a small
4389: pair of bare legs sticking up, feet uppermost, by the side of a
4390: hillock; they seemed something hideously preternatural,—a diabolical
4391: kind of fungus; for she was too much agitated at the first glance to
4392: see the ragged clothes and the dark shaggy head attached to them. It
4393: was a boy asleep, and Maggie trotted along faster and more lightly,
4394: lest she should wake him; it did not occur to her that he was one of
4395: her friends the gypsies, who in all probability would have very genial
4396: manners. But the fact was so, for at the next bend in the lane Maggie
4397: actually saw the little semicircular black tent with the blue smoke
4398: rising before it, which was to be her refuge from all the blighting
4399: obloquy that had pursued her in civilised life. She even saw a tall
4400: female figure by the column of smoke, doubtless the gypsy-mother, who
4401: provided the tea and other groceries; it was astonishing to herself
4402: that she did not feel more delighted. But it was startling to find the
4403: gypsies in a lane, after all, and not on a common; indeed, it was
4404: rather disappointing; for a mysterious illimitable common, where there
4405: were sand-pits to hide in, and one was out of everybody’s reach, had
4406: always made part of Maggie’s picture of gypsy life. She went on,
4407: however, and thought with some comfort that gypsies most likely knew
4408: nothing about idiots, so there was no danger of their falling into the
4409: mistake of setting her down at the first glance as an idiot. It was
4410: plain she had attracted attention; for the tall figure, who proved to
4411: be a young woman with a baby on her arm, walked slowly to meet her.
4412: Maggie looked up in the new face rather tremblingly as it approached,
4413: and was reassured by the thought that her aunt Pullet and the rest were
4414: right when they called her a gypsy; for this face, with the bright dark
4415: eyes and the long hair, was really something like what she used to see
4416: in the glass before she cut her hair off.
4417: 
4418: “My little lady, where are you going to?” the gypsy said, in a tone of
4419: coaxing deference.
4420: 
4421: It was delightful, and just what Maggie expected; the gypsies saw at
4422: once that she was a little lady, and were prepared to treat her
4423: accordingly.
4424: 
4425: “Not any farther,” said Maggie, feeling as if she were saying what she
4426: had rehearsed in a dream. “I’m come to stay with _you_, please.”
4427: 
4428: “That’s pretty; come, then. Why, what a nice little lady you are, to be
4429: sure!” said the gypsy, taking her by the hand. Maggie thought her very
4430: agreeable, but wished she had not been so dirty.
4431: 
4432: There was quite a group round the fire when she reached it. An old
4433: gypsy woman was seated on the ground nursing her knees, and
4434: occasionally poking a skewer into the round kettle that sent forth an
4435: odorous steam; two small shock-headed children were lying prone and
4436: resting on their elbows something like small sphinxes; and a placid
4437: donkey was bending his head over a tall girl, who, lying on her back,
4438: was scratching his nose and indulging him with a bite of excellent
4439: stolen hay. The slanting sunlight fell kindly upon them, and the scene
4440: was really very pretty and comfortable, Maggie thought, only she hoped
4441: they would soon set out the tea-cups. Everything would be quite
4442: charming when she had taught the gypsies to use a washing-basin, and to
4443: feel an interest in books. It was a little confusing, though, that the
4444: young woman began to speak to the old one in a language which Maggie
4445: did not understand, while the tall girl, who was feeding the donkey,
4446: sat up and stared at her without offering any salutation. At last the
4447: old woman said,—
4448: 
4449: “What! my pretty lady, are you come to stay with us? Sit ye down and
4450: tell us where you come from.”
4451: 
4452: It was just like a story; Maggie liked to be called pretty lady and
4453: treated in this way. She sat down and said,—
4454: 
4455: “I’m come from home because I’m unhappy, and I mean to be a gypsy. I’ll
4456: live with you if you like, and I can teach you a great many things.”
4457: 
4458: “Such a clever little lady,” said the woman with the baby sitting down
4459: by Maggie, and allowing baby to crawl; “and such a pretty bonnet and
4460: frock,” she added, taking off Maggie’s bonnet and looking at it while
4461: she made an observation to the old woman, in the unknown language. The
4462: tall girl snatched the bonnet and put it on her own head hind-foremost
4463: with a grin; but Maggie was determined not to show any weakness on this
4464: subject, as if she were susceptible about her bonnet.
4465: 
4466: “I don’t want to wear a bonnet,” she said; “I’d rather wear a red
4467: handkerchief, like yours” (looking at her friend by her side). “My hair
4468: was quite long till yesterday, when I cut it off; but I dare say it
4469: will grow again very soon,” she added apologetically, thinking it
4470: probable the gypsies had a strong prejudice in favour of long hair. And
4471: Maggie had forgotten even her hunger at that moment in the desire to
4472: conciliate gypsy opinion.
4473: 
4474: “Oh, what a nice little lady!—and rich, I’m sure,” said the old woman.
4475: “Didn’t you live in a beautiful house at home?”
4476: 
4477: “Yes, my home is pretty, and I’m very fond of the river, where we go
4478: fishing, but I’m often very unhappy. I should have liked to bring my
4479: books with me, but I came away in a hurry, you know. But I can tell you
4480: almost everything there is in my books, I’ve read them so many times,
4481: and that will amuse you. And I can tell you something about Geography
4482: too,—that’s about the world we live in,—very useful and interesting.
4483: Did you ever hear about Columbus?”
4484: 
4485: Maggie’s eyes had begun to sparkle and her cheeks to flush,—she was
4486: really beginning to instruct the gypsies, and gaining great influence
4487: over them. The gypsies themselves were not without amazement at this
4488: talk, though their attention was divided by the contents of Maggie’s
4489: pocket, which the friend at her right hand had by this time emptied
4490: without attracting her notice.
4491: 
4492: “Is that where you live, my little lady?” said the old woman, at the
4493: mention of Columbus.
4494: 
4495: “Oh, no!” said Maggie, with some pity; “Columbus was a very wonderful
4496: man, who found out half the world, and they put chains on him and
4497: treated him very badly, you know; it’s in my Catechism of Geography,
4498: but perhaps it’s rather too long to tell before tea—_I want my tea
4499: so_.”
4500: 
4501: The last words burst from Maggie, in spite of herself, with a sudden
4502: drop from patronizing instruction to simple peevishness.
4503: 
4504: “Why, she’s hungry, poor little lady,” said the younger woman. “Give
4505: her some o’ the cold victual. You’ve been walking a good way, I’ll be
4506: bound, my dear. Where’s your home?”
4507: 
4508: “It’s Dorlcote Mill, a good way off,” said Maggie. “My father is Mr
4509: Tulliver, but we mustn’t let him know where I am, else he’ll fetch me
4510: home again. Where does the queen of the gypsies live?”
4511: 
4512: “What! do you want to go to her, my little lady?” said the younger
4513: woman. The tall girl meanwhile was constantly staring at Maggie and
4514: grinning. Her manners were certainly not agreeable.
4515: 
4516: “No,” said Maggie, “I’m only thinking that if she isn’t a very good
4517: queen you might be glad when she died, and you could choose another. If
4518: I was a queen, I’d be a very good queen, and kind to everybody.”
4519: 
4520: “Here’s a bit o’ nice victual, then,” said the old woman, handing to
4521: Maggie a lump of dry bread, which she had taken from a bag of scraps,
4522: and a piece of cold bacon.
4523: 
4524: “Thank you,’ said Maggie, looking at the food without taking it; “but
4525: will you give me some bread-and-butter and tea instead? I don’t like
4526: bacon.”
4527: 
4528: “We’ve got no tea nor butter,” said the old woman, with something like
4529: a scowl, as if she were getting tired of coaxing.
4530: 
4531: “Oh, a little bread and treacle would do,” said Maggie.
4532: 
4533: “We han’t got no treacle,” said the old woman, crossly, whereupon there
4534: followed a sharp dialogue between the two women in their unknown
4535: tongue, and one of the small sphinxes snatched at the bread-and-bacon,
4536: and began to eat it. At this moment the tall girl, who had gone a few
4537: yards off, came back, and said something which produced a strong
4538: effect. The old woman, seeming to forget Maggie’s hunger, poked the
4539: skewer into the pot with new vigor, and the younger crept under the
4540: tent and reached out some platters and spoons. Maggie trembled a
4541: little, and was afraid the tears would come into her eyes. Meanwhile
4542: the tall girl gave a shrill cry, and presently came running up the boy
4543: whom Maggie had passed as he was sleeping,—a rough urchin about the age
4544: of Tom. He stared at Maggie, and there ensued much incomprehensible
4545: chattering. She felt very lonely, and was quite sure she should begin
4546: to cry before long; the gypsies didn’t seem to mind her at all, and she
4547: felt quite weak among them. But the springing tears were checked by new
4548: terror, when two men came up, whose approach had been the cause of the
4549: sudden excitement. The elder of the two carried a bag, which he flung
4550: down, addressing the women in a loud and scolding tone, which they
4551: answered by a shower of treble sauciness; while a black cur ran barking
4552: up to Maggie, and threw her into a tremor that only found a new cause
4553: in the curses with which the younger man called the dog off, and gave
4554: him a rap with a great stick he held in his hand.
4555: 
4556: Maggie felt that it was impossible she should ever be queen of these
4557: people, or ever communicate to them amusing and useful knowledge.
4558: 
4559: Both the men now seemed to be inquiring about Maggie, for they looked
4560: at her, and the tone of the conversation became of that pacific kind
4561: which implies curiosity on one side and the power of satisfying it on
4562: the other. At last the younger woman said in her previous deferential,
4563: coaxing tone,—
4564: 
4565: “This nice little lady’s come to live with us; aren’t you glad?”
4566: 
4567: “Ay, very glad,” said the younger man, who was looking at Maggie’s
4568: silver thimble and other small matters that had been taken from her
4569: pocket. He returned them all except the thimble to the younger woman,
4570: with some observation, and she immediately restored them to Maggie’s
4571: pocket, while the men seated themselves, and began to attack the
4572: contents of the kettle,—a stew of meat and potatoes,—which had been
4573: taken off the fire and turned out into a yellow platter.
4574: 
4575: Maggie began to think that Tom must be right about the gypsies; they
4576: must certainly be thieves, unless the man meant to return her thimble
4577: by and by. She would willingly have given it to him, for she was not at
4578: all attached to her thimble; but the idea that she was among thieves
4579: prevented her from feeling any comfort in the revival of deference and
4580: attention toward her; all thieves, except Robin Hood, were wicked
4581: people. The women saw she was frightened.
4582: 
4583: “We’ve got nothing nice for a lady to eat,” said the old woman, in her
4584: coaxing tone. “And she’s so hungry, sweet little lady.”
4585: 
4586: “Here, my dear, try if you can eat a bit o’ this,” said the younger
4587: woman, handing some of the stew on a brown dish with an iron spoon to
4588: Maggie, who, remembering that the old woman had seemed angry with her
4589: for not liking the bread-and-bacon, dared not refuse the stew, though
4590: fear had chased away her appetite. If her father would but come by in
4591: the gig and take her up! Or even if Jack the Giantkiller, or Mr
4592: Greatheart, or St George who slew the dragon on the half-pennies, would
4593: happen to pass that way! But Maggie thought with a sinking heart that
4594: these heroes were never seen in the neighbourhood of St Ogg’s; nothing
4595: very wonderful ever came there.
4596: 
4597: Maggie Tulliver, you perceive, was by no means that well trained,
4598: well-informed young person that a small female of eight or nine
4599: necessarily is in these days; she had only been to school a year at St
4600: Ogg’s, and had so few books that she sometimes read the dictionary; so
4601: that in travelling over her small mind you would have found the most
4602: unexpected ignorance as well as unexpected knowledge. She could have
4603: informed you that there was such a word as “polygamy,” and being also
4604: acquainted with “polysyllable,” she had deduced the conclusion that
4605: “poly” mean “many”; but she had had no idea that gypsies were not well
4606: supplied with groceries, and her thoughts generally were the oddest
4607: mixture of clear-eyed acumen and blind dreams.
4608: 
4609: Her ideas about the gypsies had undergone a rapid modification in the
4610: last five minutes. From having considered them very respectful
4611: companions, amenable to instruction, she had begun to think that they
4612: meant perhaps to kill her as soon as it was dark, and cut up her body
4613: for gradual cooking; the suspicion crossed her that the fierce-eyed old
4614: man was in fact the Devil, who might drop that transparent disguise at
4615: any moment, and turn either into the grinning blacksmith, or else a
4616: fiery-eyed monster with dragon’s wings. It was no use trying to eat the
4617: stew, and yet the thing she most dreaded was to offend the gypsies, by
4618: betraying her extremely unfavourable opinion of them; and she wondered,
4619: with a keenness of interest that no theologian could have exceeded,
4620: whether, if the Devil were really present, he would know her thoughts.
4621: 
4622: “What! you don’t like the smell of it, my dear,” said the young woman,
4623: observing that Maggie did not even take a spoonful of the stew. “Try a
4624: bit, come.”
4625: 
4626: “No, thank you,” said Maggie, summoning all her force for a desperate
4627: effort, and trying to smile in a friendly way. “I haven’t time, I
4628: think; it seems getting darker. I think I must go home now, and come
4629: again another day, and then I can bring you a basket with some
4630: jam-tarts and things.”
4631: 
4632: Maggie rose from her seat as she threw out this illusory prospect,
4633: devoutly hoping that Apollyon was gullible; but her hope sank when the
4634: old gypsy-woman said, “Stop a bit, stop a bit, little lady; we’ll take
4635: you home, all safe, when we’ve done supper; you shall ride home, like a
4636: lady.”
4637: 
4638: Maggie sat down again, with little faith in this promise, though she
4639: presently saw the tall girl putting a bridle on the donkey, and
4640: throwing a couple of bags on his back.
4641: 
4642: “Now, then, little missis,” said the younger man, rising, and leading
4643: the donkey forward, “tell us where you live; what’s the name o’ the
4644: place?”
4645: 
4646: “Dorlcote Mill is my home,” said Maggie, eagerly. “My father is Mr
4647: Tulliver; he lives there.”
4648: 
4649: “What! a big mill a little way this side o’ St Ogg’s?”
4650: 
4651: “Yes,” said Maggie. “Is it far off? I think I should like to walk
4652: there, if you please.”
4653: 
4654: “No, no, it’ll be getting dark, we must make haste. And the donkey’ll
4655: carry you as nice as can be; you’ll see.”
4656: 
4657: He lifted Maggie as he spoke, and set her on the donkey. She felt
4658: relieved that it was not the old man who seemed to be going with her,
4659: but she had only a trembling hope that she was really going home.
4660: 
4661: “Here’s your pretty bonnet,” said the younger woman, putting that
4662: recently despised but now welcome article of costume on Maggie’s head;
4663: “and you’ll say we’ve been very good to you, won’t you? and what a nice
4664: little lady we said you was.”
4665: 
4666: “Oh yes, thank you,” said Maggie, “I’m very much obliged to you. But I
4667: wish you’d go with me too.” She thought anything was better than going
4668: with one of the dreadful men alone; it would be more cheerful to be
4669: murdered by a larger party.
4670: 
4671: “Ah, you’re fondest o’ _me_, aren’t you?” said the woman. “But I can’t
4672: go; you’ll go too fast for me.”
4673: 
4674: It now appeared that the man also was to be seated on the donkey,
4675: holding Maggie before him, and she was as incapable of remonstrating
4676: against this arrangement as the donkey himself, though no nightmare had
4677: ever seemed to her more horrible. When the woman had patted her on the
4678: back, and said “Good-by,” the donkey, at a strong hint from the man’s
4679: stick, set off at a rapid walk along the lane toward the point Maggie
4680: had come from an hour ago, while the tall girl and the rough urchin,
4681: also furnished with sticks, obligingly escorted them for the first
4682: hundred yards, with much screaming and thwacking.
4683: 
4684: Not Leonore, in that preternatural midnight excursion with her phantom
4685: lover, was more terrified than poor Maggie in this entirely natural
4686: ride on a short-paced donkey, with a gypsy behind her, who considered
4687: that he was earning half a crown. The red light of the setting sun
4688: seemed to have a portentous meaning, with which the alarming bray of
4689: the second donkey with the log on its foot must surely have some
4690: connection. Two low thatched cottages—the only houses they passed in
4691: this lane—seemed to add to its dreariness; they had no windows to speak
4692: of, and the doors were closed; it was probable that they were
4693: inhabitated by witches, and it was a relief to find that the donkey did
4694: not stop there.
4695: 
4696: At last—oh, sight of joy!—this lane, the longest in the world, was
4697: coming to an end, was opening on a broad highroad, where there was
4698: actually a coach passing! And there was a finger-post at the
4699: corner,—she had surely seen that finger-post before,—“To St Ogg’s, 2
4700: miles.” The gypsy really meant to take her home, then; he was probably
4701: a good man, after all, and might have been rather hurt at the thought
4702: that she didn’t like coming with him alone. This idea became stronger
4703: as she felt more and more certain that she knew the road quite well,
4704: and she was considering how she might open a conversation with the
4705: injured gypsy, and not only gratify his feelings but efface the
4706: impression of her cowardice, when, as they reached a cross-road. Maggie
4707: caught sight of some one coming on a white-faced horse.
4708: 
4709: “Oh, stop, stop!” she cried out. “There’s my father! Oh, father,
4710: father!”
4711: 
4712: The sudden joy was almost painful, and before her father reached her,
4713: she was sobbing. Great was Mr Tulliver’s wonder, for he had made a
4714: round from Basset, and had not yet been home.
4715: 
4716: “Why, what’s the meaning o’ this?” he said, checking his horse, while
4717: Maggie slipped from the donkey and ran to her father’s stirrup.
4718: 
4719: “The little miss lost herself, I reckon,” said the gypsy. “She’d come
4720: to our tent at the far end o’ Dunlow Lane, and I was bringing her where
4721: she said her home was. It’s a good way to come after being on the tramp
4722: all day.”
4723: 
4724: “Oh yes, father, he’s been very good to bring me home,” said Maggie,—“a
4725: very kind, good man!”
4726: 
4727: “Here, then, my man,” said Mr Tulliver, taking out five shillings.
4728: “It’s the best day’s work _you_ ever did. I couldn’t afford to lose the
4729: little wench; here, lift her up before me.”
4730: 
4731: “Why, Maggie, how’s this, how’s this?” he said, as they rode along,
4732: while she laid her head against her father and sobbed. “How came you to
4733: be rambling about and lose yourself?”
4734: 
4735: “Oh, father,” sobbed Maggie, “I ran away because I was so unhappy; Tom
4736: was so angry with me. I couldn’t bear it.”
4737: 
4738: “Pooh, pooh,” said Mr Tulliver, soothingly, “you mustn’t think o’
4739: running away from father. What ’ud father do without his little wench?”
4740: 
4741: “Oh no, I never will again, father—never.”
4742: 
4743: Mr Tulliver spoke his mind very strongly when he reached home that
4744: evening; and the effect was seen in the remarkable fact that Maggie
4745: never heard one reproach from her mother, or one taunt from Tom, about
4746: this foolish business of her running away to the gypsies. Maggie was
4747: rather awe-stricken by this unusual treatment, and sometimes thought
4748: that her conduct had been too wicked to be alluded to.
4749: 
4750: 
4751: Chapter XII.
4752: 
4753: Mr and Mrs Glegg at Home
4754: 
4755: In order to see Mr and Mrs Glegg at home, we must enter the town of St
4756: Ogg’s,—that venerable town with the red fluted roofs and the broad
4757: warehouse gables, where the black ships unlade themselves of their
4758: burthens from the far north, and carry away, in exchange, the precious
4759: inland products, the well-crushed cheese and the soft fleeces which my
4760: refined readers have doubtless become acquainted with through the
4761: medium of the best classic pastorals.
4762: 
4763: It is one of those old, old towns which impress one as a continuation
4764: and outgrowth of nature, as much as the nests of the bower-birds or the
4765: winding galleries of the white ants; a town which carries the traces of
4766: its long growth and history like a millennial tree, and has sprung up
4767: and developed in the same spot between the river and the low hill from
4768: the time when the Roman legions turned their backs on it from the camp
4769: on the hillside, and the long-haired sea-kings came up the river and
4770: looked with fierce, eager eyes at the fatness of the land. It is a town
4771: “familiar with forgotten years.” The shadow of the Saxon hero-king
4772: still walks there fitfully, reviewing the scenes of his youth and
4773: love-time, and is met by the gloomier shadow of the dreadful heathen
4774: Dane, who was stabbed in the midst of his warriors by the sword of an
4775: invisible avenger, and who rises on autumn evenings like a white mist
4776: from his tumulus on the hill, and hovers in the court of the old hall
4777: by the river-side, the spot where he was thus miraculously slain in the
4778: days before the old hall was built. It was the Normans who began to
4779: build that fine old hall, which is, like the town, telling of the
4780: thoughts and hands of widely sundered generations; but it is all so old
4781: that we look with loving pardon at its inconsistencies, and are well
4782: content that they who built the stone oriel, and they who built the
4783: Gothic façade and towers of finest small brickwork with the trefoil
4784: ornament, and the windows and battlements defined with stone, did not
4785: sacrilegiously pull down the ancient half-timbered body with its
4786: oak-roofed banqueting-hall.
4787: 
4788: But older even than this old hall is perhaps the bit of wall now built
4789: into the belfry of the parish church, and said to be a remnant of the
4790: original chapel dedicated to St Ogg, the patron saint of this ancient
4791: town, of whose history I possess several manuscript versions. I incline
4792: to the briefest, since, if it should not be wholly true, it is at least
4793: likely to contain the least falsehood. “Ogg the son of Beorl,” says my
4794: private hagiographer, “was a boatman who gained a scanty living by
4795: ferrying passengers across the river Floss. And it came to pass, one
4796: evening when the winds were high, that there sat moaning by the brink
4797: of the river a woman with a child in her arms; and she was clad in
4798: rags, and had a worn and withered look, and she craved to be rowed
4799: across the river. And the men thereabout questioned her, and said,
4800: ‘Wherefore dost thou desire to cross the river? Tarry till the morning,
4801: and take shelter here for the night; so shalt thou be wise and not
4802: foolish.’ Still she went on to mourn and crave. But Ogg the son of
4803: Beorl came up and said, ‘I will ferry thee across; it is enough that
4804: thy heart needs it.’ And he ferried her across. And it came to pass,
4805: when she stepped ashore, that her rags were turned into robes of
4806: flowing white, and her face became bright with exceeding beauty, and
4807: there was a glory around it, so that she shed a light on the water like
4808: the moon in its brightness. And she said, ‘Ogg, the son of Beorl, thou
4809: art blessed in that thou didst not question and wrangle with the
4810: heart’s need, but wast smitten with pity, and didst straightway relieve
4811: the same. And from henceforth whoso steps into thy boat shall be in no
4812: peril from the storm; and whenever it puts forth to the rescue, it
4813: shall save the lives both of men and beasts.’ And when the floods came,
4814: many were saved by reason of that blessing on the boat. But when Ogg
4815: the son of Beorl died, behold, in the parting of his soul, the boat
4816: loosed itself from its moorings, and was floated with the ebbing tide
4817: in great swiftness to the ocean, and was seen no more. Yet it was
4818: witnessed in the floods of aftertime, that at the coming on of
4819: eventide, Ogg the son of Beorl was always seen with his boat upon the
4820: wide-spreading waters, and the Blessed Virgin sat in the prow, shedding
4821: a light around as of the moon in its brightness, so that the rowers in
4822: the gathering darkness took heart and pulled anew.”
4823: 
4824: This legend, one sees, reflects from a far-off time the visitation of
4825: the floods, which, even when they left human life untouched, were
4826: widely fatal to the helpless cattle, and swept as sudden death over all
4827: smaller living things. But the town knew worse troubles even than the
4828: floods,—troubles of the civil wars, when it was a continual
4829: fighting-place, where first Puritans thanked God for the blood of the
4830: Loyalists, and then Loyalists thanked God for the blood of the
4831: Puritans. Many honest citizens lost all their possessions for
4832: conscience’ sake in those times, and went forth beggared from their
4833: native town. Doubtless there are many houses standing now on which
4834: those honest citizens turned their backs in sorrow,—quaint-gabled
4835: houses looking on the river, jammed between newer warehouses, and
4836: penetrated by surprising passages, which turn and turn at sharp angles
4837: till they lead you out on a muddy strand overflowed continually by the
4838: rushing tide. Everywhere the brick houses have a mellow look, and in
4839: Mrs Glegg’s day there was no incongruous new-fashioned smartness, no
4840: plate-glass in shop-windows, no fresh stucco-facing or other fallacious
4841: attempt to make fine old red St Ogg’s wear the air of a town that
4842: sprang up yesterday. The shop-windows were small and unpretending; for
4843: the farmers’ wives and daughters who came to do their shopping on
4844: market-days were not to be withdrawn from their regular well-known
4845: shops; and the tradesmen had no wares intended for customers who would
4846: go on their way and be seen no more. Ah! even Mrs Glegg’s day seems far
4847: back in the past now, separated from us by changes that widen the
4848: years. War and the rumor of war had then died out from the minds of
4849: men, and if they were ever thought of by the farmers in drab
4850: greatcoats, who shook the grain out of their sample-bags and buzzed
4851: over it in the full market-place, it was as a state of things that
4852: belonged to a past golden age when prices were high. Surely the time
4853: was gone forever when the broad river could bring up unwelcome ships;
4854: Russia was only the place where the linseed came from,—the more the
4855: better,—making grist for the great vertical millstones with their
4856: scythe-like arms, roaring and grinding and carefully sweeping as if an
4857: informing soul were in them. The Catholics, bad harvests, and the
4858: mysterious fluctuations of trade were the three evils mankind had to
4859: fear; even the floods had not been great of late years. The mind of St
4860: Ogg’s did not look extensively before or after. It inherited a long
4861: past without thinking of it, and had no eyes for the spirits that walk
4862: the streets. Since the centuries when St Ogg with his boat and the
4863: Virgin Mother at the prow had been seen on the wide water, so many
4864: memories had been left behind, and had gradually vanished like the
4865: receding hilltops! And the present time was like the level plain where
4866: men lose their belief in volcanoes and earthquakes, thinking to-morrow
4867: will be as yesterday, and the giant forces that used to shake the earth
4868: are forever laid to sleep. The days were gone when people could be
4869: greatly wrought upon by their faith, still less change it; the
4870: Catholics were formidable because they would lay hold of government and
4871: property, and burn men alive; not because any sane and honest
4872: parishioner of St Ogg’s could be brought to believe in the Pope. One
4873: aged person remembered how a rude multitude had been swayed when John
4874: Wesley preached in the cattle-market; but for a long while it had not
4875: been expected of preachers that they should shake the souls of men. An
4876: occasional burst of fervor in Dissenting pulpits on the subject of
4877: infant baptism was the only symptom of a zeal unsuited to sober times
4878: when men had done with change. Protestantism sat at ease, unmindful of
4879: schisms, careless of proselytism: Dissent was an inheritance along with
4880: a superior pew and a business connection; and Churchmanship only
4881: wondered contemptuously at Dissent as a foolish habit that clung
4882: greatly to families in the grocery and chandlering lines, though not
4883: incompatible with prosperous wholesale dealing. But with the Catholic
4884: Question had come a slight wind of controversy to break the calm: the
4885: elderly rector had become occasionally historical and argumentative;
4886: and Mr Spray, the Independent minister, had begun to preach political
4887: sermons, in which he distinguished with much subtlety between his
4888: fervent belief in the right of the Catholics to the franchise and his
4889: fervent belief in their eternal perdition. Most of Mr Spray’s hearers,
4890: however, were incapable of following his subtleties, and many
4891: old-fashioned Dissenters were much pained by his “siding with the
4892: Catholics”; while others thought he had better let politics alone.
4893: Public spirit was not held in high esteem at St Ogg’s, and men who
4894: busied themselves with political questions were regarded with some
4895: suspicion, as dangerous characters; they were usually persons who had
4896: little or no business of their own to manage, or, if they had, were
4897: likely enough to become insolvent.
4898: 
4899: This was the general aspect of things at St Ogg’s in Mrs Glegg’s day,
4900: and at that particular period in her family history when she had had
4901: her quarrel with Mr Tulliver. It was a time when ignorance was much
4902: more comfortable than at present, and was received with all the honours
4903: in very good society, without being obliged to dress itself in an
4904: elaborate costume of knowledge; a time when cheap periodicals were not,
4905: and when country surgeons never thought of asking their female patients
4906: if they were fond of reading, but simply took it for granted that they
4907: preferred gossip; a time when ladies in rich silk gowns wore large
4908: pockets, in which they carried a mutton-bone to secure them against
4909: cramp. Mrs Glegg carried such a bone, which she had inherited from her
4910: grandmother with a brocaded gown that would stand up empty, like a suit
4911: of armor, and a silver-headed walking-stick; for the Dodson family had
4912: been respectable for many generations.
4913: 
4914: Mrs Glegg had both a front and a back parlour in her excellent house at
4915: St Ogg’s, so that she had two points of view from which she could
4916: observe the weakness of her fellow-beings, and reinforce her
4917: thankfulness for her own exceptional strength of mind. From her front
4918: window she could look down the Tofton Road, leading out of St Ogg’s,
4919: and note the growing tendency to “gadding about” in the wives of men
4920: not retired from business, together with a practice of wearing woven
4921: cotton stockings, which opened a dreary prospect for the coming
4922: generation; and from her back windows she could look down the pleasant
4923: garden and orchard which stretched to the river, and observe the folly
4924: of Mr Glegg in spending his time among “them flowers and vegetables.”
4925: For Mr Glegg, having retired from active business as a wool-stapler for
4926: the purpose of enjoying himself through the rest of his life, had found
4927: this last occupation so much more severe than his business, that he had
4928: been driven into amateur hard labour as a dissipation, and habitually
4929: relaxed by doing the work of two ordinary gardeners. The economizing of
4930: a gardener’s wages might perhaps have induced Mrs Glegg to wink at this
4931: folly, if it were possible for a healthy female mind even to simulate
4932: respect for a husband’s hobby. But it is well known that this conjugal
4933: complacency belongs only to the weaker portion of the sex, who are
4934: scarcely alive to the responsibilities of a wife as a constituted check
4935: on her husband’s pleasures, which are hardly ever of a rational or
4936: commendable kind.
4937: 
4938: Mr Glegg on his side, too, had a double source of mental occupation,
4939: which gave every promise of being inexhaustible. On the one hand, he
4940: surprised himself by his discoveries in natural history, finding that
4941: his piece of garden-ground contained wonderful caterpillars, slugs, and
4942: insects, which, so far as he had heard, had never before attracted
4943: human observation; and he noticed remarkable coincidences between these
4944: zoological phenomena and the great events of that time,—as, for
4945: example, that before the burning of York Minster there had been
4946: mysterious serpentine marks on the leaves of the rose-trees, together
4947: with an unusual prevalence of slugs, which he had been puzzled to know
4948: the meaning of, until it flashed upon him with this melancholy
4949: conflagration. (Mr Glegg had an unusual amount of mental activity,
4950: which, when disengaged from the wool business, naturally made itself a
4951: pathway in other directions.) And his second subject of meditation was
4952: the “contrairiness” of the female mind, as typically exhibited in Mrs
4953: Glegg. That a creature made—in a genealogical sense—out of a man’s rib,
4954: and in this particular case maintained in the highest respectability
4955: without any trouble of her own, should be normally in a state of
4956: contradiction to the blandest propositions and even to the most
4957: accommodating concessions, was a mystery in the scheme of things to
4958: which he had often in vain sought a clew in the early chapters of
4959: Genesis. Mr Glegg had chosen the eldest Miss Dodson as a handsome
4960: embodiment of female prudence and thrift, and being himself of a
4961: money-getting, money-keeping turn, had calculated on much conjugal
4962: harmony. But in that curious compound, the feminine character, it may
4963: easily happen that the flavour is unpleasant in spite of excellent
4964: ingredients; and a fine systematic stinginess may be accompanied with a
4965: seasoning that quite spoils its relish. Now, good Mr Glegg himself was
4966: stingy in the most amiable manner; his neighbours called him “near,”
4967: which always means that the person in question is a lovable skinflint.
4968: If you expressed a preference for cheese-parings, Mr Glegg would
4969: remember to save them for you, with a good-natured delight in
4970: gratifying your palate, and he was given to pet all animals which
4971: required no appreciable keep. There was no humbug or hypocrisy about Mr
4972: Glegg; his eyes would have watered with true feeling over the sale of a
4973: widow’s furniture, which a five-pound note from his side pocket would
4974: have prevented; but a donation of five pounds to a person “in a small
4975: way of life” would have seemed to him a mad kind of lavishness rather
4976: than “charity,” which had always presented itself to him as a
4977: contribution of small aids, not a neutralizing of misfortune. And Mr
4978: Glegg was just as fond of saving other people’s money as his own; he
4979: would have ridden as far round to avoid a turnpike when his expenses
4980: were to be paid for him, as when they were to come out of his own
4981: pocket, and was quite zealous in trying to induce indifferent
4982: acquaintances to adopt a cheap substitute for blacking. This
4983: inalienable habit of saving, as an end in itself, belonged to the
4984: industrious men of business of a former generation, who made their
4985: fortunes slowly, almost as the tracking of the fox belongs to the
4986: harrier,—it constituted them a “race,” which is nearly lost in these
4987: days of rapid money-getting, when lavishness comes close on the back of
4988: want. In old-fashioned times an “independence” was hardly ever made
4989: without a little miserliness as a condition, and you would have found
4990: that quality in every provincial district, combined with characters as
4991: various as the fruits from which we can extract acid. The true
4992: Harpagons were always marked and exceptional characters; not so the
4993: worthy tax-payers, who, having once pinched from real necessity,
4994: retained even in the midst of their comfortable retirement, with their
4995: wallfruit and wine-bins, the habit of regarding life as an ingenious
4996: process of nibbling out one’s livelihood without leaving any
4997: perceptible deficit, and who would have been as immediately prompted to
4998: give up a newly taxed luxury when they had had their clear five hundred
4999: a year, as when they had only five hundred pounds of capital. Mr Glegg
5000: was one of these men, found so impracticable by chancellors of the
5001: exchequer; and knowing this, you will be the better able to understand
5002: why he had not swerved from the conviction that he had made an eligible
5003: marriage, in spite of the too pungent seasoning that nature had given
5004: to the eldest Miss Dodson’s virtues. A man with an affectionate
5005: disposition, who finds a wife to concur with his fundamental idea of
5006: life, easily comes to persuade himself that no other woman would have
5007: suited him so well, and does a little daily snapping and quarrelling
5008: without any sense of alienation. Mr Glegg, being of a reflective turn,
5009: and no longer occupied with wool, had much wondering meditation on the
5010: peculiar constitution of the female mind as unfolded to him in his
5011: domestic life; and yet he thought Mrs Glegg’s household ways a model
5012: for her sex. It struck him as a pitiable irregularity in other women if
5013: they did not roll up their table-napkins with the same tightness and
5014: emphasis as Mrs Glegg did, if their pastry had a less leathery
5015: consistence, and their damson cheese a less venerable hardness than
5016: hers; nay, even the peculiar combination of grocery and druglike odors
5017: in Mrs Glegg’s private cupboard impressed him as the only right thing
5018: in the way of cupboard smells. I am not sure that he would not have
5019: longed for the quarrelling again, if it had ceased for an entire week;
5020: and it is certain that an acquiescent, mild wife would have left his
5021: meditations comparatively jejune and barren of mystery.
5022: 
5023: Mr Glegg’s unmistakable kind-heartedness was shown in this, that it
5024: pained him more to see his wife at variance with others,—even with
5025: Dolly, the servant,—than to be in a state of cavil with her himself;
5026: and the quarrel between her and Mr Tulliver vexed him so much that it
5027: quite nullified the pleasure he would otherwise have had in the state
5028: of his early cabbages, as he walked in his garden before breakfast the
5029: next morning. Still, he went in to breakfast with some slight hope
5030: that, now Mrs Glegg had “slept upon it,” her anger might be subdued
5031: enough to give way to her usually strong sense of family decorum. She
5032: had been used to boast that there had never been any of those deadly
5033: quarrels among the Dodsons which had disgraced other families; that no
5034: Dodson had ever been “cut off with a shilling,” and no cousin of the
5035: Dodsons disowned; as, indeed, why should they be? For they had no
5036: cousins who had not money out at use, or some houses of their own, at
5037: the very least.
5038: 
5039: There was one evening-cloud which had always disappeared from Mrs
5040: Glegg’s brow when she sat at the breakfast-table. It was her fuzzy
5041: front of curls; for as she occupied herself in household matters in the
5042: morning it would have been a mere extravagance to put on anything so
5043: superfluous to the making of leathery pastry as a fuzzy curled front.
5044: By half-past ten decorum demanded the front; until then Mrs Glegg could
5045: economise it, and society would never be any the wiser. But the absence
5046: of that cloud only left it more apparent that the cloud of severity
5047: remained; and Mr Glegg, perceiving this, as he sat down to his
5048: milkporridge, which it was his old frugal habit to stem his morning
5049: hunger with, prudently resolved to leave the first remark to Mrs Glegg,
5050: lest, to so delicate an article as a lady’s temper, the slightest touch
5051: should do mischief. People who seem to enjoy their ill temper have a
5052: way of keeping it in fine condition by inflicting privations on
5053: themselves. That was Mrs Glegg’s way. She made her tea weaker than
5054: usual this morning, and declined butter. It was a hard case that a
5055: vigorous mood for quarrelling, so highly capable of using an
5056: opportunity, should not meet with a single remark from Mr Glegg on
5057: which to exercise itself. But by and by it appeared that his silence
5058: would answer the purpose, for he heard himself apostrophised at last in
5059: that tone peculiar to the wife of one’s bosom.
5060: 
5061: “Well, Mr Glegg! it’s a poor return I get for making you the wife I’ve
5062: made you all these years. If this is the way I’m to be treated, I’d
5063: better ha’ known it before my poor father died, and then, when I’d
5064: wanted a home, I should ha’ gone elsewhere, as the choice was offered
5065: me.”
5066: 
5067: Mr Glegg paused from his porridge and looked up, not with any new
5068: amazement, but simply with that quiet, habitual wonder with which we
5069: regard constant mysteries.
5070: 
5071: “Why, Mrs G., what have I done now?”
5072: 
5073: “Done now, Mr Glegg? _done now?_—I’m sorry for you.”
5074: 
5075: Not seeing his way to any pertinent answer, Mr Glegg reverted to his
5076: porridge.
5077: 
5078: “There’s husbands in the world,” continued Mrs Glegg, after a pause,
5079: “as ’ud have known how to do something different to siding with
5080: everybody else against their own wives. Perhaps I’m wrong and you can
5081: teach me better. But I’ve allays heard as it’s the husband’s place to
5082: stand by the wife, instead o’ rejoicing and triumphing when folks
5083: insult her.”
5084: 
5085: “Now, what call have you to say that?” said Mr Glegg, rather warmly,
5086: for though a kind man, he was not as meek as Moses. “When did I rejoice
5087: or triumph over you?”
5088: 
5089: “There’s ways o’ doing things worse than speaking out plain, Mr Glegg.
5090: I’d sooner you’d tell me to my face as you make light of me, than try
5091: to make out as everybody’s in the right but me, and come to your
5092: breakfast in the morning, as I’ve hardly slept an hour this night, and
5093: sulk at me as if I was the dirt under your feet.”
5094: 
5095: “Sulk at you?” said Mr Glegg, in a tone of angry facetiousness. “You’re
5096: like a tipsy man as thinks everybody’s had too much but himself.”
5097: 
5098: “Don’t lower yourself with using coarse language to _me_, Mr Glegg! It
5099: makes you look very small, though you can’t see yourself,” said Mrs
5100: Glegg, in a tone of energetic compassion. “A man in your place should
5101: set an example, and talk more sensible.”
5102: 
5103: “Yes; but will you listen to sense?” retorted Mr Glegg, sharply. “The
5104: best sense I can talk to you is what I said last night,—as you’re i’
5105: the wrong to think o’ calling in your money, when it’s safe enough if
5106: you’d let it alone, all because of a bit of a tiff, and I was in hopes
5107: you’d ha’ altered your mind this morning. But if you’d like to call it
5108: in, don’t do it in a hurry now, and breed more enmity in the family,
5109: but wait till there’s a pretty mortgage to be had without any trouble.
5110: You’d have to set the lawyer to work now to find an investment, and
5111: make no end o’ expense.”
5112: 
5113: Mrs Glegg felt there was really something in this, but she tossed her
5114: head and emitted a guttural interjection to indicate that her silence
5115: was only an armistice, not a peace. And, in fact hostilities soon broke
5116: out again.
5117: 
5118: “I’ll thank you for my cup o’ tea, now, Mrs G.,” said Mr Glegg, seeing
5119: that she did not proceed to give it him as usual, when he had finished
5120: his porridge. She lifted the teapot with a slight toss of the head, and
5121: said,—
5122: 
5123: “I’m glad to hear you’ll _thank_ me, Mr Glegg. It’s little thanks _I_
5124: get for what I do for folks i’ this world. Though there’s never a woman
5125: o’ _your_ side o’ the family, Mr Glegg, as is fit to stand up with me,
5126: and I’d say it if I was on my dying bed. Not but what I’ve allays
5127: conducted myself civil to your kin, and there isn’t one of ’em can say
5128: the contrary, though my equils they aren’t, and nobody shall make me
5129: say it.”
5130: 
5131: “You’d better leave finding fault wi’ my kin till you’ve left off
5132: quarrelling with your own, Mrs G.,” said Mr Glegg, with angry sarcasm.
5133: “I’ll trouble you for the milk-jug.”
5134: 
5135: “That’s as false a word as ever you spoke, Mr Glegg,” said the lady,
5136: pouring out the milk with unusual profuseness, as much as to say, if he
5137: wanted milk he should have it with a vengeance. “And you know it’s
5138: false. I’m not the woman to quarrel with my own kin; _you_ may, for
5139: I’ve known you to do it.”
5140: 
5141: “Why, what did you call it yesterday, then, leaving your sister’s house
5142: in a tantrum?”
5143: 
5144: “I’d no quarrel wi’ my sister, Mr Glegg, and it’s false to say it. Mr
5145: Tulliver’s none o’ my blood, and it was him quarrelled with me, and
5146: drove me out o’ the house. But perhaps you’d have had me stay and be
5147: swore at, Mr Glegg; perhaps you was vexed not to hear more abuse and
5148: foul language poured out upo’ your own wife. But, let me tell you, it’s
5149: _your_ disgrace.”
5150: 
5151: “Did ever anybody hear the like i’ this parish?” said Mr Glegg, getting
5152: hot. “A woman, with everything provided for her, and allowed to keep
5153: her own money the same as if it was settled on her, and with a gig new
5154: stuffed and lined at no end o’ expense, and provided for when I die
5155: beyond anything she could expect—to go on i’ this way, biting and
5156: snapping like a mad dog! It’s beyond everything, as God A ’mighty
5157: should ha’ made women _so_.” (These last words were uttered in a tone
5158: of sorrowful agitation. Mr Glegg pushed his tea from him, and tapped
5159: the table with both his hands.)
5160: 
5161: “Well, Mr Glegg, if those are your feelings, it’s best they should be
5162: known,” said Mrs Glegg, taking off her napkin, and folding it in an
5163: excited manner. “But if you talk o’ my being provided for beyond what I
5164: could expect, I beg leave to tell you as I’d a right to expect a many
5165: things as I don’t find. And as to my being like a mad dog, it’s well if
5166: you’re not cried shame on by the county for your treatment of me, for
5167: it’s what I can’t bear, and I won’t bear——”
5168: 
5169: Here Mrs Glegg’s voice intimated that she was going to cry, and
5170: breaking off from speech, she rang the bell violently.
5171: 
5172: “Sally,” she said, rising from her chair, and speaking in rather a
5173: choked voice, “light a fire up-stairs, and put the blinds down. Mr
5174: Glegg, you’ll please to order what you’d like for dinner. I shall have
5175: gruel.”
5176: 
5177: Mrs Glegg walked across the room to the small book-case, and took down
5178: Baxter’s “Saints’ Everlasting Rest,” which she carried with her
5179: up-stairs. It was the book she was accustomed to lay open before her on
5180: special occasions,—on wet Sunday mornings, or when she heard of a death
5181: in the family, or when, as in this case, her quarrel with Mr Glegg had
5182: been set an octave higher than usual.
5183: 
5184: But Mrs Glegg carried something else up-stairs with her, which,
5185: together with the “Saints’ Rest” and the gruel, may have had some
5186: influence in gradually calming her feelings, and making it possible for
5187: her to endure existence on the ground-floor, shortly before tea-time.
5188: This was, partly, Mr Glegg’s suggestion that she would do well to let
5189: her five hundred lie still until a good investment turned up; and,
5190: further, his parenthetic hint at his handsome provision for her in case
5191: of his death. Mr Glegg, like all men of his stamp, was extremely
5192: reticent about his will; and Mrs Glegg, in her gloomier moments, had
5193: forebodings that, like other husbands of whom she had heard, he might
5194: cherish the mean project of heightening her grief at his death by
5195: leaving her poorly off, in which case she was firmly resolved that she
5196: would have scarcely any weeper on her bonnet, and would cry no more
5197: than if he had been a second husband. But if he had really shown her
5198: any testamentary tenderness, it would be affecting to think of him,
5199: poor man, when he was gone; and even his foolish fuss about the flowers
5200: and garden-stuff, and his insistence on the subject of snails, would be
5201: touching when it was once fairly at an end. To survive Mr Glegg, and
5202: talk eulogistically of him as a man who might have his weaknesses, but
5203: who had done the right thing by her, not-withstanding his numerous poor
5204: relations; to have sums of interest coming in more frequently, and
5205: secrete it in various corners, baffling to the most ingenious of
5206: thieves (for, to Mrs Glegg’s mind, banks and strong-boxes would have
5207: nullified the pleasure of property; she might as well have taken her
5208: food in capsules); finally, to be looked up to by her own family and
5209: the neighbourhood, so as no woman can ever hope to be who has not the
5210: præterite and present dignity comprised in being a “widow well
5211: left,”—all this made a flattering and conciliatory view of the future.
5212: So that when good Mr Glegg, restored to good humour by much hoeing, and
5213: moved by the sight of his wife’s empty chair, with her knitting rolled
5214: up in the corner, went up-stairs to her, and observed that the bell had
5215: been tolling for poor Mr Morton, Mrs Glegg answered magnanimously,
5216: quite as if she had been an uninjured woman: “Ah! then, there’ll be a
5217: good business for somebody to take to.”
5218: 
5219: Baxter had been open at least eight hours by this time, for it was
5220: nearly five o’clock; and if people are to quarrel often, it follows as
5221: a corollary that their quarrels cannot be protracted beyond certain
5222: limits.
5223: 
5224: Mr and Mrs Glegg talked quite amicably about the Tullivers that
5225: evening. Mr Glegg went the length of admitting that Tulliver was a sad
5226: man for getting into hot water, and was like enough to run through his
5227: property; and Mrs Glegg, meeting this acknowledgment half-way, declared
5228: that it was beneath her to take notice of such a man’s conduct, and
5229: that, for her sister’s sake, she would let him keep the five hundred a
5230: while longer, for when she put it out on a mortgage she should only get
5231: four per cent.
5232: 
5233: 
5234: Chapter XIII.
5235: 
5236: Mr Tulliver Further Entangles the Skein of Life
5237: 
5238: Owing to this new adjustment of Mrs Glegg’s thoughts, Mrs Pullet found
5239: her task of mediation the next day surprisingly easy. Mrs Glegg, indeed
5240: checked her rather sharply for thinking it would be necessary to tell
5241: her elder sister what was the right mode of behaviour in family
5242: matters. Mrs Pullet’s argument, that it would look ill in the
5243: neighbourhood if people should have it in their power to say that there
5244: was a quarrel in the family, was particularly offensive. If the family
5245: name never suffered except through Mrs Glegg, Mrs Pullet might lay her
5246: head on her pillow in perfect confidence.
5247: 
5248: “It’s not to be expected, I suppose,” observed Mrs Glegg, by way of
5249: winding up the subject, “as I shall go to the mill again before Bessy
5250: comes to see me, or as I shall go and fall down o’ my knees to Mr
5251: Tulliver, and ask his pardon for showing him favours; but I shall bear
5252: no malice, and when Mr Tulliver speaks civil to me, I’ll speak civil to
5253: him. Nobody has any call to tell me what’s becoming.”
5254: 
5255: Finding it unnecessary to plead for the Tullivers, it was natural that
5256: aunt Pullet should relax a little in her anxiety for them, and recur to
5257: the annoyance she had suffered yesterday from the offspring of that
5258: apparently ill-fated house. Mrs Glegg heard a circumstantial narrative,
5259: to which Mr Pullet’s remarkable memory furnished some items; and while
5260: aunt Pullet pitied poor Bessy’s bad luck with her children, and
5261: expressed a half-formed project of paying for Maggie’s being sent to a
5262: distant boarding-school, which would not prevent her being so brown,
5263: but might tend to subdue some other vices in her, aunt Glegg blamed
5264: Bessy for her weakness, and appealed to all witnesses who should be
5265: living when the Tulliver children had turned out ill, that she, Mrs
5266: Glegg, had always said how it would be from the very first, observing
5267: that it was wonderful to herself how all her words came true.
5268: 
5269: “Then I may call and tell Bessy you’ll bear no malice, and everything
5270: be as it was before?” Mrs Pullet said, just before parting.
5271: 
5272: “Yes, you may, Sophy,” said Mrs Glegg; “you may tell Mr Tulliver, and
5273: Bessy too, as I’m not going to behave ill because folks behave ill to
5274: me; I know it’s my place, as the eldest, to set an example in every
5275: respect, and I do it. Nobody can say different of me, if they’ll keep
5276: to the truth.”
5277: 
5278: Mrs Glegg being in this state of satisfaction in her own lofty
5279: magnanimity, I leave you to judge what effect was produced on her by
5280: the reception of a short letter from Mr Tulliver that very evening,
5281: after Mrs Pullet’s departure, informing her that she needn’t trouble
5282: her mind about her five hundred pounds, for it should be paid back to
5283: her in the course of the next month at farthest, together with the
5284: interest due thereon until the time of payment. And furthermore, that
5285: Mr Tulliver had no wish to behave uncivilly to Mrs Glegg, and she was
5286: welcome to his house whenever she liked to come, but he desired no
5287: favours from her, either for himself or his children.
5288: 
5289: It was poor Mrs Tulliver who had hastened this catastrophe, entirely
5290: through that irrepressible hopefulness of hers which led her to expect
5291: that similar causes may at any time produce different results. It had
5292: very often occurred in her experience that Mr Tulliver had done
5293: something because other people had said he was not able to do it, or
5294: had pitied him for his supposed inability, or in any other way piqued
5295: his pride; still, she thought to-day, if she told him when he came in
5296: to tea that sister Pullet was gone to try and make everything up with
5297: sister Glegg, so that he needn’t think about paying in the money, it
5298: would give a cheerful effect to the meal. Mr Tulliver had never
5299: slackened in his resolve to raise the money, but now he at once
5300: determined to write a letter to Mrs Glegg, which should cut off all
5301: possibility of mistake. Mrs Pullet gone to beg and pray for _him_
5302: indeed! Mr Tulliver did not willingly write a letter, and found the
5303: relation between spoken and written language, briefly known as
5304: spelling, one of the most puzzling things in this puzzling world.
5305: Nevertheless, like all fervid writing, the task was done in less time
5306: than usual, and if the spelling differed from Mrs Glegg’s,—why, she
5307: belonged, like himself, to a generation with whom spelling was a matter
5308: of private judgment.
5309: 
5310: Mrs Glegg did not alter her will in consequence of this letter, and cut
5311: off the Tulliver children from their sixth and seventh share in her
5312: thousand pounds; for she had her principles. No one must be able to say
5313: of her when she was dead that she had not divided her money with
5314: perfect fairness among her own kin. In the matter of wills, personal
5315: qualities were subordinate to the great fundamental fact of blood; and
5316: to be determined in the distribution of your property by caprice, and
5317: not make your legacies bear a direct ratio to degrees of kinship, was a
5318: prospective disgrace that would have embittered her life. This had
5319: always been a principle in the Dodson family; it was one form of that
5320: sense of honour and rectitude which was a proud tradition in such
5321: families,—a tradition which has been the salt of our provincial
5322: society.
5323: 
5324: But though the letter could not shake Mrs Glegg’s principles, it made
5325: the family breach much more difficult to mend; and as to the effect it
5326: produced on Mrs Glegg’s opinion of Mr Tulliver, she begged to be
5327: understood from that time forth that she had nothing whatever to say
5328: about him; his state of mind, apparently, was too corrupt for her to
5329: contemplate it for a moment. It was not until the evening before Tom
5330: went to school, at the beginning of August, that Mrs Glegg paid a visit
5331: to her sister Tulliver, sitting in her gig all the while, and showing
5332: her displeasure by markedly abstaining from all advice and criticism;
5333: for, as she observed to her sister Deane, “Bessy must bear the
5334: consequence o’ having such a husband, though I’m sorry for her,” and
5335: Mrs Deane agreed that Bessy was pitiable.
5336: 
5337: That evening Tom observed to Maggie: “Oh my! Maggie, aunt Glegg’s
5338: beginning to come again; I’m glad I’m going to school. _You’ll_ catch
5339: it all now!”
5340: 
5341: Maggie was already so full of sorrow at the thought of Tom’s going away
5342: from her, that this playful exultation of his seemed very unkind, and
5343: she cried herself to sleep that night.
5344: 
5345: Mr Tulliver’s prompt procedure entailed on him further promptitude in
5346: finding the convenient person who was desirous of lending five hundred
5347: pounds on bond. “It must be no client of Wakem’s,” he said to himself;
5348: and yet at the end of a fortnight it turned out to the contrary; not
5349: because Mr Tulliver’s will was feeble, but because external fact was
5350: stronger. Wakem’s client was the only convenient person to be found. Mr
5351: Tulliver had a destiny as well as Œdipus, and in this case he might
5352: plead, like Œdipus, that his deed was inflicted on him rather than
5353: committed by him.

5359: 
5360: 
5361: Chapter I.
5362: 
5363: Tom’s “First Half”
5364: 
5365: Tom Tulliver’s sufferings during the first quarter he was at King’s
5366: Lorton, under the distinguished care of the Rev. Walter Stelling, were
5367: rather severe. At Mr Jacob’s academy life had not presented itself to
5368: him as a difficult problem; there were plenty of fellows to play with,
5369: and Tom being good at all active games,—fighting especially,—had that
5370: precedence among them which appeared to him inseparable from the
5371: personality of Tom Tulliver. Mr Jacobs himself, familiarly known as Old
5372: Goggles, from his habit of wearing spectacles, imposed no painful awe;
5373: and if it was the property of snuffy old hypocrites like him to write
5374: like copperplate and surround their signatures with arabesques, to
5375: spell without forethought, and to spout “my name is Norval” without
5376: bungling, Tom, for his part, was glad he was not in danger of those
5377: mean accomplishments. He was not going to be a snuffy schoolmaster, he,
5378: but a substantial man, like his father, who used to go hunting when he
5379: was younger, and rode a capital black mare,—as pretty a bit of
5380: horse-flesh as ever you saw; Tom had heard what her points were a
5381: hundred times. _He_ meant to go hunting too, and to be generally
5382: respected. When people were grown up, he considered, nobody inquired
5383: about their writing and spelling; when he was a man, he should be
5384: master of everything, and do just as he liked. It had been very
5385: difficult for him to reconcile himself to the idea that his school-time
5386: was to be prolonged and that he was not to be brought up to his
5387: father’s business, which he had always thought extremely pleasant; for
5388: it was nothing but riding about, giving orders, and going to market;
5389: and he thought that a clergyman would give him a great many Scripture
5390: lessons, and probably make him learn the Gospel and Epistle on a
5391: Sunday, as well as the Collect. But in the absence of specific
5392: information, it was impossible for him to imagine that school and a
5393: schoolmaster would be something entirely different from the academy of
5394: Mr Jacobs. So, not to be at a deficiency, in case of his finding genial
5395: companions, he had taken care to carry with him a small box of
5396: percussion-caps; not that there was anything particular to be done with
5397: them, but they would serve to impress strange boys with a sense of his
5398: familiarity with guns. Thus poor Tom, though he saw very clearly
5399: through Maggie’s illusions, was not without illusions of his own, which
5400: were to be cruelly dissipated by his enlarged experience at King’s
5401: Lorton.
5402: 
5403: He had not been there a fortnight before it was evident to him that
5404: life, complicated not only with the Latin grammar but with a new
5405: standard of English pronunciation, was a very difficult business, made
5406: all the more obscure by a thick mist of bashfulness. Tom, as you have
5407: observed, was never an exception among boys for ease of address; but
5408: the difficulty of enunciating a monosyllable in reply to Mr or Mrs
5409: Stelling was so great, that he even dreaded to be asked at table
5410: whether he would have more pudding. As to the percussion-caps, he had
5411: almost resolved, in the bitterness of his heart, that he would throw
5412: them into a neighbouring pond; for not only was he the solitary pupil,
5413: but he began even to have a certain scepticism about guns, and a
5414: general sense that his theory of life was undermined. For Mr Stelling
5415: thought nothing of guns, or horses either, apparently; and yet it was
5416: impossible for Tom to despise Mr Stelling as he had despised Old
5417: Goggles. If there were anything that was not thoroughly genuine about
5418: Mr Stelling, it lay quite beyond Tom’s power to detect it; it is only
5419: by a wide comparison of facts that the wisest full-grown man can
5420: distinguish well-rolled barrels from mere supernal thunder.
5421: 
5422: Mr Stelling was a well-sized, broad-chested man, not yet thirty, with
5423: flaxen hair standing erect, and large lightish-gray eyes, which were
5424: always very wide open; he had a sonorous bass voice, and an air of
5425: defiant self-confidence inclining to brazenness. He had entered on his
5426: career with great vigor, and intended to make a considerable impression
5427: on his fellow-men. The Rev. Walter Stelling was not a man who would
5428: remain among the “inferior clergy” all his life. He had a true British
5429: determination to push his way in the world,—as a schoolmaster, in the
5430: first place, for there were capital masterships of grammar-schools to
5431: be had, and Mr Stelling meant to have one of them; but as a preacher
5432: also, for he meant always to preach in a striking manner, so as to have
5433: his congregation swelled by admirers from neighbouring parishes, and to
5434: produce a great sensation whenever he took occasional duty for a
5435: brother clergyman of minor gifts. The style of preaching he had chosen
5436: was the extemporaneous, which was held little short of the miraculous
5437: in rural parishes like King’s Lorton. Some passages of Massillon and
5438: Bourdaloue, which he knew by heart, were really very effective when
5439: rolled out in Mr Stelling’s deepest tones; but as comparatively feeble
5440: appeals of his own were delivered in the same loud and impressive
5441: manner, they were often thought quite as striking by his hearers. Mr
5442: Stelling’s doctrine was of no particular school; if anything, it had a
5443: tinge of evangelicalism, for that was “the telling thing” just then in
5444: the diocese to which King’s Lorton belonged. In short, Mr Stelling was
5445: a man who meant to rise in his profession, and to rise by merit,
5446: clearly, since he had no interest beyond what might be promised by a
5447: problematic relationship to a great lawyer who had not yet become Lord
5448: Chancellor. A clergyman who has such vigorous intentions naturally gets
5449: a little into debt at starting; it is not to be expected that he will
5450: live in the meagre style of a man who means to be a poor curate all his
5451: life; and if the few hundreds Mr Timpson advanced toward his daughter’s
5452: fortune did not suffice for the purchase of handsome furniture,
5453: together with a stock of wine, a grand piano, and the laying out of a
5454: superior flower-garden, it followed in the most rigorous manner, either
5455: that these things must be procured by some other means, or else that
5456: the Rev. Mr Stelling must go without them, which last alternative would
5457: be an absurd procrastination of the fruits of success, where success
5458: was certain. Mr Stelling was so broad-chested and resolute that he felt
5459: equal to anything; he would become celebrated by shaking the
5460: consciences of his hearers, and he would by and by edit a Greek play,
5461: and invent several new readings. He had not yet selected the play, for
5462: having been married little more than two years, his leisure time had
5463: been much occupied with attentions to Mrs Stelling; but he had told
5464: that fine woman what he meant to do some day, and she felt great
5465: confidence in her husband, as a man who understood everything of that
5466: sort.
5467: 
5468: But the immediate step to future success was to bring on Tom Tulliver
5469: during this first half-year; for, by a singular coincidence, there had
5470: been some negotiation concerning another pupil from the same
5471: neighbourhood and it might further a decision in Mr Stelling’s favour,
5472: if it were understood that young Tulliver, who, Mr Stelling observed in
5473: conjugal privacy, was rather a rough cub, had made prodigious progress
5474: in a short time. It was on this ground that he was severe with Tom
5475: about his lessons; he was clearly a boy whose powers would never be
5476: developed through the medium of the Latin grammar, without the
5477: application of some sternness. Not that Mr Stelling was a
5478: harsh-tempered or unkind man; quite the contrary. He was jocose with
5479: Tom at table, and corrected his provincialisms and his deportment in
5480: the most playful manner; but poor Tom was only the more cowed and
5481: confused by this double novelty, for he had never been used to jokes at
5482: all like Mr Stelling’s; and for the first time in his life he had a
5483: painful sense that he was all wrong somehow. When Mr Stelling said, as
5484: the roast-beef was being uncovered, “Now, Tulliver! which would you
5485: rather decline, roast-beef or the Latin for it?” Tom, to whom in his
5486: coolest moments a pun would have been a hard nut, was thrown into a
5487: state of embarrassed alarm that made everything dim to him except the
5488: feeling that he would rather not have anything to do with Latin; of
5489: course he answered, “Roast-beef,” whereupon there followed much
5490: laughter and some practical joking with the plates, from which Tom
5491: gathered that he had in some mysterious way refused beef, and, in fact,
5492: made himself appear “a silly.” If he could have seen a fellow-pupil
5493: undergo these painful operations and survive them in good spirits, he
5494: might sooner have taken them as a matter of course. But there are two
5495: expensive forms of education, either of which a parent may procure for
5496: his son by sending him as solitary pupil to a clergyman: one is the
5497: enjoyment of the reverend gentleman’s undivided neglect; the other is
5498: the endurance of the reverend gentleman’s undivided attention. It was
5499: the latter privilege for which Mr Tulliver paid a high price in Tom’s
5500: initiatory months at King’s Lorton.
5501: 
5502: That respectable miller and maltster had left Tom behind, and driven
5503: homeward in a state of great mental satisfaction. He considered that it
5504: was a happy moment for him when he had thought of asking Riley’s advice
5505: about a tutor for Tom. Mr Stelling’s eyes were so wide open, and he
5506: talked in such an off-hand, matter-of-fact way, answering every
5507: difficult, slow remark of Mr Tulliver’s with, “I see, my good sir, I
5508: see”; “To be sure, to be sure”; “You want your son to be a man who will
5509: make his way in the world,”—that Mr Tulliver was delighted to find in
5510: him a clergyman whose knowledge was so applicable to the everyday
5511: affairs of this life. Except Counsellor Wylde, whom he had heard at the
5512: last sessions, Mr Tulliver thought the Rev. Mr Stelling was the
5513: shrewdest fellow he had ever met with,—not unlike Wylde, in fact; he
5514: had the same way of sticking his thumbs in the armholes of his
5515: waistcoat. Mr Tulliver was not by any means an exception in mistaking
5516: brazenness for shrewdness; most laymen thought Stelling shrewd, and a
5517: man of remarkable powers generally; it was chiefly by his clerical
5518: brethren that he was considered rather a dull fellow. But he told Mr
5519: Tulliver several stories about “Swing” and incendiarism, and asked his
5520: advice about feeding pigs in so thoroughly secular and judicious a
5521: manner, with so much polished glibness of tongue, that the miller
5522: thought, here was the very thing he wanted for Tom. He had no doubt
5523: this first-rate man was acquainted with every branch of information,
5524: and knew exactly what Tom must learn in order to become a match for the
5525: lawyers, which poor Mr Tulliver himself did _not_ know, and so was
5526: necessarily thrown for self-direction on this wide kind of inference.
5527: It is hardly fair to laugh at him, for I have known much more highly
5528: instructed persons than he make inferences quite as wide, and not at
5529: all wiser.
5530: 
5531: As for Mrs Tulliver, finding that Mrs Stelling’s views as to the airing
5532: of linen and the frequent recurrence of hunger in a growing boy
5533: entirely coincided with her own; moreover, that Mrs Stelling, though so
5534: young a woman, and only anticipating her second confinement, had gone
5535: through very nearly the same experience as herself with regard to the
5536: behaviour and fundamental character of the monthly nurse,—she expressed
5537: great contentment to her husband, when they drove away, at leaving Tom
5538: with a woman who, in spite of her youth, seemed quite sensible and
5539: motherly, and asked advice as prettily as could be.
5540: 
5541: “They must be very well off, though,” said Mrs Tulliver, “for
5542: everything’s as nice as can be all over the house, and that watered
5543: silk she had on cost a pretty penny. Sister Pullet has got one like
5544: it.”
5545: 
5546: “Ah,” said Mr Tulliver, “he’s got some income besides the curacy, I
5547: reckon. Perhaps her father allows ’em something. There’s Tom ’ull be
5548: another hundred to him, and not much trouble either, by his own
5549: account; he says teaching comes natural to him. That’s wonderful, now,”
5550: added Mr Tulliver, turning his head on one side, and giving his horse a
5551: meditative tickling on the flank.
5552: 
5553: Perhaps it was because teaching came naturally to Mr Stelling, that he
5554: set about it with that uniformity of method and independence of
5555: circumstances which distinguish the actions of animals understood to be
5556: under the immediate teaching of nature. Mr Broderip’s amiable beaver,
5557: as that charming naturalist tells us, busied himself as earnestly in
5558: constructing a dam, in a room up three pair of stairs in London, as if
5559: he had been laying his foundation in a stream or lake in Upper Canada.
5560: It was “Binny’s” function to build; the absence of water or of possible
5561: progeny was an accident for which he was not accountable. With the same
5562: unerring instinct Mr Stelling set to work at his natural method of
5563: instilling the Eton Grammar and Euclid into the mind of Tom Tulliver.
5564: This, he considered, was the only basis of solid instruction; all other
5565: means of education were mere charlatanism, and could produce nothing
5566: better than smatterers. Fixed on this firm basis, a man might observe
5567: the display of various or special knowledge made by irregularly
5568: educated people with a pitying smile; all that sort of thing was very
5569: well, but it was impossible these people could form sound opinions. In
5570: holding this conviction Mr Stelling was not biassed, as some tutors
5571: have been, by the excessive accuracy or extent of his own scholarship;
5572: and as to his views about Euclid, no opinion could have been freer from
5573: personal partiality. Mr Stelling was very far from being led astray by
5574: enthusiasm, either religious or intellectual; on the other hand, he had
5575: no secret belief that everything was humbug. He thought religion was a
5576: very excellent thing, and Aristotle a great authority, and deaneries
5577: and prebends useful institutions, and Great Britain the providential
5578: bulwark of Protestantism, and faith in the unseen a great support to
5579: afflicted minds; he believed in all these things, as a Swiss
5580: hotel-keeper believes in the beauty of the scenery around him, and in
5581: the pleasure it gives to artistic visitors. And in the same way Mr
5582: Stelling believed in his method of education; he had no doubt that he
5583: was doing the very best thing for Mr Tulliver’s boy. Of course, when
5584: the miller talked of “mapping” and “summing” in a vague and diffident
5585: manner, Mr Stelling had set his mind at rest by an assurance that he
5586: understood what was wanted; for how was it possible the good man could
5587: form any reasonable judgment about the matter? Mr Stelling’s duty was
5588: to teach the lad in the only right way,—indeed he knew no other; he had
5589: not wasted his time in the acquirement of anything abnormal.
5590: 
5591: He very soon set down poor Tom as a thoroughly stupid lad; for though
5592: by hard labour he could get particular declensions into his brain,
5593: anything so abstract as the relation between cases and terminations
5594: could by no means get such a lodgment there as to enable him to
5595: recognise a chance genitive or dative. This struck Mr Stelling as
5596: something more than natural stupidity; he suspected obstinacy, or at
5597: any rate indifference, and lectured Tom severely on his want of
5598: thorough application. “You feel no interest in what you’re doing, sir,”
5599: Mr Stelling would say, and the reproach was painfully true. Tom had
5600: never found any difficulty in discerning a pointer from a setter, when
5601: once he had been told the distinction, and his perceptive powers were
5602: not at all deficient. I fancy they were quite as strong as those of the
5603: Rev. Mr Stelling; for Tom could predict with accuracy what number of
5604: horses were cantering behind him, he could throw a stone right into the
5605: centre of a given ripple, he could guess to a fraction how many lengths
5606: of his stick it would take to reach across the playground, and could
5607: draw almost perfect squares on his slate without any measurement. But
5608: Mr Stelling took no note of these things; he only observed that Tom’s
5609: faculties failed him before the abstractions hideously symbolised to
5610: him in the pages of the Eton Grammar, and that he was in a state
5611: bordering on idiocy with regard to the demonstration that two given
5612: triangles must be equal, though he could discern with great promptitude
5613: and certainty the fact that they _were_ equal. Whence Mr Stelling
5614: concluded that Tom’s brain, being peculiarly impervious to etymology
5615: and demonstrations, was peculiarly in need of being ploughed and
5616: harrowed by these patent implements; it was his favourite metaphor,
5617: that the classics and geometry constituted that culture of the mind
5618: which prepared it for the reception of any subsequent crop. I say
5619: nothing against Mr Stelling’s theory; if we are to have one regimen for
5620: all minds, his seems to me as good as any other. I only know it turned
5621: out as uncomfortably for Tom Tulliver as if he had been plied with
5622: cheese in order to remedy a gastric weakness which prevented him from
5623: digesting it. It is astonishing what a different result one gets by
5624: changing the metaphor! Once call the brain an intellectual stomach, and
5625: one’s ingenious conception of the classics and geometry as ploughs and
5626: harrows seems to settle nothing. But then it is open to some one else
5627: to follow great authorities, and call the mind a sheet of white paper
5628: or a mirror, in which case one’s knowledge of the digestive process
5629: becomes quite irrelevant. It was doubtless an ingenious idea to call
5630: the camel the ship of the desert, but it would hardly lead one far in
5631: training that useful beast. O Aristotle! if you had had the advantage
5632: of being “the freshest modern” instead of the greatest ancient, would
5633: you not have mingled your praise of metaphorical speech, as a sign of
5634: high intelligence, with a lamentation that intelligence so rarely shows
5635: itself in speech without metaphor,—that we can so seldom declare what a
5636: thing is, except by saying it is something else?
5637: 
5638: Tom Tulliver, being abundant in no form of speech, did not use any
5639: metaphor to declare his views as to the nature of Latin; he never
5640: called it an instrument of torture; and it was not until he had got on
5641: some way in the next half-year, and in the Delectus, that he was
5642: advanced enough to call it a “bore” and “beastly stuff.” At present, in
5643: relation to this demand that he should learn Latin declensions and
5644: conjugations, Tom was in a state of as blank unimaginativeness
5645: concerning the cause and tendency of his sufferings, as if he had been
5646: an innocent shrewmouse imprisoned in the split trunk of an ash-tree in
5647: order to cure lameness in cattle. It is doubtless almost incredible to
5648: instructed minds of the present day that a boy of twelve, not belonging
5649: strictly to “the masses,” who are now understood to have the monopoly
5650: of mental darkness, should have had no distinct idea how there came to
5651: be such a thing as Latin on this earth; yet so it was with Tom. It
5652: would have taken a long while to make conceivable to him that there
5653: ever existed a people who bought and sold sheep and oxen, and
5654: transacted the everyday affairs of life, through the medium of this
5655: language; and still longer to make him understand why he should be
5656: called upon to learn it, when its connection with those affairs had
5657: become entirely latent. So far as Tom had gained any acquaintance with
5658: the Romans at Mr Jacob’s academy, his knowledge was strictly correct,
5659: but it went no farther than the fact that they were “in the New
5660: Testament”; and Mr Stelling was not the man to enfeeble and emasculate
5661: his pupil’s mind by simplifying and explaining, or to reduce the tonic
5662: effect of etymology by mixing it with smattering, extraneous
5663: information, such as is given to girls.
5664: 
5665: Yet, strange to say, under this vigorous treatment Tom became more like
5666: a girl than he had ever been in his life before. He had a large share
5667: of pride, which had hitherto found itself very comfortable in the
5668: world, despising Old Goggles, and reposing in the sense of unquestioned
5669: rights; but now this same pride met with nothing but bruises and
5670: crushings. Tom was too clear-sighted not to be aware that Mr Stelling’s
5671: standard of things was quite different, was certainly something higher
5672: in the eyes of the world than that of the people he had been living
5673: amongst, and that, brought in contact with it, he, Tom Tulliver,
5674: appeared uncouth and stupid; he was by no means indifferent to this,
5675: and his pride got into an uneasy condition which quite nullified his
5676: boyish self-satisfaction, and gave him something of the girl’s
5677: susceptibility. He was of a very firm, not to say obstinate, disposition,
5678: but there was no brute-like rebellion and recklessness in his nature;
5679: the human sensibilities predominated, and if it had occurred to him
5680: that he could enable himself to show some quickness at his lessons, and
5681: so acquire Mr Stelling’s approbation, by standing on one leg for an
5682: inconvenient length of time, or rapping his head moderately against the
5683: wall, or any voluntary action of that sort, he would certainly have
5684: tried it. But no; Tom had never heard that these measures would
5685: brighten the understanding, or strengthen the verbal memory; and he was
5686: not given to hypothesis and experiment. It did occur to him that he
5687: could perhaps get some help by praying for it; but as the prayers he
5688: said every evening were forms learned by heart, he rather shrank from
5689: the novelty and irregularity of introducing an extempore passage on a
5690: topic of petition for which he was not aware of any precedent. But one
5691: day, when he had broken down, for the fifth time, in the supines of the
5692: third conjugation, and Mr Stelling, convinced that this must be
5693: carelessness, since it transcended the bounds of possible stupidity,
5694: had lectured him very seriously, pointing out that if he failed to
5695: seize the present golden opportunity of learning supines, he would have
5696: to regret it when he became a man,—Tom, more miserable than usual,
5697: determined to try his sole resource; and that evening, after his usual
5698: form of prayer for his parents and “little sister” (he had begun to
5699: pray for Maggie when she was a baby), and that he might be able always
5700: to keep God’s commandments, he added, in the same low whisper, “and
5701: please to make me always remember my Latin.” He paused a little to
5702: consider how he should pray about Euclid—whether he should ask to see
5703: what it meant, or whether there was any other mental state which would
5704: be more applicable to the case. But at last he added: “And make Mr
5705: Stelling say I sha’n’t do Euclid any more. Amen.”
5706: 
5707: The fact that he got through his supines without mistake the next day,
5708: encouraged him to persevere in this appendix to his prayers, and
5709: neutralised any scepticism that might have arisen from Mr Stelling’s
5710: continued demand for Euclid. But his faith broke down under the
5711: apparent absence of all help when he got into the irregular verbs. It
5712: seemed clear that Tom’s despair under the caprices of the present tense
5713: did not constitute a _nodus_ worthy of interference, and since this was
5714: the climax of his difficulties, where was the use of praying for help
5715: any longer? He made up his mind to this conclusion in one of his dull,
5716: lonely evenings, which he spent in the study, preparing his lessons for
5717: the morrow. His eyes were apt to get dim over the page, though he hated
5718: crying, and was ashamed of it; he couldn’t help thinking with some
5719: affection even of Spouncer, whom he used to fight and quarrel with; he
5720: would have felt at home with Spouncer, and in a condition of
5721: superiority. And then the mill, and the river, and Yap pricking up his
5722: ears, ready to obey the least sign when Tom said, “Hoigh!” would all
5723: come before him in a sort of calenture, when his fingers played
5724: absently in his pocket with his great knife and his coil of whipcord,
5725: and other relics of the past.
5726: 
5727: Tom, as I said, had never been so much like a girl in his life before,
5728: and at that epoch of irregular verbs his spirit was further depressed
5729: by a new means of mental development which had been thought of for him
5730: out of school hours. Mrs Stelling had lately had her second baby, and
5731: as nothing could be more salutary for a boy than to feel himself
5732: useful, Mrs Stelling considered she was doing Tom a service by setting
5733: him to watch the little cherub Laura while the nurse was occupied with
5734: the sickly baby. It was quite a pretty employment for Tom to take
5735: little Laura out in the sunniest hour of the autumn day; it would help
5736: to make him feel that Lorton Parsonage was a home for him, and that he
5737: was one of the family. The little cherub Laura, not being an
5738: accomplished walker at present, had a ribbon fastened round her waist,
5739: by which Tom held her as if she had been a little dog during the
5740: minutes in which she chose to walk; but as these were rare, he was for
5741: the most part carrying this fine child round and round the garden,
5742: within sight of Mrs Stelling’s window, according to orders. If any one
5743: considers this unfair and even oppressive toward Tom, I beg him to
5744: consider that there are feminine virtues which are with difficulty
5745: combined, even if they are not incompatible. When the wife of a poor
5746: curate contrives, under all her disadvantages, to dress extremely well,
5747: and to have a style of coiffure which requires that her nurse shall
5748: occasionally officiate as lady’s-maid; when, moreover, her
5749: dinner-parties and her drawing-room show that effort at elegance and
5750: completeness of appointment to which ordinary women might imagine a
5751: large income necessary, it would be unreasonable to expect of her that
5752: she should employ a second nurse, or even act as a nurse herself. Mr
5753: Stelling knew better; he saw that his wife did wonders already, and was
5754: proud of her. It was certainly not the best thing in the world for
5755: young Tulliver’s gait to carry a heavy child, but he had plenty of
5756: exercise in long walks with himself, and next half-year Mr Stelling
5757: would see about having a drilling-master. Among the many means whereby
5758: Mr Stelling intended to be more fortunate than the bulk of his
5759: fellow-men, he had entirely given up that of having his own way in his
5760: own house. What then? He had married “as kind a little soul as ever
5761: breathed,” according to Mr Riley, who had been acquainted with Mrs
5762: Stelling’s blond ringlets and smiling demeanour throughout her maiden
5763: life, and on the strength of that knowledge would have been ready any
5764: day to pronounce that whatever domestic differences might arise in her
5765: married life must be entirely Mr Stelling’s fault.
5766: 
5767: If Tom had had a worse disposition, he would certainly have hated the
5768: little cherub Laura, but he was too kind-hearted a lad for that; there
5769: was too much in him of the fibre that turns to true manliness, and to
5770: protecting pity for the weak. I am afraid he hated Mrs Stelling, and
5771: contracted a lasting dislike to pale blond ringlets and broad plaits,
5772: as directly associated with haughtiness of manner, and a frequent
5773: reference to other people’s “duty.” But he couldn’t help playing with
5774: little Laura, and liking to amuse her; he even sacrificed his
5775: percussion-caps for her sake, in despair of their ever serving a
5776: greater purpose,—thinking the small flash and bang would delight her,
5777: and thereby drawing down on himself a rebuke from Mrs Stelling for
5778: teaching her child to play with fire. Laura was a sort of
5779: playfellow—and oh, how Tom longed for playfellows! In his secret heart
5780: he yearned to have Maggie with him, and was almost ready to dote on her
5781: exasperating acts of forgetfulness; though, when he was at home, he
5782: always represented it as a great favour on his part to let Maggie trot
5783: by his side on his pleasure excursions.
5784: 
5785: And before this dreary half-year was ended, Maggie actually came. Mrs
5786: Stelling had given a general invitation for the little girl to come and
5787: stay with her brother; so when Mr Tulliver drove over to King’s Lorton
5788: late in October, Maggie came too, with the sense that she was taking a
5789: great journey, and beginning to see the world. It was Mr Tulliver’s
5790: first visit to see Tom, for the lad must learn not to think too much
5791: about home.
5792: 
5793: “Well, my lad,” he said to Tom, when Mr Stelling had left the room to
5794: announce the arrival to his wife, and Maggie had begun to kiss Tom
5795: freely, “you look rarely! School agrees with you.”
5796: 
5797: Tom wished he had looked rather ill.
5798: 
5799: “I don’t think I _am_ well, father,” said Tom; “I wish you’d ask Mr
5800: Stelling not to let me do Euclid; it brings on the toothache, I think.”
5801: 
5802: (The toothache was the only malady to which Tom had ever been subject.)
5803: 
5804: “Euclid, my lad,—why, what’s that?” said Mr Tulliver.
5805: 
5806: “Oh, I don’t know; it’s definitions, and axioms, and triangles, and
5807: things. It’s a book I’ve got to learn in—there’s no sense in it.”
5808: 
5809: “Go, go!” said Mr Tulliver, reprovingly; “you mustn’t say so. You must
5810: learn what your master tells you. He knows what it’s right for you to
5811: learn.”
5812: 
5813: “_I’ll_ help you now, Tom,” said Maggie, with a little air of
5814: patronizing consolation. “I’m come to stay ever so long, if Mrs
5815: Stelling asks me. I’ve brought my box and my pinafores, haven’t I,
5816: father?”
5817: 
5818: “_You_ help me, you silly little thing!” said Tom, in such high spirits
5819: at this announcement that he quite enjoyed the idea of confounding
5820: Maggie by showing her a page of Euclid. “I should like to see you doing
5821: one of _my_ lessons! Why, I learn Latin too! Girls never learn such
5822: things. They’re too silly.”
5823: 
5824: “I know what Latin is very well,” said Maggie, confidently, “Latin’s a
5825: language. There are Latin words in the Dictionary. There’s bonus, a
5826: gift.”
5827: 
5828: “Now, you’re just wrong there, Miss Maggie!” said Tom, secretly
5829: astonished. “You think you’re very wise! But ‘bonus’ means ‘good,’ as
5830: it happens,—bonus, bona, bonum.”
5831: 
5832: “Well, that’s no reason why it shouldn’t mean ‘gift,’” said Maggie,
5833: stoutly. “It may mean several things; almost every word does. There’s
5834: ‘lawn,’—it means the grass-plot, as well as the stuff pocket
5835: handkerchiefs are made of.”
5836: 
5837: “Well done, little ’un,” said Mr Tulliver, laughing, while Tom felt
5838: rather disgusted with Maggie’s knowingness, though beyond measure
5839: cheerful at the thought that she was going to stay with him. Her
5840: conceit would soon be overawed by the actual inspection of his books.
5841: 
5842: Mrs Stelling, in her pressing invitation, did not mention a longer time
5843: than a week for Maggie’s stay; but Mr Stelling, who took her between
5844: his knees, and asked her where she stole her dark eyes from, insisted
5845: that she must stay a fortnight. Maggie thought Mr Stelling was a
5846: charming man, and Mr Tulliver was quite proud to leave his little wench
5847: where she would have an opportunity of showing her cleverness to
5848: appreciating strangers. So it was agreed that she should not be fetched
5849: home till the end of the fortnight.
5850: 
5851: “Now, then, come with me into the study, Maggie,” said Tom, as their
5852: father drove away. “What do you shake and toss your head now for, you
5853: silly?” he continued; for though her hair was now under a new
5854: dispensation, and was brushed smoothly behind her ears, she seemed
5855: still in imagination to be tossing it out of her eyes. “It makes you
5856: look as if you were crazy.”
5857: 
5858: “Oh, I can’t help it,” said Maggie, impatiently. “Don’t tease me, Tom.
5859: Oh, what books!” she exclaimed, as she saw the bookcases in the study.
5860: “How I should like to have as many books as that!”
5861: 
5862: “Why, you couldn’t read one of ’em,” said Tom, triumphantly. “They’re
5863: all Latin.”
5864: 
5865: “No, they aren’t,” said Maggie. “I can read the back of this,—‘History
5866: of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.’”
5867: 
5868: “Well, what does that mean? _You_ don’t know,” said Tom, wagging his
5869: head.
5870: 
5871: “But I could soon find out,” said Maggie, scornfully.
5872: 
5873: “Why, how?”
5874: 
5875: “I should look inside, and see what it was about.”
5876: 
5877: “You’d better not, Miss Maggie,” said Tom, seeing her hand on the
5878: volume. “Mr Stelling lets nobody touch his books without leave, and _I_
5879: shall catch it, if you take it out.”
5880: 
5881: “Oh, very well. Let me see all _your_ books, then,” said Maggie,
5882: turning to throw her arms round Tom’s neck, and rub his cheek with her
5883: small round nose.
5884: 
5885: Tom, in the gladness of his heart at having dear old Maggie to dispute
5886: with and crow over again, seized her round the waist, and began to jump
5887: with her round the large library table. Away they jumped with more and
5888: more vigor, till Maggie’s hair flew from behind her ears, and twirled
5889: about like an animated mop. But the revolutions round the table became
5890: more and more irregular in their sweep, till at last reaching Mr
5891: Stelling’s reading stand, they sent it thundering down with its heavy
5892: lexicons to the floor. Happily it was the ground-floor, and the study
5893: was a one-storied wing to the house, so that the downfall made no
5894: alarming resonance, though Tom stood dizzy and aghast for a few
5895: minutes, dreading the appearance of Mr or Mrs Stelling.
5896: 
5897: “Oh, I say, Maggie,” said Tom at last, lifting up the stand, “we must
5898: keep quiet here, you know. If we break anything Mrs Stelling’ll make us
5899: cry peccavi.”
5900: 
5901: “What’s that?” said Maggie.
5902: 
5903: “Oh, it’s the Latin for a good scolding,” said Tom, not without some
5904: pride in his knowledge.
5905: 
5906: “Is she a cross woman?” said Maggie.
5907: 
5908: “I believe you!” said Tom, with an emphatic nod.
5909: 
5910: “I think all women are crosser than men,” said Maggie. “Aunt Glegg’s a
5911: great deal crosser than uncle Glegg, and mother scolds me more than
5912: father does.”
5913: 
5914: “Well, _you’ll_ be a woman some day,” said Tom, “so _you_ needn’t
5915: talk.”
5916: 
5917: “But I shall be a _clever_ woman,” said Maggie, with a toss.
5918: 
5919: “Oh, I dare say, and a nasty conceited thing. Everybody’ll hate you.”
5920: 
5921: “But you oughtn’t to hate me, Tom; it’ll be very wicked of you, for I
5922: shall be your sister.”
5923: 
5924: “Yes, but if you’re a nasty disagreeable thing I _shall_ hate you.”
5925: 
5926: “Oh, but, Tom, you won’t! I sha’n’t be disagreeable. I shall be very
5927: good to you, and I shall be good to everybody. You won’t hate me
5928: really, will you, Tom?”
5929: 
5930: “Oh, bother! never mind! Come, it’s time for me to learn my lessons.
5931: See here! what I’ve got to do,” said Tom, drawing Maggie toward him and
5932: showing her his theorem, while she pushed her hair behind her ears, and
5933: prepared herself to prove her capability of helping him in Euclid. She
5934: began to read with full confidence in her own powers, but presently,
5935: becoming quite bewildered, her face flushed with irritation. It was
5936: unavoidable; she must confess her incompetency, and she was not fond of
5937: humiliation.
5938: 
5939: “It’s nonsense!” she said, “and very ugly stuff; nobody need want to
5940: make it out.”
5941: 
5942: “Ah, there, now, Miss Maggie!” said Tom, drawing the book away, and
5943: wagging his head at her, “You see you’re not so clever as you thought
5944: you were.”
5945: 
5946: “Oh,” said Maggie, pouting, “I dare say I could make it out, if I’d
5947: learned what goes before, as you have.”
5948: 
5949: “But that’s what you just couldn’t, Miss Wisdom,” said Tom. “For it’s
5950: all the harder when you know what goes before; for then you’ve got to
5951: say what definition 3 is, and what axiom V. is. But get along with you
5952: now; I must go on with this. Here’s the Latin Grammar. See what you can
5953: make of that.”
5954: 
5955: Maggie found the Latin Grammar quite soothing after her mathematical
5956: mortification; for she delighted in new words, and quickly found that
5957: there was an English Key at the end, which would make her very wise
5958: about Latin, at slight expense. She presently made up her mind to skip
5959: the rules in the Syntax, the examples became so absorbing. These
5960: mysterious sentences, snatched from an unknown context,—like strange
5961: horns of beasts, and leaves of unknown plants, brought from some
5962: far-off region,—gave boundless scope to her imagination, and were all
5963: the more fascinating because they were in a peculiar tongue of their
5964: own, which she could learn to interpret. It was really very
5965: interesting, the Latin Grammar that Tom had said no girls could learn;
5966: and she was proud because she found it interesting. The most
5967: fragmentary examples were her favourites. _Mors omnibus est communis_
5968: would have been jejune, only she liked to know the Latin; but the
5969: fortunate gentleman whom every one congratulated because he had a son
5970: “endowed with _such_ a disposition” afforded her a great deal of
5971: pleasant conjecture, and she was quite lost in the “thick grove
5972: penetrable by no star,” when Tom called out,—
5973: 
5974: “Now, then, Magsie, give us the Grammar!”
5975: 
5976: “Oh, Tom, it’s such a pretty book!” she said, as she jumped out of the
5977: large arm-chair to give it him; “it’s much prettier than the
5978: Dictionary. I could learn Latin very soon. I don’t think it’s at all
5979: hard.”
5980: 
5981: “Oh, I know what you’ve been doing,” said Tom; “you’ve been reading the
5982: English at the end. Any donkey can do that.”
5983: 
5984: Tom seized the book and opened it with a determined and business-like
5985: air, as much as to say that he had a lesson to learn which no donkeys
5986: would find themselves equal to. Maggie, rather piqued, turned to the
5987: bookcases to amuse herself with puzzling out the titles.
5988: 
5989: Presently Tom called to her: “Here, Magsie, come and hear if I can say
5990: this. Stand at that end of the table, where Mr Stelling sits when he
5991: hears me.”
5992: 
5993: Maggie obeyed, and took the open book.
5994: 
5995: “Where do you begin, Tom?”
5996: 
5997: “Oh, I begin at _’Appellativa arborum,’_ because I say all over again
5998: what I’ve been learning this week.”
5999: 
6000: Tom sailed along pretty well for three lines; and Maggie was beginning
6001: to forget her office of prompter in speculating as to what _mas_ could
6002: mean, which came twice over, when he stuck fast at _Sunt etiam
6003: volucrum_.
6004: 
6005: “Don’t tell me, Maggie; _Sunt etiam volucrum_—_Sunt etiam volucrum_—_ut
6006: ostrea, cetus_——”
6007: 
6008: “No,” said Maggie, opening her mouth and shaking her head.
6009: 
6010: “_Sunt etiam volucrum_,” said Tom, very slowly, as if the next words
6011: might be expected to come sooner when he gave them this strong hint
6012: that they were waited for.
6013: 
6014: “C, e, u,” said Maggie, getting impatient.
6015: 
6016: “Oh, I know—hold your tongue,” said Tom. “_Ceu passer, hirundo;
6017: Ferarum_—_ferarum_——” Tom took his pencil and made several hard dots
6018: with it on his book-cover—“_ferarum_——”
6019: 
6020: “Oh dear, oh dear, Tom,” said Maggie, “what a time you are! _Ut_——”
6021: 
6022: “_Ut ostrea_——”
6023: 
6024: “No, no,” said Maggie, “_ut tigris_——”
6025: 
6026: “Oh yes, now I can do,” said Tom; “it was _tigris, vulpes_, I’d
6027: forgotten: _ut tigris, volupes; et Piscium_.”
6028: 
6029: With some further stammering and repetition, Tom got through the next
6030: few lines.
6031: 
6032: “Now, then,” he said, “the next is what I’ve just learned for
6033: to-morrow. Give me hold of the book a minute.”
6034: 
6035: After some whispered gabbling, assisted by the beating of his fist on
6036: the table, Tom returned the book.
6037: 
6038: “_Mascula nomina in a_,” he began.
6039: 
6040: “No, Tom,” said Maggie, “that doesn’t come next. It’s _Nomen non
6041: creskens genittivo_——”
6042: 
6043: “_Creskens genittivo!_” exclaimed Tom, with a derisive laugh, for Tom
6044: had learned this omitted passage for his yesterday’s lesson, and a
6045: young gentleman does not require an intimate or extensive acquaintance
6046: with Latin before he can feel the pitiable absurdity of a false
6047: quantity. “_Creskens genittivo!_ What a little silly you are, Maggie!”
6048: 
6049: “Well, you needn’t laugh, Tom, for you didn’t remember it at all. I’m
6050: sure it’s spelt so; how was I to know?”
6051: 
6052: “Phee-e-e-h! I told you girls couldn’t learn Latin. It’s _Nomen non
6053: crescens genitivo_.”
6054: 
6055: “Very well, then,” said Maggie, pouting. “I can say that as well as you
6056: can. And you don’t mind your stops. For you ought to stop twice as long
6057: at a semicolon as you do at a comma, and you make the longest stops
6058: where there ought to be no stop at all.”
6059: 
6060: “Oh, well, don’t chatter. Let me go on.”
6061: 
6062: They were presently fetched to spend the rest of the evening in the
6063: drawing-room, and Maggie became so animated with Mr Stelling, who, she
6064: felt sure, admired her cleverness, that Tom was rather amazed and
6065: alarmed at her audacity. But she was suddenly subdued by Mr Stelling’s
6066: alluding to a little girl of whom he had heard that she once ran away
6067: to the gypsies.
6068: 
6069: “What a very odd little girl that must be!” said Mrs Stelling, meaning
6070: to be playful; but a playfulness that turned on her supposed oddity was
6071: not at all to Maggie’s taste. She feared that Mr Stelling, after all,
6072: did not think much of her, and went to bed in rather low spirits. Mrs
6073: Stelling, she felt, looked at her as if she thought her hair was very
6074: ugly because it hung down straight behind.
6075: 
6076: Nevertheless it was a very happy fortnight to Maggie, this visit to
6077: Tom. She was allowed to be in the study while he had his lessons, and
6078: in her various readings got very deep into the examples in the Latin
6079: Grammar. The astronomer who hated women generally caused her so much
6080: puzzling speculation that she one day asked Mr Stelling if all
6081: astronomers hated women, or whether it was only this particular
6082: astronomer. But forestalling his answer, she said,—
6083: 
6084: “I suppose it’s all astronomers; because, you know, they live up in
6085: high towers, and if the women came there they might talk and hinder
6086: them from looking at the stars.”
6087: 
6088: Mr Stelling liked her prattle immensely, and they were on the best
6089: terms. She told Tom she should like to go to school to Mr Stelling, as
6090: he did, and learn just the same things. She knew she could do Euclid,
6091: for she had looked into it again, and she saw what A B C meant; they
6092: were the names of the lines.
6093: 
6094: “I’m sure you couldn’t do it, now,” said Tom; “and I’ll just ask Mr
6095: Stelling if you could.”
6096: 
6097: “I don’t mind,” said the little conceited minx, “I’ll ask him myself.”
6098: 
6099: “Mr Stelling,” she said, that same evening when they were in the
6100: drawing-room, “couldn’t I do Euclid, and all Tom’s lessons, if you were
6101: to teach me instead of him?”
6102: 
6103: “No, you couldn’t,” said Tom, indignantly. “Girls can’t do Euclid; can
6104: they, sir?”
6105: 
6106: “They can pick up a little of everything, I dare say,” said Mr
6107: Stelling. “They’ve a great deal of superficial cleverness; but they
6108: couldn’t go far into anything. They’re quick and shallow.”
6109: 
6110: Tom, delighted with this verdict, telegraphed his triumph by wagging
6111: his head at Maggie, behind Mr Stelling’s chair. As for Maggie, she had
6112: hardly ever been so mortified. She had been so proud to be called
6113: “quick” all her little life, and now it appeared that this quickness
6114: was the brand of inferiority. It would have been better to be slow,
6115: like Tom.
6116: 
6117: “Ha, ha! Miss Maggie!” said Tom, when they were alone; “you see it’s
6118: not such a fine thing to be quick. You’ll never go far into anything,
6119: you know.”
6120: 
6121: And Maggie was so oppressed by this dreadful destiny that she had no
6122: spirit for a retort.
6123: 
6124: But when this small apparatus of shallow quickness was fetched away in
6125: the gig by Luke, and the study was once more quite lonely for Tom, he
6126: missed her grievously. He had really been brighter, and had got through
6127: his lessons better, since she had been there; and she had asked Mr
6128: Stelling so many questions about the Roman Empire, and whether there
6129: really ever was a man who said, in Latin, “I would not buy it for a
6130: farthing or a rotten nut,” or whether that had only been turned into
6131: Latin, that Tom had actually come to a dim understanding of the fact
6132: that there had once been people upon the earth who were so fortunate as
6133: to know Latin without learning it through the medium of the Eton
6134: Grammar. This luminous idea was a great addition to his historical
6135: acquirements during this half-year, which were otherwise confined to an
6136: epitomised history of the Jews.
6137: 
6138: But the dreary half-year _did_ come to an end. How glad Tom was to see
6139: the last yellow leaves fluttering before the cold wind! The dark
6140: afternoons and the first December snow seemed to him far livelier than
6141: the August sunshine; and that he might make himself the surer about the
6142: flight of the days that were carrying him homeward, he stuck twenty-one
6143: sticks deep in a corner of the garden, when he was three weeks from the
6144: holidays, and pulled one up every day with a great wrench, throwing it
6145: to a distance with a vigor of will which would have carried it to
6146: limbo, if it had been in the nature of sticks to travel so far.
6147: 
6148: But it was worth purchasing, even at the heavy price of the Latin
6149: Grammar, the happiness of seeing the bright light in the parlour at
6150: home, as the gig passed noiselessly over the snow-covered bridge; the
6151: happiness of passing from the cold air to the warmth and the kisses and
6152: the smiles of that familiar hearth, where the pattern of the rug and
6153: the grate and the fire-irons were “first ideas” that it was no more
6154: possible to criticise than the solidity and extension of matter. There
6155: is no sense of ease like the ease we felt in those scenes where we were
6156: born, where objects became dear to us before we had known the labour of
6157: choice, and where the outer world seemed only an extension of our own
6158: personality; we accepted and loved it as we accepted our own sense of
6159: existence and our own limbs. Very commonplace, even ugly, that
6160: furniture of our early home might look if it were put up to auction; an
6161: improved taste in upholstery scorns it; and is not the striving after
6162: something better and better in our surroundings the grand
6163: characteristic that distinguishes man from the brute, or, to satisfy a
6164: scrupulous accuracy of definition, that distinguishes the British man
6165: from the foreign brute? But heaven knows where that striving might lead
6166: us, if our affections had not a trick of twining round those old
6167: inferior things; if the loves and sanctities of our life had no deep
6168: immovable roots in memory. One’s delight in an elderberry bush
6169: overhanging the confused leafage of a hedgerow bank, as a more
6170: gladdening sight than the finest cistus or fuchsia spreading itself on
6171: the softest undulating turf, is an entirely unjustifiable preference to
6172: a nursery-gardener, or to any of those regulated minds who are free
6173: from the weakness of any attachment that does not rest on a
6174: demonstrable superiority of qualities. And there is no better reason
6175: for preferring this elderberry bush than that it stirs an early memory;
6176: that it is no novelty in my life, speaking to me merely through my
6177: present sensibilities to form and colour, but the long companion of my
6178: existence, that wove itself into my joys when joys were vivid.
6179: 
6180: 
6181: Chapter II.
6182: 
6183: The Christmas Holidays
6184: 
6185: Fine old Christmas, with the snowy hair and ruddy face, had done his
6186: duty that year in the noblest fashion, and had set off his rich gifts
6187: of warmth and colour with all the heightening contrast of frost and
6188: snow.
6189: 
6190: Snow lay on the croft and river-bank in undulations softer than the
6191: limbs of infancy; it lay with the neatliest finished border on every
6192: sloping roof, making the dark-red gables stand out with a new depth of
6193: colour; it weighed heavily on the laurels and fir-trees, till it fell
6194: from them with a shuddering sound; it clothed the rough turnip-field
6195: with whiteness, and made the sheep look like dark blotches; the gates
6196: were all blocked up with the sloping drifts, and here and there a
6197: disregarded four-footed beast stood as if petrified “in unrecumbent
6198: sadness”; there was no gleam, no shadow, for the heavens, too, were one
6199: still, pale cloud; no sound or motion in anything but the dark river
6200: that flowed and moaned like an unresting sorrow. But old Christmas
6201: smiled as he laid this cruel-seeming spell on the outdoor world, for he
6202: meant to light up home with new brightness, to deepen all the richness
6203: of indoor colour, and give a keener edge of delight to the warm
6204: fragrance of food; he meant to prepare a sweet imprisonment that would
6205: strengthen the primitive fellowship of kindred, and make the sunshine
6206: of familiar human faces as welcome as the hidden day-star. His kindness
6207: fell but hardly on the homeless,—fell but hardly on the homes where the
6208: hearth was not very warm, and where the food had little fragrance;
6209: where the human faces had had no sunshine in them, but rather the
6210: leaden, blank-eyed gaze of unexpectant want. But the fine old season
6211: meant well; and if he has not learned the secret how to bless men
6212: impartially, it is because his father Time, with ever-unrelenting
6213: purpose, still hides that secret in his own mighty, slow-beating heart.
6214: 
6215: And yet this Christmas day, in spite of Tom’s fresh delight in home,
6216: was not, he thought, somehow or other, quite so happy as it had always
6217: been before. The red berries were just as abundant on the holly, and he
6218: and Maggie had dressed all the windows and mantlepieces and
6219: picture-frames on Christmas eve with as much taste as ever, wedding the
6220: thick-set scarlet clusters with branches of the black-berried ivy.
6221: There had been singing under the windows after midnight,—supernatural
6222: singing, Maggie always felt, in spite of Tom’s contemptuous insistence
6223: that the singers were old Patch, the parish clerk, and the rest of the
6224: church choir; she trembled with awe when their carolling broke in upon
6225: her dreams, and the image of men in fustian clothes was always thrust
6226: away by the vision of angels resting on the parted cloud. The midnight
6227: chant had helped as usual to lift the morning above the level of common
6228: days; and then there were the smell of hot toast and ale from the
6229: kitchen, at the breakfast hour; the favourite anthem, the green boughs,
6230: and the short sermon gave the appropriate festal character to the
6231: church-going; and aunt and uncle Moss, with all their seven children,
6232: were looking like so many reflectors of the bright parlour-fire, when
6233: the church-goers came back, stamping the snow from their feet. The
6234: plum-pudding was of the same handsome roundness as ever, and came in
6235: with the symbolic blue flames around it, as if it had been heroically
6236: snatched from the nether fires, into which it had been thrown by
6237: dyspeptic Puritans; the dessert was as splendid as ever, with its
6238: golden oranges, brown nuts, and the crystalline light and dark of
6239: apple-jelly and damson cheese; in all these things Christmas was as it
6240: had always been since Tom could remember; it was only distinguished, if
6241: by anything, by superior sliding and snowballs.
6242: 
6243: Christmas was cheery, but not so Mr Tulliver. He was irate and defiant;
6244: and Tom, though he espoused his father’s quarrels and shared his
6245: father’s sense of injury, was not without some of the feeling that
6246: oppressed Maggie when Mr Tulliver got louder and more angry in
6247: narration and assertion with the increased leisure of dessert. The
6248: attention that Tom might have concentrated on his nuts and wine was
6249: distracted by a sense that there were rascally enemies in the world,
6250: and that the business of grown-up life could hardly be conducted
6251: without a good deal of quarrelling. Now, Tom was not fond of
6252: quarrelling, unless it could soon be put an end to by a fair stand-up
6253: fight with an adversary whom he had every chance of thrashing; and his
6254: father’s irritable talk made him uncomfortable, though he never
6255: accounted to himself for the feeling, or conceived the notion that his
6256: father was faulty in this respect.
6257: 
6258: The particular embodiment of the evil principle now exciting Mr
6259: Tulliver’s determined resistance was Mr Pivart, who, having lands
6260: higher up the Ripple, was taking measures for their irrigation, which
6261: either were, or would be, or were bound to be (on the principle that
6262: water was water), an infringement on Mr Tulliver’s legitimate share of
6263: water-power. Dix, who had a mill on the stream, was a feeble auxiliary
6264: of Old Harry compared with Pivart. Dix had been brought to his senses
6265: by arbitration, and Wakem’s advice had not carried _him_ far. No; Dix,
6266: Mr Tulliver considered, had been as good as nowhere in point of law;
6267: and in the intensity of his indignation against Pivart, his contempt
6268: for a baffled adversary like Dix began to wear the air of a friendly
6269: attachment. He had no male audience to-day except Mr Moss, who knew
6270: nothing, as he said, of the “natur’ o’ mills,” and could only assent to
6271: Mr Tulliver’s arguments on the _a priori_ ground of family relationship
6272: and monetary obligation; but Mr Tulliver did not talk with the futile
6273: intention of convincing his audience, he talked to relieve himself;
6274: while good Mr Moss made strong efforts to keep his eyes wide open, in
6275: spite of the sleepiness which an unusually good dinner produced in his
6276: hard-worked frame. Mrs Moss, more alive to the subject, and interested
6277: in everything that affected her brother, listened and put in a word as
6278: often as maternal preoccupations allowed.
6279: 
6280: “Why, Pivart’s a new name hereabout, brother, isn’t it?” she said; “he
6281: didn’t own the land in father’s time, nor yours either, before I was
6282: married.”
6283: 
6284: “New name? Yes, I should think it _is_ a new name,” said Mr Tulliver,
6285: with angry emphasis. “Dorlcote Mill’s been in our family a hundred year
6286: and better, and nobody ever heard of a Pivart meddling with the river,
6287: till this fellow came and bought Bincome’s farm out of hand, before
6288: anybody else could so much as say ‘snap.’ But I’ll _Pivart_ him!” added
6289: Mr Tulliver, lifting his glass with a sense that he had defined his
6290: resolution in an unmistakable manner.
6291: 
6292: “You won’t be forced to go to law with him, I hope, brother?” said Mrs
6293: Moss, with some anxiety.
6294: 
6295: “I don’t know what I shall be forced to; but I know what I shall force
6296: _him_ to, with his dikes and erigations, if there’s any law to be
6297: brought to bear o’ the right side. I know well enough who’s at the
6298: bottom of it; he’s got Wakem to back him and egg him on. I know Wakem
6299: tells him the law can’t touch him for it, but there’s folks can handle
6300: the law besides Wakem. It takes a big raskil to beat him; but there’s
6301: bigger to be found, as know more o’ th’ ins and outs o’ the law, else
6302: how came Wakem to lose Brumley’s suit for him?”
6303: 
6304: Mr Tulliver was a strictly honest man, and proud of being honest, but
6305: he considered that in law the ends of justice could only be achieved by
6306: employing a stronger knave to frustrate a weaker. Law was a sort of
6307: cock-fight, in which it was the business of injured honesty to get a
6308: game bird with the best pluck and the strongest spurs.
6309: 
6310: “Gore’s no fool; you needn’t tell me that,” he observed presently, in a
6311: pugnacious tone, as if poor Gritty had been urging that lawyer’s
6312: capabilities; “but, you see, he isn’t up to the law as Wakem is. And
6313: water’s a very particular thing; you can’t pick it up with a pitchfork.
6314: That’s why it’s been nuts to Old Harry and the lawyers. It’s plain
6315: enough what’s the rights and the wrongs of water, if you look at it
6316: straight-forrard; for a river’s a river, and if you’ve got a mill, you
6317: must have water to turn it; and it’s no use telling me Pivart’s
6318: erigation and nonsense won’t stop my wheel; I know what belongs to
6319: water better than that. Talk to me o’ what th’ engineers say! I say
6320: it’s common sense, as Pivart’s dikes must do me an injury. But if
6321: that’s their engineering, I’ll put Tom to it by-and-by, and he shall
6322: see if he can’t find a bit more sense in th’ engineering business than
6323: what _that_ comes to.”
6324: 
6325: Tom, looking round with some anxiety at this announcement of his
6326: prospects, unthinkingly withdrew a small rattle he was amusing baby
6327: Moss with, whereupon she, being a baby that knew her own mind with
6328: remarkable clearness, instantaneously expressed her sentiments in a
6329: piercing yell, and was not to be appeased even by the restoration of
6330: the rattle, feeling apparently that the original wrong of having it
6331: taken from her remained in all its force. Mrs Moss hurried away with
6332: her into another room, and expressed to Mrs Tulliver, who accompanied
6333: her, the conviction that the dear child had good reasons for crying;
6334: implying that if it was supposed to be the rattle that baby clamored
6335: for, she was a misunderstood baby. The thoroughly justifiable yell
6336: being quieted, Mrs Moss looked at her sister-in-law and said,—
6337: 
6338: “I’m sorry to see brother so put out about this water work.”
6339: 
6340: “It’s your brother’s way, Mrs Moss; I’d never anything o’ that sort
6341: before I was married,” said Mrs Tulliver, with a half-implied reproach.
6342: She always spoke of her husband as “your brother” to Mrs Moss in any
6343: case when his line of conduct was not matter of pure admiration.
6344: Amiable Mrs Tulliver, who was never angry in her life, had yet her mild
6345: share of that spirit without which she could hardly have been at once a
6346: Dodson and a woman. Being always on the defensive toward her own
6347: sisters, it was natural that she should be keenly conscious of her
6348: superiority, even as the weakest Dodson, over a husband’s sister, who,
6349: besides being poorly off, and inclined to “hang on” her brother, had
6350: the good-natured submissiveness of a large, easy-tempered, untidy,
6351: prolific woman, with affection enough in her not only for her own
6352: husband and abundant children, but for any number of collateral
6353: relations.
6354: 
6355: “I hope and pray he won’t go to law,” said Mrs Moss, “for there’s never
6356: any knowing where that’ll end. And the right doesn’t allays win. This
6357: Mr Pivart’s a rich man, by what I can make out, and the rich mostly get
6358: things their own way.”
6359: 
6360: “As to that,” said Mrs Tulliver, stroking her dress down, “I’ve seen
6361: what riches are in my own family; for my sisters have got husbands as
6362: can afford to do pretty much what they like. But I think sometimes I
6363: shall be drove off my head with the talk about this law and erigation;
6364: and my sisters lay all the fault to me, for they don’t know what it is
6365: to marry a man like your brother; how should they? Sister Pullet has
6366: her own way from morning till night.”
6367: 
6368: “Well,” said Mrs Moss, “I don’t think I should like my husband if he
6369: hadn’t got any wits of his own, and I had to find head-piece for him.
6370: It’s a deal easier to do what pleases one’s husband, than to be
6371: puzzling what else one should do.”
6372: 
6373: “If people come to talk o’ doing what pleases their husbands,” said Mrs
6374: Tulliver, with a faint imitation of her sister Glegg, “I’m sure your
6375: brother might have waited a long while before he’d have found a wife
6376: that ’ud have let him have his say in everything, as I do. It’s nothing
6377: but law and erigation now, from when we first get up in the morning
6378: till we go to bed at night; and I never contradict him; I only say,
6379: ‘Well, Mr Tulliver, do as you like; but whativer you do, don’t go to
6380: law.”
6381: 
6382: Mrs Tulliver, as we have seen, was not without influence over her
6383: husband. No woman is; she can always incline him to do either what she
6384: wishes, or the reverse; and on the composite impulses that were
6385: threatening to hurry Mr Tulliver into “law,” Mrs Tulliver’s monotonous
6386: pleading had doubtless its share of force; it might even be comparable
6387: to that proverbial feather which has the credit or discredit of
6388: breaking the camel’s back; though, on a strictly impartial view, the
6389: blame ought rather to lie with the previous weight of feathers which
6390: had already placed the back in such imminent peril that an otherwise
6391: innocent feather could not settle on it without mischief. Not that Mrs
6392: Tulliver’s feeble beseeching could have had this feather’s weight in
6393: virtue of her single personality; but whenever she departed from entire
6394: assent to her husband, he saw in her the representative of the Dodson
6395: family; and it was a guiding principle with Mr Tulliver to let the
6396: Dodsons know that they were not to domineer over _him_, or—more
6397: specifically—that a male Tulliver was far more than equal to four
6398: female Dodsons, even though one of them was Mrs Glegg.
6399: 
6400: But not even a direct argument from that typical Dodson female herself
6401: against his going to law could have heightened his disposition toward
6402: it so much as the mere thought of Wakem, continually freshened by the
6403: sight of the too able attorney on market-days. Wakem, to his certain
6404: knowledge, was (metaphorically speaking) at the bottom of Pivart’s
6405: irrigation; Wakem had tried to make Dix stand out, and go to law about
6406: the dam; it was unquestionably Wakem who had caused Mr Tulliver to lose
6407: the suit about the right of road and the bridge that made a
6408: thoroughfare of his land for every vagabond who preferred an
6409: opportunity of damaging private property to walking like an honest man
6410: along the highroad; all lawyers were more or less rascals, but Wakem’s
6411: rascality was of that peculiarly aggravated kind which placed itself in
6412: opposition to that form of right embodied in Mr Tulliver’s interests
6413: and opinions. And as an extra touch of bitterness, the injured miller
6414: had recently, in borrowing the five hundred pounds, been obliged to
6415: carry a little business to Wakem’s office on his own account. A
6416: hook-nosed glib fellow! as cool as a cucumber,—always looking so sure
6417: of his game! And it was vexatious that Lawyer Gore was not more like
6418: him, but was a bald, round-featured man, with bland manners and fat
6419: hands; a game-cock that you would be rash to bet upon against Wakem.
6420: Gore was a sly fellow. His weakness did not lie on the side of
6421: scrupulosity; but the largest amount of winking, however significant,
6422: is not equivalent to seeing through a stone wall; and confident as Mr
6423: Tulliver was in his principle that water was water, and in the direct
6424: inference that Pivart had not a leg to stand on in this affair of
6425: irrigation, he had an uncomfortable suspicion that Wakem had more law
6426: to show against this (rationally) irrefragable inference than Gore
6427: could show for it. But then, if they went to law, there was a chance
6428: for Mr Tulliver to employ Counsellor Wylde on his side, instead of
6429: having that admirable bully against him; and the prospect of seeing a
6430: witness of Wakem’s made to perspire and become confounded, as Mr
6431: Tulliver’s witness had once been, was alluring to the love of
6432: retributive justice.
6433: 
6434: Much rumination had Mr Tulliver on these puzzling subjects during his
6435: rides on the gray horse; much turning of the head from side to side, as
6436: the scales dipped alternately; but the probable result was still out of
6437: sight, only to be reached through much hot argument and iteration in
6438: domestic and social life. That initial stage of the dispute which
6439: consisted in the narration of the case and the enforcement of Mr
6440: Tulliver’s views concerning it throughout the entire circle of his
6441: connections would necessarily take time; and at the beginning of
6442: February, when Tom was going to school again, there were scarcely any
6443: new items to be detected in his father’s statement of the case against
6444: Pivart, or any more specific indication of the measures he was bent on
6445: taking against that rash contravener of the principle that water was
6446: water. Iteration, like friction, is likely to generate heat instead of
6447: progress, and Mr Tulliver’s heat was certainly more and more palpable.
6448: If there had been no new evidence on any other point, there had been
6449: new evidence that Pivart was as “thick as mud” with Wakem.
6450: 
6451: “Father,” said Tom, one evening near the end of the holidays, “uncle
6452: Glegg says Lawyer Wakem _is_ going to send his son to Mr Stelling. It
6453: isn’t true, what they said about his going to be sent to France. You
6454: won’t like me to go to school with Wakem’s son, shall you?”
6455: 
6456: “It’s no matter for that, my boy,” said Mr Tulliver; “don’t you learn
6457: anything bad of him, that’s all. The lad’s a poor deformed creatur, and
6458: takes after his mother in the face; I think there isn’t much of his
6459: father in him. It’s a sign Wakem thinks high o’ Mr Sterling, as he
6460: sends his son to him, and Wakem knows meal from bran.”
6461: 
6462: Mr Tulliver in his heart was rather proud of the fact that his son was
6463: to have the same advantages as Wakem’s; but Tom was not at all easy on
6464: the point. It would have been much clearer if the lawyer’s son had not
6465: been deformed, for then Tom would have had the prospect of pitching
6466: into him with all that freedom which is derived from a high moral
6467: sanction.
6468: 
6469: 
6470: Chapter III.
6471: 
6472: The New Schoolfellow
6473: 
6474: It was a cold, wet January day on which Tom went back to school; a day
6475: quite in keeping with this severe phase of his destiny. If he had not
6476: carried in his pocket a parcel of sugar-candy and a small Dutch doll
6477: for little Laura, there would have been no ray of expected pleasure to
6478: enliven the general gloom. But he liked to think how Laura would put
6479: out her lips and her tiny hands for the bits of sugarcandy; and to give
6480: the greater keenness to these pleasures of imagination, he took out the
6481: parcel, made a small hole in the paper, and bit off a crystal or two,
6482: which had so solacing an effect under the confined prospect and damp
6483: odors of the gig-umbrella, that he repeated the process more than once
6484: on his way.
6485: 
6486: “Well, Tulliver, we’re glad to see you again,” said Mr Stelling,
6487: heartily. “Take off your wrappings and come into the study till dinner.
6488: You’ll find a bright fire there, and a new companion.”
6489: 
6490: Tom felt in an uncomfortable flutter as he took off his woollen
6491: comforter and other wrappings. He had seen Philip Wakem at St Ogg’s,
6492: but had always turned his eyes away from him as quickly as possible. He
6493: would have disliked having a deformed boy for his companion, even if
6494: Philip had not been the son of a bad man. And Tom did not see how a bad
6495: man’s son could be very good. His own father was a good man, and he
6496: would readily have fought any one who said the contrary. He was in a
6497: state of mingled embarrassment and defiance as he followed Mr Stelling
6498: to the study.
6499: 
6500: “Here is a new companion for you to shake hands with, Tulliver,” said
6501: that gentleman on entering the study,—“Master Philip Wakem. I shall
6502: leave you to make acquaintance by yourselves. You already know
6503: something of each other, I imagine; for you are neighbours at home.”
6504: 
6505: Tom looked confused and awkward, while Philip rose and glanced at him
6506: timidly. Tom did not like to go up and put out his hand, and he was not
6507: prepared to say, “How do you do?” on so short a notice.
6508: 
6509: Mr Stelling wisely turned away, and closed the door behind him; boys’
6510: shyness only wears off in the absence of their elders.
6511: 
6512: Philip was at once too proud and too timid to walk toward Tom. He
6513: thought, or rather felt, that Tom had an aversion to looking at him;
6514: every one, almost, disliked looking at him; and his deformity was more
6515: conspicuous when he walked. So they remained without shaking hands or
6516: even speaking, while Tom went to the fire and warmed himself, every now
6517: and then casting furtive glances at Philip, who seemed to be drawing
6518: absently first one object and then another on a piece of paper he had
6519: before him. He had seated himself again, and as he drew, was thinking
6520: what he could say to Tom, and trying to overcome his own repugnance to
6521: making the first advances.
6522: 
6523: Tom began to look oftener and longer at Philip’s face, for he could see
6524: it without noticing the hump, and it was really not a disagreeable
6525: face,—very old-looking, Tom thought. He wondered how much older Philip
6526: was than himself. An anatomist—even a mere physiognomist—would have
6527: seen that the deformity of Philip’s spine was not a congenital hump,
6528: but the result of an accident in infancy; but you do not expect from
6529: Tom any acquaintance with such distinctions; to him, Philip was simply
6530: a humpback. He had a vague notion that the deformity of Wakem’s son had
6531: some relation to the lawyer’s rascality, of which he had so often heard
6532: his father talk with hot emphasis; and he felt, too, a half-admitted
6533: fear of him as probably a spiteful fellow, who, not being able to fight
6534: you, had cunning ways of doing you a mischief by the sly. There was a
6535: humpbacked tailor in the neighbourhood of Mr Jacobs’s academy, who was
6536: considered a very unamiable character, and was much hooted after by
6537: public-spirited boys solely on the ground of his unsatisfactory moral
6538: qualities; so that Tom was not without a basis of fact to go upon.
6539: Still, no face could be more unlike that ugly tailor’s than this
6540: melancholy boy’s face,—the brown hair round it waved and curled at the
6541: ends like a girl’s: Tom thought that truly pitiable. This Wakem was a
6542: pale, puny fellow, and it was quite clear he would not be able to play
6543: at anything worth speaking of; but he handled his pencil in an enviable
6544: manner, and was apparently making one thing after another without any
6545: trouble. What was he drawing? Tom was quite warm now, and wanted
6546: something new to be going forward. It was certainly more agreeable to
6547: have an ill-natured humpback as a companion than to stand looking out
6548: of the study window at the rain, and kicking his foot against the
6549: washboard in solitude; something would happen every day,—“a quarrel or
6550: something”; and Tom thought he should rather like to show Philip that
6551: he had better not try his spiteful tricks on _him_. He suddenly walked
6552: across the hearth and looked over Philip’s paper.
6553: 
6554: “Why, that’s a donkey with panniers, and a spaniel, and partridges in
6555: the corn!” he exclaimed, his tongue being completely loosed by surprise
6556: and admiration. “Oh my buttons! I wish I could draw like that. I’m to
6557: learn drawing this half; I wonder if I shall learn to make dogs and
6558: donkeys!”
6559: 
6560: “Oh, you can do them without learning,” said Philip; “I never learned
6561: drawing.”
6562: 
6563: “Never learned?” said Tom, in amazement. “Why, when I make dogs and
6564: horses, and those things, the heads and the legs won’t come right;
6565: though I can see how they ought to be very well. I can make houses, and
6566: all sorts of chimneys,—chimneys going all down the wall,—and windows in
6567: the roof, and all that. But I dare say I could do dogs and horses if I
6568: was to try more,” he added, reflecting that Philip might falsely
6569: suppose that he was going to “knock under,” if he were too frank about
6570: the imperfection of his accomplishments.
6571: 
6572: “Oh, yes,” said Philip, “it’s very easy. You’ve only to look well at
6573: things, and draw them over and over again. What you do wrong once, you
6574: can alter the next time.”
6575: 
6576: “But haven’t you been taught _any_thing?” said Tom, beginning to have a
6577: puzzled suspicion that Philip’s crooked back might be the source of
6578: remarkable faculties. “I thought you’d been to school a long while.”
6579: 
6580: “Yes,” said Philip, smiling; “I’ve been taught Latin and Greek and
6581: mathematics, and writing and such things.”
6582: 
6583: “Oh, but I say, you don’t like Latin, though, do you?” said Tom,
6584: lowering his voice confidentially.
6585: 
6586: “Pretty well; I don’t care much about it,” said Philip.
6587: 
6588: “Ah, but perhaps you haven’t got into the _Propria quæ maribus_,” said
6589: Tom, nodding his head sideways, as much as to say, “that was the test;
6590: it was easy talking till you came to _that_.”
6591: 
6592: Philip felt some bitter complacency in the promising stupidity of this
6593: well-made, active-looking boy; but made polite by his own extreme
6594: sensitiveness, as well as by his desire to conciliate, he checked his
6595: inclination to laugh, and said quietly,—
6596: 
6597: “I’ve done with the grammar; I don’t learn that any more.”
6598: 
6599: “Then you won’t have the same lessons as I shall?” said Tom, with a
6600: sense of disappointment.
6601: 
6602: “No; but I dare say I can help you. I shall be very glad to help you if
6603: I can.”
6604: 
6605: Tom did not say “Thank you,” for he was quite absorbed in the thought
6606: that Wakem’s son did not seem so spiteful a fellow as might have been
6607: expected.
6608: 
6609: “I say,” he said presently, “do you love your father?”
6610: 
6611: “Yes,” said Philip, colouring deeply; “don’t you love yours?”
6612: 
6613: “Oh yes—I only wanted to know,” said Tom, rather ashamed of himself,
6614: now he saw Philip colouring and looking uncomfortable. He found much
6615: difficulty in adjusting his attitude of mind toward the son of Lawyer
6616: Wakem, and it had occurred to him that if Philip disliked his father,
6617: that fact might go some way toward clearing up his perplexity.
6618: 
6619: “Shall you learn drawing now?” he said, by way of changing the subject.
6620: 
6621: “No,” said Philip. “My father wishes me to give all my time to other
6622: things now.”
6623: 
6624: “What! Latin and Euclid, and those things?” said Tom.
6625: 
6626: “Yes,” said Philip, who had left off using his pencil, and was resting
6627: his head on one hand, while Tom was learning forward on both elbows,
6628: and looking with increasing admiration at the dog and the donkey.
6629: 
6630: “And you don’t mind that?” said Tom, with strong curiosity.
6631: 
6632: “No; I like to know what everybody else knows. I can study what I like
6633: by-and-by.”
6634: 
6635: “I can’t think why anybody should learn Latin,” said Tom. “It’s no
6636: good.”
6637: 
6638: “It’s part of the education of a gentleman,” said Philip. “All
6639: gentlemen learn the same things.”
6640: 
6641: “What! do you think Sir John Crake, the master of the harriers, knows
6642: Latin?” said Tom, who had often thought he should like to resemble Sir
6643: John Crake.
6644: 
6645: “He learned it when he was a boy, of course,” said Philip. “But I dare
6646: say he’s forgotten it.”
6647: 
6648: “Oh, well, I can do that, then,” said Tom, not with any epigrammatic
6649: intention, but with serious satisfaction at the idea that, as far as
6650: Latin was concerned, there was no hindrance to his resembling Sir John
6651: Crake. “Only you’re obliged to remember it while you’re at school, else
6652: you’ve got to learn ever so many lines of ‘Speaker.’ Mr Stelling’s very
6653: particular—did you know? He’ll have you up ten times if you say ‘nam’
6654: for ‘jam,’—he won’t let you go a letter wrong, _I_ can tell you.”
6655: 
6656: “Oh, I don’t mind,” said Philip, unable to choke a laugh; “I can
6657: remember things easily. And there are some lessons I’m very fond of.
6658: I’m very fond of Greek history, and everything about the Greeks. I
6659: should like to have been a Greek and fought the Persians, and then have
6660: come home and have written tragedies, or else have been listened to by
6661: everybody for my wisdom, like Socrates, and have died a grand death.”
6662: (Philip, you perceive, was not without a wish to impress the well-made
6663: barbarian with a sense of his mental superiority.)
6664: 
6665: “Why, were the Greeks great fighters?” said Tom, who saw a vista in
6666: this direction. “Is there anything like David and Goliath and Samson in
6667: the Greek history? Those are the only bits I like in the history of the
6668: Jews.”
6669: 
6670: “Oh, there are very fine stories of that sort about the Greeks,—about
6671: the heroes of early times who killed the wild beasts, as Samson did.
6672: And in the Odyssey—that’s a beautiful poem—there’s a more wonderful
6673: giant than Goliath,—Polypheme, who had only one eye in the middle of
6674: his forehead; and Ulysses, a little fellow, but very wise and cunning,
6675: got a red-hot pine-tree and stuck it into this one eye, and made him
6676: roar like a thousand bulls.”
6677: 
6678: “Oh, what fun!” said Tom, jumping away from the table, and stamping
6679: first with one leg and then the other. “I say, can you tell me all
6680: about those stories? Because I sha’n’t learn Greek, you know. Shall I?”
6681: he added, pausing in his stamping with a sudden alarm, lest the
6682: contrary might be possible. “Does every gentleman learn Greek? Will Mr
6683: Stelling make me begin with it, do you think?”
6684: 
6685: “No, I should think not, very likely not,” said Philip. “But you may
6686: read those stories without knowing Greek. I’ve got them in English.”
6687: 
6688: “Oh, but I don’t like reading; I’d sooner have you tell them me. But
6689: only the fighting ones, you know. My sister Maggie is always wanting to
6690: tell me stories, but they’re stupid things. Girls’ stories always are.
6691: Can you tell a good many fighting stories?”
6692: 
6693: “Oh yes,” said Philip; “lots of them, besides the Greek stories. I can
6694: tell you about Richard Cœur-de-Lion and Saladin, and about William
6695: Wallace and Robert Bruce and James Douglas,—I know no end.”
6696: 
6697: “You’re older than I am, aren’t you?” said Tom.
6698: 
6699: “Why, how old are _you?_ I’m fifteen.”
6700: 
6701: “I’m only going in fourteen,” said Tom. “But I thrashed all the fellows
6702: at Jacob’s—that’s where I was before I came here. And I beat ’em all at
6703: bandy and climbing. And I wish Mr Stelling would let us go fishing. _I_
6704: could show you how to fish. You _could_ fish, couldn’t you? It’s only
6705: standing, and sitting still, you know.”
6706: 
6707: Tom, in his turn, wished to make the balance dip in his favour. This
6708: hunchback must not suppose that his acquaintance with fighting stories
6709: put him on a par with an actual fighting hero, like Tom Tulliver.
6710: Philip winced under this allusion to his unfitness for active sports,
6711: and he answered almost peevishly,—
6712: 
6713: “I can’t bear fishing. I think people look like fools sitting watching
6714: a line hour after hour, or else throwing and throwing, and catching
6715: nothing.”
6716: 
6717: “Ah, but you wouldn’t say they looked like fools when they landed a big
6718: pike, I can tell you,” said Tom, who had never caught anything that was
6719: “big” in his life, but whose imagination was on the stretch with
6720: indignant zeal for the honour of sport. Wakem’s son, it was plain, had
6721: his disagreeable points, and must be kept in due check. Happily for the
6722: harmony of this first interview, they were now called to dinner, and
6723: Philip was not allowed to develop farther his unsound views on the
6724: subject of fishing. But Tom said to himself, that was just what he
6725: should have expected from a hunchback.

6728: Chapter IV.
6729: 
6730: “The Young Idea”
6731: 
6732: The alterations of feeling in that first dialogue between Tom and
6733: Philip continued to mark their intercourse even after many weeks of
6734: schoolboy intimacy. Tom never quite lost the feeling that Philip, being
6735: the son of a “rascal,” was his natural enemy; never thoroughly overcame
6736: his repulsion to Philip’s deformity. He was a boy who adhered
6737: tenaciously to impressions once received; as with all minds in which
6738: mere perception predominates over thought and emotion, the external
6739: remained to him rigidly what it was in the first instance. But then it
6740: was impossible not to like Philip’s company when he was in a good
6741: humour; he could help one so well in one’s Latin exercises, which Tom
6742: regarded as a kind of puzzle that could only be found out by a lucky
6743: chance; and he could tell such wonderful fighting stories about Hal of
6744: the Wynd, for example, and other heroes who were especial favourites
6745: with Tom, because they laid about them with heavy strokes. He had small
6746: opinion of Saladin, whose cimeter could cut a cushion in two in an
6747: instant; who wanted to cut cushions? That was a stupid story, and he
6748: didn’t care to hear it again. But when Robert Bruce, on the black pony,
6749: rose in his stirrups, and lifting his good battle-axe, cracked at once
6750: the helmet and the skull of the too hasty knight at Bannockburn, then
6751: Tom felt all the exaltation of sympathy, and if he had had a cocoanut
6752: at hand, he would have cracked it at once with the poker. Philip in his
6753: happier moods indulged Tom to the top of his bent, heightening the
6754: crash and bang and fury of every fight with all the artillery of
6755: epithets and similes at his command. But he was not always in a good
6756: humour or happy mood. The slight spurt of peevish susceptibility which
6757: had escaped him in their first interview was a symptom of a perpetually
6758: recurring mental ailment, half of it nervous irritability, half of it
6759: the heart-bitterness produced by the sense of his deformity. In these
6760: fits of susceptibility every glance seemed to him to be charged either
6761: with offensive pity or with ill-repressed disgust; at the very least it
6762: was an indifferent glance, and Philip felt indifference as a child of
6763: the south feels the chill air of a northern spring. Poor Tom’s
6764: blundering patronage when they were out of doors together would
6765: sometimes make him turn upon the well-meaning lad quite savagely; and
6766: his eyes, usually sad and quiet, would flash with anything but playful
6767: lightning. No wonder Tom retained his suspicions of the humpback.
6768: 
6769: But Philip’s self-taught skill in drawing was another link between
6770: them; for Tom found, to his disgust, that his new drawing-master gave
6771: him no dogs and donkeys to draw, but brooks and rustic bridges and
6772: ruins, all with a general softness of black-lead surface, indicating
6773: that nature, if anything, was rather satiny; and as Tom’s feeling for
6774: the picturesque in landscape was at present quite latent, it is not
6775: surprising that Mr Goodrich’s productions seemed to him an
6776: uninteresting form of art. Mr Tulliver, having a vague intention that
6777: Tom should be put to some business which included the drawing out of
6778: plans and maps, had complained to Mr Riley, when he saw him at Mudport,
6779: that Tom seemed to be learning nothing of that sort; whereupon that
6780: obliging adviser had suggested that Tom should have drawing-lessons. Mr
6781: Tulliver must not mind paying extra for drawing; let Tom be made a good
6782: draughtsman, and he would be able to turn his pencil to any purpose. So
6783: it was ordered that Tom should have drawing-lessons; and whom should Mr
6784: Stelling have selected as a master if not Mr Goodrich, who was
6785: considered quite at the head of his profession within a circuit of
6786: twelve miles round King’s Lorton? By which means Tom learned to make an
6787: extremely fine point to his pencil, and to represent landscape with a
6788: “broad generality,” which, doubtless from a narrow tendency in his mind
6789: to details, he thought extremely dull.
6790: 
6791: All this, you remember, happened in those dark ages when there were no
6792: schools of design; before schoolmasters were invariably men of
6793: scrupulous integrity, and before the clergy were all men of enlarged
6794: minds and varied culture. In those less favoured days, it is no fable
6795: that there were other clergymen besides Mr Stelling who had narrow
6796: intellects and large wants, and whose income, by a logical confusion to
6797: which Fortune, being a female as well as blindfold, is peculiarly
6798: liable, was proportioned not to their wants but to their intellect,
6799: with which income has clearly no inherent relation. The problem these
6800: gentlemen had to solve was to readjust the proportion between their
6801: wants and their income; and since wants are not easily starved to
6802: death, the simpler method appeared to be to raise their income. There
6803: was but one way of doing this; any of those low callings in which men
6804: are obliged to do good work at a low price were forbidden to clergymen;
6805: was it their fault if their only resource was to turn out very poor
6806: work at a high price? Besides, how should Mr Stelling be expected to
6807: know that education was a delicate and difficult business, any more
6808: than an animal endowed with a power of boring a hole through a rock
6809: should be expected to have wide views of excavation? Mr Stelling’s
6810: faculties had been early trained to boring in a straight line, and he
6811: had no faculty to spare. But among Tom’s contemporaries, whose fathers
6812: cast their sons on clerical instruction to find them ignorant after
6813: many days, there were many far less lucky than Tom Tulliver. Education
6814: was almost entirely a matter of luck—usually of ill-luck—in those
6815: distant days. The state of mind in which you take a billiard-cue or a
6816: dice-box in your hand is one of sober certainty compared with that of
6817: old-fashioned fathers, like Mr Tulliver, when they selected a school or
6818: a tutor for their sons. Excellent men, who had been forced all their
6819: lives to spell on an impromptu-phonetic system, and having carried on a
6820: successful business in spite of this disadvantage, had acquired money
6821: enough to give their sons a better start in life than they had had
6822: themselves, must necessarily take their chance as to the conscience and
6823: the competence of the schoolmaster whose circular fell in their way,
6824: and appeared to promise so much more than they would ever have thought
6825: of asking for, including the return of linen, fork, and spoon. It was
6826: happy for them if some ambitious draper of their acquaintance had not
6827: brought up his son to the Church, and if that young gentleman, at the
6828: age of four-and-twenty, had not closed his college dissipations by an
6829: imprudent marriage; otherwise, these innocent fathers, desirous of
6830: doing the best for their offspring, could only escape the draper’s son
6831: by happening to be on the foundation of a grammar-school as yet
6832: unvisited by commissioners, where two or three boys could have, all to
6833: themselves, the advantages of a large and lofty building, together with
6834: a head-master, toothless, dim-eyed and deaf, whose erudite
6835: indistinctness and inattention were engrossed by them at the rate of
6836: three hundred pounds a-head,—a ripe scholar, doubtless, when first
6837: appointed; but all ripeness beneath the sun has a further stage less
6838: esteemed in the market.
6839: 
6840: Tom Tulliver, then, compared with many other British youths of his time
6841: who have since had to scramble through life with some fragments of more
6842: or less relevant knowledge, and a great deal of strictly relevant
6843: ignorance, was not so very unlucky. Mr Stelling was a broad-chested,
6844: healthy man, with the bearing of a gentleman, a conviction that a
6845: growing boy required a sufficiency of beef, and a certain hearty
6846: kindness in him that made him like to see Tom looking well and enjoying
6847: his dinner; not a man of refined conscience, or with any deep sense of
6848: the infinite issues belonging to everyday duties, not quite competent
6849: to his high offices; but incompetent gentlemen must live, and without
6850: private fortune it is difficult to see how they could all live
6851: genteelly if they had nothing to do with education or government.
6852: Besides, it was the fault of Tom’s mental constitution that his
6853: faculties could not be nourished on the sort of knowledge Mr Stelling
6854: had to communicate. A boy born with a deficient power of apprehending
6855: signs and abstractions must suffer the penalty of his congenital
6856: deficiency, just as if he had been born with one leg shorter than the
6857: other. A method of education sanctioned by the long practice of our
6858: venerable ancestors was not to give way before the exceptional dulness
6859: of a boy who was merely living at the time then present. And Mr
6860: Stelling was convinced that a boy so stupid at signs and abstractions
6861: must be stupid at everything else, even if that reverend gentleman
6862: could have taught him everything else. It was the practice of our
6863: venerable ancestors to apply that ingenious instrument the thumb-screw,
6864: and to tighten and tighten it in order to elicit non-existent facts;
6865: they had a fixed opinion to begin with, that the facts were existent,
6866: and what had they to do but to tighten the thumb-screw? In like manner,
6867: Mr Stelling had a fixed opinion that all boys with any capacity could
6868: learn what it was the only regular thing to teach; if they were slow,
6869: the thumb-screw must be tightened,—the exercises must be insisted on
6870: with increased severity, and a page of Virgil be awarded as a penalty,
6871: to encourage and stimulate a too languid inclination to Latin verse.
6872: 
6873: The thumb-screw was a little relaxed, however, during this second
6874: half-year. Philip was so advanced in his studies, and so apt, that Mr
6875: Stelling could obtain credit by his facility, which required little
6876: help, much more easily than by the troublesome process of overcoming
6877: Tom’s dulness. Gentlemen with broad chests and ambitious intentions do
6878: sometimes disappoint their friends by failing to carry the world before
6879: them. Perhaps it is that high achievements demand some other unusual
6880: qualification besides an unusual desire for high prizes; perhaps it is
6881: that these stalwart gentlemen are rather indolent, their _divinæ
6882: particulum auræ_ being obstructed from soaring by a too hearty
6883: appetite. Some reason or other there was why Mr Stelling deferred the
6884: execution of many spirited projects,—why he did not begin the editing
6885: of his Greek play, or any other work of scholarship, in his leisure
6886: hours, but, after turning the key of his private study with much
6887: resolution, sat down to one of Theodore Hook’s novels. Tom was
6888: gradually allowed to shuffle through his lessons with less rigor, and
6889: having Philip to help him, he was able to make some show of having
6890: applied his mind in a confused and blundering way, without being
6891: cross-examined into a betrayal that his mind had been entirely neutral
6892: in the matter. He thought school much more bearable under this
6893: modification of circumstances; and he went on contentedly enough,
6894: picking up a promiscuous education chiefly from things that were not
6895: intended as education at all. What was understood to be his education
6896: was simply the practice of reading, writing, and spelling, carried on
6897: by an elaborate appliance of unintelligible ideas, and by much failure
6898: in the effort to learn by rote.
6899: 
6900: Nevertheless, there was a visible improvement in Tom under this
6901: training; perhaps because he was not a boy in the abstract, existing
6902: solely to illustrate the evils of a mistaken education, but a boy made
6903: of flesh and blood, with dispositions not entirely at the mercy of
6904: circumstances.
6905: 
6906: There was a great improvement in his bearing, for example; and some
6907: credit on this score was due to Mr Poulter, the village schoolmaster,
6908: who, being an old Peninsular soldier, was employed to drill Tom,—a
6909: source of high mutual pleasure. Mr Poulter, who was understood by the
6910: company at the Black Swan to have once struck terror into the hearts of
6911: the French, was no longer personally formidable. He had rather a
6912: shrunken appearance, and was tremulous in the mornings, not from age,
6913: but from the extreme perversity of the King’s Lorton boys, which
6914: nothing but gin could enable him to sustain with any firmness. Still,
6915: he carried himself with martial erectness, had his clothes scrupulously
6916: brushed, and his trousers tightly strapped; and on the Wednesday and
6917: Saturday afternoons, when he came to Tom, he was always inspired with
6918: gin and old memories, which gave him an exceptionally spirited air, as
6919: of a superannuated charger who hears the drum. The drilling-lessons
6920: were always protracted by episodes of warlike narrative, much more
6921: interesting to Tom than Philip’s stories out of the Iliad; for there
6922: were no cannon in the Iliad, and besides, Tom had felt some disgust on
6923: learning that Hector and Achilles might possibly never have existed.
6924: But the Duke of Wellington was really alive, and Bony had not been long
6925: dead; therefore Mr Poulter’s reminiscences of the Peninsular War were
6926: removed from all suspicion of being mythical. Mr Poulter, it appeared,
6927: had been a conspicuous figure at Talavera, and had contributed not a
6928: little to the peculiar terror with which his regiment of infantry was
6929: regarded by the enemy. On afternoons when his memory was more
6930: stimulated than usual, he remembered that the Duke of Wellington had
6931: (in strict privacy, lest jealousies should be awakened) expressed his
6932: esteem for that fine fellow Poulter. The very surgeon who attended him
6933: in the hospital after he had received his gunshot-wound had been
6934: profoundly impressed with the superiority of Mr Poulter’s flesh,—no
6935: other flesh would have healed in anything like the same time. On less
6936: personal matters connected with the important warfare in which he had
6937: been engaged, Mr Poulter was more reticent, only taking care not to
6938: give the weight of his authority to any loose notions concerning
6939: military history. Any one who pretended to a knowledge of what occurred
6940: at the siege of Badajos was especially an object of silent pity to Mr
6941: Poulter; he wished that prating person had been run down, and had the
6942: breath trampled out of him at the first go-off, as he himself had,—he
6943: might talk about the siege of Badajos then! Tom did not escape
6944: irritating his drilling-master occasionally, by his curiosity
6945: concerning other military matters than Mr Poulter’s personal
6946: experience.
6947: 
6948: “And General Wolfe, Mr Poulter,—wasn’t he a wonderful fighter?” said
6949: Tom, who held the notion that all the martial heroes commemorated on
6950: the public-house signs were engaged in the war with Bony.
6951: 
6952: “Not at all!” said Mr Poulter, contemptuously. “Nothing o’ the sort!
6953: Heads up!” he added, in a tone of stern command, which delighted Tom,
6954: and made him feel as if he were a regiment in his own person.
6955: 
6956: “No, no!” Mr Poulter would continue, on coming to a pause in his
6957: discipline; “they’d better not talk to me about General Wolfe. He did
6958: nothing but die of his wound; that’s a poor haction, I consider. Any
6959: other man ’ud have died o’ the wounds I’ve had. One of my sword-cuts
6960: ’ud ha’ killed a fellow like General Wolfe.”
6961: 
6962: “Mr Poulter,” Tom would say, at any allusion to the sword, “I wish
6963: you’d bring your sword and do the sword-exercise!”
6964: 
6965: For a long while Mr Poulter only shook his head in a significant manner
6966: at this request, and smiled patronizingly, as Jupiter may have done
6967: when Semele urged her too ambitious request. But one afternoon, when a
6968: sudden shower of heavy rain had detained Mr Poulter twenty minutes
6969: longer than usual at the Black Swan, the sword was brought,—just for
6970: Tom to look at.
6971: 
6972: “And this is the real sword you fought with in all the battles, Mr
6973: Poulter?” said Tom, handling the hilt. “Has it ever cut a Frenchman’s
6974: head off?”
6975: 
6976: “Head off? Ah! and would, if he’d had three heads.”
6977: 
6978: “But you had a gun and bayonet besides?” said Tom. “_I_ should like the
6979: gun and bayonet best, because you could shoot ’em first and spear ’em
6980: after. Bang! Ps-s-s-s!” Tom gave the requisite pantomime to indicate
6981: the double enjoyment of pulling the trigger and thrusting the spear.
6982: 
6983: “Ah, but the sword’s the thing when you come to close fighting,” said
6984: Mr Poulter, involuntarily falling in with Tom’s enthusiasm, and drawing
6985: the sword so suddenly that Tom leaped back with much agility.
6986: 
6987: “Oh, but, Mr Poulter, if you’re going to do the exercise,” said Tom, a
6988: little conscious that he had not stood his ground as became an
6989: Englishman, “let me go and call Philip. He’ll like to see you, you
6990: know.”
6991: 
6992: “What! the humpbacked lad?” said Mr Poulter, contemptuously; “what’s
6993: the use of _his_ looking on?”
6994: 
6995: “Oh, but he knows a great deal about fighting,” said Tom, “and how they
6996: used to fight with bows and arrows, and battle-axes.”
6997: 
6998: “Let him come, then. I’ll show him something different from his bows
6999: and arrows,” said Mr Poulter, coughing and drawing himself up, while he
7000: gave a little preliminary play to his wrist.
7001: 
7002: Tom ran in to Philip, who was enjoying his afternoon’s holiday at the
7003: piano, in the drawing-room, picking out tunes for himself and singing
7004: them. He was supremely happy, perched like an amorphous bundle on the
7005: high stool, with his head thrown back, his eyes fixed on the opposite
7006: cornice, and his lips wide open, sending forth, with all his might,
7007: impromptu syllables to a tune of Arne’s which had hit his fancy.
7008: 
7009: “Come, Philip,” said Tom, bursting in; “don’t stay roaring ‘la la’
7010: there; come and see old Poulter do his sword-exercise in the
7011: carriage-house!”
7012: 
7013: The jar of this interruption, the discord of Tom’s tones coming across
7014: the notes to which Philip was vibrating in soul and body, would have
7015: been enough to unhinge his temper, even if there had been no question
7016: of Poulter the drilling-master; and Tom, in the hurry of seizing
7017: something to say to prevent Mr Poulter from thinking he was afraid of
7018: the sword when he sprang away from it, had alighted on this proposition
7019: to fetch Philip, though he knew well enough that Philip hated to hear
7020: him mention his drilling-lessons. Tom would never have done so
7021: inconsiderate a thing except under the severe stress of his personal
7022: pride.
7023: 
7024: Philip shuddered visibly as he paused from his music. Then turning red,
7025: he said, with violent passion,—
7026: 
7027: “Get away, you lumbering idiot! Don’t come bellowing at me; you’re not
7028: fit to speak to anything but a cart-horse!”
7029: 
7030: It was not the first time Philip had been made angry by him, but Tom
7031: had never before been assailed with verbal missiles that he understood
7032: so well.
7033: 
7034: “I’m fit to speak to something better than you, you poor-spirited imp!”
7035: said Tom, lighting up immediately at Philip’s fire. “You know I won’t
7036: hit you, because you’re no better than a girl. But I’m an honest man’s
7037: son, and _your_ father’s a rogue; everybody says so!”
7038: 
7039: Tom flung out of the room, and slammed the door after him, made
7040: strangely heedless by his anger; for to slam doors within the hearing
7041: of Mrs Stelling, who was probably not far off, was an offence only to
7042: be wiped out by twenty lines of Virgil. In fact, that lady did
7043: presently descend from her room, in double wonder at the noise and the
7044: subsequent cessation of Philip’s music. She found him sitting in a heap
7045: on the hassock, and crying bitterly.
7046: 
7047: “What’s the matter, Wakem? what was that noise about? Who slammed the
7048: door?”
7049: 
7050: Philip looked up, and hastily dried his eyes. “It was Tulliver who came
7051: in—to ask me to go out with him.”
7052: 
7053: “And what are you in trouble about?” said Mrs Stelling.
7054: 
7055: Philip was not her favourite of the two pupils; he was less obliging
7056: than Tom, who was made useful in many ways. Still, his father paid more
7057: than Mr Tulliver did, and she meant him to feel that she behaved
7058: exceedingly well to him. Philip, however, met her advances toward a
7059: good understanding very much as a caressed mollusk meets an invitation
7060: to show himself out of his shell. Mrs Stelling was not a loving,
7061: tender-hearted woman; she was a woman whose skirt sat well, who
7062: adjusted her waist and patted her curls with a preoccupied air when she
7063: inquired after your welfare. These things, doubtless, represent a great
7064: social power, but it is not the power of love; and no other power could
7065: win Philip from his personal reserve.
7066: 
7067: He said, in answer to her question, “My toothache came on, and made me
7068: hysterical again.”
7069: 
7070: This had been the fact once, and Philip was glad of the recollection;
7071: it was like an inspiration to enable him to excuse his crying. He had
7072: to accept eau-de-Cologne and to refuse creosote in consequence; but
7073: that was easy.
7074: 
7075: Meanwhile Tom, who had for the first time sent a poisoned arrow into
7076: Philip’s heart, had returned to the carriage-house, where he found Mr
7077: Poulter, with a fixed and earnest eye, wasting the perfections of his
7078: sword-exercise on probably observant but inappreciative rats. But Mr
7079: Poulter was a host in himself; that is to say, he admired himself more
7080: than a whole army of spectators could have admired him. He took no
7081: notice of Tom’s return, being too entirely absorbed in the cut and
7082: thrust,—the solemn one, two, three, four; and Tom, not without a slight
7083: feeling of alarm at Mr Poulter’s fixed eye and hungry-looking sword,
7084: which seemed impatient for something else to cut besides the air,
7085: admired the performance from as great a distance as possible. It was
7086: not until Mr Poulter paused and wiped the perspiration from his
7087: forehead, that Tom felt the full charm of the sword-exercise, and
7088: wished it to be repeated.
7089: 
7090: “Mr Poulter,” said Tom, when the sword was being finally sheathed, “I
7091: wish you’d lend me your sword a little while to keep.”
7092: 
7093: “No no, young gentleman,” said Mr Poulter, shaking his head decidedly;
7094: “you might do yourself some mischief with it.”
7095: 
7096: “No, I’m sure I wouldn’t; I’m sure I’d take care and not hurt myself. I
7097: shouldn’t take it out of the sheath much, but I could ground arms with
7098: it, and all that.”
7099: 
7100: “No, no, it won’t do, I tell you; it won’t do,” said Mr Poulter,
7101: preparing to depart. “What ’ud Mr Stelling say to me?”
7102: 
7103: “Oh, I say, do, Mr Poulter! I’d give you my five-shilling piece if
7104: you’d let me keep the sword a week. Look here!” said Tom, reaching out
7105: the attractively large round of silver. The young dog calculated the
7106: effect as well as if he had been a philosopher.
7107: 
7108: “Well,” said Mr Poulter, with still deeper gravity, “you must keep it
7109: out of sight, you know.”
7110: 
7111: “Oh yes, I’ll keep it under the bed,” said Tom, eagerly, “or else at
7112: the bottom of my large box.”
7113: 
7114: “And let me see, now, whether you can draw it out of the sheath without
7115: hurting yourself.” That process having been gone through more than
7116: once, Mr Poulter felt that he had acted with scrupulous
7117: conscientiousness, and said, “Well, now, Master Tulliver, if I take the
7118: crown-piece, it is to make sure as you’ll do no mischief with the
7119: sword.”
7120: 
7121: “Oh no, indeed, Mr Poulter,” said Tom, delightedly handing him the
7122: crown-piece, and grasping the sword, which, he thought, might have been
7123: lighter with advantage.
7124: 
7125: “But if Mr Stelling catches you carrying it in?” said Mr Poulter,
7126: pocketing the crown-piece provisionally while he raised this new doubt.
7127: 
7128: “Oh, he always keeps in his upstairs study on Saturday afternoon,” said
7129: Tom, who disliked anything sneaking, but was not disinclined to a
7130: little stratagem in a worthy cause. So he carried off the sword in
7131: triumph mixed with dread—dread that he might encounter Mr or Mrs
7132: Stelling—to his bedroom, where, after some consideration, he hid it in
7133: the closet behind some hanging clothes. That night he fell asleep in
7134: the thought that he would astonish Maggie with it when she came,—tie it
7135: round his waist with his red comforter, and make her believe that the
7136: sword was his own, and that he was going to be a soldier. There was
7137: nobody but Maggie who would be silly enough to believe him, or whom he
7138: dared allow to know he had a sword; and Maggie was really coming next
7139: week to see Tom, before she went to a boarding-school with Lucy.
7140: 
7141: If you think a lad of thirteen would not have been so childish, you
7142: must be an exceptionally wise man, who, although you are devoted to a
7143: civil calling, requiring you to look bland rather than formidable, yet
7144: never, since you had a beard, threw yourself into a martial attitude,
7145: and frowned before the looking-glass. It is doubtful whether our
7146: soldiers would be maintained if there were not pacific people at home
7147: who like to fancy themselves soldiers. War, like other dramatic
7148: spectacles, might possibly cease for want of a “public.”
7149: 
7150: 
7151: Chapter V.
7152: 
7153: Maggie’s Second Visit
7154: 
7155: This last breach between the two lads was not readily mended, and for
7156: some time they spoke to each other no more than was necessary. Their
7157: natural antipathy of temperament made resentment an easy passage to
7158: hatred, and in Philip the transition seemed to have begun; there was no
7159: malignity in his disposition, but there was a susceptibility that made
7160: him peculiarly liable to a strong sense of repulsion. The ox—we may
7161: venture to assert it on the authority of a great classic—is not given
7162: to use his teeth as an instrument of attack, and Tom was an excellent
7163: bovine lad, who ran at questionable objects in a truly ingenious bovine
7164: manner; but he had blundered on Philip’s tenderest point, and had
7165: caused him as much acute pain as if he had studied the means with the
7166: nicest precision and the most envenomed spite. Tom saw no reason why
7167: they should not make up this quarrel as they had done many others, by
7168: behaving as if nothing had happened; for though he had never before
7169: said to Philip that his father was a rogue, this idea had so habitually
7170: made part of his feeling as to the relation between himself and his
7171: dubious schoolfellow, whom he could neither like nor dislike, that the
7172: mere utterance did not make such an epoch to him as it did to Philip.
7173: And he had a right to say so when Philip hectored over _him_, and
7174: called him names. But perceiving that his first advances toward amity
7175: were not met, he relapsed into his least favourable disposition toward
7176: Philip, and resolved never to appeal to him either about drawing or
7177: exercise again. They were only so far civil to each other as was
7178: necessary to prevent their state of feud from being observed by Mr
7179: Stelling, who would have “put down” such nonsense with great vigor.
7180: 
7181: When Maggie came, however, she could not help looking with growing
7182: interest at the new schoolfellow, although he was the son of that
7183: wicked Lawyer Wakem, who made her father so angry. She had arrived in
7184: the middle of school-hours, and had sat by while Philip went through
7185: his lessons with Mr Stelling. Tom, some weeks ago, had sent her word
7186: that Philip knew no end of stories,—not stupid stories like hers; and
7187: she was convinced now from her own observation that he must be very
7188: clever; she hoped he would think _her_ rather clever too, when she came
7189: to talk to him. Maggie, moreover, had rather a tenderness for deformed
7190: things; she preferred the wry-necked lambs, because it seemed to her
7191: that the lambs which were quite strong and well made wouldn’t mind so
7192: much about being petted; and she was especially fond of petting objects
7193: that would think it very delightful to be petted by her. She loved Tom
7194: very dearly, but she often wished that he _cared_ more about her loving
7195: him.
7196: 
7197: “I think Philip Wakem seems a nice boy, Tom,” she said, when they went
7198: out of the study together into the garden, to pass the interval before
7199: dinner. “He couldn’t choose his father, you know; and I’ve read of very
7200: bad men who had good sons, as well as good parents who had bad
7201: children. And if Philip is good, I think we ought to be the more sorry
7202: for him because his father is not a good man. _You_ like him, don’t
7203: you?”
7204: 
7205: “Oh, he’s a queer fellow,” said Tom, curtly, “and he’s as sulky as can
7206: be with me, because I told him his father was a rogue. And I’d a right
7207: to tell him so, for it was true; and _he_ began it, with calling me
7208: names. But you stop here by yourself a bit, Maggie, will you? I’ve got
7209: something I want to do upstairs.”
7210: 
7211: “Can’t I go too?” said Maggie, who in this first day of meeting again
7212: loved Tom’s shadow.
7213: 
7214: “No, it’s something I’ll tell you about by-and-by, not yet,” said Tom,
7215: skipping away.
7216: 
7217: In the afternoon the boys were at their books in the study, preparing
7218: the morrow’s lessons that they might have a holiday in the evening in
7219: honour of Maggie’s arrival. Tom was hanging over his Latin grammar,
7220: moving his lips inaudibly like a strict but impatient Catholic
7221: repeating his tale of paternosters; and Philip, at the other end of the
7222: room, was busy with two volumes, with a look of contented diligence
7223: that excited Maggie’s curiosity; he did not look at all as if he were
7224: learning a lesson. She sat on a low stool at nearly a right angle with
7225: the two boys, watching first one and then the other; and Philip,
7226: looking off his book once toward the fire-place, caught the pair of
7227: questioning dark eyes fixed upon him. He thought this sister of
7228: Tulliver’s seemed a nice little thing, quite unlike her brother; he
7229: wished _he_ had a little sister. What was it, he wondered, that made
7230: Maggie’s dark eyes remind him of the stories about princesses being
7231: turned into animals? I think it was that her eyes were full of
7232: unsatisfied intelligence, and unsatisfied beseeching affection.
7233: 
7234: “I say, Magsie,” said Tom at last, shutting his books and putting them
7235: away with the energy and decision of a perfect master in the art of
7236: leaving off, “I’ve done my lessons now. Come upstairs with me.”
7237: 
7238: “What is it?” said Maggie, when they were outside the door, a slight
7239: suspicion crossing her mind as she remembered Tom’s preliminary visit
7240: upstairs. “It isn’t a trick you’re going to play me, now?”
7241: 
7242: “No, no, Maggie,” said Tom, in his most coaxing tone; “It’s something
7243: you’ll like _ever so_.”
7244: 
7245: He put his arm round her neck, and she put hers round his waist, and
7246: twined together in this way, they went upstairs.
7247: 
7248: “I say, Magsie, you must not tell anybody, you know,” said Tom, “else I
7249: shall get fifty lines.”
7250: 
7251: “Is it alive?” said Maggie, whose imagination had settled for the
7252: moment on the idea that Tom kept a ferret clandestinely.
7253: 
7254: “Oh, I sha’n’t tell you,” said he. “Now you go into that corner and
7255: hide your face, while I reach it out,” he added, as he locked the
7256: bedroom door behind them. “I’ll tell you when to turn round. You
7257: mustn’t squeal out, you know.”
7258: 
7259: “Oh, but if you frighten me, I shall,” said Maggie, beginning to look
7260: rather serious.
7261: 
7262: “You won’t be frightened, you silly thing,” said Tom. “Go and hide your
7263: face, and mind you don’t peep.”
7264: 
7265: “Of course I sha’n’t peep,” said Maggie, disdainfully; and she buried
7266: her face in the pillow like a person of strict honour.
7267: 
7268: But Tom looked round warily as he walked to the closet; then he stepped
7269: into the narrow space, and almost closed the door. Maggie kept her face
7270: buried without the aid of principle, for in that dream-suggestive
7271: attitude she had soon forgotten where she was, and her thoughts were
7272: busy with the poor deformed boy, who was so clever, when Tom called
7273: out, “Now then, Magsie!”
7274: 
7275: Nothing but long meditation and preconcerted arrangement of effects
7276: could have enabled Tom to present so striking a figure as he did to
7277: Maggie when she looked up. Dissatisfied with the pacific aspect of a
7278: face which had no more than the faintest hint of flaxen eyebrow,
7279: together with a pair of amiable blue-gray eyes and round pink cheeks
7280: that refused to look formidable, let him frown as he would before the
7281: looking-glass (Philip had once told him of a man who had a horseshoe
7282: frown, and Tom had tried with all his frowning might to make a
7283: horseshoe on his forehead), he had had recourse to that unfailing
7284: source of the terrible, burnt cork, and had made himself a pair of
7285: black eyebrows that met in a satisfactory manner over his nose, and
7286: were matched by a less carefully adjusted blackness about the chin. He
7287: had wound a red handkerchief round his cloth cap to give it the air of
7288: a turban, and his red comforter across his breast as a scarf,—an amount
7289: of red which, with the tremendous frown on his brow, and the decision
7290: with which he grasped the sword, as he held it with its point resting
7291: on the ground, would suffice to convey an approximate idea of his
7292: fierce and bloodthirsty disposition.
7293: 
7294: Maggie looked bewildered for a moment, and Tom enjoyed that moment
7295: keenly; but in the next she laughed, clapped her hands together, and
7296: said, “Oh, Tom, you’ve made yourself like Bluebeard at the show.”
7297: 
7298: It was clear she had not been struck with the presence of the sword,—it
7299: was not unsheathed. Her frivolous mind required a more direct appeal to
7300: its sense of the terrible, and Tom prepared for his master-stroke.
7301: Frowning with a double amount of intention, if not of corrugation, he
7302: (carefully) drew the sword from its sheath, and pointed it at Maggie.
7303: 
7304: “Oh, Tom, please don’t!” exclaimed Maggie, in a tone of suppressed
7305: dread, shrinking away from him into the opposite corner. “I _shall_
7306: scream—I’m sure I shall! Oh, don’t I wish I’d never come upstairs!”
7307: 
7308: The corners of Tom’s mouth showed an inclination to a smile of
7309: complacency that was immediately checked as inconsistent with the
7310: severity of a great warrior. Slowly he let down the scabbard on the
7311: floor, lest it should make too much noise, and then said sternly,—
7312: 
7313: “I’m the Duke of Wellington! March!” stamping forward with the right
7314: leg a little bent, and the sword still pointing toward Maggie, who,
7315: trembling, and with tear-filled eyes, got upon the bed, as the only
7316: means of widening the space between them.
7317: 
7318: Tom, happy in this spectator of his military performances, even though
7319: the spectator was only Maggie, proceeded, with the utmost exertion of
7320: his force, to such an exhibition of the cut and thrust as would
7321: necessarily be expected of the Duke of Wellington.
7322: 
7323: “Tom, I _will not_ bear it, I _will_ scream,” said Maggie, at the first
7324: movement of the sword. “You’ll hurt yourself; you’ll cut your head
7325: off!”
7326: 
7327: “One—two,” said Tom, resolutely, though at “two” his wrist trembled a
7328: little. “Three” came more slowly, and with it the sword swung downward,
7329: and Maggie gave a loud shriek. The sword had fallen, with its edge on
7330: Tom’s foot, and in a moment after he had fallen too. Maggie leaped from
7331: the bed, still shrieking, and immediately there was a rush of footsteps
7332: toward the room. Mr Stelling, from his upstairs study, was the first to
7333: enter. He found both the children on the floor. Tom had fainted, and
7334: Maggie was shaking him by the collar of his jacket, screaming, with
7335: wild eyes. She thought he was dead, poor child! and yet she shook him,
7336: as if that would bring him back to life. In another minute she was
7337: sobbing with joy because Tom opened his eyes. She couldn’t sorrow yet
7338: that he had hurt his foot; it seemed as if all happiness lay in his
7339: being alive.
7340: 
7341: 
7342: Chapter VI.
7343: 
7344: A Love-Scene
7345: 
7346: Poor Tom bore his severe pain heroically, and was resolute in not
7347: “telling” of Mr Poulter more than was unavoidable; the five-shilling
7348: piece remained a secret even to Maggie. But there was a terrible dread
7349: weighing on his mind, so terrible that he dared not even ask the
7350: question which might bring the fatal “yes”; he dared not ask the
7351: surgeon or Mr Stelling, “Shall I be lame, Sir?” He mastered himself so
7352: as not to cry out at the pain; but when his foot had been dressed, and
7353: he was left alone with Maggie seated by his bedside, the children
7354: sobbed together, with their heads laid on the same pillow. Tom was
7355: thinking of himself walking about on crutches, like the wheelwright’s
7356: son; and Maggie, who did not guess what was in his mind, sobbed for
7357: company. It had not occurred to the surgeon or to Mr Stelling to
7358: anticipate this dread in Tom’s mind, and to reassure him by hopeful
7359: words. But Philip watched the surgeon out of the house, and waylaid Mr
7360: Stelling to ask the very question that Tom had not dared to ask for
7361: himself.
7362: 
7363: “I beg your pardon, sir,—but does Mr Askern say Tulliver will be lame?”
7364: 
7365: “Oh, no; oh, no,” said Mr Stelling, “not permanently; only for a little
7366: while.”
7367: 
7368: “Did he tell Tulliver so, sir, do you think?”
7369: 
7370: “No; nothing was said to him on the subject.”
7371: 
7372: “Then may I go and tell him, sir?”
7373: 
7374: “Yes, to be sure; now you mention it, I dare say he may be troubling
7375: about that. Go to his bedroom, but be very quiet at present.”
7376: 
7377: It had been Philip’s first thought when he heard of the accident,—“Will
7378: Tulliver be lame? It will be very hard for him if he is”; and Tom’s
7379: hitherto unforgiven offences were washed out by that pity. Philip felt
7380: that they were no longer in a state of repulsion, but were being drawn
7381: into a common current of suffering and sad privation. His imagination
7382: did not dwell on the outward calamity and its future effect on Tom’s
7383: life, but it made vividly present to him the probable state of Tom’s
7384: feeling. Philip had only lived fourteen years, but those years had,
7385: most of them, been steeped in the sense of a lot irremediably hard.
7386: 
7387: “Mr Askern says you’ll soon be all right again, Tulliver, did you
7388: know?” he said rather timidly, as he stepped gently up to Tom’s bed.
7389: “I’ve just been to ask Mr Stelling, and he says you’ll walk as well as
7390: ever again by-and-day.”
7391: 
7392: Tom looked up with that momentary stopping of the breath which comes
7393: with a sudden joy; then he gave a long sigh, and turned his blue-gray
7394: eyes straight on Philip’s face, as he had not done for a fortnight or
7395: more. As for Maggie, this intimation of a possibility she had not
7396: thought of before affected her as a new trouble; the bare idea of Tom’s
7397: being always lame overpowered the assurance that such a misfortune was
7398: not likely to befall him, and she clung to him and cried afresh.
7399: 
7400: “Don’t be a little silly, Magsie,” said Tom, tenderly, feeling very
7401: brave now. “I shall soon get well.”
7402: 
7403: “Good-by, Tulliver,” said Philip, putting out his small, delicate hand,
7404: which Tom clasped immediately with his more substantial fingers.
7405: 
7406: “I say,” said Tom, “ask Mr Stelling to let you come and sit with me
7407: sometimes, till I get up again, Wakem; and tell me about Robert Bruce,
7408: you know.”
7409: 
7410: After that, Philip spent all his time out of school-hours with Tom and
7411: Maggie. Tom liked to hear fighting stories as much as ever, but he
7412: insisted strongly on the fact that those great fighters who did so many
7413: wonderful things and came off unhurt, wore excellent armor from head to
7414: foot, which made fighting easy work, he considered. He should not have
7415: hurt his foot if he had had an iron shoe on. He listened with great
7416: interest to a new story of Philip’s about a man who had a very bad
7417: wound in his foot, and cried out so dreadfully with the pain that his
7418: friends could bear with him no longer, but put him ashore on a desert
7419: island, with nothing but some wonderful poisoned arrows to kill animals
7420: with for food.
7421: 
7422: “I didn’t roar out a bit, you know,” Tom said, “and I dare say my foot
7423: was as bad as his. It’s cowardly to roar.”
7424: 
7425: But Maggie would have it that when anything hurt you very much, it was
7426: quite permissible to cry out, and it was cruel of people not to bear
7427: it. She wanted to know if Philoctetes had a sister, and why _she_
7428: didn’t go with him on the desert island and take care of him.
7429: 
7430: One day, soon after Philip had told this story, he and Maggie were in
7431: the study alone together while Tom’s foot was being dressed. Philip was
7432: at his books, and Maggie, after sauntering idly round the room, not
7433: caring to do anything in particular, because she would soon go to Tom
7434: again, went and leaned on the table near Philip to see what he was
7435: doing, for they were quite old friends now, and perfectly at home with
7436: each other.
7437: 
7438: “What are you reading about in Greek?” she said. “It’s poetry, I can
7439: see that, because the lines are so short.”
7440: 
7441: “It’s about Philoctetes, the lame man I was telling you of yesterday,”
7442: he answered, resting his head on his hand, and looking at her as if he
7443: were not at all sorry to be interrupted. Maggie, in her absent way,
7444: continued to lean forward, resting on her arms and moving her feet
7445: about, while her dark eyes got more and more fixed and vacant, as if
7446: she had quite forgotten Philip and his book.
7447: 
7448: “Maggie,” said Philip, after a minute or two, still leaning on his
7449: elbow and looking at her, “if you had had a brother like me, do you
7450: think you should have loved him as well as Tom?”
7451: 
7452: Maggie started a little on being roused from her reverie, and said,
7453: “What?” Philip repeated his question.
7454: 
7455: “Oh, yes, better,” she answered immediately. “No, not better; because I
7456: don’t think I _could_ love you better than Tom. But I should be so
7457: sorry,—_so sorry_ for you.”
7458: 
7459: Philip coloured; he had meant to imply, would she love him as well in
7460: spite of his deformity, and yet when she alluded to it so plainly, he
7461: winced under her pity. Maggie, young as she was, felt her mistake.
7462: Hitherto she had instinctively behaved as if she were quite unconscious
7463: of Philip’s deformity; her own keen sensitiveness and experience under
7464: family criticism sufficed to teach her this as well as if she had been
7465: directed by the most finished breeding.
7466: 
7467: “But you are so very clever, Philip, and you can play and sing,” she
7468: added quickly. “I wish you _were_ my brother. I’m very fond of you. And
7469: you would stay at home with me when Tom went out, and you would teach
7470: me everything; wouldn’t you,—Greek and everything?”
7471: 
7472: “But you’ll go away soon, and go to school, Maggie,” said Philip, “and
7473: then you’ll forget all about me, and not care for me any more. And then
7474: I shall see you when you’re grown up, and you’ll hardly take any notice
7475: of me.”
7476: 
7477: “Oh, no, I sha’n’t forget you, I’m sure,” said Maggie, shaking her head
7478: very seriously. “I never forget anything, and I think about everybody
7479: when I’m away from them. I think about poor Yap; he’s got a lump in his
7480: throat, and Luke says he’ll die. Only don’t you tell Tom. because it
7481: will vex him so. You never saw Yap; he’s a queer little dog,—nobody
7482: cares about him but Tom and me.”
7483: 
7484: “Do you care as much about me as you do about Yap, Maggie?” said
7485: Philip, smiling rather sadly.
7486: 
7487: “Oh, yes, I should think so,” said Maggie, laughing.
7488: 
7489: “I’m very fond of _you_, Maggie; I shall never forget _you_,” said
7490: Philip, “and when I’m very unhappy, I shall always think of you, and
7491: wish I had a sister with dark eyes, just like yours.”
7492: 
7493: “Why do you like my eyes?” said Maggie, well pleased. She had never
7494: heard any one but her father speak of her eyes as if they had merit.
7495: 
7496: “I don’t know,” said Philip. “They’re not like any other eyes. They
7497: seem trying to speak,—trying to speak kindly. I don’t like other people
7498: to look at me much, but I like you to look at me, Maggie.”
7499: 
7500: “Why, I think you’re fonder of me than Tom is,” said Maggie, rather
7501: sorrowfully. Then, wondering how she could convince Philip that she
7502: could like him just as well, although he was crooked, she said:
7503: 
7504: “Should you like me to kiss you, as I do Tom? I will, if you like.”
7505: 
7506: “Yes, very much; nobody kisses me.”
7507: 
7508: Maggie put her arm round his neck and kissed him quite earnestly.
7509: 
7510: “There now,” she said, “I shall always remember you, and kiss you when
7511: I see you again, if it’s ever so long. But I’ll go now, because I think
7512: Mr Askern’s done with Tom’s foot.”
7513: 
7514: When their father came the second time, Maggie said to him, “Oh,
7515: father, Philip Wakem is so very good to Tom; he is such a clever boy,
7516: and I _do_ love him. And you love him too, Tom, don’t you? _Say_ you
7517: love him,” she added entreatingly.
7518: 
7519: Tom coloured a little as he looked at his father, and said: “I sha’n’t
7520: be friends with him when I leave school, father; but we’ve made it up
7521: now, since my foot has been bad, and he’s taught me to play at
7522: draughts, and I can beat him.”
7523: 
7524: “Well, well,” said Mr Tulliver, “if he’s good to you, try and make him
7525: amends, and be good to _him_. He’s a poor crooked creature, and takes
7526: after his dead mother. But don’t you be getting too thick with him;
7527: he’s got his father’s blood in him too. Ay, ay, the gray colt may
7528: chance to kick like his black sire.”
7529: 
7530: The jarring natures of the two boys effected what Mr Tulliver’s
7531: admonition alone might have failed to effect; in spite of Philip’s new
7532: kindness, and Tom’s answering regard in this time of his trouble, they
7533: never became close friends. When Maggie was gone, and when Tom
7534: by-and-by began to walk about as usual, the friendly warmth that had
7535: been kindled by pity and gratitude died out by degrees, and left them
7536: in their old relation to each other. Philip was often peevish and
7537: contemptuous; and Tom’s more specific and kindly impressions gradually
7538: melted into the old background of suspicion and dislike toward him as a
7539: queer fellow, a humpback, and the son of a rogue. If boys and men are
7540: to be welded together in the glow of transient feeling, they must be
7541: made of metal that will mix, else they inevitably fall asunder when the
7542: heat dies out.

7545: Chapter VII.
7546: 
7547: The Golden Gates Are Passed
7548: 
7549: So Tom went on even to the fifth half-year—till he was turned
7550: sixteen—at King’s Lorton, while Maggie was growing with a rapidity
7551: which her aunts considered highly reprehensible, at Miss Firniss’s
7552: boarding-school in the ancient town of Laceham on the Floss, with
7553: cousin Lucy for her companion. In her early letters to Tom she had
7554: always sent her love to Philip, and asked many questions about him,
7555: which were answered by brief sentences about Tom’s toothache, and a
7556: turf-house which he was helping to build in the garden, with other
7557: items of that kind. She was pained to hear Tom say in the holidays that
7558: Philip was as queer as ever again, and often cross. They were no longer
7559: very good friends, she perceived; and when she reminded Tom that he
7560: ought always to love Philip for being so good to him when his foot was
7561: bad, he answered: “Well, it isn’t my fault; _I_ don’t do anything to
7562: him.” She hardly ever saw Philip during the remainder of their
7563: school-life; in the Midsummer holidays he was always away at the
7564: seaside, and at Christmas she could only meet him at long intervals in
7565: the street of St Ogg’s. When they did meet, she remembered her promise
7566: to kiss him, but, as a young lady who had been at a boarding-school,
7567: she knew now that such a greeting was out of the question, and Philip
7568: would not expect it. The promise was void, like so many other sweet,
7569: illusory promises of our childhood; void as promises made in Eden
7570: before the seasons were divided, and when the starry blossoms grew side
7571: by side with the ripening peach,—impossible to be fulfilled when the
7572: golden gates had been passed.
7573: 
7574: But when their father was actually engaged in the long-threatened
7575: lawsuit, and Wakem, as the agent at once of Pivart and Old Harry, was
7576: acting against him, even Maggie felt, with some sadness, that they were
7577: not likely ever to have any intimacy with Philip again; the very name
7578: of Wakem made her father angry, and she had once heard him say that if
7579: that crook-backed son lived to inherit his father’s ill-gotten gains,
7580: there would be a curse upon him. “Have as little to do with him at
7581: school as you can, my lad,” he said to Tom; and the command was obeyed
7582: the more easily because Mr Sterling by this time had two additional
7583: pupils; for though this gentleman’s rise in the world was not of that
7584: meteor-like rapidity which the admirers of his extemporaneous eloquence
7585: had expected for a preacher whose voice demanded so wide a sphere, he
7586: had yet enough of growing prosperity to enable him to increase his
7587: expenditure in continued disproportion to his income.
7588: 
7589: As for Tom’s school course, it went on with mill-like monotony, his
7590: mind continuing to move with a slow, half-stifled pulse in a medium of
7591: uninteresting or unintelligible ideas. But each vacation he brought
7592: home larger and larger drawings with the satiny rendering of landscape,
7593: and water-colours in vivid greens, together with manuscript books full
7594: of exercises and problems, in which the handwriting was all the finer
7595: because he gave his whole mind to it. Each vacation he brought home a
7596: new book or two, indicating his progress through different stages of
7597: history, Christian doctrine, and Latin literature; and that passage was
7598: not entirely without results, besides the possession of the books.
7599: Tom’s ear and tongue had become accustomed to a great many words and
7600: phrases which are understood to be signs of an educated condition; and
7601: though he had never really applied his mind to any one of his lessons,
7602: the lessons had left a deposit of vague, fragmentary, ineffectual
7603: notions. Mr Tulliver, seeing signs of acquirement beyond the reach of
7604: his own criticism, thought it was probably all right with Tom’s
7605: education; he observed, indeed, that there were no maps, and not enough
7606: “summing”; but he made no formal complaint to Mr Stelling. It was a
7607: puzzling business, this schooling; and if he took Tom away, where could
7608: he send him with better effect?
7609: 
7610: By the time Tom had reached his last quarter at King’s Lorton, the
7611: years had made striking changes in him since the day we saw him
7612: returning from Mr Jacobs’s academy. He was a tall youth now, carrying
7613: himself without the least awkwardness, and speaking without more
7614: shyness than was a becoming symptom of blended diffidence and pride; he
7615: wore his tail-coat and his stand-up collars, and watched the down on
7616: his lip with eager impatience, looking every day at his virgin razor,
7617: with which he had provided himself in the last holidays. Philip had
7618: already left,—at the autumn quarter,—that he might go to the south for
7619: the winter, for the sake of his health; and this change helped to give
7620: Tom the unsettled, exultant feeling that usually belongs to the last
7621: months before leaving school. This quarter, too, there was some hope of
7622: his father’s lawsuit being decided; _that_ made the prospect of home
7623: more entirely pleasurable. For Tom, who had gathered his view of the
7624: case from his father’s conversation, had no doubt that Pivart would be
7625: beaten.
7626: 
7627: Tom had not heard anything from home for some weeks,—a fact which did
7628: not surprise him, for his father and mother were not apt to manifest
7629: their affection in unnecessary letters,—when, to his great surprise, on
7630: the morning of a dark, cold day near the end of November, he was told,
7631: soon after entering the study at nine o’clock, that his sister was in
7632: the drawing-room. It was Mrs Stelling who had come into the study to
7633: tell him, and she left him to enter the drawing-room alone.
7634: 
7635: Maggie, too, was tall now, with braided and coiled hair; she was almost
7636: as tall as Tom, though she was only thirteen; and she really looked
7637: older than he did at that moment. She had thrown off her bonnet, her
7638: heavy braids were pushed back from her forehead, as if it would not
7639: bear that extra load, and her young face had a strangely worn look, as
7640: her eyes turned anxiously toward the door. When Tom entered she did not
7641: speak, but only went up to him, put her arms round his neck, and kissed
7642: him earnestly. He was used to various moods of hers, and felt no alarm
7643: at the unusual seriousness of her greeting.
7644: 
7645: “Why, how is it you’re come so early this cold morning, Maggie? Did you
7646: come in the gig?” said Tom, as she backed toward the sofa, and drew him
7647: to her side.
7648: 
7649: “No, I came by the coach. I’ve walked from the turnpike.”
7650: 
7651: “But how is it you’re not at school? The holidays have not begun yet?”
7652: 
7653: “Father wanted me at home,” said Maggie, with a slight trembling of the
7654: lip. “I came home three or four days ago.”
7655: 
7656: “Isn’t my father well?” said Tom, rather anxiously.
7657: 
7658: “Not quite,” said Maggie. “He’s very unhappy, Tom. The lawsuit is
7659: ended, and I came to tell you because I thought it would be better for
7660: you to know it before you came home, and I didn’t like only to send you
7661: a letter.”
7662: 
7663: “My father hasn’t lost?” said Tom, hastily, springing from the sofa,
7664: and standing before Maggie with his hands suddenly thrust into his
7665: pockets.
7666: 
7667: “Yes, dear Tom,” said Maggie, looking up at him with trembling.
7668: 
7669: Tom was silent a minute or two, with his eyes fixed on the floor. Then
7670: he said:
7671: 
7672: “My father will have to pay a good deal of money, then?”
7673: 
7674: “Yes,” said Maggie, rather faintly.
7675: 
7676: “Well, it can’t be helped,” said Tom, bravely, not translating the loss
7677: of a large sum of money into any tangible results. “But my father’s
7678: very much vexed, I dare say?” he added, looking at Maggie, and thinking
7679: that her agitated face was only part of her girlish way of taking
7680: things.
7681: 
7682: “Yes,” said Maggie, again faintly. Then, urged to fuller speech by
7683: Tom’s freedom from apprehension, she said loudly and rapidly, as if the
7684: words _would_ burst from her: “Oh, Tom, he will lose the mill and the
7685: land and everything; he will have nothing left.”
7686: 
7687: Tom’s eyes flashed out one look of surprise at her, before he turned
7688: pale, and trembled visibly. He said nothing, but sat down on the sofa
7689: again, looking vaguely out of the opposite window.
7690: 
7691: Anxiety about the future had never entered Tom’s mind. His father had
7692: always ridden a good horse, kept a good house, and had the cheerful,
7693: confident air of a man who has plenty of property to fall back upon.
7694: Tom had never dreamed that his father would “fail”; _that_ was a form
7695: of misfortune which he had always heard spoken of as a deep disgrace,
7696: and disgrace was an idea that he could not associate with any of his
7697: relations, least of all with his father. A proud sense of family
7698: respectability was part of the very air Tom had been born and brought
7699: up in. He knew there were people in St Ogg’s who made a show without
7700: money to support it, and he had always heard such people spoken of by
7701: his own friends with contempt and reprobation. He had a strong belief,
7702: which was a lifelong habit, and required no definite evidence to rest
7703: on, that his father could spend a great deal of money if he chose; and
7704: since his education at Mr Stelling’s had given him a more expensive
7705: view of life, he had often thought that when he got older he would make
7706: a figure in the world, with his horse and dogs and saddle, and other
7707: accoutrements of a fine young man, and show himself equal to any of his
7708: contemporaries at St Ogg’s, who might consider themselves a grade above
7709: him in society because their fathers were professional men, or had
7710: large oil-mills. As to the prognostics and headshaking of his aunts and
7711: uncles, they had never produced the least effect on him, except to make
7712: him think that aunts and uncles were disagreeable society; he had heard
7713: them find fault in much the same way as long as he could remember. His
7714: father knew better than they did.
7715: 
7716: The down had come on Tom’s lip, yet his thoughts and expectations had
7717: been hitherto only the reproduction, in changed forms, of the boyish
7718: dreams in which he had lived three years ago. He was awakened now with
7719: a violent shock.
7720: 
7721: Maggie was frightened at Tom’s pale, trembling silence. There was
7722: something else to tell him,—something worse. She threw her arms round
7723: him at last, and said, with a half sob:
7724: 
7725: “Oh, Tom—dear, dear Tom, don’t fret too much; try and bear it well.”
7726: 
7727: Tom turned his cheek passively to meet her entreating kisses, and there
7728: gathered a moisture in his eyes, which he just rubbed away with his
7729: hand. The action seemed to rouse him, for he shook himself and said: “I
7730: shall go home, with you, Maggie. Didn’t my father say I was to go?”
7731: 
7732: “No, Tom, father didn’t wish it,” said Maggie, her anxiety about _his_
7733: feeling helping her to master her agitation. What _would_ he do when
7734: she told him all? “But mother wants you to come,—poor mother!—she cries
7735: so. Oh, Tom, it’s very dreadful at home.”
7736: 
7737: Maggie’s lips grew whiter, and she began to tremble almost as Tom had
7738: done. The two poor things clung closer to each other, both
7739: trembling,—the one at an unshapen fear, the other at the image of a
7740: terrible certainty. When Maggie spoke, it was hardly above a whisper.
7741: 
7742: “And—and—poor father——”
7743: 
7744: Maggie could not utter it. But the suspense was intolerable to Tom. A
7745: vague idea of going to prison, as a consequence of debt, was the shape
7746: his fears had begun to take.
7747: 
7748: “Where’s my father?” he said impatiently. “_Tell_ me, Maggie.”
7749: 
7750: “He’s at home,” said Maggie, finding it easier to reply to that
7751: question. “But,” she added, after a pause, “not himself—he fell off his
7752: horse. He has known nobody but me ever since—he seems to have lost his
7753: senses. O father, father——”
7754: 
7755: With these last words, Maggie’s sobs burst forth with the more violence
7756: for the previous struggle against them. Tom felt that pressure of the
7757: heart which forbids tears; he had no distinct vision of their troubles
7758: as Maggie had, who had been at home; he only felt the crushing weight
7759: of what seemed unmitigated misfortune. He tightened his arm almost
7760: convulsively round Maggie as she sobbed, but his face looked rigid and
7761: tearless, his eyes blank,—as if a black curtain of cloud had suddenly
7762: fallen on his path.
7763: 
7764: But Maggie soon checked herself abruptly; a single thought had acted on
7765: her like a startling sound.
7766: 
7767: “We must set out, Tom, we must not stay. Father will miss me; we must
7768: be at the turnpike at ten to meet the coach.” She said this with hasty
7769: decision, rubbing her eyes, and rising to seize her bonnet.
7770: 
7771: Tom at once felt the same impulse, and rose too. “Wait a minute,
7772: Maggie,” he said. “I must speak to Mr Stelling, and then we’ll go.”
7773: 
7774: He thought he must go to the study where the pupils were; but on his
7775: way he met Mr Stelling, who had heard from his wife that Maggie
7776: appeared to be in trouble when she asked for her brother, and now that
7777: he thought the brother and sister had been alone long enough, was
7778: coming to inquire and offer his sympathy.
7779: 
7780: “Please, sir, I must go home,” Tom said abruptly, as he met Mr Stelling
7781: in the passage. “I must go back with my sister directly. My father’s
7782: lost his lawsuit—he’s lost all his property—and he’s very ill.”
7783: 
7784: Mr Stelling felt like a kind-hearted man; he foresaw a probable money
7785: loss for himself, but this had no appreciable share in his feeling,
7786: while he looked with grave pity at the brother and sister for whom
7787: youth and sorrow had begun together. When he knew how Maggie had come,
7788: and how eager she was to get home again, he hurried their departure,
7789: only whispering something to Mrs Stelling, who had followed him, and
7790: who immediately left the room.
7791: 
7792: Tom and Maggie were standing on the door-step, ready to set out, when
7793: Mrs Stelling came with a little basket, which she hung on Maggie’s arm,
7794: saying: “Do remember to eat something on the way, dear.” Maggie’s heart
7795: went out toward this woman whom she had never liked, and she kissed her
7796: silently. It was the first sign within the poor child of that new sense
7797: which is the gift of sorrow,—that susceptibility to the bare offices of
7798: humanity which raises them into a bond of loving fellowship, as to
7799: haggard men among the ice-bergs the mere presence of an ordinary
7800: comrade stirs the deep fountains of affection.
7801: 
7802: Mr Stelling put his hand on Tom’s shoulder and said: “God bless you, my
7803: boy; let me know how you get on.” Then he pressed Maggie’s hand; but
7804: there were no audible good-byes. Tom had so often thought how joyful he
7805: should be the day he left school “for good”! And now his school years
7806: seemed like a holiday that had come to an end.
7807: 
7808: The two slight youthful figures soon grew indistinct on the distant
7809: road,—were soon lost behind the projecting hedgerow.
7810: 
7811: They had gone forth together into their life of sorrow, and they would
7812: never more see the sunshine undimmed by remembered cares. They had
7813: entered the thorny wilderness, and the golden gates of their childhood
7814: had forever closed behind them.

7817: BOOK THIRD
7818: 
7819: THE DOWNFALL.
7820: 
7821: 
7822: Chapter I.
7823: 
7824: What Had Happened at Home
7825: 
7826: When Mr Tulliver first knew the fact that the lawsuit was decided
7827: against him, and that Pivart and Wakem were triumphant, every one who
7828: happened to observe him at the time thought that, for so confident and
7829: hot-tempered a man, he bore the blow remarkably well. He thought so
7830: himself; he thought he was going to show that if Wakem or anybody else
7831: considered him crushed, they would find themselves mistaken. He could
7832: not refuse to see that the costs of this protracted suit would take
7833: more than he possessed to pay them; but he appeared to himself to be
7834: full of expedients by which he could ward off any results but such as
7835: were tolerable, and could avoid the appearance of breaking down in the
7836: world. All the obstinacy and defiance of his nature, driven out of
7837: their old channel, found a vent for themselves in the immediate
7838: formation of plans by which he would meet his difficulties, and remain
7839: Mr Tulliver of Dorlcote Mill in spite of them. There was such a rush of
7840: projects in his brain, that it was no wonder his face was flushed when
7841: he came away from his talk with his attorney, Mr Gore, and mounted his
7842: horse to ride home from Lindum. There was Furley, who held the mortgage
7843: on the land,—a reasonable fellow, who would see his own interest, Mr
7844: Tulliver was convinced, and who would be glad not only to purchase the
7845: whole estate, including the mill and homestead, but would accept Mr
7846: Tulliver as tenant, and be willing to advance money to be repaid with
7847: high interest out of the profits of the business, which would be made
7848: over to him, Mr Tulliver only taking enough barely to maintain himself
7849: and his family. Who would neglect such a profitable investment?
7850: Certainly not Furley, for Mr Tulliver had determined that Furley should
7851: meet his plans with the utmost alacrity; and there are men whoses
7852: brains have not yet been dangerously heated by the loss of a lawsuit,
7853: who are apt to see in their own interest or desires a motive for other
7854: men’s actions. There was no doubt (in the miller’s mind) that Furley
7855: would do just what was desirable; and if he did—why, things would not
7856: be so very much worse. Mr Tulliver and his family must live more
7857: meagrely and humbly, but it would only be till the profits of the
7858: business had paid off Furley’s advances, and that might be while Mr
7859: Tulliver had still a good many years of life before him. It was clear
7860: that the costs of the suit could be paid without his being obliged to
7861: turn out of his old place, and look like a ruined man. It was certainly
7862: an awkward moment in his affairs. There was that suretyship for poor
7863: Riley, who had died suddenly last April, and left his friend saddled
7864: with a debt of two hundred and fifty pounds,—a fact which had helped to
7865: make Mr Tulliver’s banking book less pleasant reading than a man might
7866: desire toward Christmas. Well! he had never been one of those
7867: poor-spirited sneaks who would refuse to give a helping hand to a
7868: fellow-traveller in this puzzling world. The really vexatious business
7869: was the fact that some months ago the creditor who had lent him the
7870: five hundred pounds to repay Mrs Glegg had become uneasy about his
7871: money (set on by Wakem, of course), and Mr Tulliver, still confident
7872: that he should gain his suit, and finding it eminently inconvenient to
7873: raise the said sum until that desirable issue had taken place, had
7874: rashly acceded to the demand that he should give a bill of sale on his
7875: household furniture and some other effects, as security in lieu of the
7876: bond. It was all one, he had said to himself; he should soon pay off
7877: the money, and there was no harm in giving that security any more than
7878: another. But now the consequences of this bill of sale occurred to him
7879: in a new light, and he remembered that the time was close at hand when
7880: it would be enforced unless the money were repaid. Two months ago he
7881: would have declared stoutly that he would never be beholden to his
7882: wife’s friends; but now he told himself as stoutly that it was nothing
7883: but right and natural that Bessy should go to the Pullets and explain
7884: the thing to them; they would hardly let Bessy’s furniture be sold, and
7885: it might be security to Pullet if he advanced the money,—there would,
7886: after all, be no gift or favour in the matter. Mr Tulliver would never
7887: have asked for anything from so poor-spirited a fellow for himself, but
7888: Bessy might do so if she liked.
7889: 
7890: It is precisely the proudest and most obstinate men who are the most
7891: liable to shift their position and contradict themselves in this sudden
7892: manner; everything is easier to them than to face the simple fact that
7893: they have been thoroughly defeated, and must begin life anew. And Mr
7894: Tulliver, you perceive, though nothing more than a superior miller and
7895: maltster, was as proud and obstinate as if he had been a very lofty
7896: personage, in whom such dispositions might be a source of that
7897: conspicuous, far-echoing tragedy, which sweeps the stage in regal
7898: robes, and makes the dullest chronicler sublime. The pride and
7899: obstinacy of millers and other insignificant people, whom you pass
7900: unnoticingly on the road every day, have their tragedy too; but it is
7901: of that unwept, hidden sort that goes on from generation to generation,
7902: and leaves no record,—such tragedy, perhaps, as lies in the conflicts
7903: of young souls, hungry for joy, under a lot made suddenly hard to them,
7904: under the dreariness of a home where the morning brings no promise with
7905: it, and where the unexpectant discontent of worn and disappointed
7906: parents weighs on the children like a damp, thick air, in which all the
7907: functions of life are depressed; or such tragedy as lies in the slow or
7908: sudden death that follows on a bruised passion, though it may be a
7909: death that finds only a parish funeral. There are certain animals to
7910: which tenacity of position is a law of life,—they can never flourish
7911: again, after a single wrench: and there are certain human beings to
7912: whom predominance is a law of life,—they can only sustain humiliation
7913: so long as they can refuse to believe in it, and, in their own
7914: conception, predominate still.
7915: 
7916: Mr Tulliver was still predominating, in his own imagination, as he
7917: approached St Ogg’s, through which he had to pass on his way homeward.
7918: But what was it that suggested to him, as he saw the Laceham coach
7919: entering the town, to follow it to the coach-office, and get the clerk
7920: there to write a letter, requiring Maggie to come home the very next
7921: day? Mr Tulliver’s own hand shook too much under his excitement for him
7922: to write himself, and he wanted the letter to be given to the coachman
7923: to deliver at Miss Firniss’s school in the morning. There was a craving
7924: which he would not account for to himself, to have Maggie near him,
7925: without delay,—she must come back by the coach to-morrow.
7926: 
7927: To Mrs Tulliver, when he got home, he would admit no difficulties, and
7928: scolded down her burst of grief on hearing that the lawsuit was lost,
7929: by angry assertions that there was nothing to grieve about. He said
7930: nothing to her that night about the bill of sale and the application to
7931: Mrs Pullet, for he had kept her in ignorance of the nature of that
7932: transaction, and had explained the necessity for taking an inventory of
7933: the goods as a matter connected with his will. The possession of a wife
7934: conspicuously one’s inferior in intellect is, like other high
7935: privileges, attended with a few inconveniences, and, among the rest,
7936: with the occasional necessity for using a little deception.
7937: 
7938: The next day Mr Tulliver was again on horseback in the afternoon, on
7939: his way to Mr Gore’s office at St Ogg’s. Gore was to have seen Furley
7940: in the morning, and to have sounded him in relation to Mr Tulliver’s
7941: affairs. But he had not gone half-way when he met a clerk from Mr
7942: Gore’s office, who was bringing a letter to Mr Tulliver. Mr Gore had
7943: been prevented by a sudden call of business from waiting at his office
7944: to see Mr Tulliver, according to appointment, but would be at his
7945: office at eleven to-morrow morning, and meanwhile had sent some
7946: important information by letter.
7947: 
7948: “Oh!” said Mr Tulliver, taking the letter, but not opening it. “Then
7949: tell Gore I’ll see him to-morrow at eleven”; and he turned his horse.
7950: 
7951: The clerk, struck with Mr Tulliver’s glistening, excited glance, looked
7952: after him for a few moments, and then rode away. The reading of a
7953: letter was not the affair of an instant to Mr Tulliver; he took in the
7954: sense of a statement very slowly through the medium of written or even
7955: printed characters; so he had put the letter in his pocket, thinking he
7956: would open it in his armchair at home. But by-and-by it occurred to him
7957: that there might be something in the letter Mrs Tulliver must not know
7958: about, and if so, it would be better to keep it out of her sight
7959: altogether. He stopped his horse, took out the letter, and read it. It
7960: was only a short letter; the substance was, that Mr Gore had
7961: ascertained, on secret, but sure authority, that Furley had been lately
7962: much straitened for money, and had parted with his securities,—among
7963: the rest, the mortgage on Mr Tulliver’s property, which he had
7964: transferred to——Wakem.
7965: 
7966: In half an hour after this Mr Tulliver’s own wagoner found him lying by
7967: the roadside insensible, with an open letter near him, and his gray
7968: horse snuffing uneasily about him.
7969: 
7970: When Maggie reached home that evening, in obedience to her father’s
7971: call, he was no longer insensible. About an hour before he had become
7972: conscious, and after vague, vacant looks around him, had muttered
7973: something about “a letter,” which he presently repeated impatiently. At
7974: the instance of Mr Turnbull, the medical man, Gore’s letter was brought
7975: and laid on the bed, and the previous impatience seemed to be allayed.
7976: The stricken man lay for some time with his eyes fixed on the letter,
7977: as if he were trying to knit up his thoughts by its help. But presently
7978: a new wave of memory seemed to have come and swept the other away; he
7979: turned his eyes from the letter to the door, and after looking
7980: uneasily, as if striving to see something his eyes were too dim for, he
7981: said, “The little wench.”
7982: 
7983: He repeated the words impatiently from time to time, appearing entirely
7984: unconscious of everything except this one importunate want, and giving
7985: no sign of knowing his wife or any one else; and poor Mrs Tulliver, her
7986: feeble faculties almost paralyzed by this sudden accumulation of
7987: troubles, went backward and forward to the gate to see if the Laceham
7988: coach were coming, though it was not yet time.
7989: 
7990: But it came at last, and set down the poor anxious girl, no longer the
7991: “little wench,” except to her father’s fond memory.
7992: 
7993: “Oh, mother, what is the matter?” Maggie said, with pale lips, as her
7994: mother came toward her crying. She didn’t think her father was ill,
7995: because the letter had come at his dictation from the office at St
7996: Ogg’s.
7997: 
7998: But Mr Turnbull came now to meet her; a medical man is the good angel
7999: of the troubled house, and Maggie ran toward the kind old friend, whom
8000: she remembered as long as she could remember anything, with a
8001: trembling, questioning look.
8002: 
8003: “Don’t alarm yourself too much, my dear,” he said, taking her hand.
8004: “Your father has had a sudden attack, and has not quite recovered his
8005: memory. But he has been asking for you, and it will do him good to see
8006: you. Keep as quiet as you can; take off your things, and come upstairs
8007: with me.”
8008: 
8009: Maggie obeyed, with that terrible beating of the heart which makes
8010: existence seem simply a painful pulsation. The very quietness with
8011: which Mr Turnbull spoke had frightened her susceptible imagination. Her
8012: father’s eyes were still turned uneasily toward the door when she
8013: entered and met the strange, yearning, helpless look that had been
8014: seeking her in vain. With a sudden flash and movement, he raised
8015: himself in the bed; she rushed toward him, and clasped him with
8016: agonised kisses.
8017: 
8018: Poor child! it was very early for her to know one of those supreme
8019: moments in life when all we have hoped or delighted in, all we can
8020: dread or endure, falls away from our regard as insignificant; is lost,
8021: like a trivial memory, in that simple, primitive love which knits us to
8022: the beings who have been nearest to us, in their times of helplessness
8023: or of anguish.
8024: 
8025: But that flash of recognition had been too great a strain on the
8026: father’s bruised, enfeebled powers. He sank back again in renewed
8027: insensibility and rigidity, which lasted for many hours, and was only
8028: broken by a flickering return of consciousness, in which he took
8029: passively everything that was given to him, and seemed to have a sort
8030: of infantine satisfaction in Maggie’s near presence,—such satisfaction
8031: as a baby has when it is returned to the nurse’s lap.
8032: 
8033: Mrs Tulliver sent for her sisters, and there was much wailing and
8034: lifting up of hands below stairs. Both uncles and aunts saw that the
8035: ruin of Bessy and her family was as complete as they had ever foreboded
8036: it, and there was a general family sense that a judgment had fallen on
8037: Mr Tulliver, which it would be an impiety to counteract by too much
8038: kindness. But Maggie heard little of this, scarcely ever leaving her
8039: father’s bedside, where she sat opposite him with her hand on his. Mrs
8040: Tulliver wanted to have Tom fetched home, and seemed to be thinking
8041: more of her boy even than of her husband; but the aunts and uncles
8042: opposed this. Tom was better at school, since Mr Turnbull said there
8043: was no immediate danger, he believed. But at the end of the second day,
8044: when Maggie had become more accustomed to her father’s fits of
8045: insensibility, and to the expectation that he would revive from them,
8046: the thought of Tom had become urgent with _her_ too; and when her
8047: mother sate crying at night and saying, “My poor lad—it’s nothing but
8048: right he should come home,” Maggie said, “Let me go for him, and tell
8049: him, mother; I’ll go to-morrow morning if father doesn’t know me and
8050: want me. It would be so hard for Tom to come home and not know anything
8051: about it beforehand.”
8052: 
8053: And the next morning Maggie went, as we have seen. Sitting on the coach
8054: on their way home, the brother and sister talked to each other in sad,
8055: interrupted whispers.
8056: 
8057: “They say Mr Wakem has got a mortgage or something on the land, Tom,”
8058: said Maggie. “It was the letter with that news in it that made father
8059: ill, they think.”
8060: 
8061: “I believe that scoundrel’s been planning all along to ruin my father,”
8062: said Tom, leaping from the vaguest impressions to a definite
8063: conclusion. “I’ll make him feel for it when I’m a man. Mind you never
8064: speak to Philip again.”
8065: 
8066: “Oh, Tom!” said Maggie, in a tone of sad remonstrance; but she had no
8067: spirit to dispute anything then, still less to vex Tom by opposing him.
8068: 
8069: 
8070: Chapter II.
8071: 
8072: Mrs Tulliver’s Teraphim, or Household Gods
8073: 
8074: When the coach set down Tom and Maggie, it was five hours since she had
8075: started from home, and she was thinking with some trembling that her
8076: father had perhaps missed her, and asked for “the little wench” in
8077: vain. She thought of no other change that might have happened.
8078: 
8079: She hurried along the gravel-walk and entered the house before Tom; but
8080: in the entrance she was startled by a strong smell of tobacco. The
8081: parlour door was ajar; that was where the smell came from. It was very
8082: strange; could any visitor be smoking at a time like this? Was her
8083: mother there? If so, she must be told that Tom was come. Maggie, after
8084: this pause of surprise, was only in the act of opening the door when
8085: Tom came up, and they both looked into the parlour together.
8086: 
8087: There was a coarse, dingy man, of whose face Tom had some vague
8088: recollection, sitting in his father’s chair, smoking, with a jug and
8089: glass beside him.
8090: 
8091: The truth flashed on Tom’s mind in an instant. To “have the bailiff in
8092: the house,” and “to be sold up,” were phrases which he had been used
8093: to, even as a little boy; they were part of the disgrace and misery of
8094: “failing,” of losing all one’s money, and being ruined,—sinking into
8095: the condition of poor working people. It seemed only natural this
8096: should happen, since his father had lost all his property, and he
8097: thought of no more special cause for this particular form of misfortune
8098: than the loss of the lawsuit. But the immediate presence of this
8099: disgrace was so much keener an experience to Tom than the worst form of
8100: apprehension, that he felt at this moment as if his real trouble had
8101: only just begun: it was a touch on the irritated nerve compared with
8102: its spontaneous dull aching.
8103: 
8104: “How do you do, sir?” said the man, taking the pipe out of his mouth,
8105: with rough, embarrassed civility. The two young startled faces made him
8106: a little uncomfortable.
8107: 
8108: But Tom turned away hastily without speaking; the sight was too
8109: hateful. Maggie had not understood the appearance of this stranger, as
8110: Tom had. She followed him, whispering: “Who can it be, Tom? What is the
8111: matter?” Then, with a sudden undefined dread lest this stranger might
8112: have something to do with a change in her father, she rushed upstairs,
8113: checking herself at the bedroom door to throw off her bonnet, and enter
8114: on tiptoe. All was silent there; her father was lying, heedless of
8115: everything around him, with his eyes closed as when she had left him. A
8116: servant was there, but not her mother.
8117: 
8118: “Where’s my mother?” she whispered. The servant did not know.
8119: 
8120: Maggie hastened out, and said to Tom; “Father is lying quiet; let us go
8121: and look for my mother. I wonder where she is.”
8122: 
8123: Mrs Tulliver was not downstairs, not in any of the bedrooms. There was
8124: but one room below the attic which Maggie had left unsearched; it was
8125: the storeroom, where her mother kept all her linen and all the precious
8126: “best things” that were only unwrapped and brought out on special
8127: occasions.
8128: 
8129: Tom, preceding Maggie, as they returned along the passage, opened the
8130: door of this room, and immediately said, “Mother!”
8131: 
8132: Mrs Tulliver was seated there with all her laid-up treasures. One of
8133: the linen chests was open; the silver teapot was unwrapped from its
8134: many folds of paper, and the best china was laid out on the top of the
8135: closed linen-chest; spoons and skewers and ladles were spread in rows
8136: on the shelves; and the poor woman was shaking her head and weeping,
8137: with a bitter tension of the mouth, over the mark, “Elizabeth Dodson,”
8138: on the corner of some tablecloths she held in her lap.
8139: 
8140: She dropped them, and started up as Tom spoke.
8141: 
8142: “Oh, my boy, my boy!” she said, clasping him round the neck. “To think
8143: as I should live to see this day! We’re ruined—everything’s going to be
8144: sold up—to think as your father should ha’ married me to bring me to
8145: this! We’ve got nothing—we shall be beggars—we must go to the
8146: workhouse——”
8147: 
8148: She kissed him, then seated herself again, and took another tablecloth
8149: on her lap, unfolding it a little way to look at the pattern, while the
8150: children stood by in mute wretchedness, their minds quite filled for
8151: the moment with the words “beggars” and “workhouse.”
8152: 
8153: “To think o’ these cloths as I spun myself,” she went on, lifting
8154: things out and turning them over with an excitement all the more
8155: strange and piteous because the stout blond woman was usually so
8156: passive,—if she had been ruffled before, it was at the surface
8157: merely,—“and Job Haxey wove ’em, and brought the piece home on his
8158: back, as I remember standing at the door and seeing him come, before I
8159: ever thought o’ marrying your father! And the pattern as I chose
8160: myself, and bleached so beautiful, and I marked ’em so as nobody ever
8161: saw such marking,—they must cut the cloth to get it out, for it’s a
8162: particular stitch. And they’re all to be sold, and go into strange
8163: people’s houses, and perhaps be cut with the knives, and wore out
8164: before I’m dead. You’ll never have one of ’em, my boy,” she said,
8165: looking up at Tom with her eyes full of tears, “and I meant ’em for
8166: you. I wanted you to have all o’ this pattern. Maggie could have had
8167: the large check—it never shows so well when the dishes are on it.”
8168: 
8169: Tom was touched to the quick, but there was an angry reaction
8170: immediately. His face flushed as he said:
8171: 
8172: “But will my aunts let them be sold, mother? Do they know about it?
8173: They’ll never let your linen go, will they? Haven’t you sent to them?”
8174: 
8175: “Yes, I sent Luke directly they’d put the bailies in, and your aunt
8176: Pullet’s been—and, oh dear, oh dear, she cries so and says your
8177: father’s disgraced my family and made it the talk o’ the country; and
8178: she’ll buy the spotted cloths for herself, because she’s never had so
8179: many as she wanted o’ that pattern, and they sha’n’t go to strangers,
8180: but she’s got more checks a’ready nor she can do with.” (Here Mrs
8181: Tulliver began to lay back the tablecloths in the chest, folding and
8182: stroking them automatically.) “And your uncle Glegg’s been too, and he
8183: says things must be bought in for us to lie down on, but he must talk
8184: to your aunt; and they’re all coming to consult. But I know they’ll
8185: none of ’em take my chany,” she added, turning toward the cups and
8186: saucers, “for they all found fault with ’em when I bought ’em, ’cause
8187: o’ the small gold sprig all over ’em, between the flowers. But there’s
8188: none of ’em got better chany, not even your aunt Pullet herself; and I
8189: bought it wi’ my own money as I’d saved ever since I was turned
8190: fifteen; and the silver teapot, too,—your father never paid for ’em.
8191: And to think as he should ha’ married me, and brought me to this.”
8192: 
8193: Mrs Tulliver burst out crying afresh, and she sobbed with her
8194: handkerchief at her eyes a few moments, but then removing it, she said
8195: in a deprecating way, still half sobbing, as if she were called upon to
8196: speak before she could command her voice,—
8197: 
8198: “And I _did_ say to him times and times, ‘Whativer you do, don’t go to
8199: law,’ and what more could I do? I’ve had to sit by while my own
8200: fortin’s been spent, and what should ha’ been my children’s, too.
8201: You’ll have niver a penny, my boy—but it isn’t your poor mother’s
8202: fault.”
8203: 
8204: She put out one arm toward Tom, looking up at him piteously with her
8205: helpless, childish blue eyes. The poor lad went to her and kissed her,
8206: and she clung to him. For the first time Tom thought of his father with
8207: some reproach. His natural inclination to blame, hitherto kept entirely
8208: in abeyance toward his father by the predisposition to think him always
8209: right, simply on the ground that he was Tom Tulliver’s father, was
8210: turned into this new channel by his mother’s plaints; and with his
8211: indignation against Wakem there began to mingle some indignation of
8212: another sort. Perhaps his father might have helped bringing them all
8213: down in the world, and making people talk of them with contempt, but no
8214: one should talk long of Tom Tulliver with contempt.
8215: 
8216: The natural strength and firmness of his nature was beginning to assert
8217: itself, urged by the double stimulus of resentment against his aunts,
8218: and the sense that he must behave like a man and take care of his
8219: mother.
8220: 
8221: “Don’t fret, mother,” he said tenderly. “I shall soon be able to get
8222: money; I’ll get a situation of some sort.”
8223: 
8224: “Bless you, my boy!” said Mrs Tulliver, a little soothed. Then, looking
8225: round sadly, “But I shouldn’t ha’ minded so much if we could ha’ kept
8226: the things wi’ my name on ’em.”
8227: 
8228: Maggie had witnessed this scene with gathering anger. The implied
8229: reproaches against her father—her father, who was lying there in a sort
8230: of living death—neutralised all her pity for griefs about tablecloths
8231: and china; and her anger on her father’s account was heightened by some
8232: egoistic resentment at Tom’s silent concurrence with her mother in
8233: shutting her out from the common calamity. She had become almost
8234: indifferent to her mother’s habitual depreciation of her, but she was
8235: keenly alive to any sanction of it, however passive, that she might
8236: suspect in Tom. Poor Maggie was by no means made up of unalloyed
8237: devotedness, but put forth large claims for herself where she loved
8238: strongly. She burst out at last in an agitated, almost violent tone:
8239: “Mother, how can you talk so; as if you cared only for things with
8240: _your_ name on, and not for what has my father’s name too; and to care
8241: about anything but dear father himself!—when he’s lying there, and may
8242: never speak to us again. Tom, you ought to say so too; you ought not to
8243: let any one find fault with my father.”
8244: 
8245: Maggie, almost choked with mingled grief and anger, left the room, and
8246: took her old place on her father’s bed. Her heart went out to him with
8247: a stronger movement than ever, at the thought that people would blame
8248: him. Maggie hated blame; she had been blamed all her life, and nothing
8249: had come of it but evil tempers.
8250: 
8251: Her father had always defended and excused her, and her loving
8252: remembrance of his tenderness was a force within her that would enable
8253: her to do or bear anything for his sake.
8254: 
8255: Tom was a little shocked at Maggie’s outburst,—telling _him_ as well as
8256: his mother what it was right to do! She ought to have learned better
8257: than have those hectoring, assuming manners, by this time. But he
8258: presently went into his father’s room, and the sight there touched him
8259: in a way that effaced the slighter impressions of the previous hour.
8260: When Maggie saw how he was moved, she went to him and put her arm round
8261: his neck as he sat by the bed, and the two children forgot everything
8262: else in the sense that they had one father and one sorrow.
8263: 
8264: 
8265: Chapter III.
8266: 
8267: The Family Council
8268: 
8269: It was at eleven o’clock the next morning that the aunts and uncles
8270: came to hold their consultation. The fire was lighted in the large
8271: parlour, and poor Mrs Tulliver, with a confused impression that it was
8272: a great occasion, like a funeral, unbagged the bell-rope tassels, and
8273: unpinned the curtains, adjusting them in proper folds, looking round
8274: and shaking her head sadly at the polished tops and legs of the tables,
8275: which sister Pullet herself could not accuse of insufficient
8276: brightness.
8277: 
8278: Mr Deane was not coming, he was away on business; but Mrs Deane
8279: appeared punctually in that handsome new gig with the head to it, and
8280: the livery-servant driving it, which had thrown so clear a light on
8281: several traits in her character to some of her female friends in St
8282: Ogg’s. Mr Deane had been advancing in the world as rapidly as Mr
8283: Tulliver had been going down in it; and in Mrs Deane’s house the Dodson
8284: linen and plate were beginning to hold quite a subordinate position, as
8285: a mere supplement to the handsomer articles of the same kind, purchased
8286: in recent years,—a change which had caused an occasional coolness in
8287: the sisterly intercourse between her and Mrs Glegg, who felt that Susan
8288: was getting “like the rest,” and there would soon be little of the true
8289: Dodson spirit surviving except in herself, and, it might be hoped, in
8290: those nephews who supported the Dodson name on the family land, far
8291: away in the Wolds.
8292: 
8293: People who live at a distance are naturally less faulty than those
8294: immediately under our own eyes; and it seems superfluous, when we
8295: consider the remote geographical position of the Ethiopians, and how
8296: very little the Greeks had to do with them, to inquire further why
8297: Homer calls them “blameless.”
8298: 
8299: Mrs Deane was the first to arrive; and when she had taken her seat in
8300: the large parlour, Mrs Tulliver came down to her with her comely face a
8301: little distorted, nearly as it would have been if she had been crying.
8302: She was not a woman who could shed abundant tears, except in moments
8303: when the prospect of losing her furniture became unusually vivid, but
8304: she felt how unfitting it was to be quite calm under present
8305: circumstances.
8306: 
8307: “Oh, sister, what a world this is!” she exclaimed as she entered; “what
8308: trouble, oh dear!”
8309: 
8310: Mrs Deane was a thin-lipped woman, who made small well-considered
8311: speeches on peculiar occasions, repeating them afterward to her
8312: husband, and asking him if she had not spoken very properly.
8313: 
8314: “Yes, sister,” she said deliberately, “this is a changing world, and we
8315: don’t know to-day what may happen tomorrow. But it’s right to be
8316: prepared for all things, and if trouble’s sent, to remember as it isn’t
8317: sent without a cause. I’m very sorry for you as a sister, and if the
8318: doctor orders jelly for Mr Tulliver, I hope you’ll let me know. I’ll
8319: send it willingly; for it is but right he should have proper attendance
8320: while he’s ill.”
8321: 
8322: “Thank you, Susan,” said Mrs Tulliver, rather faintly, withdrawing her
8323: fat hand from her sister’s thin one. “But there’s been no talk o’ jelly
8324: yet.” Then after a moment’s pause she added, “There’s a dozen o’ cut
8325: jelly-glasses upstairs—I shall never put jelly into ’em no more.”
8326: 
8327: Her voice was rather agitated as she uttered the last words, but the
8328: sound of wheels diverted her thoughts. Mr and Mrs Glegg were come, and
8329: were almost immediately followed by Mr and Mrs Pullet.
8330: 
8331: Mrs Pullet entered crying, as a compendious mode, at all times, of
8332: expressing what were her views of life in general, and what, in brief,
8333: were the opinions she held concerning the particular case before her.
8334: 
8335: Mrs Glegg had on her fuzziest front, and garments which appeared to
8336: have had a recent resurrection from rather a creasy form of burial; a
8337: costume selected with the high moral purpose of instilling perfect
8338: humility into Bessy and her children.
8339: 
8340: “Mrs G., won’t you come nearer the fire?” said her husband, unwilling
8341: to take the more comfortable seat without offering it to her.
8342: 
8343: “You see I’ve seated myself here, Mr Glegg,” returned this superior
8344: woman; “_you_ can roast yourself, if you like.”
8345: 
8346: “Well,” said Mr Glegg, seating himself good-humouredly, “and how’s the
8347: poor man upstairs?”
8348: 
8349: “Dr Turnbull thought him a deal better this morning,” said Mrs
8350: Tulliver; “he took more notice, and spoke to me; but he’s never known
8351: Tom yet,—looks at the poor lad as if he was a stranger, though he said
8352: something once about Tom and the pony. The doctor says his memory’s
8353: gone a long way back, and he doesn’t know Tom because he’s thinking of
8354: him when he was little. Eh dear, eh dear!”
8355: 
8356: “I doubt it’s the water got on his brain,” said aunt Pullet, turning
8357: round from adjusting her cap in a melancholy way at the pier-glass.
8358: “It’s much if he ever gets up again; and if he does, he’ll most like be
8359: childish, as Mr Carr was, poor man! They fed him with a spoon as if
8360: he’d been a babby for three year. He’d quite lost the use of his limbs;
8361: but then he’d got a Bath chair, and somebody to draw him; and that’s
8362: what you won’t have, I doubt, Bessy.”
8363: 
8364: “Sister Pullet,” said Mrs Glegg, severely, “if I understand right,
8365: we’ve come together this morning to advise and consult about what’s to
8366: be done in this disgrace as has fallen upon the family, and not to talk
8367: o’ people as don’t belong to us. Mr Carr was none of our blood, nor
8368: noways connected with us, as I’ve ever heared.”
8369: 
8370: “Sister Glegg,” said Mrs Pullet, in a pleading tone, drawing on her
8371: gloves again, and stroking the fingers in an agitated manner, “if
8372: you’ve got anything disrespectful to say o’ Mr Carr, I do beg of you as
8373: you won’t say it to me. _I_ know what he was,” she added, with a sigh;
8374: “his breath was short to that degree as you could hear him two rooms
8375: off.”
8376: 
8377: “Sophy!” said Mrs Glegg, with indignant disgust, “you _do_ talk o’
8378: people’s complaints till it’s quite undecent. But I say again, as I
8379: said before, I didn’t come away from home to talk about acquaintances,
8380: whether they’d short breath or long. If we aren’t come together for one
8381: to hear what the other ’ull do to save a sister and her children from
8382: the parish, _I_ shall go back. _One_ can’t act without the other, I
8383: suppose; it isn’t to be expected as _I_ should do everything.”
8384: 
8385: “Well, Jane,” said Mrs Pullet, “I don’t see as you’ve been so very
8386: forrard at doing. So far as I know, this is the first time as here
8387: you’ve been, since it’s been known as the bailiff’s in the house; and I
8388: was here yesterday, and looked at all Bessy’s linen and things, and I
8389: told her I’d buy in the spotted tablecloths. I couldn’t speak fairer;
8390: for as for the teapot as she doesn’t want to go out o’ the family, it
8391: stands to sense I can’t do with two silver teapots, not if it _hadn’t_
8392: a straight spout, but the spotted damask I was allays fond on.”
8393: 
8394: “I wish it could be managed so as my teapot and chany and the best
8395: castors needn’t be put up for sale,” said poor Mrs Tulliver,
8396: beseechingly, “and the sugar-tongs the first things ever I bought.”
8397: 
8398: “But that can’t be helped, you know,” said Mr Glegg. “If one o’ the
8399: family chooses to buy ’em in, they can, but one thing must be bid for
8400: as well as another.”
8401: 
8402: “And it isn’t to be looked for,” said uncle Pullet, with unwonted
8403: independence of idea, “as your own family should pay more for things
8404: nor they’ll fetch. They may go for an old song by auction.”
8405: 
8406: “Oh dear, oh dear,” said Mrs Tulliver, “to think o’ my chany being sold
8407: i’ that way, and I bought it when I was married, just as you did yours,
8408: Jane and Sophy; and I know you didn’t like mine, because o’ the sprig,
8409: but I was fond of it; and there’s never been a bit broke, for I’ve
8410: washed it myself; and there’s the tulips on the cups, and the roses, as
8411: anybody might go and look at ’em for pleasure. You wouldn’t like _your_
8412: chany to go for an old song and be broke to pieces, though yours has
8413: got no colour in it, Jane,—it’s all white and fluted, and didn’t cost
8414: so much as mine. And there’s the castors, sister Deane, I can’t think
8415: but you’d like to have the castors, for I’ve heard you say they’re
8416: pretty.”
8417: 
8418: “Well, I’ve no objection to buy some of the best things,” said Mrs
8419: Deane, rather loftily; “we can do with extra things in our house.”
8420: 
8421: “Best things!” exclaimed Mrs Glegg, with severity, which had gathered
8422: intensity from her long silence. “It drives me past patience to hear
8423: you all talking o’ best things, and buying in this, that, and the
8424: other, such as silver and chany. You must bring your mind to your
8425: circumstances, Bessy, and not be thinking o’ silver and chany; but
8426: whether you shall get so much as a flock-bed to lie on, and a blanket
8427: to cover you, and a stool to sit on. You must remember, if you get ’em,
8428: it’ll be because your friends have bought ’em for you, for you’re
8429: dependent upon _them_ for everything; for your husband lies there
8430: helpless, and hasn’t got a penny i’ the world to call his own. And it’s
8431: for your own good I say this, for it’s right you should feel what your
8432: state is, and what disgrace your husband’s brought on your own family,
8433: as you’ve got to look to for everything, and be humble in your mind.”
8434: 
8435: Mrs Glegg paused, for speaking with much energy for the good of others
8436: is naturally exhausting.
8437: 
8438: Mrs Tulliver, always borne down by the family predominance of sister
8439: Jane, who had made her wear the yoke of a younger sister in very tender
8440: years, said pleadingly:
8441: 
8442: “I’m sure, sister, I’ve never asked anybody to do anything, only buy
8443: things as it ’ud be a pleasure to ’em to have, so as they mightn’t go
8444: and be spoiled i’ strange houses. I never asked anybody to buy the
8445: things in for me and my children; though there’s the linen I spun, and
8446: I thought when Tom was born,—I thought one o’ the first things when he
8447: was lying i’ the cradle, as all the things I’d bought wi’ my own money,
8448: and been so careful of, ’ud go to him. But I’ve said nothing as I
8449: wanted my sisters to pay their money for me. What my husband has done
8450: for _his_ sister’s unknown, and we should ha’ been better off this day
8451: if it hadn’t been as he’s lent money and never asked for it again.”
8452: 
8453: “Come, come,” said Mr Glegg, kindly, “don’t let us make things too
8454: dark. What’s done can’t be undone. We shall make a shift among us to
8455: buy what’s sufficient for you; though, as Mrs G. says, they must be
8456: useful, plain things. We mustn’t be thinking o’ what’s unnecessary. A
8457: table, and a chair or two, and kitchen things, and a good bed, and
8458: such-like. Why, I’ve seen the day when I shouldn’t ha’ known myself if
8459: I’d lain on sacking i’stead o’ the floor. We get a deal o’ useless
8460: things about us, only because we’ve got the money to spend.”
8461: 
8462: “Mr Glegg,” said Mrs G., “if you’ll be kind enough to let me speak,
8463: i’stead o’ taking the words out o’ my mouth,—I was going to say, Bessy,
8464: as it’s fine talking for you to say as you’ve never asked us to buy
8465: anything for you; let me tell you, you _ought_ to have asked us. Pray,
8466: how are you to be purvided for, if your own family don’t help you? You
8467: must go to the parish, if they didn’t. And you ought to know that, and
8468: keep it in mind, and ask us humble to do what we can for you, i’stead
8469: o’ saying, and making a boast, as you’ve never asked us for anything.”
8470: 
8471: “You talked o’ the Mosses, and what Mr Tulliver’s done for ’em,” said
8472: uncle Pullet, who became unusually suggestive where advances of money
8473: were concerned. “Haven’t _they_ been anear you? They ought to do
8474: something as well as other folks; and if he’s lent ’em money, they
8475: ought to be made to pay it back.”
8476: 
8477: “Yes, to be sure,” said Mrs Deane; “I’ve been thinking so. How is it Mr
8478: and Mrs Moss aren’t here to meet us? It is but right they should do
8479: their share.”
8480: 
8481: “Oh, dear!” said Mrs Tulliver, “I never sent ’em word about Mr
8482: Tulliver, and they live so back’ard among the lanes at Basset, they
8483: niver hear anything only when Mr Moss comes to market. But I niver gave
8484: ’em a thought. I wonder Maggie didn’t, though, for she was allays so
8485: fond of her aunt Moss.”
8486: 
8487: “Why don’t your children come in, Bessy?” said Mrs Pullet, at the
8488: mention of Maggie. “They should hear what their aunts and uncles have
8489: got to say; and Maggie,—when it’s me as have paid for half her
8490: schooling, she ought to think more of her aunt Pullet than of aunt
8491: Moss. I may go off sudden when I get home to-day; there’s no telling.”
8492: 
8493: “If I’d had _my_ way,” said Mrs Glegg, “the children ’ud ha’ been in
8494: the room from the first. It’s time they knew who they’ve to look to,
8495: and it’s right as _somebody_ should talk to ’em, and let ’em know their
8496: condition i’ life, and what they’re come down to, and make ’em feel as
8497: they’ve got to suffer for their father’s faults.”
8498: 
8499: “Well, I’ll go and fetch ’em, sister,” said Mrs Tulliver, resignedly.
8500: She was quite crushed now, and thought of the treasures in the
8501: storeroom with no other feeling than blank despair.
8502: 
8503: She went upstairs to fetch Tom and Maggie, who were both in their
8504: father’s room, and was on her way down again, when the sight of the
8505: storeroom door suggested a new thought to her. She went toward it, and
8506: left the children to go down by themselves.
8507: 
8508: The aunts and uncles appeared to have been in warm discussion when the
8509: brother and sister entered,—both with shrinking reluctance; for though
8510: Tom, with a practical sagacity which had been roused into activity by
8511: the strong stimulus of the new emotions he had undergone since
8512: yesterday, had been turning over in his mind a plan which he meant to
8513: propose to one of his aunts or uncles, he felt by no means amicably
8514: toward them, and dreaded meeting them all at once as he would have
8515: dreaded a large dose of concentrated physic, which was but just
8516: endurable in small draughts. As for Maggie, she was peculiarly
8517: depressed this morning; she had been called up, after brief rest, at
8518: three o’clock, and had that strange dreamy weariness which comes from
8519: watching in a sick-room through the chill hours of early twilight and
8520: breaking day,—in which the outside day-light life seems to have no
8521: importance, and to be a mere margin to the hours in the darkened
8522: chamber. Their entrance interrupted the conversation. The shaking of
8523: hands was a melancholy and silent ceremony, till uncle Pullet observed,
8524: as Tom approached him:
8525: 
8526: “Well, young sir, we’ve been talking as we should want your pen and
8527: ink; you can write rarely now, after all your schooling, I should
8528: think.”
8529: 
8530: “Ay, ay,” said uncle Glegg, with admonition which he meant to be kind,
8531: “we must look to see the good of all this schooling, as your father’s
8532: sunk so much money in, now,—
8533: 
8534:      ‘When land is gone and money’s spent,
8535:      Then learning is most excellent.’
8536: 
8537: 
8538: Now’s the time, Tom, to let us see the good o’ your learning. Let us
8539: see whether you can do better than I can, as have made my fortin
8540: without it. But I began wi’ doing with little, you see; I could live on
8541: a basin o’ porridge and a crust o’ bread-and-cheese. But I doubt high
8542: living and high learning ’ull make it harder for you, young man, nor it
8543: was for me.”
8544: 
8545: “But he must do it,” interposed aunt Glegg, energetically, “whether
8546: it’s hard or no. He hasn’t got to consider what’s hard; he must
8547: consider as he isn’t to trusten to his friends to keep him in idleness
8548: and luxury; he’s got to bear the fruits of his father’s misconduct, and
8549: bring his mind to fare hard and to work hard. And he must be humble and
8550: grateful to his aunts and uncles for what they’re doing for his mother
8551: and father, as must be turned out into the streets and go to the
8552: workhouse if they didn’t help ’em. And his sister, too,” continued Mrs
8553: Glegg, looking severely at Maggie, who had sat down on the sofa by her
8554: aunt Deane, drawn to her by the sense that she was Lucy’s mother, “she
8555: must make up her mind to be humble and work; for there’ll be no
8556: servants to wait on her any more,—she must remember that. She must do
8557: the work o’ the house, and she must respect and love her aunts as have
8558: done so much for her, and saved their money to leave to their nepheys
8559: and nieces.”
8560: 
8561: Tom was still standing before the table in the centre of the group.
8562: There was a heightened colour in his face, and he was very far from
8563: looking humbled, but he was preparing to say, in a respectful tone,
8564: something he had previously meditated, when the door opened and his
8565: mother re-entered.
8566: 
8567: Poor Mrs Tulliver had in her hands a small tray, on which she had
8568: placed her silver teapot, a specimen teacup and saucer, the castors,
8569: and sugar-tongs.
8570: 
8571: “See here, sister,” she said, looking at Mrs Deane, as she set the tray
8572: on the table, “I thought, perhaps, if you looked at the teapot
8573: again,—it’s a good while since you saw it,—you might like the pattern
8574: better; it makes beautiful tea, and there’s a stand and everything; you
8575: might use it for every day, or else lay it by for Lucy when she goes to
8576: housekeeping. I should be so loath for ’em to buy it at the Golden
8577: Lion,” said the poor woman, her heart swelling, and the tears
8578: coming,—“my teapot as I bought when I was married, and to think of its
8579: being scratched, and set before the travellers and folks, and my
8580: letters on it,—see here, E. D.,—and everybody to see ’em.”
8581: 
8582: “Ah, dear, dear!” said aunt Pullet, shaking her head with deep sadness,
8583: “it’s very bad,—to think o’ the family initials going about
8584: everywhere—it niver was so before; you’re a very unlucky sister, Bessy.
8585: But what’s the use o’ buying the teapot, when there’s the linen and
8586: spoons and everything to go, and some of ’em with your full name,—and
8587: when it’s got that straight spout, too.”
8588: 
8589: “As to disgrace o’ the family,” said Mrs Glegg, “that can’t be helped
8590: wi’ buying teapots. The disgrace is, for one o’ the family to ha’
8591: married a man as has brought her to beggary. The disgrace is, as
8592: they’re to be sold up. We can’t hinder the country from knowing that.”
8593: 
8594: Maggie had started up from the sofa at the allusion to her father, but
8595: Tom saw her action and flushed face in time to prevent her from
8596: speaking. “Be quiet, Maggie,” he said authoritatively, pushing her
8597: aside. It was a remarkable manifestation of self-command and practical
8598: judgment in a lad of fifteen, that when his aunt Glegg ceased, he began
8599: to speak in a quiet and respectful manner, though with a good deal of
8600: trembling in his voice; for his mother’s words had cut him to the
8601: quick.
8602: 
8603: “Then, aunt,” he said, looking straight at Mrs Glegg, “if you think
8604: it’s a disgrace to the family that we should be sold up, wouldn’t it be
8605: better to prevent it altogether? And if you and aunt Pullet,” he
8606: continued, looking at the latter, “think of leaving any money to me and
8607: Maggie, wouldn’t it be better to give it now, and pay the debt we’re
8608: going to be sold up for, and save my mother from parting with her
8609: furniture?”
8610: 
8611: There was silence for a few moments, for every one, including Maggie,
8612: was astonished at Tom’s sudden manliness of tone. Uncle Glegg was the
8613: first to speak.
8614: 
8615: “Ay, ay, young man, come now! You show some notion o’ things. But
8616: there’s the interest, you must remember; your aunts get five per cent
8617: on their money, and they’d lose that if they advanced it; you haven’t
8618: thought o’ that.”
8619: 
8620: “I could work and pay that every year,” said Tom, promptly. “I’d do
8621: anything to save my mother from parting with her things.”
8622: 
8623: “Well done!” said uncle Glegg, admiringly. He had been drawing Tom out,
8624: rather than reflecting on the practicability of his proposal. But he
8625: had produced the unfortunate result of irritating his wife.
8626: 
8627: “Yes, Mr Glegg!” said that lady, with angry sarcasm. “It’s pleasant
8628: work for you to be giving my money away, as you’ve pretended to leave
8629: at my own disposal. And my money, as was my own father’s gift, and not
8630: yours, Mr Glegg; and I’ve saved it, and added to it myself, and had
8631: more to put out almost every year, and it’s to go and be sunk in other
8632: folks’ furniture, and encourage ’em in luxury and extravagance as
8633: they’ve no means of supporting; and I’m to alter my will, or have a
8634: codicil made, and leave two or three hundred less behind me when I
8635: die,—me as have allays done right and been careful, and the eldest o’
8636: the family; and my money’s to go and be squandered on them as have had
8637: the same chance as me, only they’ve been wicked and wasteful. Sister
8638: Pullet, _you_ may do as you like, and you may let your husband rob you
8639: back again o’ the money he’s given you, but that isn’t _my_ sperrit.”
8640: 
8641: “La, Jane, how fiery you are!” said Mrs Pullet. “I’m sure you’ll have
8642: the blood in your head, and have to be cupped. I’m sorry for Bessy and
8643: her children,—I’m sure I think of ’em o’ nights dreadful, for I sleep
8644: very bad wi’ this new medicine,—but it’s no use for me to think o’
8645: doing anything, if you won’t meet me half-way.”
8646: 
8647: “Why, there’s this to be considered,” said Mr Glegg. “It’s no use to
8648: pay off this debt and save the furniture, when there’s all the law
8649: debts behind, as ’ud take every shilling, and more than could be made
8650: out o’ land and stock, for I’ve made that out from Lawyer Gore. We’d
8651: need save our money to keep the poor man with, instead o’ spending it
8652: on furniture as he can neither eat nor drink. You _will_ be so hasty,
8653: Jane, as if I didn’t know what was reasonable.”
8654: 
8655: “Then speak accordingly, Mr Glegg!” said his wife, with slow, loud
8656: emphasis, bending her head toward him significantly.
8657: 
8658: Tom’s countenance had fallen during this conversation, and his lip
8659: quivered; but he was determined not to give way. He would behave like a
8660: man. Maggie, on the contrary, after her momentary delight in Tom’s
8661: speech, had relapsed into her state of trembling indignation. Her
8662: mother had been standing close by Tom’s side, and had been clinging to
8663: his arm ever since he had last spoken; Maggie suddenly started up and
8664: stood in front of them, her eyes flashing like the eyes of a young
8665: lioness.
8666: 
8667: “Why do you come, then,” she burst out, “talking and interfering with
8668: us and scolding us, if you don’t mean to do anything to help my poor
8669: mother—your own sister,—if you’ve no feeling for her when she’s in
8670: trouble, and won’t part with anything, though you would never miss it,
8671: to save her from pain? Keep away from us then, and don’t come to find
8672: fault with my father,—he was better than any of you; he was kind,—he
8673: would have helped _you_, if you had been in trouble. Tom and I don’t
8674: ever want to have any of your money, if you won’t help my mother. We’d
8675: rather not have it! We’ll do without you.”
8676: 
8677: Maggie, having hurled her defiance at aunts and uncles in this way,
8678: stood still, with her large dark eyes glaring at them, as if she were
8679: ready to await all consequences.
8680: 
8681: Mrs Tulliver was frightened; there was something portentous in this mad
8682: outbreak; she did not see how life could go on after it. Tom was vexed;
8683: it was no _use_ to talk so. The aunts were silent with surprise for
8684: some moments. At length, in a case of aberration such as this, comment
8685: presented itself as more expedient than any answer.
8686: 
8687: “You haven’t seen the end o’ your trouble wi’ that child, Bessy,” said
8688: Mrs Pullet; “she’s beyond everything for boldness and unthankfulness.
8689: It’s dreadful. I might ha’ let alone paying for her schooling, for
8690: she’s worse nor ever.”
8691: 
8692: “It’s no more than what I’ve allays said,” followed Mrs Glegg. “Other
8693: folks may be surprised, but I’m not. I’ve said over and over
8694: again,—years ago I’ve said,—‘Mark my words; that child ’ull come to no
8695: good; there isn’t a bit of our family in her.’ And as for her having so
8696: much schooling, I never thought well o’ that. I’d my reasons when I
8697: said _I_ wouldn’t pay anything toward it.”
8698: 
8699: “Come, come,” said Mr Glegg, “let’s waste no more time in
8700: talking,—let’s go to business. Tom, now, get the pen and ink——”
8701: 
8702: While Mr Glegg was speaking, a tall dark figure was seen hurrying past
8703: the window.
8704: 
8705: “Why, there’s Mrs Moss,” said Mrs Tulliver. “The bad news must ha’
8706: reached her, then”; and she went out to open the door, Maggie eagerly
8707: following her.
8708: 
8709: “That’s fortunate,” said Mrs Glegg. “She can agree to the list o’
8710: things to be bought in. It’s but right she should do her share when
8711: it’s her own brother.”
8712: 
8713: Mrs Moss was in too much agitation to resist Mrs Tulliver’s movement,
8714: as she drew her into the parlour automatically, without reflecting that
8715: it was hardly kind to take her among so many persons in the first
8716: painful moment of arrival. The tall, worn, dark-haired woman was a
8717: strong contrast to the Dodson sisters as she entered in her shabby
8718: dress, with her shawl and bonnet looking as if they had been hastily
8719: huddled on, and with that entire absence of self-consciousness which
8720: belongs to keenly felt trouble. Maggie was clinging to her arm; and Mrs
8721: Moss seemed to notice no one else except Tom, whom she went straight up
8722: to and took by the hand.
8723: 
8724: “Oh, my dear children,” she burst out, “you’ve no call to think well o’
8725: me; I’m a poor aunt to you, for I’m one o’ them as take all and give
8726: nothing. How’s my poor brother?”
8727: 
8728: “Mr Turnbull thinks he’ll get better,” said Maggie. “Sit down, aunt
8729: Gritty. Don’t fret.”
8730: 
8731: “Oh, my sweet child, I feel torn i’ two,” said Mrs Moss, allowing
8732: Maggie to lead her to the sofa, but still not seeming to notice the
8733: presence of the rest. “We’ve three hundred pounds o’ my brother’s
8734: money, and now he wants it, and you all want it, poor things!—and yet
8735: we must be sold up to pay it, and there’s my poor children,—eight of
8736: ’em, and the little un of all can’t speak plain. And I feel as if I was
8737: a robber. But I’m sure I’d no thought as my brother——”
8738: 
8739: The poor woman was interrupted by a rising sob.
8740: 
8741: “Three hundred pounds! oh dear, dear,” said Mrs Tulliver, who, when she
8742: had said that her husband had done “unknown” things for his sister, had
8743: not had any particular sum in her mind, and felt a wife’s irritation at
8744: having been kept in the dark.
8745: 
8746: “What madness, to be sure!” said Mrs Glegg. “A man with a family! He’d
8747: no right to lend his money i’ that way; and without security, I’ll be
8748: bound, if the truth was known.”
8749: 
8750: Mrs Glegg’s voice had arrested Mrs Moss’s attention, and looking up,
8751: she said:
8752: 
8753: “Yes, there _was_ security; my husband gave a note for it. We’re not
8754: that sort o’ people, neither of us, as ’ud rob my brother’s children;
8755: and we looked to paying back the money, when the times got a bit
8756: better.”
8757: 
8758: “Well, but now,” said Mr Glegg, gently, “hasn’t your husband no way o’
8759: raising this money? Because it ’ud be a little fortin, like, for these
8760: folks, if we can do without Tulliver’s being made a bankrupt. Your
8761: husband’s got stock; it is but right he should raise the money, as it
8762: seems to me,—not but what I’m sorry for you, Mrs Moss.”
8763: 
8764: “Oh, sir, you don’t know what bad luck my husband’s had with his stock.
8765: The farm’s suffering so as never was for want o’ stock; and we’ve sold
8766: all the wheat, and we’re behind with our rent,—not but what we’d like
8767: to do what’s right, and I’d sit up and work half the night, if it ’ud
8768: be any good; but there’s them poor children,—four of ’em such little
8769: uns——”
8770: 
8771: “Don’t cry so, aunt; don’t fret,” whispered Maggie, who had kept hold
8772: of Mrs Moss’s hand.
8773: 
8774: “Did Mr Tulliver let you have the money all at once?” said Mrs
8775: Tulliver, still lost in the conception of things which had been “going
8776: on” without her knowledge.
8777: 
8778: “No; at twice,” said Mrs Moss, rubbing her eyes and making an effort to
8779: restrain her tears. “The last was after my bad illness four years ago,
8780: as everything went wrong, and there was a new note made then. What with
8781: illness and bad luck, I’ve been nothing but cumber all my life.”
8782: 
8783: “Yes, Mrs Moss,” said Mrs Glegg, with decision, “yours is a very
8784: unlucky family; the more’s the pity for _my_ sister.”
8785: 
8786: “I set off in the cart as soon as ever I heard o’ what had happened,”
8787: said Mrs Moss, looking at Mrs Tulliver. “I should never ha’ stayed away
8788: all this while, if you’d thought well to let me know. And it isn’t as
8789: I’m thinking all about ourselves, and nothing about my brother, only
8790: the money was so on my mind, I couldn’t help speaking about it. And my
8791: husband and me desire to do the right thing, sir,” she added, looking
8792: at Mr Glegg, “and we’ll make shift and pay the money, come what will,
8793: if that’s all my brother’s got to trust to. We’ve been used to trouble,
8794: and don’t look for much else. It’s only the thought o’ my poor children
8795: pulls me i’ two.”
8796: 
8797: “Why, there’s this to be thought on, Mrs Moss,” said Mr Glegg, “and
8798: it’s right to warn you,—if Tulliver’s made a bankrupt, and he’s got a
8799: note-of-hand of your husband’s for three hundred pounds, you’ll be
8800: obliged to pay it; th’ assignees ’ull come on you for it.”
8801: 
8802: “Oh dear, oh dear!” said Mrs Tulliver, thinking of the bankruptcy, and
8803: not of Mrs Moss’s concern in it. Poor Mrs Moss herself listened in
8804: trembling submission, while Maggie looked with bewildered distress at
8805: Tom to see if _he_ showed any signs of understanding this trouble, and
8806: caring about poor aunt Moss. Tom was only looking thoughtful, with his
8807: eyes on the tablecloth.
8808: 
8809: “And if he isn’t made bankrupt,” continued Mr Glegg, “as I said before,
8810: three hundred pounds ’ud be a little fortin for him, poor man. We don’t
8811: know but what he may be partly helpless, if he ever gets up again. I’m
8812: very sorry if it goes hard with you, Mrs Moss, but my opinion is,
8813: looking at it one way, it’ll be right for you to raise the money; and
8814: looking at it th’ other way, you’ll be obliged to pay it. You won’t
8815: think ill o’ me for speaking the truth.”
8816: 
8817: “Uncle,” said Tom, looking up suddenly from his meditative view of the
8818: tablecloth, “I don’t think it would be right for my aunt Moss to pay
8819: the money if it would be against my father’s will for her to pay it;
8820: would it?”
8821: 
8822: Mr Glegg looked surprised for a moment or two before he said: “Why, no,
8823: perhaps not, Tom; but then he’d ha’ destroyed the note, you know. We
8824: must look for the note. What makes you think it ’ud be against his
8825: will?”
8826: 
8827: “Why,” said Tom, colouring, but trying to speak firmly, in spite of a
8828: boyish tremor, “I remember quite well, before I went to school to Mr
8829: Stelling, my father said to me one night, when we were sitting by the
8830: fire together, and no one else was in the room——”
8831: 
8832: Tom hesitated a little, and then went on.
8833: 
8834: “He said something to me about Maggie, and then he said: ‘I’ve always
8835: been good to my sister, though she married against my will, and I’ve
8836: lent Moss money; but I shall never think of distressing him to pay it;
8837: I’d rather lose it. My children must not mind being the poorer for
8838: that.’ And now my father’s ill, and not able to speak for himself, I
8839: shouldn’t like anything to be done contrary to what he said to me.”
8840: 
8841: “Well, but then, my boy,” said Uncle Glegg, whose good feeling led him
8842: to enter into Tom’s wish, but who could not at once shake off his
8843: habitual abhorrence of such recklessness as destroying securities, or
8844: alienating anything important enough to make an appreciable difference
8845: in a man’s property, “we should have to make away wi’ the note, you
8846: know, if we’re to guard against what may happen, supposing your
8847: father’s made bankrupt——”
8848: 
8849: “Mr Glegg,” interrupted his wife, severely, “mind what you’re saying.
8850: You’re putting yourself very forrard in other folks’s business. If you
8851: speak rash, don’t say it was my fault.”
8852: 
8853: “That’s such a thing as I never heared of before,” said uncle Pullet,
8854: who had been making haste with his lozenge in order to express his
8855: amazement,—“making away with a note! I should think anybody could set
8856: the constable on you for it.”
8857: 
8858: “Well, but,” said Mrs Tulliver, “if the note’s worth all that money,
8859: why can’t we pay it away, and save my things from going away? We’ve no
8860: call to meddle with your uncle and aunt Moss, Tom, if you think your
8861: father ’ud be angry when he gets well.”
8862: 
8863: Mrs Tulliver had not studied the question of exchange, and was
8864: straining her mind after original ideas on the subject.
8865: 
8866: “Pooh, pooh, pooh! you women don’t understand these things,” said uncle
8867: Glegg. “There’s no way o’ making it safe for Mr and Mrs Moss but
8868: destroying the note.”
8869: 
8870: “Then I hope you’ll help me do it, uncle,” said Tom, earnestly. “If my
8871: father shouldn’t get well, I should be very unhappy to think anything
8872: had been done against his will that I could hinder. And I’m sure he
8873: meant me to remember what he said that evening. I ought to obey my
8874: father’s wish about his property.”
8875: 
8876: Even Mrs Glegg could not withhold her approval from Tom’s words; she
8877: felt that the Dodson blood was certainly speaking in him, though, if
8878: his father had been a Dodson, there would never have been this wicked
8879: alienation of money. Maggie would hardly have restrained herself from
8880: leaping on Tom’s neck, if her aunt Moss had not prevented her by
8881: herself rising and taking Tom’s hand, while she said, with rather a
8882: choked voice:
8883: 
8884: “You’ll never be the poorer for this, my dear boy, if there’s a God
8885: above; and if the money’s wanted for your father, Moss and me ’ull pay
8886: it, the same as if there was ever such security. We’ll do as we’d be
8887: done by; for if my children have got no other luck, they’ve got an
8888: honest father and mother.”
8889: 
8890: “Well,” said Mr Glegg, who had been meditating after Tom’s words, “we
8891: shouldn’t be doing any wrong by the creditors, supposing your father
8892: _was_ bankrupt. I’ve been thinking o’ that, for I’ve been a creditor
8893: myself, and seen no end o’ cheating. If he meant to give your aunt the
8894: money before ever he got into this sad work o’ lawing, it’s the same as
8895: if he’d made away with the note himself; for he’d made up his mind to
8896: be that much poorer. But there’s a deal o’ things to be considered,
8897: young man,” Mr Glegg added, looking admonishingly at Tom, “when you
8898: come to money business, and you may be taking one man’s dinner away to
8899: make another man’s breakfast. You don’t understand that, I doubt?”
8900: 
8901: “Yes, I do,” said Tom, decidedly. “I know if I owe money to one man,
8902: I’ve no right to give it to another. But if my father had made up his
8903: mind to give my aunt the money before he was in debt, he had a right to
8904: do it.”
8905: 
8906: “Well done, young man! I didn’t think you’d been so sharp,” said uncle
8907: Glegg, with much candor. “But perhaps your father _did_ make away with
8908: the note. Let us go and see if we can find it in the chest.”
8909: 
8910: “It’s in my father’s room. Let us go too, aunt Gritty,” whispered
8911: Maggie.
8912: 
8913: 
8914: Chapter IV.
8915: 
8916: A Vanishing Gleam
8917: 
8918: Mr Tulliver, even between the fits of spasmodic rigidity which had
8919: recurred at intervals ever since he had been found fallen from his
8920: horse, was usually in so apathetic a condition that the exits and
8921: entrances into his room were not felt to be of great importance. He had
8922: lain so still, with his eyes closed, all this morning, that Maggie told
8923: her aunt Moss she must not expect her father to take any notice of
8924: them.
8925: 
8926: They entered very quietly, and Mrs Moss took her seat near the head of
8927: the bed, while Maggie sat in her old place on the bed, and put her hand
8928: on her father’s without causing any change in his face.
8929: 
8930: Mr Glegg and Tom had also entered, treading softly, and were busy
8931: selecting the key of the old oak chest from the bunch which Tom had
8932: brought from his father’s bureau. They succeeded in opening the
8933: chest,—which stood opposite the foot of Mr Tulliver’s bed,—and propping
8934: the lid with the iron holder, without much noise.
8935: 
8936: “There’s a tin box,” whispered Mr Glegg; “he’d most like put a small
8937: thing like a note in there. Lift it out, Tom; but I’ll just lift up
8938: these deeds,—they’re the deeds o’ the house and mill, I suppose,—and
8939: see what there is under ’em.”
8940: 
8941: Mr Glegg had lifted out the parchments, and had fortunately drawn back
8942: a little, when the iron holder gave way, and the heavy lid fell with a
8943: loud bang that resounded over the house.
8944: 
8945: Perhaps there was something in that sound more than the mere fact of
8946: the strong vibration that produced the instantaneous effect on the
8947: frame of the prostrate man, and for the time completely shook off the
8948: obstruction of paralysis. The chest had belonged to his father and his
8949: father’s father, and it had always been rather a solemn business to
8950: visit it. All long-known objects, even a mere window fastening or a
8951: particular door-latch, have sounds which are a sort of recognised voice
8952: to us,—a voice that will thrill and awaken, when it has been used to
8953: touch deep-lying fibres. In the same moment, when all the eyes in the
8954: room were turned upon him, he started up and looked at the chest, the
8955: parchments in Mr Glegg’s hand, and Tom holding the tin box, with a
8956: glance of perfect consciousness and recognition.
8957: 
8958: “What are you going to do with those deeds?” he said, in his ordinary
8959: tone of sharp questioning whenever he was irritated. “Come here, Tom.
8960: What do you do, going to my chest?”
8961: 
8962: Tom obeyed, with some trembling; it was the first time his father had
8963: recognised him. But instead of saying anything more to him, his father
8964: continued to look with a growing distinctness of suspicion at Mr Glegg
8965: and the deeds.
8966: 
8967: “What’s been happening, then?” he said sharply. “What are you meddling
8968: with my deeds for? Is Wakem laying hold of everything? Why don’t you
8969: tell me what you’ve been a-doing?” he added impatiently, as Mr Glegg
8970: advanced to the foot of the bed before speaking.
8971: 
8972: “No, no, friend Tulliver,” said Mr Glegg, in a soothing tone. “Nobody’s
8973: getting hold of anything as yet. We only came to look and see what was
8974: in the chest. You’ve been ill, you know, and we’ve had to look after
8975: things a bit. But let’s hope you’ll soon be well enough to attend to
8976: everything yourself.”
8977: 
8978: Mr Tulliver looked around him meditatively, at Tom, at Mr Glegg, and at
8979: Maggie; then suddenly appearing aware that some one was seated by his
8980: side at the head of the bed he turned sharply round and saw his sister.
8981: 
8982: “Eh, Gritty!” he said, in the half-sad, affectionate tone in which he
8983: had been wont to speak to her. “What! you’re there, are you? How could
8984: you manage to leave the children?”
8985: 
8986: “Oh, brother!” said good Mrs Moss, too impulsive to be prudent, “I’m
8987: thankful I’m come now to see you yourself again; I thought you’d never
8988: know us any more.”
8989: 
8990: “What! have I had a stroke?” said Mr Tulliver, anxiously, looking at Mr
8991: Glegg.
8992: 
8993: “A fall from your horse—shook you a bit,—that’s all, I think,” said Mr
8994: Glegg. “But you’ll soon get over it, let’s hope.”
8995: 
8996: Mr Tulliver fixed his eyes on the bed-clothes, and remained silent for
8997: two or three minutes. A new shadow came over his face. He looked up at
8998: Maggie first, and said in a lower tone, “You got the letter, then, my
8999: wench?”
9000: 
9001: “Yes, father,” she said, kissing him with a full heart. She felt as if
9002: her father were come back to her from the dead, and her yearning to
9003: show him how she had always loved him could be fulfilled.
9004: 
9005: “Where’s your mother?” he said, so preoccupied that he received the
9006: kiss as passively as some quiet animal might have received it.
9007: 
9008: “She’s downstairs with my aunts, father. Shall I fetch her?”
9009: 
9010: “Ay, ay; poor Bessy!” and his eyes turned toward Tom as Maggie left the
9011: room.
9012: 
9013: “You’ll have to take care of ’em both if I die, you know, Tom. You’ll
9014: be badly off, I doubt. But you must see and pay everybody. And
9015: mind,—there’s fifty pound o’ Luke’s as I put into the business,—he gave
9016: me a bit at a time, and he’s got nothing to show for it. You must pay
9017: him first thing.”
9018: 
9019: Uncle Glegg involuntarily shook his head, and looked more concerned
9020: than ever, but Tom said firmly:
9021: 
9022: “Yes, father. And haven’t you a note from my uncle Moss for three
9023: hundred pounds? We came to look for that. What do you wish to be done
9024: about it, father?”
9025: 
9026: “Ah! I’m glad you thought o’ that, my lad,” said Mr Tulliver. “I allays
9027: meant to be easy about that money, because o’ your aunt. You mustn’t
9028: mind losing the money, if they can’t pay it,—and it’s like enough they
9029: can’t. The note’s in that box, mind! I allays meant to be good to you,
9030: Gritty,” said Mr Tulliver, turning to his sister; “but you know you
9031: aggravated me when you would have Moss.”
9032: 
9033: At this moment Maggie re-entered with her mother, who came in much
9034: agitated by the news that her husband was quite himself again.
9035: 
9036: “Well, Bessy,” he said, as she kissed him, “you must forgive me if
9037: you’re worse off than you ever expected to be.
9038: 
9039: But it’s the fault o’ the law,—it’s none o’ mine,” he added angrily.
9040: “It’s the fault o’ raskills. Tom, you mind this: if ever you’ve got the
9041: chance, you make Wakem smart. If you don’t, you’re a good-for-nothing
9042: son. You might horse-whip him, but he’d set the law on you,—the law’s
9043: made to take care o’ raskills.”
9044: 
9045: Mr Tulliver was getting excited, and an alarming flush was on his face.
9046: Mr Glegg wanted to say something soothing, but he was prevented by Mr
9047: Tulliver’s speaking again to his wife. “They’ll make a shift to pay
9048: everything, Bessy,” he said, “and yet leave you your furniture; and
9049: your sisters’ll do something for you—and Tom’ll grow up—though what
9050: he’s to be I don’t know—I’ve done what I could—I’ve given him a
9051: eddication—and there’s the little wench, she’ll get married—but it’s a
9052: poor tale——”
9053: 
9054: The sanative effect of the strong vibration was exhausted, and with the
9055: last words the poor man fell again, rigid and insensible. Though this
9056: was only a recurrence of what had happened before, it struck all
9057: present as if it had been death, not only from its contrast with the
9058: completeness of the revival, but because his words had all had
9059: reference to the possibility that his death was near. But with poor
9060: Tulliver death was not to be a leap; it was to be a long descent under
9061: thickening shadows.
9062: 
9063: Mr Turnbull was sent for; but when he heard what had passed, he said
9064: this complete restoration, though only temporary, was a hopeful sign,
9065: proving that there was no permanent lesion to prevent ultimate
9066: recovery.
9067: 
9068: Among the threads of the past which the stricken man had gathered up,
9069: he had omitted the bill of sale; the flash of memory had only lit up
9070: prominent ideas, and he sank into forgetfulness again with half his
9071: humiliation unlearned.
9072: 
9073: But Tom was clear upon two points,—that his uncle Moss’s note must be
9074: destroyed; and that Luke’s money must be paid, if in no other way, out
9075: of his own and Maggie’s money now in the savings bank. There were
9076: subjects, you perceive, on which Tom was much quicker than on the
9077: niceties of classical construction, or the relations of a mathematical
9078: demonstration.
9079: 
9080: 
9081: Chapter V.
9082: 
9083: Tom Applies His Knife to the Oyster
9084: 
9085: The next day, at ten o’clock, Tom was on his way to St Ogg’s, to see
9086: his uncle Deane, who was to come home last night, his aunt had said;
9087: and Tom had made up his mind that his uncle Deane was the right person
9088: to ask for advice about getting some employment. He was in a great way
9089: of business; he had not the narrow notions of uncle Glegg; and he had
9090: risen in the world on a scale of advancement which accorded with Tom’s
9091: ambition.
9092: 
9093: It was a dark, chill, misty morning, likely to end in rain,—one of
9094: those mornings when even happy people take refuge in their hopes. And
9095: Tom was very unhappy; he felt the humiliation as well as the
9096: prospective hardships of his lot with all the keenness of a proud
9097: nature; and with all his resolute dutifulness toward his father there
9098: mingled an irrepressible indignation against him which gave misfortune
9099: the less endurable aspect of a wrong. Since these were the consequences
9100: of going to law, his father was really blamable, as his aunts and
9101: uncles had always said he was; and it was a significant indication of
9102: Tom’s character, that though he thought his aunts ought to do something
9103: more for his mother, he felt nothing like Maggie’s violent resentment
9104: against them for showing no eager tenderness and generosity. There were
9105: no impulses in Tom that led him to expect what did not present itself
9106: to him as a right to be demanded. Why should people give away their
9107: money plentifully to those who had not taken care of their own money?
9108: Tom saw some justice in severity; and all the more, because he had
9109: confidence in himself that he should never deserve that just severity.
9110: It was very hard upon him that he should be put at this disadvantage in
9111: life by his father’s want of prudence; but he was not going to complain
9112: and to find fault with people because they did not make everything easy
9113: for him. He would ask no one to help him, more than to give him work
9114: and pay him for it. Poor Tom was not without his hopes to take refuge
9115: in under the chill damp imprisonment of the December fog, which seemed
9116: only like a part of his home troubles. At sixteen, the mind that has
9117: the strongest affinity for fact cannot escape illusion and
9118: self-flattery; and Tom, in sketching his future, had no other guide in
9119: arranging his facts than the suggestions of his own brave
9120: self-reliance. Both Mr Glegg and Mr Deane, he knew, had been very poor
9121: once; he did not want to save money slowly and retire on a moderate
9122: fortune like his uncle Glegg, but he would be like his uncle Deane—get
9123: a situation in some great house of business and rise fast. He had
9124: scarcely seen anything of his uncle Deane for the last three years—the
9125: two families had been getting wider apart; but for this very reason Tom
9126: was the more hopeful about applying to him. His uncle Glegg, he felt
9127: sure, would never encourage any spirited project, but he had a vague
9128: imposing idea of the resources at his uncle Deane’s command. He had
9129: heard his father say, long ago, how Deane had made himself so valuable
9130: to Guest & Co. that they were glad enough to offer him a share in the
9131: business; that was what Tom resolved _he_ would do. It was intolerable
9132: to think of being poor and looked down upon all one’s life. He would
9133: provide for his mother and sister, and make every one say that he was a
9134: man of high character. He leaped over the years in this way, and, in
9135: the haste of strong purpose and strong desire, did not see how they
9136: would be made up of slow days, hours, and minutes.
9137: 
9138: By the time he had crossed the stone bridge over the Floss and was
9139: entering St Ogg’s, he was thinking that he would buy his father’s mill
9140: and land again when he was rich enough, and improve the house and live
9141: there; he should prefer it to any smarter, newer place, and he could
9142: keep as many horses and dogs as he liked.
9143: 
9144: Walking along the street with a firm, rapid step, at this point in his
9145: reverie he was startled by some one who had crossed without his notice,
9146: and who said to him in a rough, familiar voice:
9147: 
9148: “Why, Master Tom, how’s your father this morning?” It was a publican of
9149: St Ogg’s, one of his father’s customers.
9150: 
9151: Tom disliked being spoken to just then; but he said civilly, “He’s
9152: still very ill, thank you.”
9153: 
9154: “Ay, it’s been a sore chance for you, young man, hasn’t it,—this
9155: lawsuit turning out against him?” said the publican, with a confused,
9156: beery idea of being good-natured.
9157: 
9158: Tom reddened and passed on; he would have felt it like the handling of
9159: a bruise, even if there had been the most polite and delicate reference
9160: to his position.
9161: 
9162: “That’s Tulliver’s son,” said the publican to a grocer standing on the
9163: adjacent door-step.
9164: 
9165: “Ah!” said the grocer, “I thought I knew his features. He takes after
9166: his mother’s family; she was a Dodson. He’s a fine, straight youth;
9167: what’s he been brought up to?”
9168: 
9169: “Oh! to turn up his nose at his father’s customers, and be a fine
9170: gentleman,—not much else, I think.”
9171: 
9172: Tom, roused from his dream of the future to a thorough consciousness of
9173: the present, made all the greater haste to reach the warehouse offices
9174: of Guest & Co., where he expected to find his uncle Deane. But this was
9175: Mr Deane’s morning at the bank, a clerk told him, and with some
9176: contempt for his ignorance; Mr Deane was not to be found in River
9177: Street on a Thursday morning.
9178: 
9179: At the bank Tom was admitted into the private room where his uncle was,
9180: immediately after sending in his name. Mr Deane was auditing accounts;
9181: but he looked up as Tom entered, and putting out his hand, said, “Well,
9182: Tom, nothing fresh the matter at home, I hope? How’s your father?”
9183: 
9184: “Much the same, thank you, uncle,” said Tom, feeling nervous. “But I
9185: want to speak to you, please, when you’re at liberty.”
9186: 
9187: “Sit down, sit down,” said Mr Deane, relapsing into his accounts, in
9188: which he and the managing-clerk remained so absorbed for the next
9189: half-hour that Tom began to wonder whether he should have to sit in
9190: this way till the bank closed,—there seemed so little tendency toward a
9191: conclusion in the quiet, monotonous procedure of these sleek,
9192: prosperous men of business. Would his uncle give him a place in the
9193: bank? It would be very dull, prosy work, he thought, writing there
9194: forever to the loud ticking of a timepiece. He preferred some other way
9195: of getting rich. But at last there was a change; his uncle took a pen
9196: and wrote something with a flourish at the end.
9197: 
9198: “You’ll just step up to Torry’s now, Mr Spence, will you?” said Mr
9199: Deane, and the clock suddenly became less loud and deliberate in Tom’s
9200: ears.
9201: 
9202: “Well, Tom,” said Mr Deane, when they were alone, turning his
9203: substantial person a little in his chair, and taking out his snuff-box;
9204: “what’s the business, my boy; what’s the business?” Mr Deane, who had
9205: heard from his wife what had passed the day before, thought Tom was
9206: come to appeal to him for some means of averting the sale.
9207: 
9208: “I hope you’ll excuse me for troubling you, uncle,” said Tom,
9209: colouring, but speaking in a tone which, though, tremulous, had a
9210: certain proud independence in it; “but I thought you were the best
9211: person to advise me what to do.”
9212: 
9213: “Ah!” said Mr Deane, reserving his pinch of snuff, and looking at Tom
9214: with new attention, “let us hear.”
9215: 
9216: “I want to get a situation, uncle, so that I may earn some money,” said
9217: Tom, who never fell into circumlocution.
9218: 
9219: “A situation?” said Mr Deane, and then took his pinch of snuff with
9220: elaborate justice to each nostril. Tom thought snuff-taking a most
9221: provoking habit.
9222: 
9223: “Why, let me see, how old are you?” said Mr Deane, as he threw himself
9224: backward again.
9225: 
9226: “Sixteen; I mean, I am going in seventeen,” said Tom, hoping his uncle
9227: noticed how much beard he had.
9228: 
9229: “Let me see; your father had some notion of making you an engineer, I
9230: think?”
9231: 
9232: “But I don’t think I could get any money at that for a long while,
9233: could I?”
9234: 
9235: “That’s true; but people don’t get much money at anything, my boy, when
9236: they’re only sixteen. You’ve had a good deal of schooling, however; I
9237: suppose you’re pretty well up in accounts, eh? You understand book
9238: keeping?”
9239: 
9240: “No,” said Tom, rather falteringly. “I was in Practice. But Mr Stelling
9241: says I write a good hand, uncle. That’s my writing,” added Tom, laying
9242: on the table a copy of the list he had made yesterday.
9243: 
9244: “Ah! that’s good, that’s good. But, you see, the best hand in the
9245: world’ll not get you a better place than a copying-clerk’s, if you know
9246: nothing of book-keeping,—nothing of accounts. And a copying-clerk’s a
9247: cheap article. But what have you been learning at school, then?”
9248: 
9249: Mr Deane had not occupied himself with methods of education, and had no
9250: precise conception of what went forward in expensive schools.
9251: 
9252: “We learned Latin,” said Tom, pausing a little between each item, as if
9253: he were turning over the books in his school-desk to assist his
9254: memory,—“a good deal of Latin; and the last year I did Themes, one week
9255: in Latin and one in English; and Greek and Roman history; and Euclid;
9256: and I began Algebra, but I left it off again; and we had one day every
9257: week for Arithmetic. Then I used to have drawing-lessons; and there
9258: were several other books we either read or learned out of,—English
9259: Poetry, and Horæ Paulinæ and Blair’s Rhetoric, the last half.”
9260: 
9261: Mr Deane tapped his snuff-box again and screwed up his mouth; he felt
9262: in the position of many estimable persons when they had read the New
9263: Tariff, and found how many commodities were imported of which they knew
9264: nothing; like a cautious man of business, he was not going to speak
9265: rashly of a raw material in which he had had no experience. But the
9266: presumption was, that if it had been good for anything, so successful a
9267: man as himself would hardly have been ignorant of it.
9268: 
9269: About Latin he had an opinion, and thought that in case of another war,
9270: since people would no longer wear hair-powder, it would be well to put
9271: a tax upon Latin, as a luxury much run upon by the higher classes, and
9272: not telling at all on the ship-owning department. But, for what he
9273: knew, the Horæ Paulinæ might be something less neutral. On the whole,
9274: this list of acquirements gave him a sort of repulsion toward poor Tom.
9275: 
9276: “Well,” he said at last, in rather a cold, sardonic tone, “you’ve had
9277: three years at these things,—you must be pretty strong in ’em. Hadn’t
9278: you better take up some line where they’ll come in handy?”
9279: 
9280: Tom coloured, and burst out, with new energy:
9281: 
9282: “I’d rather not have any employment of that sort, uncle. I don’t like
9283: Latin and those things. I don’t know what I could do with them unless I
9284: went as usher in a school; and I don’t know them well enough for that!
9285: besides, I would as soon carry a pair of panniers. I don’t want to be
9286: that sort of person. I should like to enter into some business where I
9287: can get on,—a manly business, where I should have to look after things,
9288: and get credit for what I did. And I shall want to keep my mother and
9289: sister.”
9290: 
9291: “Ah, young gentleman,” said Mr Deane, with that tendency to repress
9292: youthful hopes which stout and successful men of fifty find one of
9293: their easiest duties, “that’s sooner said than done,—sooner said than
9294: done.”
9295: 
9296: “But didn’t _you_ get on in that way, uncle?” said Tom, a little
9297: irritated that Mr Deane did not enter more rapidly into his views. “I
9298: mean, didn’t you rise from one place to another through your abilities
9299: and good conduct?”
9300: 
9301: “Ay, ay, sir,” said Mr Deane, spreading himself in his chair a little,
9302: and entering with great readiness into a retrospect of his own career.
9303: “But I’ll tell you how I got on. It wasn’t by getting astride a stick
9304: and thinking it would turn into a horse if I sat on it long enough. I
9305: kept my eyes and ears open, sir, and I wasn’t too fond of my own back,
9306: and I made my master’s interest my own. Why, with only looking into
9307: what went on in the mill, I found out how there was a waste of five
9308: hundred a-year that might be hindered. Why, sir, I hadn’t more
9309: schooling to begin with than a charity boy; but I saw pretty soon that
9310: I couldn’t get on far enough without mastering accounts, and I learned
9311: ’em between working hours, after I’d been unlading. Look here.” Mr
9312: Deane opened a book and pointed to the page. “I write a good hand
9313: enough, and I’ll match anybody at all sorts of reckoning by the head;
9314: and I got it all by hard work, and paid for it out of my own
9315: earnings,—often out of my own dinner and supper. And I looked into the
9316: nature of all the things we had to do in the business, and picked up
9317: knowledge as I went about my work, and turned it over in my head. Why,
9318: I’m no mechanic,—I never pretended to be—but I’ve thought of a thing or
9319: two that the mechanics never thought of, and it’s made a fine
9320: difference in our returns. And there isn’t an article shipped or
9321: unshipped at our wharf but I know the quality of it. If I got places,
9322: sir, it was because I made myself fit for ’em. If you want to slip into
9323: a round hole, you must make a ball of yourself; that’s where it is.”
9324: 
9325: Mr Deane tapped his box again. He had been led on by pure enthusiasm in
9326: his subject, and had really forgotten what bearing this retrospective
9327: survey had on his listener. He had found occasion for saying the same
9328: thing more than once before, and was not distinctly aware that he had
9329: not his port-wine before him.
9330: 
9331: “Well, uncle,” said Tom, with a slight complaint in his tone, “that’s
9332: what I should like to do. Can’t _I_ get on in the same way?”
9333: 
9334: “In the same way?” said Mr Deane, eyeing Tom with quiet deliberation.
9335: “There go two or three questions to that, Master Tom. That depends on
9336: what sort of material you are, to begin with, and whether you’ve been
9337: put into the right mill. But I’ll tell you what it is. Your poor father
9338: went the wrong way to work in giving you an education. It wasn’t my
9339: business, and I didn’t interfere; but it is as I thought it would be.
9340: You’ve had a sort of learning that’s all very well for a young fellow
9341: like our Mr Stephen Guest, who’ll have nothing to do but sign checks
9342: all his life, and may as well have Latin inside his head as any other
9343: sort of stuffing.”
9344: 
9345: “But, uncle,” said Tom, earnestly, “I don’t see why the Latin need
9346: hinder me from getting on in business. I shall soon forget it all; it
9347: makes no difference to me. I had to do my lessons at school, but I
9348: always thought they’d never be of any use to me afterward; I didn’t
9349: care about them.”
9350: 
9351: “Ay, ay, that’s all very well,” said Mr Deane; “but it doesn’t alter
9352: what I was going to say. Your Latin and rigmarole may soon dry off you,
9353: but you’ll be but a bare stick after that. Besides, it’s whitened your
9354: hands and taken the rough work out of you. And what do you know? Why,
9355: you know nothing about book-keeping, to begin with, and not so much of
9356: reckoning as a common shopman. You’ll have to begin at a low round of
9357: the ladder, let me tell you, if you mean to get on in life. It’s no use
9358: forgetting the education your father’s been paying for, if you don’t
9359: give yourself a new un.”
9360: 
9361: Tom bit his lips hard; he felt as if the tears were rising, and he
9362: would rather die than let them.
9363: 
9364: “You want me to help you to a situation,” Mr Deane went on; “well, I’ve
9365: no fault to find with that. I’m willing to do something for you. But
9366: you youngsters nowadays think you’re to begin with living well and
9367: working easy; you’ve no notion of running afoot before you get
9368: horseback. Now, you must remember what you are,—you’re a lad of
9369: sixteen, trained to nothing particular. There’s heaps of your sort,
9370: like so many pebbles, made to fit in nowhere. Well, you might be
9371: apprenticed to some business,—a chemist’s and druggist’s perhaps; your
9372: Latin might come in a bit there——”
9373: 
9374: Tom was going to speak, but Mr Deane put up his hand and said:
9375: 
9376: “Stop! hear what I’ve got to say. You don’t want to be a ’prentice,—I
9377: know, I know,—you want to make more haste, and you don’t want to stand
9378: behind a counter. But if you’re a copying-clerk, you’ll have to stand
9379: behind a desk, and stare at your ink and paper all day; there isn’t
9380: much out-look there, and you won’t be much wiser at the end of the year
9381: than at the beginning. The world isn’t made of pen, ink, and paper, and
9382: if you’re to get on in the world, young man, you must know what the
9383: world’s made of. Now the best chance for you ’ud be to have a place on
9384: a wharf, or in a warehouse, where you’d learn the smell of things, but
9385: you wouldn’t like that, I’ll be bound; you’d have to stand cold and
9386: wet, and be shouldered about by rough fellows. You’re too fine a
9387: gentleman for that.”
9388: 
9389: Mr Deane paused and looked hard at Tom, who certainly felt some inward
9390: struggle before he could reply.
9391: 
9392: “I would rather do what will be best for me in the end, sir; I would
9393: put up with what was disagreeable.”
9394: 
9395: “That’s well, if you can carry it out. But you must remember it isn’t
9396: only laying hold of a rope, you must go on pulling. It’s the mistake
9397: you lads make that have got nothing either in your brains or your
9398: pocket, to think you’ve got a better start in the world if you stick
9399: yourselves in a place where you can keep your coats clean, and have the
9400: shopwenches take you for fine gentlemen. That wasn’t the way _I_
9401: started, young man; when I was sixteen, my jacket smelt of tar, and I
9402: wasn’t afraid of handling cheeses. That’s the reason I can wear good
9403: broadcloth now, and have my legs under the same table with the heads of
9404: the best firms in St Ogg’s.”
9405: 
9406: Uncle Deane tapped his box, and seemed to expand a little under his
9407: waistcoat and gold chain, as he squared his shoulders in the chair.
9408: 
9409: “Is there any place at liberty that you know of now, uncle, that I
9410: should do for? I should like to set to work at once,” said Tom, with a
9411: slight tremor in his voice.
9412: 
9413: “Stop a bit, stop a bit; we mustn’t be in too great a hurry. You must
9414: bear in mind, if I put you in a place you’re a bit young for, because
9415: you happen to be my nephew, I shall be responsible for you. And there’s
9416: no better reason, you know, than your being my nephew; because it
9417: remains to be seen whether you’re good for anything.”
9418: 
9419: “I hope I shall never do you any discredit, uncle,” said Tom, hurt, as
9420: all boys are at the statement of the unpleasant truth that people feel
9421: no ground for trusting them. “I care about my own credit too much for
9422: that.”
9423: 
9424: “Well done, Tom, well done! That’s the right spirit, and I never refuse
9425: to help anybody if they’ve a mind to do themselves justice. There’s a
9426: young man of two-and-twenty I’ve got my eye on now. I shall do what I
9427: can for that young man; he’s got some pith in him. But then, you see,
9428: he’s made good use of his time,—a first-rate calculator,—can tell you
9429: the cubic contents of anything in no time, and put me up the other day
9430: to a new market for Swedish bark; he’s uncommonly knowing in
9431: manufactures, that young fellow.”
9432: 
9433: “I’d better set about learning book-keeping, hadn’t I, uncle?” said
9434: Tom, anxious to prove his readiness to exert himself.
9435: 
9436: “Yes, yes, you can’t do amiss there. But—Ah, Spence, you’re back again.
9437: Well Tom, there’s nothing more to be said just now, I think, and I must
9438: go to business again. Good-by. Remember me to your mother.”
9439: 
9440: Mr Deane put out his hand, with an air of friendly dismissal, and Tom
9441: had not courage to ask another question, especially in the presence of
9442: Mr Spence. So he went out again into the cold damp air. He had to call
9443: at his uncle Glegg’s about the money in the Savings Bank, and by the
9444: time he set out again the mist had thickened, and he could not see very
9445: far before him; but going along River Street again, he was startled,
9446: when he was within two yards of the projecting side of a shop-window,
9447: by the words “Dorlcote Mill” in large letters on a hand-bill, placed as
9448: if on purpose to stare at him. It was the catalogue of the sale to take
9449: place the next week; it was a reason for hurrying faster out of the
9450: town.
9451: 
9452: Poor Tom formed no visions of the distant future as he made his way
9453: homeward; he only felt that the present was very hard. It seemed a
9454: wrong toward him that his uncle Deane had no confidence in him,—did not
9455: see at once that he should acquit himself well, which Tom himself was
9456: as certain of as of the daylight. Apparently he, Tom Tulliver, was
9457: likely to be held of small account in the world; and for the first time
9458: he felt a sinking of heart under the sense that he really was very
9459: ignorant, and could do very little. Who was that enviable young man
9460: that could tell the cubic contents of things in no time, and make
9461: suggestions about Swedish bark! Tom had been used to be so entirely
9462: satisfied with himself, in spite of his breaking down in a
9463: demonstration, and construing _nunc illas promite vires_ as “now
9464: promise those men”; but now he suddenly felt at a disadvantage, because
9465: he knew less than some one else knew. There must be a world of things
9466: connected with that Swedish bark, which, if he only knew them, might
9467: have helped him to get on. It would have been much easier to make a
9468: figure with a spirited horse and a new saddle.
9469: 
9470: Two hours ago, as Tom was walking to St Ogg’s, he saw the distant
9471: future before him as he might have seen a tempting stretch of smooth
9472: sandy beach beyond a belt of flinty shingles; he was on the grassy bank
9473: then, and thought the shingles might soon be passed. But now his feet
9474: were on the sharp stones; the belt of shingles had widened, and the
9475: stretch of sand had dwindled into narrowness.
9476: 
9477: “What did my Uncle Deane say, Tom?” said Maggie, putting her arm
9478: through Tom’s as he was warming himself rather drearily by the kitchen
9479: fire. “Did he say he would give you a situation?”
9480: 
9481: “No, he didn’t say that. He didn’t quite promise me anything; he seemed
9482: to think I couldn’t have a very good situation. I’m too young.”
9483: 
9484: “But didn’t he speak kindly, Tom?”
9485: 
9486: “Kindly? Pooh! what’s the use of talking about that? I wouldn’t care
9487: about his speaking kindly, if I could get a situation. But it’s such a
9488: nuisance and bother; I’ve been at school all this while learning Latin
9489: and things,—not a bit of good to me,—and now my uncle says I must set
9490: about learning book-keeping and calculation, and those things. He seems
9491: to make out I’m good for nothing.”
9492: 
9493: Tom’s mouth twitched with a bitter expression as he looked at the fire.
9494: 
9495: “Oh, what a pity we haven’t got Dominie Sampson!” said Maggie, who
9496: couldn’t help mingling some gayety with their sadness. “If he had
9497: taught me book-keeping by double entry and after the Italian method, as
9498: he did Lucy Bertram, I could teach you, Tom.”
9499: 
9500: “_You_ teach! Yes, I dare say. That’s always the tone you take,” said
9501: Tom.
9502: 
9503: “Dear Tom, I was only joking,” said Maggie, putting her cheek against
9504: his coat-sleeve.
9505: 
9506: “But it’s always the same, Maggie,” said Tom, with the little frown he
9507: put on when he was about to be justifiably severe. “You’re always
9508: setting yourself up above me and every one else, and I’ve wanted to
9509: tell you about it several times. You ought not to have spoken as you
9510: did to my uncles and aunts; you should leave it to me to take care of
9511: my mother and you, and not put yourself forward. You think you know
9512: better than any one, but you’re almost always wrong. I can judge much
9513: better than you can.”
9514: 
9515: Poor Tom! he had just come from being lectured and made to feel his
9516: inferiority; the reaction of his strong, self-asserting nature must
9517: take place somehow; and here was a case in which he could justly show
9518: himself dominant. Maggie’s cheek flushed and her lip quivered with
9519: conflicting resentment and affection, and a certain awe as well as
9520: admiration of Tom’s firmer and more effective character. She did not
9521: answer immediately; very angry words rose to her lips, but they were
9522: driven back again, and she said at last:
9523: 
9524: “You often think I’m conceited, Tom, when I don’t mean what I say at
9525: all in that way. I don’t mean to put myself above you; I know you
9526: behaved better than I did yesterday. But you are always so harsh to me,
9527: Tom.”
9528: 
9529: With the last words the resentment was rising again.
9530: 
9531: “No, I’m not harsh,” said Tom, with severe decision. “I’m always kind
9532: to you, and so I shall be; I shall always take care of you. But you
9533: must mind what I say.”
9534: 
9535: Their mother came in now, and Maggie rushed away, that her burst of
9536: tears, which she felt must come, might not happen till she was safe
9537: upstairs. They were very bitter tears; everybody in the world seemed so
9538: hard and unkind to Maggie; there was no indulgence, no fondness, such
9539: as she imagined when she fashioned the world afresh in her own
9540: thoughts. In books there were people who were always agreeable or
9541: tender, and delighted to do things that made one happy, and who did not
9542: show their kindness by finding fault. The world outside the books was
9543: not a happy one, Maggie felt; it seemed to be a world where people
9544: behaved the best to those they did not pretend to love, and that did
9545: not belong to them. And if life had no love in it, what else was there
9546: for Maggie? Nothing but poverty and the companionship of her mother’s
9547: narrow griefs, perhaps of her father’s heart-cutting childish
9548: dependence. There is no hopelessness so sad as that of early youth,
9549: when the soul is made up of wants, and has no long memories, no
9550: superadded life in the life of others; though we who looked on think
9551: lightly of such premature despair, as if our vision of the future
9552: lightened the blind sufferer’s present.
9553: 
9554: Maggie, in her brown frock, with her eyes reddened and her heavy hair
9555: pushed back, looking from the bed where her father lay to the dull
9556: walls of this sad chamber which was the centre of her world, was a
9557: creature full of eager, passionate longings for all that was beautiful
9558: and glad; thirsty for all knowledge; with an ear straining after dreamy
9559: music that died away and would not come near to her; with a blind,
9560: unconscious yearning for something that would link together the
9561: wonderful impressions of this mysterious life, and give her soul a
9562: sense of home in it.
9563: 
9564: No wonder, when there is this contrast between the outward and the
9565: inward, that painful collisions come of it.
9566: 
9567: 
9568: Chapter VI.
9569: 
9570: Tending to Refute the Popular Prejudice against the Present of a
9571: Pocket-Knife
9572: 
9573: In that dark time of December, the sale of the household furniture
9574: lasted beyond the middle of the second day. Mr Tulliver, who had begun,
9575: in his intervals of consciousness, to manifest an irritability which
9576: often appeared to have as a direct effect the recurrence of spasmodic
9577: rigidity and insensibility, had lain in this living death throughout
9578: the critical hours when the noise of the sale came nearest to his
9579: chamber. Mr Turnbull had decided that it would be a less risk to let
9580: him remain where he was than to remove him to Luke’s cottage,—a plan
9581: which the good Luke had proposed to Mrs Tulliver, thinking it would be
9582: very bad if the master were “to waken up” at the noise of the sale; and
9583: the wife and children had sat imprisoned in the silent chamber,
9584: watching the large prostrate figure on the bed, and trembling lest the
9585: blank face should suddenly show some response to the sounds which fell
9586: on their own ears with such obstinate, painful repetition.
9587: 
9588: But it was over at last, that time of importunate certainty and
9589: eye-straining suspense. The sharp sound of a voice, almost as metallic
9590: as the rap that followed it, had ceased; the tramping of footsteps on
9591: the gravel had died out. Mrs Tulliver’s blond face seemed aged ten
9592: years by the last thirty hours; the poor woman’s mind had been busy
9593: divining when her favourite things were being knocked down by the
9594: terrible hammer; her heart had been fluttering at the thought that
9595: first one thing and then another had gone to be identified as hers in
9596: the hateful publicity of the Golden Lion; and all the while she had to
9597: sit and make no sign of this inward agitation. Such things bring lines
9598: in well-rounded faces, and broaden the streaks of white among the hairs
9599: that once looked as if they had been dipped in pure sunshine. Already,
9600: at three o’clock, Kezia, the good-hearted, bad-tempered housemaid, who
9601: regarded all people that came to the sale as her personal enemies, the
9602: dirt on whose feet was of a peculiarly vile quality, had begun to scrub
9603: and swill with an energy much assisted by a continual low muttering
9604: against “folks as came to buy up other folk’s things,” and made light
9605: of “scrazing” the tops of mahogany tables over which better folks than
9606: themselves had had to—suffer a waste of tissue through evaporation. She
9607: was not scrubbing indiscriminately, for there would be further dirt of
9608: the same atrocious kind made by people who had still to fetch away
9609: their purchases; but she was bent on bringing the parlour, where that
9610: “pipe-smoking pig,” the bailiff, had sat, to such an appearance of
9611: scant comfort as could be given to it by cleanliness and the few
9612: articles of furniture bought in for the family. Her mistress and the
9613: young folks should have their tea in it that night, Kezia was
9614: determined.
9615: 
9616: It was between five and six o’clock, near the usual teatime, when she
9617: came upstairs and said that Master Tom was wanted. The person who
9618: wanted him was in the kitchen, and in the first moments, by the
9619: imperfect fire and candle light, Tom had not even an indefinite sense
9620: of any acquaintance with the rather broad-set but active figure,
9621: perhaps two years older than himself, that looked at him with a pair of
9622: blue eyes set in a disc of freckles, and pulled some curly red locks
9623: with a strong intention of respect. A low-crowned oilskin-covered hat,
9624: and a certain shiny deposit of dirt on the rest of the costume, as of
9625: tablets prepared for writing upon, suggested a calling that had to do
9626: with boats; but this did not help Tom’s memory.
9627: 
9628: “Sarvant, Master Tom,” said he of the red locks, with a smile which
9629: seemed to break through a self-imposed air of melancholy. “You don’t
9630: know me again, I doubt,” he went on, as Tom continued to look at him
9631: inquiringly; “but I’d like to talk to you by yourself a bit, please.”
9632: 
9633: “There’s a fire i’ the parlour, Master Tom,” said Kezia, who objected
9634: to leaving the kitchen in the crisis of toasting.
9635: 
9636: “Come this way, then,” said Tom, wondering if this young fellow
9637: belonged to Guest & Co.’s Wharf, for his imagination ran continually
9638: toward that particular spot; and uncle Deane might any time be sending
9639: for him to say that there was a situation at liberty.
9640: 
9641: The bright fire in the parlour was the only light that showed the few
9642: chairs, the bureau, the carpetless floor, and the one table—no, not the
9643: _one_ table; there was a second table, in a corner, with a large Bible
9644: and a few other books upon it. It was this new strange bareness that
9645: Tom felt first, before he thought of looking again at the face which
9646: was also lit up by the fire, and which stole a half-shy, questioning
9647: glance at him as the entirely strange voice said:
9648: 
9649: “Why! you don’t remember Bob, then, as you gen the pocket-knife to, Mr
9650: Tom?”
9651: 
9652: The rough-handled pocket-knife was taken out in the same moment, and
9653: the largest blade opened by way of irresistible demonstration.
9654: 
9655: “What! Bob Jakin?” said Tom, not with any cordial delight, for he felt
9656: a little ashamed of that early intimacy symbolised by the pocket-knife,
9657: and was not at all sure that Bob’s motives for recalling it were
9658: entirely admirable.
9659: 
9660: “Ay, ay, Bob Jakin, if Jakin it must be, ’cause there’s so many Bobs as
9661: you went arter the squerrils with, that day as I plumped right down
9662: from the bough, and bruised my shins a good un—but I got the squerril
9663: tight for all that, an’ a scratter it was. An’ this littlish blade’s
9664: broke, you see, but I wouldn’t hev a new un put in, ’cause they might
9665: be cheatin’ me an’ givin’ me another knife instid, for there isn’t such
9666: a blade i’ the country,—it’s got used to my hand, like. An’ there was
9667: niver nobody else gen me nothin’ but what I got by my own sharpness,
9668: only you, Mr Tom; if it wasn’t Bill Fawks as gen me the terrier pup
9669: istid o’ drowndin’t it, an’ I had to jaw him a good un afore he’d give
9670: it me.”
9671: 
9672: Bob spoke with a sharp and rather treble volubility, and got through
9673: his long speech with surprising despatch, giving the blade of his knife
9674: an affectionate rub on his sleeve when he had finished.
9675: 
9676: “Well, Bob,” said Tom, with a slight air of patronage, the foregoing
9677: reminscences having disposed him to be as friendly as was becoming,
9678: though there was no part of his acquaintance with Bob that he
9679: remembered better than the cause of their parting quarrel; “is there
9680: anything I can do for you?”
9681: 
9682: “Why, no, Mr Tom,” answered Bob, shutting up his knife with a click and
9683: returning it to his pocket, where he seemed to be feeling for something
9684: else. “I shouldn’t ha’ come back upon you now ye’re i’ trouble, an’
9685: folks say as the master, as I used to frighten the birds for, an’ he
9686: flogged me a bit for fun when he catched me eatin’ the turnip, as they
9687: say he’ll niver lift up his head no more,—I shouldn’t ha’ come now to
9688: ax you to gi’ me another knife ’cause you gen me one afore. If a chap
9689: gives me one black eye, that’s enough for me; I sha’n’t ax him for
9690: another afore I sarve him out; an’ a good turn’s worth as much as a bad
9691: un, anyhow. I shall niver grow down’ards again, Mr Tom, an’ you war the
9692: little chap as I liked the best when _I_ war a little chap, for all you
9693: leathered me, and wouldn’t look at me again. There’s Dick Brumby,
9694: there, I could leather him as much as I’d a mind; but lors! you get
9695: tired o’ leatherin’ a chap when you can niver make him see what you
9696: want him to shy at. I’n seen chaps as ’ud stand starin’ at a bough till
9697: their eyes shot out, afore they’d see as a bird’s tail warn’t a leaf.
9698: It’s poor work goin’ wi’ such raff. But you war allays a rare un at
9699: shying, Mr Tom, an’ I could trusten to you for droppin’ down wi’ your
9700: stick in the nick o’ time at a runnin’ rat, or a stoat, or that, when I
9701: war a-beatin’ the bushes.”
9702: 
9703: Bob had drawn out a dirty canvas bag, and would perhaps not have paused
9704: just then if Maggie had not entered the room and darted a look of
9705: surprise and curiosity at him, whereupon he pulled his red locks again
9706: with due respect. But the next moment the sense of the altered room
9707: came upon Maggie with a force that overpowered the thought of Bob’s
9708: presence. Her eyes had immediately glanced from him to the place where
9709: the bookcase had hung; there was nothing now but the oblong unfaded
9710: space on the wall, and below it the small table with the Bible and the
9711: few other books.
9712: 
9713: “Oh, Tom!” she burst out, clasping her hands, “where are the books? I
9714: thought my uncle Glegg said he would buy them. Didn’t he? Are those all
9715: they’ve left us?”
9716: 
9717: “I suppose so,” said Tom, with a sort of desperate indifference. “Why
9718: should they buy many books when they bought so little furniture?”
9719: 
9720: “Oh, but, Tom,” said Maggie, her eyes filling with tears, as she rushed
9721: up to the table to see what books had been rescued. “Our dear old
9722: Pilgrim’s Progress that you coloured with your little paints; and that
9723: picture of Pilgrim with a mantle on, looking just like a turtle—oh
9724: dear!” Maggie went on, half sobbing as she turned over the few books,
9725: “I thought we should never part with that while we lived; everything is
9726: going away from us; the end of our lives will have nothing in it like
9727: the beginning!”
9728: 
9729: Maggie turned away from the table and threw herself into a chair, with
9730: the big tears ready to roll down her cheeks, quite blinded to the
9731: presence of Bob, who was looking at her with the pursuant gaze of an
9732: intelligent dumb animal, with perceptions more perfect than his
9733: comprehension.
9734: 
9735: “Well, Bob,” said Tom, feeling that the subject of the books was
9736: unseasonable, “I suppose you just came to see me because we’re in
9737: trouble? That was very good-natured of you.”
9738: 
9739: “I’ll tell you how it is, Master Tom,” said Bob, beginning to untwist
9740: his canvas bag. “You see, I’n been with a barge this two ’ear; that’s
9741: how I’n been gettin’ my livin’,—if it wasn’t when I was tentin’ the
9742: furnace, between whiles, at Torry’s mill. But a fortni’t ago I’d a rare
9743: bit o’ luck,—I allays thought I was a lucky chap, for I niver set a
9744: trap but what I catched something; but this wasn’t trap, it was a fire
9745: i’ Torry’s mill, an’ I doused it, else it ’ud set th’ oil alight, an’
9746: the genelman gen me ten suvreigns; he gen me ’em himself last week. An’
9747: he said first, I was a sperrited chap,—but I knowed that afore,—but
9748: then he outs wi’ the ten suvreigns, an’ that war summat new. Here they
9749: are, all but one!” Here Bob emptied the canvas bag on the table. “An’
9750: when I’d got ’em, my head was all of a boil like a kettle o’ broth,
9751: thinkin’ what sort o’ life I should take to, for there war a many
9752: trades I’d thought on; for as for the barge, I’m clean tired out wi’t,
9753: for it pulls the days out till they’re as long as pigs’ chitterlings.
9754: An’ I thought first I’d ha’ ferrets an’ dogs, an’ be a rat-catcher; an’
9755: then I thought as I should like a bigger way o’ life, as I didn’t know
9756: so well; for I’n seen to the bottom o’ rat-catching; an’ I thought, an’
9757: thought, till at last I settled I’d be a packman,—for they’re knowin’
9758: fellers, the packmen are,—an’ I’d carry the lightest things I could i’
9759: my pack; an’ there’d be a use for a feller’s tongue, as is no use
9760: neither wi’ rats nor barges. An’ I should go about the country far an’
9761: wide, an’ come round the women wi’ my tongue, an’ get my dinner hot at
9762: the public,—lors! it ’ud be a lovely life!”
9763: 
9764: Bob paused, and then said, with defiant decision, as if resolutely
9765: turning his back on that paradisaic picture:
9766: 
9767: “But I don’t mind about it, not a chip! An’ I’n changed one o’ the
9768: suvreigns to buy my mother a goose for dinner, an’ I’n bought a blue
9769: plush wescoat, an’ a sealskin cap,—for if I meant to be a packman, I’d
9770: do it respectable. But I don’t mind about it, not a chip! My yead isn’t
9771: a turnip, an’ I shall p’r’aps have a chance o’ dousing another fire
9772: afore long. I’m a lucky chap. So I’ll thank you to take the nine
9773: suvreigns, Mr Tom, and set yoursen up with ’em somehow, if it’s true as
9774: the master’s broke. They mayn’t go fur enough, but they’ll help.”
9775: 
9776: Tom was touched keenly enough to forget his pride and suspicion.
9777: 
9778: “You’re a very kind fellow, Bob,” he said, colouring, with that little
9779: diffident tremor in his voice which gave a certain charm even to Tom’s
9780: pride and severity, “and I sha’n’t forget you again, though I didn’t
9781: know you this evening. But I can’t take the nine sovereigns; I should
9782: be taking your little fortune from you, and they wouldn’t do me much
9783: good either.”
9784: 
9785: “Wouldn’t they, Mr Tom?” said Bob, regretfully. “Now don’t say so
9786: ’cause you think I want ’em. I aren’t a poor chap. My mother gets a
9787: good penn’orth wi’ picking feathers an’ things; an’ if she eats nothin’
9788: but bread-an’-water, it runs to fat. An’ I’m such a lucky chap; an’ I
9789: doubt you aren’t quite so lucky, Mr Tom,—th’ old master isn’t,
9790: anyhow,—an’ so you might take a slice o’ my luck, an’ no harm done.
9791: Lors! I found a leg o’ pork i’ the river one day; it had tumbled out o’
9792: one o’ them round-sterned Dutchmen, I’ll be bound. Come, think better
9793: on it, Mr Tom, for old ’quinetance’ sake, else I shall think you bear
9794: me a grudge.”
9795: 
9796: Bob pushed the sovereigns forward, but before Tom could speak Maggie,
9797: clasping her hands, and looking penitently at Bob, said:
9798: 
9799: “Oh, I’m so sorry, Bob; I never thought you were so good. Why, I think
9800: you’re the kindest person in the world!”
9801: 
9802: Bob had not been aware of the injurious opinion for which Maggie was
9803: performing an inward act of penitence, but he smiled with pleasure at
9804: this handsome eulogy,—especially from a young lass who, as he informed
9805: his mother that evening, had “such uncommon eyes, they looked somehow
9806: as they made him feel nohow.”
9807: 
9808: “No, indeed Bob, I can’t take them,” said Tom; “but don’t think I feel
9809: your kindness less because I say no. I don’t want to take anything from
9810: anybody, but to work my own way. And those sovereigns wouldn’t help me
9811: much—they wouldn’t really—if I were to take them. Let me shake hands
9812: with you instead.”
9813: 
9814: Tom put out his pink palm, and Bob was not slow to place his hard,
9815: grimy hand within it.
9816: 
9817: “Let me put the sovereigns in the bag again,” said Maggie; “and you’ll
9818: come and see us when you’ve bought your pack, Bob.”
9819: 
9820: “It’s like as if I’d come out o’ make believe, o’ purpose to show ’em
9821: you,” said Bob, with an air of discontent, as Maggie gave him the bag
9822: again, “a-taking ’em back i’ this way. I _am_ a bit of a Do, you know;
9823: but it isn’t that sort o’ Do,—it’s on’y when a feller’s a big rogue, or
9824: a big flat, I like to let him in a bit, that’s all.”
9825: 
9826: “Now, don’t you be up to any tricks, Bob,” said Tom, “else you’ll get
9827: transported some day.”
9828: 
9829: “No, no; not me, Mr Tom,” said Bob, with an air of cheerful confidence.
9830: “There’s no law again’ flea-bites. If I wasn’t to take a fool in now
9831: and then, he’d niver get any wiser. But, lors! hev a suvreign to buy
9832: you and Miss summat, on’y for a token—just to match my pocket-knife.”
9833: 
9834: While Bob was speaking he laid down the sovereign, and resolutely
9835: twisted up his bag again. Tom pushed back the gold, and said, “No,
9836: indeed, Bob; thank you heartily, but I can’t take it.” And Maggie,
9837: taking it between her fingers, held it up to Bob and said, more
9838: persuasively:
9839: 
9840: “Not now, but perhaps another time. If ever Tom or my father wants help
9841: that you can give, we’ll let you know; won’t we, Tom? That’s what you
9842: would like,—to have us always depend on you as a friend that we can go
9843: to,—isn’t it, Bob?”
9844: 
9845: “Yes, Miss, and thank you,” said Bob, reluctantly taking the money;
9846: “that’s what I’d like, anything as you like. An’ I wish you good-by,
9847: Miss, and good-luck, Mr Tom, and thank you for shaking hands wi’ me,
9848: _though_ you wouldn’t take the money.”
9849: 
9850: Kezia’s entrance, with very black looks, to inquire if she shouldn’t
9851: bring in the tea now, or whether the toast was to get hardened to a
9852: brick, was a seasonable check on Bob’s flux of words, and hastened his
9853: parting bow.

9857: 
9858: How a Hen Takes to Stratagem
9859: 
9860: The days passed, and Mr Tulliver showed, at least to the eyes of the
9861: medical man, stronger and stronger symptoms of a gradual return to his
9862: normal condition; the paralytic obstruction was, little by little,
9863: losing its tenacity, and the mind was rising from under it with fitful
9864: struggles, like a living creature making its way from under a great
9865: snowdrift, that slides and slides again, and shuts up the newly made
9866: opening.
9867: 
9868: Time would have seemed to creep to the watchers by the bed, if it had
9869: only been measured by the doubtful, distant hope which kept count of
9870: the moments within the chamber; but it was measured for them by a
9871: fast-approaching dread which made the nights come too quickly. While Mr
9872: Tulliver was slowly becoming himself again, his lot was hastening
9873: toward its moment of most palpable change. The taxing-masters had done
9874: their work like any respectable gunsmith conscientiously preparing the
9875: musket, that, duly pointed by a brave arm, will spoil a life or two.
9876: Allocaturs, filing of bills in Chancery, decrees of sale, are legal
9877: chain-shot or bomb-shells that can never hit a solitary mark, but must
9878: fall with widespread shattering. So deeply inherent is it in this life
9879: of ours that men have to suffer for each other’s sins, so inevitably
9880: diffusive is human suffering, that even justice makes its victims, and
9881: we can conceive no retribution that does not spread beyond its mark in
9882: pulsations of unmerited pain.
9883: 
9884: By the beginning of the second week in January, the bills were out
9885: advertising the sale, under a decree of Chancery, of Mr Tulliver’s
9886: farming and other stock, to be followed by a sale of the mill and land,
9887: held in the proper after-dinner hour at the Golden Lion. The miller
9888: himself, unaware of the lapse of time, fancied himself still in that
9889: first stage of his misfortunes when expedients might be thought of; and
9890: often in his conscious hours talked in a feeble, disjointed manner of
9891: plans he would carry out when he “got well.” The wife and children were
9892: not without hope of an issue that would at least save Mr Tulliver from
9893: leaving the old spot, and seeking an entirely strange life. For uncle
9894: Deane had been induced to interest himself in this stage of the
9895: business. It would not, he acknowledged, be a bad speculation for Guest
9896: & Co. to buy Dorlcote Mill, and carry on the business, which was a good
9897: one, and might be increased by the addition of steam power; in which
9898: case Tulliver might be retained as manager. Still, Mr Deane would say
9899: nothing decided about the matter; the fact that Wakem held the mortgage
9900: on the land might put it into his head to bid for the whole estate, and
9901: further, to outbid the cautious firm of Guest & Co., who did not carry
9902: on business on sentimental grounds. Mr Deane was obliged to tell Mrs
9903: Tulliver something to that effect, when he rode over to the mill to
9904: inspect the books in company with Mrs Glegg; for she had observed that
9905: “if Guest &Co. would only think about it, Mr Tulliver’s father and
9906: grandfather had been carrying on Dorlcote Mill long before the oil-mill
9907: of that firm had been so much as thought of.”
9908: 
9909: Mr Deane, in reply, doubted whether that was precisely the relation
9910: between the two mills which would determine their value as investments.
9911: As for uncle Glegg, the thing lay quite beyond his imagination; the
9912: good-natured man felt sincere pity for the Tulliver family, but his
9913: money was all locked up in excellent mortgages, and he could run no
9914: risk; that would be unfair to his own relatives; but he had made up his
9915: mind that Tulliver should have some new flannel waistcoats which he had
9916: himself renounced in favour of a more elastic commodity, and that he
9917: would buy Mrs Tulliver a pound of tea now and then; it would be a
9918: journey which his benevolence delighted in beforehand, to carry the tea
9919: and see her pleasure on being assured it was the best black.
9920: 
9921: Still, it was clear that Mr Deane was kindly disposed toward the
9922: Tullivers. One day he had brought Lucy, who was come home for the
9923: Christmas holidays, and the little blond angel-head had pressed itself
9924: against Maggie’s darker cheek with many kisses and some tears. These
9925: fair slim daughters keep up a tender spot in the heart of many a
9926: respectable partner in a respectable firm, and perhaps Lucy’s anxious,
9927: pitying questions about her poor cousins helped to make uncle Deane
9928: more prompt in finding Tom a temporary place in the warehouse, and in
9929: putting him in the way of getting evening lessons in book-keeping and
9930: calculation.
9931: 
9932: That might have cheered the lad and fed his hopes a little, if there
9933: had not come at the same time the much-dreaded blow of finding that his
9934: father must be a bankrupt, after all; at least, the creditors must be
9935: asked to take less than their due, which to Tom’s untechnical mind was
9936: the same thing as bankruptcy. His father must not only be said to have
9937: “lost his property,” but to have “failed,”—the word that carried the
9938: worst obloquy to Tom’s mind. For when the defendant’s claim for costs
9939: had been satisfied, there would remain the friendly bill of Mr Gore,
9940: and the deficiency at the bank, as well as the other debts which would
9941: make the assets shrink into unequivocal disproportion; “not more than
9942: ten or twelve shillings in the pound,” predicted Mr Deane, in a decided
9943: tone, tightening his lips; and the words fell on Tom like a scalding
9944: liquied, leaving a continual smart.
9945: 
9946: He was sadly in want of something to keep up his spirits a little in
9947: the unpleasant newness of his position,—suddenly transported from the
9948: easy carpeted _ennui_ of study-hours at Mr Stelling’s, and the busy
9949: idleness of castle-building in a “last half” at school, to the
9950: companionship of sacks and hides, and bawling men thundering down heavy
9951: weights at his elbow. The first step toward getting on in the world was
9952: a chill, dusty, noisy affair, and implied going without one’s tea in
9953: order to stay in St Ogg’s and have an evening lesson from a one-armed
9954: elderly clerk, in a room smelling strongly of bad tobacco. Tom’s young
9955: pink-and-white face had its colours very much deadened by the time he
9956: took off his hat at home, and sat down with keen hunger to his supper.
9957: No wonder he was a little cross if his mother or Maggie spoke to him.
9958: 
9959: But all this while Mrs Tulliver was brooding over a scheme by which
9960: she, and no one else, would avert the result most to be dreaded, and
9961: prevent Wakem from entertaining the purpose of bidding for the mill.
9962: Imagine a truly respectable and amiable hen, by some portentous
9963: anomaly, taking to reflection and inventing combinations by which she
9964: might prevail on Hodge not to wring her neck, or send her and her
9965: chicks to market; the result could hardly be other than much cackling
9966: and fluttering. Mrs Tulliver, seeing that everything had gone wrong,
9967: had begun to think she had been too passive in life; and that, if she
9968: had applied her mind to business, and taken a strong resolution now and
9969: then, it would have been all the better for her and her family. Nobody,
9970: it appeared, had thought of going to speak to Wakem on this business of
9971: the mill; and yet, Mrs Tulliver reflected, it would have been quite the
9972: shortest method of securing the right end. It would have been of no
9973: use, to be sure, for Mr Tulliver to go,—even if he had been able and
9974: willing,—for he had been “going to law against Wakem” and abusing him
9975: for the last ten years; Wakem was always likely to have a spite against
9976: him. And now that Mrs Tulliver had come to the conclusion that her
9977: husband was very much in the wrong to bring her into this trouble, she
9978: was inclined to think that his opinion of Wakem was wrong too. To be
9979: sure, Wakem had “put the bailies in the house, and sold them up”; but
9980: she supposed he did that to please the man that lent Mr Tulliver the
9981: money, for a lawyer had more folks to please than one, and he wasn’t
9982: likely to put Mr Tulliver, who had gone to law with him, above
9983: everybody else in the world. The attorney might be a very reasonable
9984: man; why not? He had married a Miss Clint, and at the time Mrs Tulliver
9985: had heard of that marriage, the summer when she wore her blue satin
9986: spencer, and had not yet any thoughts of Mr Tulliver, she knew no harm
9987: of Wakem. And certainly toward herself, whom he knew to have been a
9988: Miss Dodson, it was out of all possibility that he could entertain
9989: anything but good-will, when it was once brought home to his
9990: observation that she, for her part, had never wanted to go to law, and
9991: indeed was at present disposed to take Mr Wakem’s view of all subjects
9992: rather than her husband’s. In fact, if that attorney saw a respectable
9993: matron like herself disposed “to give him good words,” why shouldn’t he
9994: listen to her representations? For she would put the matter clearly
9995: before him, which had never been done yet. And he would never go and
9996: bid for the mill on purpose to spite her, an innocent woman, who
9997: thought it likely enough that she had danced with him in their youth at
9998: Squire Darleigh’s, for at those big dances she had often and often
9999: danced with young men whose names she had forgotten.
10000: 
10001: Mrs Tulliver hid these reasonings in her own bosom; for when she had
10002: thrown out a hint to Mr Deane and Mr Glegg that she wouldn’t mind going
10003: to speak to Wakem herself, they had said, “No, no, no,” and “Pooh,
10004: pooh,” and “Let Wakem alone,” in the tone of men who were not likely to
10005: give a candid attention to a more definite exposition of her project;
10006: still less dared she mention the plan to Tom and Maggie, for “the
10007: children were always so against everything their mother said”; and Tom,
10008: she observed, was almost as much set against Wakem as his father was.
10009: But this unusual concentration of thought naturally gave Mrs Tulliver
10010: an unusual power of device and determination: and a day or two before
10011: the sale, to be held at the Golden Lion, when there was no longer any
10012: time to be lost, she carried out her plan by a stratagem. There were
10013: pickles in question, a large stock of pickles and ketchup which Mrs
10014: Tulliver possessed, and which Mr Hyndmarsh, the grocer, would certainly
10015: purchase if she could transact the business in a personal interview, so
10016: she would walk with Tom to St Ogg’s that morning; and when Tom urged
10017: that she might let the pickles be at present,—he didn’t like her to go
10018: about just yet,—she appeared so hurt at this conduct in her son,
10019: contradicting her about pickles which she had made after the family
10020: receipts inherited from his own grandmother, who had died when his
10021: mother was a little girl, that he gave way, and they walked together
10022: until she turned toward Danish Street, where Mr Hyndmarsh retailed his
10023: grocery, not far from the offices of Mr Wakem.
10024: 
10025: That gentleman was not yet come to his office; would Mrs Tulliver sit
10026: down by the fire in his private room and wait for him? She had not long
10027: to wait before the punctual attorney entered, knitting his brow with an
10028: examining glance at the stout blond woman who rose, curtsying
10029: deferentially,—a tallish man, with an aquiline nose and abundant
10030: iron-gray hair. You have never seen Mr Wakem before, and are possibly
10031: wondering whether he was really as eminent a rascal, and as crafty,
10032: bitter an enemy of honest humanity in general, and of Mr Tulliver in
10033: particular, as he is represented to be in that eidolon or portrait of
10034: him which we have seen to exist in the miller’s mind.
10035: 
10036: It is clear that the irascible miller was a man to interpret any
10037: chance-shot that grazed him as an attempt on his own life, and was
10038: liable to entanglements in this puzzling world, which, due
10039: consideration had to his own infallibility, required the hypothesis of
10040: a very active diabolical agency to explain them. It is still possible
10041: to believe that the attorney was not more guilty toward him than an
10042: ingenious machine, which performs its work with much regularity, is
10043: guilty toward the rash man who, venturing too near it, is caught up by
10044: some fly-wheel or other, and suddenly converted into unexpected
10045: mince-meat.
10046: 
10047: But it is really impossible to decide this question by a glance at his
10048: person; the lines and lights of the human countenance are like other
10049: symbols,—not always easy to read without a key. On an _a priori_ view
10050: of Wakem’s aquiline nose, which offended Mr Tulliver, there was not
10051: more rascality than in the shape of his stiff shirt-collar, though this
10052: too along with his nose, might have become fraught with damnatory
10053: meaning when once the rascality was ascertained.
10054: 
10055: “Mrs Tulliver, I think?” said Mr Wakem.
10056: 
10057: “Yes, sir; Miss Elizabeth Dodson as was.”
10058: 
10059: “Pray be seated. You have some business with me?”
10060: 
10061: “Well, sir, yes,” said Mrs Tulliver, beginning to feel alarmed at her
10062: own courage, now she was really in presence of the formidable man, and
10063: reflecting that she had not settled with herself how she should begin.
10064: Mr Wakem felt in his waistcoat pockets, and looked at her in silence.
10065: 
10066: “I hope, sir,” she began at last,—“I hope, sir, you’re not a-thinking
10067: as _I_ bear you any ill-will because o’ my husband’s losing his
10068: lawsuit, and the bailies being put in, and the linen being sold,—oh
10069: dear!—for I wasn’t brought up in that way. I’m sure you remember my
10070: father, sir, for he was close friends with Squire Darleigh, and we
10071: allays went to the dances there, the Miss Dodsons,—nobody could be more
10072: looked on,—and justly, for there was four of us, and you’re quite aware
10073: as Mrs Glegg and Mrs Deane are my sisters. And as for going to law and
10074: losing money, and having sales before you’re dead, I never saw anything
10075: o’ that before I was married, nor for a long while after. And I’m not
10076: to be answerable for my bad luck i’ marrying out o’ my own family into
10077: one where the goings-on was different. And as for being drawn in t’
10078: abuse you as other folks abuse you, sir, _that_ I niver was, and nobody
10079: can say it of me.”
10080: 
10081: Mrs Tulliver shook her head a little, and looked at the hem of her
10082: pocket handkerchief.
10083: 
10084: “I’ve no doubt of what you say, Mrs Tulliver,” said Mr Wakem, with cold
10085: politeness. “But you have some question to ask me?”
10086: 
10087: “Well, sir, yes. But that’s what I’ve said to myself,—I’ve said you’d
10088: had some nat’ral feeling; and as for my husband, as hasn’t been himself
10089: for this two months, I’m not a-defending him, in no way, for being so
10090: hot about th’ erigation,—not but what there’s worse men, for he never
10091: wronged nobody of a shilling nor a penny, not willingly; and as for his
10092: fieriness and lawing, what could I do? And him struck as if it was with
10093: death when he got the letter as said you’d the hold upo’ the land. But
10094: I can’t believe but what you’ll behave as a gentleman.”
10095: 
10096: “What does all this mean, Mrs Tulliver?” said Mr Wakem rather sharply.
10097: “What do you want to ask me?”
10098: 
10099: “Why, sir, if you’ll be so good,” said Mrs Tulliver, starting a little,
10100: and speaking more hurriedly,—“if you’ll be so good not to buy the mill
10101: an’ the land,—the land wouldn’t so much matter, only my husband ull’ be
10102: like mad at your having it.”
10103: 
10104: Something like a new thought flashed across Mr Wakem’s face as he said,
10105: “Who told you I meant to buy it?”
10106: 
10107: “Why, sir, it’s none o’ my inventing, and I should never ha’ thought of
10108: it; for my husband, as ought to know about the law, he allays used to
10109: say as lawyers had never no call to buy anything,—either lands or
10110: houses,—for they allays got ’em into their hands other ways. An’ I
10111: should think that ’ud be the way with you, sir; and I niver said as
10112: you’d be the man to do contrairy to that.”
10113: 
10114: “Ah, well, who was it that _did_ say so?” said Wakem, opening his desk,
10115: and moving things about, with the accompaniment of an almost inaudible
10116: whistle.
10117: 
10118: “Why, sir, it was Mr Glegg and Mr Deane, as have all the management;
10119: and Mr Deane thinks as Guest &Co. ’ud buy the mill and let Mr Tulliver
10120: work it for ’em, if you didn’t bid for it and raise the price. And it
10121: ’ud be such a thing for my husband to stay where he is, if he could get
10122: his living: for it was his father’s before him, the mill was, and his
10123: grandfather built it, though I wasn’t fond o’ the noise of it, when
10124: first I was married, for there was no mills in our family,—not the
10125: Dodson’s,—and if I’d known as the mills had so much to do with the law,
10126: it wouldn’t have been me as ’ud have been the first Dodson to marry
10127: one; but I went into it blindfold, that I did, erigation and
10128: everything.”
10129: 
10130: “What! Guest &Co. would keep the mill in their own hands, I suppose,
10131: and pay your husband wages?”
10132: 
10133: “Oh dear, sir, it’s hard to think of,” said poor Mrs Tulliver, a little
10134: tear making its way, “as my husband should take wage. But it ’ud look
10135: more like what used to be, to stay at the mill than to go anywhere
10136: else; and if you’ll only think—if you was to bid for the mill and buy
10137: it, my husband might be struck worse than he was before, and niver get
10138: better again as he’s getting now.”
10139: 
10140: “Well, but if I bought the mill, and allowed your husband to act as my
10141: manager in the same way, how then?” said Mr Wakem.
10142: 
10143: “Oh, sir, I doubt he could niver be got to do it, not if the very mill
10144: stood still to beg and pray of him. For your name’s like poison to him,
10145: it’s so as never was; and he looks upon it as you’ve been the ruin of
10146: him all along, ever since you set the law on him about the road through
10147: the meadow,—that’s eight year ago, and he’s been going on ever since—as
10148: I’ve allays told him he was wrong——”
10149: 
10150: “He’s a pig-headed, foul-mouthed fool!” burst out Mr Wakem, forgetting
10151: himself.
10152: 
10153: “Oh dear, sir!” said Mrs Tulliver, frightened at a result so different
10154: from the one she had fixed her mind on; “I wouldn’t wish to contradict
10155: you, but it’s like enough he’s changed his mind with this illness,—he’s
10156: forgot a many things he used to talk about. And you wouldn’t like to
10157: have a corpse on your mind, if he was to die; and they _do_ say as it’s
10158: allays unlucky when Dorlcote Mill changes hands, and the water might
10159: all run away, and _then_—not as I’m wishing you any ill-luck, sir, for
10160: I forgot to tell you as I remember your wedding as if it was yesterday;
10161: Mrs Wakem was a Miss Clint, I know _that;_ and my boy, as there isn’t a
10162: nicer, handsomer, straighter boy nowhere, went to school with your
10163: son——”
10164: 
10165: Mr Wakem rose, opened the door, and called to one of his clerks.
10166: 
10167: “You must excuse me for interrupting you, Mrs Tulliver; I have business
10168: that must be attended to; and I think there is nothing more necessary
10169: to be said.”
10170: 
10171: “But if you _would_ bear it in mind, sir,” said Mrs Tulliver, rising,
10172: “and not run against me and my children; and I’m not denying Mr
10173: Tulliver’s been in the wrong, but he’s been punished enough, and
10174: there’s worse men, for it’s been giving to other folks has been his
10175: fault. He’s done nobody any harm but himself and his family,—the more’s
10176: the pity,—and I go and look at the bare shelves every day, and think
10177: where all my things used to stand.”
10178: 
10179: “Yes, yes, I’ll bear it in mind,” said Mr Wakem, hastily, looking
10180: toward the open door.
10181: 
10182: “And if you’d please not to say as I’ve been to speak to you, for my
10183: son ’ud be very angry with me for demeaning myself, I know he would,
10184: and I’ve trouble enough without being scolded by my children.”
10185: 
10186: Poor Mrs Tulliver’s voice trembled a little, and she could make no
10187: answer to the attorney’s “good morning,” but curtsied and walked out in
10188: silence.
10189: 
10190: “Which day is it that Dorlcote Mill is to be sold? Where’s the bill?”
10191: said Mr Wakem to his clerk when they were alone.
10192: 
10193: “Next Friday is the day,—Friday at six o’clock.”
10194: 
10195: “Oh, just run to Winship’s the auctioneer, and see if he’s at home. I
10196: have some business for him; ask him to come up.”
10197: 
10198: Although, when Mr Wakem entered his office that morning, he had had no
10199: intention of purchasing Dorlcote Mill, his mind was already made up.
10200: Mrs Tulliver had suggested to him several determining motives, and his
10201: mental glance was very rapid; he was one of those men who can be prompt
10202: without being rash, because their motives run in fixed tracks, and they
10203: have no need to reconcile conflicting aims.
10204: 
10205: To suppose that Wakem had the same sort of inveterate hatred toward
10206: Tulliver that Tulliver had toward him would be like supposing that a
10207: pike and a roach can look at each other from a similar point of view.
10208: The roach necessarily abhors the mode in which the pike gets his
10209: living, and the pike is likely to think nothing further even of the
10210: most indignant roach than that he is excellent good eating; it could
10211: only be when the roach choked him that the pike could entertain a
10212: strong personal animosity. If Mr Tulliver had ever seriously injured or
10213: thwarted the attorney, Wakem would not have refused him the distinction
10214: of being a special object of his vindictiveness. But when Mr Tulliver
10215: called Wakem a rascal at the market dinner-table, the attorneys’
10216: clients were not a whit inclined to withdraw their business from him;
10217: and if, when Wakem himself happened to be present, some jocose
10218: cattle-feeder, stimulated by opportunity and brandy, made a thrust at
10219: him by alluding to old ladies’ wills, he maintained perfect _sang
10220: froid_, and knew quite well that the majority of substantial men then
10221: present were perfectly contented with the fact that “Wakem was Wakem”;
10222: that is to say, a man who always knew the stepping-stones that would
10223: carry him through very muddy bits of practice. A man who had made a
10224: large fortune, had a handsome house among the trees at Tofton, and
10225: decidedly the finest stock of port-wine in the neighbourhood of St
10226: Ogg’s, was likely to feel himself on a level with public opinion. And I
10227: am not sure that even honest Mr Tulliver himself, with his general view
10228: of law as a cockpit, might not, under opposite circumstances, have seen
10229: a fine appropriateness in the truth that “Wakem was Wakem”; since I
10230: have understood from persons versed in history, that mankind is not
10231: disposed to look narrowly into the conduct of great victors when their
10232: victory is on the right side. Tulliver, then, could be no obstruction
10233: to Wakem; on the contrary, he was a poor devil whom the lawyer had
10234: defeated several times; a hot-tempered fellow, who would always give
10235: you a handle against him. Wakem’s conscience was not uneasy because he
10236: had used a few tricks against the miller; why should he hate that
10237: unsuccessful plaintiff, that pitiable, furious bull entangled in the
10238: meshes of a net?
10239: 
10240: Still, among the various excesses to which human nature is subject,
10241: moralists have never numbered that of being too fond of the people who
10242: openly revile us. The successful Yellow candidate for the borough of
10243: Old Topping, perhaps, feels no pursuant meditative hatred toward the
10244: Blue editor who consoles his subscribers with vituperative rhetoric
10245: against Yellow men who sell their country, and are the demons of
10246: private life; but he might not be sorry, if law and opportunity
10247: favoured, to kick that Blue editor to a deeper shade of his favourite
10248: colour. Prosperous men take a little vengeance now and then, as they
10249: take a diversion, when it comes easily in their way, and is no
10250: hindrance to business; and such small unimpassioned revenges have an
10251: enormous effect in life, running through all degrees of pleasant
10252: infliction, blocking the fit men out of places, and blackening
10253: characters in unpremeditated talk. Still more, to see people who have
10254: been only insignificantly offensive to us reduced in life and
10255: humiliated, without any special effort of ours, is apt to have a
10256: soothing, flattering influence. Providence or some other prince of this
10257: world, it appears, has undertaken the task of retribution for us; and
10258: really, by an agreeable constitution of things, our enemies somehow
10259: _don’t_ prosper.
10260: 
10261: Wakem was not without this parenthetic vindictiveness toward the
10262: uncomplimentary miller; and now Mrs Tulliver had put the notion into
10263: his head, it presented itself to him as a pleasure to do the very thing
10264: that would cause Mr Tulliver the most deadly mortification,—and a
10265: pleasure of a complex kind, not made up of crude malice, but mingling
10266: with it the relish of self-approbation. To see an enemy humiliated
10267: gives a certain contentment, but this is jejune compared with the
10268: highly blent satisfaction of seeing him humiliated by your benevolent
10269: action or concession on his behalf. That is a sort of revenge which
10270: falls into the scale of virtue, and Wakem was not without an intention
10271: of keeping that scale respectably filled. He had once had the pleasure
10272: of putting an old enemy of his into one of the St Ogg’s alms-houses, to
10273: the rebuilding of which he had given a large subscription; and here was
10274: an opportunity of providing for another by making him his own servant.
10275: Such things give a completeness to prosperity, and contribute elements
10276: of agreeable consciousness that are not dreamed of by that
10277: short-sighted, overheated vindictiveness which goes out its way to
10278: wreak itself in direct injury. And Tulliver, with his rough tongue
10279: filed by a sense of obligation, would make a better servant than any
10280: chance-fellow who was cap-in-hand for a situation. Tulliver was known
10281: to be a man of proud honesty, and Wakem was too acute not to believe in
10282: the existence of honesty. He was given to observing individuals, not
10283: to judging of them according to maxims, and no one knew better than he
10284: that all men were not like himself. Besides, he intended to overlook
10285: the whole business of land and mill pretty closely; he was fond of
10286: these practical rural matters. But there were good reasons for
10287: purchasing Dorlcote Mill, quite apart from any benevolent vengeance on
10288: the miller. It was really a capital investment; besides, Guest &Co.
10289: were going to bid for it. Mr Guest and Mr Wakem were on friendly dining
10290: terms, and the attorney liked to predominate over a ship-owner and
10291: mill-owner who was a little too loud in the town affairs as well as in
10292: his table-talk. For Wakem was not a mere man of business; he was
10293: considered a pleasant fellow in the upper circles of St Ogg’s—chatted
10294: amusingly over his port-wine, did a little amateur farming, and had
10295: certainly been an excellent husband and father; at church, when he went
10296: there, he sat under the handsomest of mural monuments erected to the
10297: memory of his wife. Most men would have married again under his
10298: circumstances, but he was said to be more tender to his deformed son
10299: than most men were to their best-shapen offspring. Not that Mr Wakem
10300: had not other sons beside Philip; but toward them he held only a
10301: chiaroscuro parentage, and provided for them in a grade of life duly
10302: beneath his own. In this fact, indeed, there lay the clenching motive
10303: to the purchase of Dorlcote Mill. While Mrs Tulliver was talking, it
10304: had occurred to the rapid-minded lawyer, among all the other
10305: circumstances of the case, that this purchase would, in a few years to
10306: come, furnish a highly suitable position for a certain favourite lad
10307: whom he meant to bring on in the world.
10308: 
10309: These were the mental conditions on which Mrs Tulliver had undertaken
10310: to act persuasively, and had failed; a fact which may receive some
10311: illustration from the remark of a great philosopher, that fly-fishers
10312: fail in preparing their bait so as to make it alluring in the right
10313: quarter, for want of a due acquaintance with the subjectivity of
10314: fishes.

10316: 
10317: Chapter VIII.
10318: 
10319: Daylight on the Wreck
10320: 
10321: It was a clear frosty January day on which Mr Tulliver first came
10322: downstairs. The bright sun on the chestnut boughs and the roofs
10323: opposite his window had made him impatiently declare that he would be
10324: caged up no longer; he thought everywhere would be more cheery under
10325: this sunshine than his bedroom; for he knew nothing of the bareness
10326: below, which made the flood of sunshine importunate, as if it had an
10327: unfeeling pleasure in showing the empty places, and the marks where
10328: well-known objects once had been. The impression on his mind that it
10329: was but yesterday when he received the letter from Mr Gore was so
10330: continually implied in his talk, and the attempts to convey to him the
10331: idea that many weeks had passed and much had happened since then had
10332: been so soon swept away by recurrent forgetfulness, that even Mr
10333: Turnbull had begun to despair of preparing him to meet the facts by
10334: previous knowledge. The full sense of the present could only be
10335: imparted gradually by new experience,—not by mere words, which must
10336: remain weaker than the impressions left by the _old_ experience. This
10337: resolution to come downstairs was heard with trembling by the wife and
10338: children. Mrs Tulliver said Tom must not go to St Ogg’s at the usual
10339: hour, he must wait and see his father downstairs; and Tom complied,
10340: though with an intense inward shrinking from the painful scene. The
10341: hearts of all three had been more deeply dejected than ever during the
10342: last few days. For Guest &Co. had not bought the mill; both mill and
10343: land had been knocked down to Wakem, who had been over the premises,
10344: and had laid before Mr Deane and Mr Glegg, in Mrs Tulliver’s presence,
10345: his willingness to employ Mr Tulliver, in case of his recovery, as a
10346: manager of the business. This proposition had occasioned much family
10347: debating. Uncles and aunts were almost unanimously of opinion that such
10348: an offer ought not to be rejected when there was nothing in the way but
10349: a feeling in Mr Tulliver’s mind, which, as neither aunts nor uncles
10350: shared it, was regarded as entirely unreasonable and childish,—indeed,
10351: as a transferring toward Wakem of that indignation and hatred which Mr
10352: Tulliver ought properly to have directed against himself for his
10353: general quarrelsomeness, and his special exhibition of it in going to
10354: law. Here was an opportunity for Mr Tulliver to provide for his wife
10355: and daughter without any assistance from his wife’s relations, and
10356: without that too evident descent into pauperism which makes it annoying
10357: to respectable people to meet the degraded member of the family by the
10358: wayside. Mr Tulliver, Mrs Glegg considered, must be made to feel, when
10359: he came to his right mind, that he could never humble himself enough;
10360: for _that_ had come which she had always foreseen would come of his
10361: insolence in time past “to them as were the best friends he’d got to
10362: look to.” Mr Glegg and Mr Deane were less stern in their views, but
10363: they both of them thought Tulliver had done enough harm by his
10364: hot-tempered crotchets and ought to put them out of the question when a
10365: livelihood was offered him; Wakem showed a right feeling about the
10366: matter,—_he_ had no grudge against Tulliver.
10367: 
10368: Tom had protested against entertaining the proposition. He shouldn’t
10369: like his father to be under Wakem; he thought it would look
10370: mean-spirited; but his mother’s main distress was the utter
10371: impossibility of ever “turning Mr Tulliver round about Wakem,” or
10372: getting him to hear reason; no, they would all have to go and live in a
10373: pigsty on purpose to spite Wakem, who spoke “so as nobody could be
10374: fairer.” Indeed, Mrs Tulliver’s mind was reduced to such confusion by
10375: living in this strange medium of unaccountable sorrow, against which
10376: she continually appealed by asking, “Oh dear, what _have_ I done to
10377: deserve worse than other women?” that Maggie began to suspect her poor
10378: mother’s wits were quite going.
10379: 
10380: “Tom,” she said, when they were out of their father’s room together,
10381: “we _must_ try to make father understand a little of what has happened
10382: before he goes downstairs. But we must get my mother away. She will say
10383: something that will do harm. Ask Kezia to fetch her down, and keep her
10384: engaged with something in the kitchen.”
10385: 
10386: Kezia was equal to the task. Having declared her intention of staying
10387: till the master could get about again, “wage or no wage,” she had found
10388: a certain recompense in keeping a strong hand over her mistress,
10389: scolding her for “moithering” herself, and going about all day without
10390: changing her cap, and looking as if she was “mushed.” Altogether, this
10391: time of trouble was rather a Saturnalian time to Kezia; she could scold
10392: her betters with unreproved freedom. On this particular occasion there
10393: were drying clothes to be fetched in; she wished to know if one pair of
10394: hands could do everything in-doors and out, and observed that _she_
10395: should have thought it would be good for Mrs Tulliver to put on her
10396: bonnet, and get a breath of fresh air by doing that needful piece of
10397: work. Poor Mrs Tulliver went submissively downstairs; to be ordered
10398: about by a servant was the last remnant of her household dignities,—she
10399: would soon have no servant to scold her. Mr Tulliver was resting in his
10400: chair a little after the fatigue of dressing, and Maggie and Tom were
10401: seated near him, when Luke entered to ask if he should help master
10402: downstairs.
10403: 
10404: “Ay, ay, Luke; stop a bit, sit down,” said Mr Tulliver pointing his
10405: stick toward a chair, and looking at him with that pursuant gaze which
10406: convalescent persons often have for those who have tended them,
10407: reminding one of an infant gazing about after its nurse. For Luke had
10408: been a constant night-watcher by his master’s bed.
10409: 
10410: “How’s the water now, eh, Luke?” said Mr Tulliver. “Dix hasn’t been
10411: choking you up again, eh?”
10412: 
10413: “No, sir, it’s all right.”
10414: 
10415: “Ay, I thought not; he won’t be in a hurry at that again, now Riley’s
10416: been to settle him. That was what I said to Riley yesterday—I said——”
10417: 
10418: Mr Tulliver leaned forward, resting his elbows on the armchair, and
10419: looking on the ground as if in search of something, striving after
10420: vanishing images like a man struggling against a doze. Maggie looked at
10421: Tom in mute distress, their father’s mind was so far off the present,
10422: which would by-and-by thrust itself on his wandering consciousness! Tom
10423: was almost ready to rush away, with that impatience of painful emotion
10424: which makes one of the differences between youth and maiden, man and
10425: woman.
10426: 
10427: “Father,” said Maggie, laying her hand on his, “don’t you remember that
10428: Mr Riley is dead?”
10429: 
10430: “Dead?” said Mr Tulliver, sharply, looking in her face with a strange,
10431: examining glance.
10432: 
10433: “Yes, he died of apoplexy nearly a year ago. I remember hearing you say
10434: you had to pay money for him; and he left his daughters badly off; one
10435: of them is under-teacher at Miss Firniss’s, where I’ve been to school,
10436: you know.”
10437: 
10438: “Ah?” said her father, doubtfully, still looking in her face. But as
10439: soon as Tom began to speak he turned to look at _him_ with the same
10440: inquiring glances, as if he were rather surprised at the presence of
10441: these two young people. Whenever his mind was wandering in the far
10442: past, he fell into this oblivion of their actual faces; they were not
10443: those of the lad and the little wench who belonged to that past.
10444: 
10445: “It’s a long while since you had the dispute with Dix, father,” said
10446: Tom. “I remember your talking about it three years ago, before I went
10447: to school at Mr Stelling’s. I’ve been at school there three years;
10448: don’t you remember?”
10449: 
10450: Mr Tulliver threw himself backward again, losing the childlike outward
10451: glance under a rush of new ideas, which diverted him from external
10452: impressions.
10453: 
10454: “Ay, ay,” he said, after a minute or two, “I’ve paid a deal o’ money—I
10455: was determined my son should have a good eddication; I’d none myself,
10456: and I’ve felt the miss of it. And he’ll want no other fortin, that’s
10457: what I say—if Wakem was to get the better of me again——”
10458: 
10459: The thought of Wakem roused new vibrations, and after a moment’s pause
10460: he began to look at the coat he had on, and to feel in his side-pocket.
10461: Then he turned to Tom, and said in his old sharp way, “Where have they
10462: put Gore’s letter?”
10463: 
10464: It was close at hand in a drawer, for he had often asked for it before.
10465: 
10466: “You know what there is in the letter, father?” said Tom, as he gave it
10467: to him.
10468: 
10469: “To be sure I do,” said Mr Tulliver, rather angrily. “What o’ that? If
10470: Furley can’t take to the property, somebody else can; there’s plenty o’
10471: people in the world besides Furley. But it’s hindering—my not being
10472: well—go and tell ’em to get the horse in the gig, Luke; I can get down
10473: to St Ogg’s well enough—Gore’s expecting me.”
10474: 
10475: “No, dear father!” Maggie burst out entreatingly; “it’s a very long
10476: while since all that; you’ve been ill a great many weeks,—more than two
10477: months; everything is changed.”
10478: 
10479: Mr Tulliver looked at them all three alternately with a startled gaze;
10480: the idea that much had happened of which he knew nothing had often
10481: transiently arrested him before, but it came upon him now with entire
10482: novelty.
10483: 
10484: “Yes, father,” said Tom, in answer to the gaze. “You needn’t trouble
10485: your mind about business until you are quite well; everything is
10486: settled about that for the present,—about the mill and the land and the
10487: debts.”
10488: 
10489: “What’s settled, then?” said his father, angrily.
10490: 
10491: “Don’t you take on too much bout it, sir,” said Luke. “You’d ha’ paid
10492: iverybody if you could,—that’s what I said to Master Tom,—I said you’d
10493: ha’ paid iverybody if you could.”
10494: 
10495: Good Luke felt, after the manner of contented hard-working men whose
10496: lives have been spent in servitude, that sense of natural fitness in
10497: rank which made his master’s downfall a tragedy to him. He was urged,
10498: in his slow way, to say something that would express his share in the
10499: family sorrow; and these words, which he had used over and over again
10500: to Tom when he wanted to decline the full payment of his fifty pounds
10501: out of the children’s money, were the most ready to his tongue. They
10502: were just the words to lay the most painful hold on his master’s
10503: bewildered mind.
10504: 
10505: “Paid everybody?” he said, with vehement agitation, his face flushing,
10506: and his eye lighting up. “Why—what—have they made me a _bankrupt?_”
10507: 
10508: “Oh, father, dear father!” said Maggie, who thought that terrible word
10509: really represented the fact; “bear it well, because we love you; your
10510: children will always love you. Tom will pay them all; he says he will,
10511: when he’s a man.”
10512: 
10513: She felt her father beginning to tremble; his voice trembled too, as he
10514: said, after a few moments:
10515: 
10516: “Ay, my little wench, but I shall never live twice o’er.”
10517: 
10518: “But perhaps you will live to see me pay everybody, father,” said Tom,
10519: speaking with a great effort.
10520: 
10521: “Ah, my lad,” said Mr Tulliver, shaking his head slowly, “but what’s
10522: broke can never be whole again; it ’ud be your doing, not mine.” Then
10523: looking up at him, “You’re only sixteen; it’s an up-hill fight for you,
10524: but you mustn’t throw it at your father; the raskills have been too
10525: many for him. I’ve given you a good eddication,—that’ll start you.”
10526: 
10527: Something in his throat half choked the last words; the flush, which
10528: had alarmed his children because it had so often preceded a recurrence
10529: of paralysis, had subsided, and his face looked pale and tremulous. Tom
10530: said nothing; he was still struggling against his inclination to rush
10531: away. His father remained quiet a minute or two, but his mind did not
10532: seem to be wandering again.
10533: 
10534: “Have they sold me up, then?” he said more calmly, as if he were
10535: possessed simply by the desire to know what had happened.
10536: 
10537: “Everything is sold, father; but we don’t know all about the mill and
10538: the land yet,” said Tom, anxious to ward off any question leading to
10539: the fact that Wakem was the purchaser.
10540: 
10541: “You must not be surprised to see the room look very bare downstairs,
10542: father,” said Maggie; “but there’s your chair and the bureau; _they’re_
10543: not gone.”
10544: 
10545: “Let us go; help me down, Luke,—I’ll go and see everything,” said Mr
10546: Tulliver, leaning on his stick, and stretching out his other hand
10547: toward Luke.
10548: 
10549: “Ay, sir,” said Luke, as he gave his arm to his master, “you’ll make up
10550: your mind to’t a bit better when you’ve seen iverything; you’ll get
10551: used to’t. That’s what my mother says about her shortness o’
10552: breath,—she says she’s made friends wi’t now, though she fought again’
10553: it sore when it just come on.”
10554: 
10555: Maggie ran on before to see that all was right in the dreary parlour,
10556: where the fire, dulled by the frosty sunshine, seemed part of the
10557: general shabbiness. She turned her father’s chair, and pushed aside the
10558: table to make an easy way for him, and then stood with a beating heart
10559: to see him enter and look round for the first time. Tom advanced before
10560: him, carrying the leg-rest, and stood beside Maggie on the hearth. Of
10561: those two young hearts Tom’s suffered the most unmixed pain, for
10562: Maggie, with all her keen susceptibility, yet felt as if the sorrow
10563: made larger room for her love to flow in, and gave breathing-space to
10564: her passionate nature. No true boy feels that; he would rather go and
10565: slay the Nemean lion, or perform any round of heroic labours, than
10566: endure perpetual appeals to his pity, for evils over which he can make
10567: no conquest.
10568: 
10569: Mr Tulliver paused just inside the door, resting on Luke, and looking
10570: round him at all the bare places, which for him were filled with the
10571: shadows of departed objects,—the daily companions of his life. His
10572: faculties seemed to be renewing their strength from getting a footing
10573: on this demonstration of the senses.
10574: 
10575: “Ah!” he said slowly, moving toward his chair, “they’ve sold me
10576: up—they’ve sold me up.”
10577: 
10578: Then seating himself, and laying down his stick, while Luke left the
10579: room, he looked round again.
10580: 
10581: “They’ve left the big Bible,” he said. “It’s got everything in,—when I
10582: was born and married; bring it me, Tom.”
10583: 
10584: The quarto Bible was laid open before him at the fly-leaf, and while he
10585: was reading with slowly travelling eyes Mrs Tulliver entered the room,
10586: but stood in mute surprise to find her husband down already, and with
10587: the great Bible before him.
10588: 
10589: “Ah,” he said, looking at a spot where his finger rested, “my mother
10590: was Margaret Beaton; she died when she was forty-seven,—hers wasn’t a
10591: long-lived family; we’re our mother’s children, Gritty and me are,—we
10592: shall go to our last bed before long.”
10593: 
10594: He seemed to be pausing over the record of his sister’s birth and
10595: marriage, as if it were suggesting new thoughts to him; then he
10596: suddenly looked up at Tom, and said, in a sharp tone of alarm:
10597: 
10598: “They haven’t come upo’ Moss for the money as I lent him, have they?”
10599: 
10600: “No, father,” said Tom; “the note was burnt.”
10601: 
10602: Mr Tulliver turned his eyes on the page again, and presently said:
10603: 
10604: “Ah—Elizabeth Dodson—it’s eighteen year since I married her——”
10605: 
10606: “Come next Ladyday,” said Mrs Tulliver, going up to his side and
10607: looking at the page.
10608: 
10609: Her husband fixed his eyes earnestly on her face.
10610: 
10611: “Poor Bessy,” he said, “you was a pretty lass then,—everybody said
10612: so,—and I used to think you kept your good looks rarely. But you’re
10613: sorely aged; don’t you bear me ill-will—I meant to do well by you—we
10614: promised one another for better or for worse——”
10615: 
10616: “But I never thought it ’ud be so for worse as this,” said poor Mrs
10617: Tulliver, with the strange, scared look that had come over her of late;
10618: “and my poor father gave me away—and to come on so all at once——”
10619: 
10620: “Oh, mother!” said Maggie, “don’t talk in that way.”
10621: 
10622: “No, I know you won’t let your poor mother speak—that’s been the way
10623: all my life—your father never minded what I said—it ’ud have been o’ no
10624: use for me to beg and pray—and it ’ud be no use now, not if I was to go
10625: down o’ my hands and knees——”
10626: 
10627: “Don’t say so, Bessy,” said Mr Tulliver, whose pride, in these first
10628: moments of humiliation, was in abeyance to the sense of some justice in
10629: his wife’s reproach. “If there’s anything left as I could do to make
10630: you amends, I wouldn’t say you nay.”
10631: 
10632: “Then we might stay here and get a living, and I might keep among my
10633: own sisters,—and me been such a good wife to you, and never crossed you
10634: from week’s end to week’s end—and they all say so—they say it ’ud be
10635: nothing but right, only you’re so turned against Wakem.”
10636: 
10637: “Mother,” said Tom, severely, “this is not the time to talk about
10638: that.”
10639: 
10640: “Let her be,” said Mr Tulliver. “Say what you mean, Bessy.”
10641: 
10642: “Why, now the mill and the land’s all Wakem’s, and he’s got everything
10643: in his hands, what’s the use o’ setting your face against him, when he
10644: says you may stay here, and speaks as fair as can be, and says you may
10645: manage the business, and have thirty shillings a-week, and a horse to
10646: ride about to market? And where have we got to put our heads? We must
10647: go into one o’ the cottages in the village,—and me and my children
10648: brought down to that,—and all because you must set your mind against
10649: folks till there’s no turning you.”
10650: 
10651: Mr Tulliver had sunk back in his chair trembling.
10652: 
10653: “You may do as you like wi’ me, Bessy,” he said, in a low voice; “I’ve
10654: been the bringing of you to poverty—this world’s too many for me—I’m
10655: nought but a bankrupt; it’s no use standing up for anything now.”
10656: 
10657: “Father,” said Tom, “I don’t agree with my mother or my uncles, and I
10658: don’t think you ought to submit to be under Wakem. I get a pound a-week
10659: now, and you can find something else to do when you get well.”
10660: 
10661: “Say no more, Tom, say no more; I’ve had enough for this day. Give me a
10662: kiss, Bessy, and let us bear one another no ill-will; we shall never be
10663: young again—this world’s been too many for me.”
10664: 
10665: 
10666: Chapter IX.
10667: 
10668: An Item Added to the Family Register
10669: 
10670: That first moment of renunciation and submission was followed by days
10671: of violent struggle in the miller’s mind, as the gradual access of
10672: bodily strength brought with it increasing ability to embrace in one
10673: view all the conflicting conditions under which he found himself.
10674: Feeble limbs easily resign themselves to be tethered, and when we are
10675: subdued by sickness it seems possible to us to fulfil pledges which the
10676: old vigor comes back and breaks. There were times when poor Tulliver
10677: thought the fulfilment of his promise to Bessy was something quite too
10678: hard for human nature; he had promised her without knowing what she was
10679: going to say,—she might as well have asked him to carry a ton weight on
10680: his back. But again, there were many feelings arguing on her side,
10681: besides the sense that life had been made hard to her by having married
10682: him. He saw a possibility, by much pinching, of saving money out of his
10683: salary toward paying a second dividend to his creditors, and it would
10684: not be easy elsewhere to get a situation such as he could fill.
10685: 
10686: He had led an easy life, ordering much and working little, and had no
10687: aptitude for any new business. He must perhaps take to day-labour, and
10688: his wife must have help from her sisters,—a prospect doubly bitter to
10689: him, now they had let all Bessy’s precious things be sold, probably
10690: because they liked to set her against him, by making her feel that he
10691: had brought her to that pass. He listened to their admonitory talk,
10692: when they came to urge on him what he was bound to do for poor Bessy’s
10693: sake, with averted eyes, that every now and then flashed on them
10694: furtively when their backs were turned. Nothing but the dread of
10695: needing their help could have made it an easier alternative to take
10696: their advice.
10697: 
10698: But the strongest influence of all was the love of the old premises
10699: where he had run about when he was a boy, just as Tom had done after
10700: him. The Tullivers had lived on this spot for generations, and he had
10701: sat listening on a low stool on winter evenings while his father talked
10702: of the old half-timbered mill that had been there before the last great
10703: floods which damaged it so that his grandfather pulled it down and
10704: built the new one. It was when he got able to walk about and look at
10705: all the old objects that he felt the strain of his clinging affection
10706: for the old home as part of his life, part of himself. He couldn’t bear
10707: to think of himself living on any other spot than this, where he knew
10708: the sound of every gate door, and felt that the shape and colour of
10709: every roof and weather-stain and broken hillock was good, because his
10710: growing senses had been fed on them. Our instructed vagrancy, which has
10711: hardly time to linger by the hedgerows, but runs away early to the
10712: tropics, and is at home with palms and banyans,—which is nourished on
10713: books of travel and stretches the theatre of its imagination to the
10714: Zambesi,—can hardly get a dim notion of what an old-fashioned man like
10715: Tulliver felt for this spot, where all his memories centred, and where
10716: life seemed like a familiar smooth-handled tool that the fingers clutch
10717: with loving ease. And just now he was living in that freshened memory
10718: of the far-off time which comes to us in the passive hours of recovery
10719: from sickness.
10720: 
10721: “Ay, Luke,” he said one afternoon, as he stood looking over the orchard
10722: gate, “I remember the day they planted those apple-trees. My father was
10723: a huge man for planting,—it was like a merry-making to him to get a
10724: cart full o’ young trees; and I used to stand i’ the cold with him, and
10725: follow him about like a dog.”
10726: 
10727: Then he turned round, and leaning against the gate-post, looked at the
10728: opposite buildings.
10729: 
10730: “The old mill ’ud miss me, I think, Luke. There’s a story as when the
10731: mill changes hands, the river’s angry; I’ve heard my father say it many
10732: a time. There’s no telling whether there mayn’t be summat _in_ the
10733: story, for this is a puzzling world, and Old Harry’s got a finger in
10734: it—it’s been too many for me, I know.”
10735: 
10736: “Ay, sir,” said Luke, with soothing sympathy, “what wi’ the rust on the
10737: wheat, an’ the firin’ o’ the ricks an’ that, as I’ve seen i’ my
10738: time,—things often looks comical; there’s the bacon fat wi’ our last
10739: pig run away like butter,—it leaves nought but a scratchin’.”
10740: 
10741: “It’s just as if it was yesterday, now,” Mr Tulliver went on, “when my
10742: father began the malting. I remember, the day they finished the
10743: malt-house, I thought summat great was to come of it; for we’d a
10744: plum-pudding that day and a bit of a feast, and I said to my
10745: mother,—she was a fine dark-eyed woman, my mother was,—the little wench
10746: ’ull be as like her as two peas.” Here Mr Tulliver put his stick
10747: between his legs, and took out his snuff-box, for the greater enjoyment
10748: of this anecdote, which dropped from him in fragments, as if he every
10749: other moment lost narration in vision. “I was a little chap no higher
10750: much than my mother’s knee,—she was sore fond of us children, Gritty
10751: and me,—and so I said to her, ‘Mother,’ I said, ‘shall we have
10752: plum-pudding _every_ day because o’ the malt-house? She used to tell me
10753: o’ that till her dying day. She was but a young woman when she died, my
10754: mother was. But it’s forty good year since they finished the
10755: malt-house, and it isn’t many days out of ’em all as I haven’t looked
10756: out into the yard there, the first thing in the morning,—all weathers,
10757: from year’s end to year’s end. I should go off my head in a new place.
10758: I should be like as if I’d lost my way. It’s all hard, whichever way I
10759: look at it,—the harness ’ull gall me, but it ’ud be summat to draw
10760: along the old road, instead of a new un.”
10761: 
10762: “Ay, sir,” said Luke, “you’d be a deal better here nor in some new
10763: place. I can’t abide new places mysen: things is allays
10764: awk’ard,—narrow-wheeled waggins, belike, and the stiles all another
10765: sort, an’ oat-cake i’ some places, tow’rt th’ head o’ the Floss, there.
10766: It’s poor work, changing your country-side.”
10767: 
10768: “But I doubt, Luke, they’ll be for getting rid o’ Ben, and making you
10769: do with a lad; and I must help a bit wi’ the mill. You’ll have a worse
10770: place.”
10771: 
10772: “Ne’er mind, sir,” said Luke, “I sha’n’t plague mysen. I’n been wi’ you
10773: twenty year, an’ you can’t get twenty year wi’ whistlin’ for ’em, no
10774: more nor you can make the trees grow: you mun wait till God A’mighty
10775: sends ’em. I can’t abide new victual nor new faces, _I_ can’t,—you
10776: niver know but what they’ll gripe you.”
10777: 
10778: The walk was finished in silence after this, for Luke had disburthened
10779: himself of thoughts to an extent that left his conversational resources
10780: quite barren, and Mr Tulliver had relapsed from his recollections into
10781: a painful meditation on the choice of hardships before him. Maggie
10782: noticed that he was unusually absent that evening at tea; and afterward
10783: he sat leaning forward in his chair, looking at the ground, moving his
10784: lips, and shaking his head from time to time. Then he looked hard at
10785: Mrs Tulliver, who was knitting opposite him, then at Maggie, who, as
10786: she bent over her sewing, was intensely conscious of some drama going
10787: forward in her father’s mind. Suddenly he took up the poker and broke
10788: the large coal fiercely.
10789: 
10790: “Dear heart, Mr Tulliver, what can you be thinking of?” said his wife,
10791: looking up in alarm; “it’s very wasteful, breaking the coal, and we’ve
10792: got hardly any large coal left, and I don’t know where the rest is to
10793: come from.”
10794: 
10795: “I don’t think you’re quite so well to-night, are you, father?” said
10796: Maggie; “you seem uneasy.”
10797: 
10798: “Why, how is it Tom doesn’t come?” said Mr Tulliver, impatiently.
10799: 
10800: “Dear heart! is it time? I must go and get his supper,” said Mrs
10801: Tulliver, laying down her knitting, and leaving the room.
10802: 
10803: “It’s nigh upon half-past eight,” said Mr Tulliver. “He’ll be here
10804: soon. Go, go and get the big Bible, and open it at the beginning, where
10805: everything’s set down. And get the pen and ink.”
10806: 
10807: Maggie obeyed, wondering; but her father gave no further orders, and
10808: only sat listening for Tom’s footfall on the gravel, apparently
10809: irritated by the wind, which had risen, and was roaring so as to drown
10810: all other sounds. There was a strange light in his eyes that rather
10811: frightened Maggie; _she_ began to wish that Tom would come, too.
10812: 
10813: “There he is, then,” said Mr Tulliver, in an excited way, when the
10814: knock came at last. Maggie went to open the door, but her mother came
10815: out of the kitchen hurriedly, saying, “Stop a bit, Maggie; I’ll open
10816: it.”
10817: 
10818: Mrs Tulliver had begun to be a little frightened at her boy, but she
10819: was jealous of every office others did for him.
10820: 
10821: “Your supper’s ready by the kitchen-fire, my boy,” she said, as he took
10822: off his hat and coat. “You shall have it by yourself, just as you like,
10823: and I won’t speak to you.”
10824: 
10825: “I think my father wants Tom, mother,” said Maggie; “he must come into
10826: the parlour first.”
10827: 
10828: Tom entered with his usual saddened evening face, but his eyes fell
10829: immediately on the open Bible and the inkstand, and he glanced with a
10830: look of anxious surprise at his father, who was saying,—
10831: 
10832: “Come, come, you’re late; I want you.”
10833: 
10834: “Is there anything the matter, father?” said Tom.
10835: 
10836: “You sit down, all of you,” said Mr Tulliver, peremptorily.
10837: 
10838: “And, Tom, sit down here; I’ve got something for you to write i’ the
10839: Bible.”
10840: 
10841: They all three sat down, looking at him. He began to speak slowly,
10842: looking first at his wife.
10843: 
10844: “I’ve made up my mind, Bessy, and I’ll be as good as my word to you.
10845: There’ll be the same grave made for us to lie down in, and we mustn’t
10846: be bearing one another ill-will. I’ll stop in the old place, and I’ll
10847: serve under Wakem, and I’ll serve him like an honest man; there’s no
10848: Tulliver but what’s honest, mind that, Tom,”—here his voice
10849: rose,—“they’ll have it to throw up against me as I paid a dividend, but
10850: it wasn’t my fault; it was because there’s raskills in the world.
10851: They’ve been too many for me, and I must give in. I’ll put my neck in
10852: harness,—for you’ve a right to say as I’ve brought you into trouble,
10853: Bessy,—and I’ll serve him as honest as if he was no raskill; I’m an
10854: honest man, though I shall never hold my head up no more. I’m a tree as
10855: is broke—a tree as is broke.”
10856: 
10857: He paused and looked on the ground. Then suddenly raising his head, he
10858: said, in a louder yet deeper tone:
10859: 
10860: “But I won’t forgive him! I know what they say, he never meant me any
10861: harm. That’s the way Old Harry props up the rascals. He’s been at the
10862: bottom of everything; but he’s a fine gentleman,—I know, I know. I
10863: shouldn’t ha’ gone to law, they say. But who made it so as there was no
10864: arbitratin’, and no justice to be got? It signifies nothing to him, I
10865: know that; he’s one o’ them fine gentlemen as get money by doing
10866: business for poorer folks, and when he’s made beggars of ’em he’ll give
10867: ’em charity. I won’t forgive him! I wish he might be punished with
10868: shame till his own son ’ud like to forget him. I wish he may do summat
10869: as they’d make him work at the treadmill! But he won’t,—he’s too big a
10870: raskill to let the law lay hold on him. And you mind this, Tom,—you
10871: never forgive him neither, if you mean to be my son. There’ll maybe
10872: come a time when you may make him feel; it’ll never come to me; I’n got
10873: my head under the yoke. Now write—write it i’ the Bible.”
10874: 
10875: “Oh, father, what?” said Maggie, sinking down by his knee, pale and
10876: trembling. “It’s wicked to curse and bear malice.”
10877: 
10878: “It isn’t wicked, I tell you,” said her father, fiercely. “It’s wicked
10879: as the raskills should prosper; it’s the Devil’s doing. Do as I tell
10880: you, Tom. Write.”
10881: 
10882: “What am I to write?” said Tom, with gloomy submission.
10883: 
10884: “Write as your father, Edward Tulliver, took service under John Wakem,
10885: the man as had helped to ruin him, because I’d promised my wife to make
10886: her what amends I could for her trouble, and because I wanted to die in
10887: th’ old place where I was born and my father was born. Put that i’ the
10888: right words—you know how—and then write, as I don’t forgive Wakem for
10889: all that; and for all I’ll serve him honest, I wish evil may befall
10890: him. Write that.”
10891: 
10892: There was a dead silence as Tom’s pen moved along the paper; Mrs
10893: Tulliver looked scared, and Maggie trembled like a leaf.
10894: 
10895: “Now let me hear what you’ve wrote,” said Mr Tulliver, Tom read aloud
10896: slowly.
10897: 
10898: “Now write—write as you’ll remember what Wakem’s done to your father,
10899: and you’ll make him and his feel it, if ever the day comes. And sign
10900: your name Thomas Tulliver.”
10901: 
10902: “Oh no, father, dear father!” said Maggie, almost choked with fear.
10903: “You shouldn’t make Tom write that.”
10904: 
10905: “Be quiet, Maggie!” said Tom. “I _shall_ write it.”
10906: 
10907: 
10908: BOOK FOURTH
10909: 
10910: THE VALLEY OF HUMILIATION.
10911: 
10912: 
10913: Chapter I.
10914: 
10915: A Variation of Protestantism Unknown to Bossuet
10916: 
10917: Journeying down the Rhone on a summer’s day, you have perhaps felt the
10918: sunshine made dreary by those ruined villages which stud the banks in
10919: certain parts of its course, telling how the swift river once rose,
10920: like an angry, destroying god, sweeping down the feeble generations
10921: whose breath is in their nostrils, and making their dwellings a
10922: desolation. Strange contrast, you may have thought, between the effect
10923: produced on us by these dismal remnants of commonplace houses, which in
10924: their best days were but the sign of a sordid life, belonging in all
10925: its details to our own vulgar era, and the effect produced by those
10926: ruins on the castled Rhine, which have crumbled and mellowed into such
10927: harmony with the green and rocky steeps that they seem to have a
10928: natural fitness, like the mountain-pine; nay, even in the day when they
10929: were built they must have had this fitness, as if they had been raised
10930: by an earth-born race, who had inherited from their mighty parent a
10931: sublime instinct of form. And that was a day of romance; If those
10932: robber-barons were somewhat grim and drunken ogres, they had a certain
10933: grandeur of the wild beast in them,—they were forest boars with tusks,
10934: tearing and rending, not the ordinary domestic grunter; they
10935: represented the demon forces forever in collision with beauty, virtue,
10936: and the gentle uses of life; they made a fine contrast in the picture
10937: with the wandering minstrel, the soft-lipped princess, the pious
10938: recluse, and the timid Israelite. That was a time of colour, when the
10939: sunlight fell on glancing steel and floating banners; a time of
10940: adventure and fierce struggle,—nay, of living, religious art and
10941: religious enthusiasm; for were not cathedrals built in those days, and
10942: did not great emperors leave their Western palaces to die before the
10943: infidel strongholds in the sacred East? Therefore it is that these
10944: Rhine castles thrill me with a sense of poetry; they belong to the
10945: grand historic life of humanity, and raise up for me the vision of an
10946: echo. But these dead-tinted, hollow-eyed, angular skeletons of villages
10947: on the Rhone oppress me with the feeling that human life—very much of
10948: it—is a narrow, ugly, grovelling existence, which even calamity does
10949: not elevate, but rather tends to exhibit in all its bare vulgarity of
10950: conception; and I have a cruel conviction that the lives these ruins
10951: are the traces of were part of a gross sum of obscure vitality, that
10952: will be swept into the same oblivion with the generations of ants and
10953: beavers.
10954: 
10955: Perhaps something akin to this oppressive feeling may have weighed upon
10956: you in watching this old-fashioned family life on the banks of the
10957: Floss, which even sorrow hardly suffices to lift above the level of the
10958: tragi-comic. It is a sordid life, you say, this of the Tullivers and
10959: Dodsons, irradiated by no sublime principles, no romantic visions, no
10960: active, self-renouncing faith; moved by none of those wild,
10961: uncontrollable passions which create the dark shadows of misery and
10962: crime; without that primitive, rough simplicity of wants, that hard,
10963: submissive, ill-paid toil, that childlike spelling-out of what nature
10964: has written, which gives its poetry to peasant life. Here one has
10965: conventional worldly notions and habits without instruction and without
10966: polish, surely the most prosaic form of human life; proud
10967: respectability in a gig of unfashionable build; worldliness without
10968: side-dishes. Observing these people narrowly, even when the iron hand
10969: of misfortune has shaken them from their unquestioning hold on the
10970: world, one sees little trace of religion, still less of a distinctively
10971: Christian creed. Their belief in the Unseen, so far as it manifests
10972: itself at all, seems to be rather a pagan kind; their moral notions,
10973: though held with strong tenacity, seem to have no standard beyond
10974: hereditary custom. You could not live among such people; you are
10975: stifled for want of an outlet toward something beautiful, great, or
10976: noble; you are irritated with these dull men and women, as a kind of
10977: population out of keeping with the earth on which they live,—with this
10978: rich plain where the great river flows forever onward, and links the
10979: small pulse of the old English town with the beatings of the world’s
10980: mighty heart. A vigorous superstition, that lashes its gods or lashes
10981: its own back, seems to be more congruous with the mystery of the human
10982: lot, than the mental condition of these emmet-like Dodsons and
10983: Tullivers.
10984: 
10985: I share with you this sense of oppressive narrowness; but it is
10986: necessary that we should feel it, if we care to understand how it acted
10987: on the lives of Tom and Maggie,—how it has acted on young natures in
10988: many generations, that in the onward tendency of human things have
10989: risen above the mental level of the generation before them, to which
10990: they have been nevertheless tied by the strongest fibres of their
10991: hearts. The suffering, whether of martyr or victim, which belongs to
10992: every historical advance of mankind, is represented in this way in
10993: every town, and by hundreds of obscure hearths; and we need not shrink
10994: from this comparison of small things with great; for does not science
10995: tell us that its highest striving is after the ascertainment of a unity
10996: which shall bind the smallest things with the greatest? In natural
10997: science, I have understood, there is nothing petty to the mind that has
10998: a large vision of relations, and to which every single object suggests
10999: a vast sum of conditions. It is surely the same with the observation of
11000: human life.
11001: 
11002: Certainly the religious and moral ideas of the Dodsons and Tullivers
11003: were of too specific a kind to be arrived at deductively, from the
11004: statement that they were part of the Protestant population of Great
11005: Britain. Their theory of life had its core of soundness, as all
11006: theories must have on which decent and prosperous families have been
11007: reared and have flourished; but it had the very slightest tincture of
11008: theology. If, in the maiden days of the Dodson sisters, their Bibles
11009: opened more easily at some parts than others, it was because of dried
11010: tulip-petals, which had been distributed quite impartially, without
11011: preference for the historical, devotional, or doctrinal. Their religion
11012: was of a simple, semi-pagan kind, but there was no heresy in it,—if
11013: heresy properly means choice,—for they didn’t know there was any other
11014: religion, except that of chapel-goers, which appeared to run in
11015: families, like asthma. How _should_ they know? The vicar of their
11016: pleasant rural parish was not a controversialist, but a good hand at
11017: whist, and one who had a joke always ready for a blooming female
11018: parishioner. The religion of the Dodsons consisted in revering whatever
11019: was customary and respectable; it was necessary to be baptised, else
11020: one could not be buried in the church-yard, and to take the sacrament
11021: before death, as a security against more dimly understood perils; but
11022: it was of equal necessity to have the proper pall-bearers and
11023: well-cured hams at one’s funeral, and to leave an unimpeachable will. A
11024: Dodson would not be taxed with the omission of anything that was
11025: becoming, or that belonged to that eternal fitness of things which was
11026: plainly indicated in the practice of the most substantial parishioners,
11027: and in the family traditions,—such as obedience to parents,
11028: faithfulness to kindred, industry, rigid honesty, thrift, the thorough
11029: scouring of wooden and copper utensils, the hoarding of coins likely to
11030: disappear from the currency, the production of first-rate commodities
11031: for the market, and the general preference of whatever was home-made.
11032: The Dodsons were a very proud race, and their pride lay in the utter
11033: frustration of all desire to tax them with a breach of traditional duty
11034: or propriety. A wholesome pride in many respects, since it identified
11035: honour with perfect integrity, thoroughness of work, and faithfulness
11036: to admitted rules; and society owes some worthy qualities in many of
11037: her members to mothers of the Dodson class, who made their butter and
11038: their fromenty well, and would have felt disgraced to make it
11039: otherwise. To be honest and poor was never a Dodson motto, still less
11040: to seem rich though being poor; rather, the family badge was to be
11041: honest and rich, and not only rich, but richer than was supposed. To
11042: live respected, and have the proper bearers at your funeral, was an
11043: achievement of the ends of existence that would be entirely nullified
11044: if, on the reading of your will, you sank in the opinion of your
11045: fellow-men, either by turning out to be poorer than they expected, or
11046: by leaving your money in a capricious manner, without strict regard to
11047: degrees of kin. The right thing must always be done toward kindred. The
11048: right thing was to correct them severely, if they were other than a
11049: credit to the family, but still not to alienate from them the smallest
11050: rightful share in the family shoebuckles and other property. A
11051: conspicuous quality in the Dodson character was its genuineness; its
11052: vices and virtues alike were phases of a proud honest egoism, which had
11053: a hearty dislike to whatever made against its own credit and interest,
11054: and would be frankly hard of speech to inconvenient “kin,” but would
11055: never forsake or ignore them,—would not let them want bread, but only
11056: require them to eat it with bitter herbs.
11057: 
11058: The same sort of traditional belief ran in the Tulliver veins, but it
11059: was carried in richer blood, having elements of generous imprudence,
11060: warm affection, and hot-tempered rashness. Mr Tulliver’s grandfather
11061: had been heard to say that he was descended from one Ralph Tulliver, a
11062: wonderfully clever fellow, who had ruined himself. It is likely enough
11063: that the clever Ralph was a high liver, rode spirited horses, and was
11064: very decidedly of his own opinion. On the other hand, nobody had ever
11065: heard of a Dodson who had ruined himself; it was not the way of that
11066: family.
11067: 
11068: If such were the views of life on which the Dodsons and Tullivers had
11069: been reared in the praiseworthy past of Pitt and high prices, you will
11070: infer from what you already know concerning the state of society in St
11071: Ogg’s, that there had been no highly modifying influence to act on them
11072: in their maturer life. It was still possible, even in that later time
11073: of anti-Catholic preaching, for people to hold many pagan ideas, and
11074: believe themselves good church-people, notwithstanding; so we need
11075: hardly feel any surprise at the fact that Mr Tulliver, though a regular
11076: church-goer, recorded his vindictiveness on the fly-leaf of his Bible.
11077: It was not that any harm could be said concerning the vicar of that
11078: charming rural parish to which Dorlcote Mill belonged; he was a man of
11079: excellent family, an irreproachable bachelor, of elegant pursuits,—had
11080: taken honours, and held a fellowship. Mr Tulliver regarded him with
11081: dutiful respect, as he did everything else belonging to the
11082: church-service; but he considered that church was one thing and
11083: common-sense another, and he wanted nobody to tell _him_ what
11084: commonsense was. Certain seeds which are required to find a nidus for
11085: themselves under unfavourable circumstances have been supplied by
11086: nature with an apparatus of hooks, so that they will get a hold on very
11087: unreceptive surfaces. The spiritual seed which had been scattered over
11088: Mr Tulliver had apparently been destitute of any corresponding
11089: provision, and had slipped off to the winds again, from a total absence
11090: of hooks.

11093: Chapter II.
11094: 
11095: The Torn Nest Is Pierced by the Thorns
11096: 
11097: There is something sustaining in the very agitation that accompanies
11098: the first shocks of trouble, just as an acute pain is often a stimulus,
11099: and produces an excitement which is transient strength. It is in the
11100: slow, changed life that follows; in the time when sorrow has become
11101: stale, and has no longer an emotive intensity that counteracts its
11102: pain; in the time when day follows day in dull, unexpectant sameness,
11103: and trial is a dreary routine,—it is then that despair threatens; it is
11104: then that the peremptory hunger of the soul is felt, and eye and ear
11105: are strained after some unlearned secret of our existence, which shall
11106: give to endurance the nature of satisfaction.
11107: 
11108: This time of utmost need was come to Maggie, with her short span of
11109: thirteen years. To the usual precocity of the girl, she added that
11110: early experience of struggle, of conflict between the inward impulse
11111: and outward fact, which is the lot of every imaginative and passionate
11112: nature; and the years since she hammered the nails into her wooden
11113: Fetish among the worm-eaten shelves of the attic had been filled with
11114: so eager a life in the triple world of Reality, Books, and Waking
11115: Dreams, that Maggie was strangely old for her years in everything
11116: except in her entire want of that prudence and self-command which were
11117: the qualities that made Tom manly in the midst of his intellectual
11118: boyishness. And now her lot was beginning to have a still, sad
11119: monotony, which threw her more than ever on her inward self. Her father
11120: was able to attend to business again, his affairs were settled, and he
11121: was acting as Wakem’s manager on the old spot. Tom went to and fro
11122: every morning and evening, and became more and more silent in the short
11123: intervals at home; what was there to say? One day was like another; and
11124: Tom’s interest in life, driven back and crushed on every other side,
11125: was concentrating itself into the one channel of ambitious resistance
11126: to misfortune. The peculiarities of his father and mother were very
11127: irksome to him, now they were laid bare of all the softening
11128: accompaniments of an easy, prosperous home; for Tom had very clear,
11129: prosaic eyes, not apt to be dimmed by mists of feeling or imagination.
11130: Poor Mrs Tulliver, it seemed, would never recover her old self, her
11131: placid household activity; how could she? The objects among which her
11132: mind had moved complacently were all gone,—all the little hopes and
11133: schemes and speculations, all the pleasant little cares about her
11134: treasures which had made the world quite comprehensible to her for a
11135: quarter of a century, since she had made her first purchase of the
11136: sugar-tongs, had been suddenly snatched away from her, and she remained
11137: bewildered in this empty life. Why that should have happened to her
11138: which had not happened to other women remained an insoluble question by
11139: which she expressed her perpetual ruminating comparison of the past
11140: with the present. It was piteous to see the comely woman getting
11141: thinner and more worn under a bodily as well as mental restlessness,
11142: which made her often wander about the empty house after her work was
11143: done, until Maggie, becoming alarmed about her, would seek her, and
11144: bring her down by telling her how it vexed Tom that she was injuring
11145: her health by never sitting down and resting herself. Yet amidst this
11146: helpless imbecility there was a touching trait of humble, self-devoting
11147: maternity, which made Maggie feel tenderly toward her poor mother
11148: amidst all the little wearing griefs caused by her mental feebleness.
11149: She would let Maggie do none of the work that was heaviest and most
11150: soiling to the hands, and was quite peevish when Maggie attempted to
11151: relieve her from her grate-brushing and scouring: “Let it alone, my
11152: dear; your hands ’ull get as hard as hard,” she would say; “it’s your
11153: mother’s place to do that. I can’t do the sewing—my eyes fail me.” And
11154: she would still brush and carefully tend Maggie’s hair, which she had
11155: become reconciled to, in spite of its refusal to curl, now it was so
11156: long and massy. Maggie was not her pet child, and, in general, would
11157: have been much better if she had been quite different; yet the womanly
11158: heart, so bruised in its small personal desires, found a future to rest
11159: on in the life of this young thing, and the mother pleased herself with
11160: wearing out her own hands to save the hands that had so much more life
11161: in them.
11162: 
11163: But the constant presence of her mother’s regretful bewilderment was
11164: less painful to Maggie than that of her father’s sullen,
11165: incommunicative depression. As long as the paralysis was upon him, and
11166: it seemed as if he might always be in a childlike condition of
11167: dependence,—as long as he was still only half awakened to his
11168: trouble,—Maggie had felt the strong tide of pitying love almost as an
11169: inspiration, a new power, that would make the most difficult life easy
11170: for his sake; but now, instead of childlike dependence, there had come
11171: a taciturn, hard concentration of purpose, in strange contrast with his
11172: old vehement communicativeness and high spirit; and this lasted from
11173: day to day, and from week to week, the dull eye never brightening with
11174: any eagerness or any joy. It is something cruelly incomprehensible to
11175: youthful natures, this sombre sameness in middle-aged and elderly
11176: people, whose life has resulted in disappointment and discontent, to
11177: whose faces a smile becomes so strange that the sad lines all about the
11178: lips and brow seem to take no notice of it, and it hurries away again
11179: for want of a welcome. “Why will they not kindle up and be glad
11180: sometimes?” thinks young elasticity. “It would be so easy if they only
11181: liked to do it.” And these leaden clouds that never part are apt to
11182: create impatience even in the filial affection that streams forth in
11183: nothing but tenderness and pity in the time of more obvious affliction.
11184: 
11185: Mr Tulliver lingered nowhere away from home; he hurried away from
11186: market, he refused all invitations to stay and chat, as in old times,
11187: in the houses where he called on business. He could not be reconciled
11188: with his lot. There was no attitude in which his pride did not feel its
11189: bruises; and in all behaviour toward him, whether kind or cold, he
11190: detected an allusion to the change in his circumstances. Even the days
11191: on which Wakem came to ride round the land and inquire into the
11192: business were not so black to him as those market-days on which he had
11193: met several creditors who had accepted a composition from him. To save
11194: something toward the repayment of those creditors was the object toward
11195: which he was now bending all his thoughts and efforts; and under the
11196: influence of this all-compelling demand of his nature, the somewhat
11197: profuse man, who hated to be stinted or to stint any one else in his
11198: own house, was gradually metamorphosed into the keen-eyed grudger of
11199: morsels. Mrs Tulliver could not economise enough to satisfy him, in
11200: their food and firing; and he would eat nothing himself but what was of
11201: the coarsest quality. Tom, though depressed and strongly repelled by
11202: his father’s sullenness, and the dreariness of home, entered thoroughly
11203: into his father’s feelings about paying the creditors; and the poor lad
11204: brought his first quarter’s money, with a delicious sense of
11205: achievement, and gave it to his father to put into the tin box which
11206: held the savings. The little store of sovereigns in the tin box seemed
11207: to be the only sight that brought a faint beam of pleasure into the
11208: miller’s eyes,—faint and transient, for it was soon dispelled by the
11209: thought that the time would be long—perhaps longer than his
11210: life,—before the narrow savings could remove the hateful incubus of
11211: debt. A deficit of more than five hundred pounds, with the accumulating
11212: interest, seemed a deep pit to fill with the savings from thirty
11213: shillings a-week, even when Tom’s probable savings were to be added. On
11214: this one point there was entire community of feeling in the four widely
11215: differing beings who sat round the dying fire of sticks, which made a
11216: cheap warmth for them on the verge of bedtime. Mrs Tulliver carried the
11217: proud integrity of the Dodsons in her blood, and had been brought up to
11218: think that to wrong people of their money, which was another phrase for
11219: debt, was a sort of moral pillory; it would have been wickedness, to
11220: her mind, to have run counter to her husband’s desire to “do the right
11221: thing,” and retrieve his name. She had a confused, dreamy notion that,
11222: if the creditors were all paid, her plate and linen ought to come back
11223: to her; but she had an inbred perception that while people owed money
11224: they were unable to pay, they couldn’t rightly call anything their own.
11225: She murmured a little that Mr Tulliver so peremptorily refused to
11226: receive anything in repayment from Mr and Mrs Moss; but to all his
11227: requirements of household economy she was submissive to the point of
11228: denying herself the cheapest indulgences of mere flavour; her only
11229: rebellion was to smuggle into the kitchen something that would make
11230: rather a better supper than usual for Tom.
11231: 
11232: These narrow notions about debt, held by the old fashioned Tullivers,
11233: may perhaps excite a smile on the faces of many readers in these days
11234: of wide commercial views and wide philosophy, according to which
11235: everything rights itself without any trouble of ours. The fact that my
11236: tradesman is out of pocket by me is to be looked at through the serene
11237: certainty that somebody else’s tradesman is in pocket by somebody else;
11238: and since there must be bad debts in the world, why, it is mere egoism
11239: not to like that we in particular should make them instead of our
11240: fellow-citizens. I am telling the history of very simple people, who
11241: had never had any illuminating doubts as to personal integrity and
11242: honour.
11243: 
11244: Under all this grim melancholy and narrowing concentration of desire,
11245: Mr Tulliver retained the feeling toward his “little wench” which made
11246: her presence a need to him, though it would not suffice to cheer him.
11247: She was still the desire of his eyes; but the sweet spring of fatherly
11248: love was now mingled with bitterness, like everything else. When Maggie
11249: laid down her work at night, it was her habit to get a low stool and
11250: sit by her father’s knee, leaning her cheek against it. How she wished
11251: he would stroke her head, or give some sign that he was soothed by the
11252: sense that he had a daughter who loved him! But now she got no answer
11253: to her little caresses, either from her father or from Tom,—the two
11254: idols of her life. Tom was weary and abstracted in the short intervals
11255: when he was at home, and her father was bitterly preoccupied with the
11256: thought that the girl was growing up, was shooting up into a woman; and
11257: how was she to do well in life? She had a poor chance for marrying,
11258: down in the world as they were. And he hated the thought of her
11259: marrying poorly, as her aunt Gritty had done; _that_ would be a thing
11260: to make him turn in his grave,—the little wench so pulled down by
11261: children and toil, as her aunt Moss was. When uncultured minds,
11262: confined to a narrow range of personal experience, are under the
11263: pressure of continued misfortune, their inward life is apt to become a
11264: perpetually repeated round of sad and bitter thoughts; the same words,
11265: the same scenes, are revolved over and over again, the same mood
11266: accompanies them; the end of the year finds them as much what they were
11267: at the beginning as if they were machines set to a recurrent series of
11268: movements.
11269: 
11270: The sameness of the days was broken by few visitors. Uncles and aunts
11271: paid only short visits now; of course, they could not stay to meals,
11272: and the constraint caused by Mr Tulliver’s savage silence, which seemed
11273: to add to the hollow resonance of the bare, uncarpeted room when the
11274: aunts were talking, heightened the unpleasantness of these family
11275: visits on all sides, and tended to make them rare. As for other
11276: acquaintances, there is a chill air surrounding those who are down in
11277: the world, and people are glad to get away from them, as from a cold
11278: room; human beings, mere men and women, without furniture, without
11279: anything to offer you, who have ceased to count as anybody, present an
11280: embarrassing negation of reasons for wishing to see them, or of
11281: subjects on which to converse with them. At that distant day, there was
11282: a dreary isolation in the civilised Christian society of these realms
11283: for families that had dropped below their original level, unless they
11284: belonged to a sectarian church, which gets some warmth of brotherhood
11285: by walling in the sacred fire.
11286: 
11287: 
11288: Chapter III.
11289: 
11290: A Voice from the Past
11291: 
11292: One afternoon, when the chestnuts were coming into flower, Maggie had
11293: brought her chair outside the front door, and was seated there with a
11294: book on her knees. Her dark eyes had wandered from the book, but they
11295: did not seem to be enjoying the sunshine which pierced the screen of
11296: jasmine on the projecting porch at her right, and threw leafy shadows
11297: on her pale round cheek; they seemed rather to be searching for
11298: something that was not disclosed by the sunshine. It had been a more
11299: miserable day than usual; her father, after a visit of Wakem’s had had
11300: a paroxysm of rage, in which for some trifling fault he had beaten the
11301: boy who served in the mill. Once before, since his illness, he had had
11302: a similar paroxysm, in which he had beaten his horse, and the scene had
11303: left a lasting terror in Maggie’s mind. The thought had risen, that
11304: some time or other he might beat her mother if she happened to speak in
11305: her feeble way at the wrong moment. The keenest of all dread with her
11306: was lest her father should add to his present misfortune the
11307: wretchedness of doing something irretrievably disgraceful. The battered
11308: school-book of Tom’s which she held on her knees could give her no
11309: fortitude under the pressure of that dread; and again and again her
11310: eyes had filled with tears, as they wandered vaguely, seeing neither
11311: the chestnut-trees, nor the distant horizon, but only future scenes of
11312: home-sorrow.
11313: 
11314: Suddenly she was roused by the sound of the opening gate and of
11315: footsteps on the gravel. It was not Tom who was entering, but a man in
11316: a sealskin cap and a blue plush waistcoat, carrying a pack on his back,
11317: and followed closely by a bullterrier of brindled coat and defiant
11318: aspect.
11319: 
11320: “Oh, Bob, it’s you!” said Maggie, starting up with a smile of pleased
11321: recognition, for there had been no abundance of kind acts to efface the
11322: recollection of Bob’s generosity; “I’m so glad to see you.”
11323: 
11324: “Thank you, Miss,” said Bob, lifting his cap and showing a delighted
11325: face, but immediately relieving himself of some accompanying
11326: embarrassment by looking down at his dog, and saying in a tone of
11327: disgust, “Get out wi’ you, you thunderin’ sawney!”
11328: 
11329: “My brother is not at home yet, Bob,” said Maggie; “he is always at St
11330: Ogg’s in the daytime.”
11331: 
11332: “Well, Miss,” said Bob, “I should be glad to see Mr Tom, but that isn’t
11333: just what I’m come for,—look here!”
11334: 
11335: Bob was in the act of depositing his pack on the door-step, and with it
11336: a row of small books fastened together with string.
11337: 
11338: Apparently, however, they were not the object to which he wished to
11339: call Maggie’s attention, but rather something which he had carried
11340: under his arm, wrapped in a red handkerchief.
11341: 
11342: “See here!” he said again, laying the red parcel on the others and
11343: unfolding it; “you won’t think I’m a-makin’ too free, Miss, I hope, but
11344: I lighted on these books, and I thought they might make up to you a bit
11345: for them as you’ve lost; for I heared you speak o’ picturs,—an’ as for
11346: picturs, _look_ here!”
11347: 
11348: The opening of the red handkerchief had disclosed a superannuated
11349: “Keepsake” and six or seven numbers of a “Portrait Gallery,” in royal
11350: octavo; and the emphatic request to look referred to a portrait of
11351: George the Fourth in all the majesty of his depressed cranium and
11352: voluminous neckcloth.
11353: 
11354: “There’s all sorts o’ genelmen here,” Bob went on, turning over the
11355: leaves with some excitement, “wi’ all sorts o’ noses,—an’ some bald an’
11356: some wi’ wigs,—Parlament genelmen, I reckon. An’ here,” he added,
11357: opening the “Keepsake,”—“_here’s_ ladies for you, some wi’ curly hair
11358: and some wi’ smooth, an’ some a-smiling wi’ their heads o’ one side,
11359: an’ some as if they were goin’ to cry,—look here,—a-sittin’ on the
11360: ground out o’ door, dressed like the ladies I’n seen get out o’ the
11361: carriages at the balls in th’ Old Hall there. My eyes! I wonder what
11362: the chaps wear as go a-courtin’ ’em! I sot up till the clock was gone
11363: twelve last night, a-lookin’ at ’em,—I did,—till they stared at me out
11364: o’ the picturs as if they’d know when I spoke to ’em. But, lors! I
11365: shouldn’t know what to say to ’em. They’ll be more fittin’ company for
11366: you, Miss; and the man at the book-stall, he said they banged
11367: iverything for picturs; he said they was a fust-rate article.”
11368: 
11369: “And you’ve bought them for me, Bob?” said Maggie, deeply touched by
11370: this simple kindness. “How very, very good of you! But I’m afraid you
11371: gave a great deal of money for them.”
11372: 
11373: “Not me!” said Bob. “I’d ha’ gev three times the money if they’ll make
11374: up to you a bit for them as was sold away from you, Miss. For I’n niver
11375: forgot how you looked when you fretted about the books bein’ gone; it’s
11376: stuck by me as if it was a pictur hingin’ before me. An’ when I see’d
11377: the book open upo’ the stall, wi’ the lady lookin’ out of it wi’ eyes a
11378: bit like your’n when you was frettin’,—you’ll excuse my takin’ the
11379: liberty, Miss,—I thought I’d make free to buy it for you, an’ then I
11380: bought the books full o’ genelmen to match; an’ then”—here Bob took up
11381: the small stringed packet of books—“I thought you might like a bit more
11382: print as well as the picturs, an’ I got these for a sayso,—they’re
11383: cram-full o’ print, an’ I thought they’d do no harm comin’ along wi’
11384: these bettermost books. An’ I hope you won’t say me nay, an’ tell me as
11385: you won’t have ’em, like Mr Tom did wi’ the suvreigns.”
11386: 
11387: “No, indeed, Bob,” said Maggie, “I’m very thankful to you for thinking
11388: of me, and being so good to me and Tom. I don’t think any one ever did
11389: such a kind thing for me before. I haven’t many friends who care for
11390: me.”
11391: 
11392: “Hev a dog, Miss!—they’re better friends nor any Christian,” said Bob,
11393: laying down his pack again, which he had taken up with the intention of
11394: hurrying away; for he felt considerable shyness in talking to a young
11395: lass like Maggie, though, as he usually said of himself, “his tongue
11396: overrun him” when he began to speak. “I can’t give you Mumps, ’cause
11397: he’d break his heart to go away from me—eh, Mumps, what do you say, you
11398: riff-raff?” (Mumps declined to express himself more diffusely than by a
11399: single affirmative movement of his tail.) “But I’d get you a pup, Miss,
11400: an’ welcome.”
11401: 
11402: “No, thank you, Bob. We have a yard dog, and I mayn’t keep a dog of my
11403: own.”
11404: 
11405: “Eh, that’s a pity; else there’s a pup,—if you didn’t mind about it not
11406: being thoroughbred; its mother acts in the Punch show,—an uncommon
11407: sensible bitch; she means more sense wi’ her bark nor half the chaps
11408: can put into their talk from breakfast to sundown. There’s one chap
11409: carries pots,—a poor, low trade as any on the road,—he says, ‘Why
11410: Toby’s nought but a mongrel; there’s nought to look at in her.’ But I
11411: says to him, ‘Why, what are you yoursen but a mongrel? There wasn’t
11412: much pickin’ o’ _your_ feyther an’ mother, to look at you.’ Not but I
11413: like a bit o’ breed myself, but I can’t abide to see one cur grinnin’
11414: at another. I wish you good evenin’, Miss,” said Bob, abruptly taking
11415: up his pack again, under the consciousness that his tongue was acting
11416: in an undisciplined manner.
11417: 
11418: “Won’t you come in the evening some time, and see my brother, Bob?”
11419: said Maggie.
11420: 
11421: “Yes, Miss, thank you—another time. You’ll give my duty to him, if you
11422: please. Eh, he’s a fine growed chap, Mr Tom is; he took to growin’ i’
11423: the legs, an’ _I_ didn’t.”
11424: 
11425: The pack was down again, now, the hook of the stick having somehow gone
11426: wrong.
11427: 
11428: “You don’t call Mumps a cur, I suppose?” said Maggie, divining that any
11429: interest she showed in Mumps would be gratifying to his master.
11430: 
11431: “No, Miss, a fine way off that,” said Bob, with pitying smile; “Mumps
11432: is as fine a cross as you’ll see anywhere along the Floss, an’ I’n been
11433: up it wi’ the barge times enow. Why, the gentry stops to look at him;
11434: but you won’t catch Mumps a-looking at the gentry much,—he minds his
11435: own business, he does.”
11436: 
11437: The expression of Mump’s face, which seemed to be tolerating the
11438: superfluous existence of objects in general, was strongly confirmatory
11439: of this high praise.
11440: 
11441: “He looks dreadfully surly,” said Maggie. “Would he let me pat him?”
11442: 
11443: “Ay, that would he, and thank you. He knows his company, Mumps does. He
11444: isn’t a dog as ’ull be caught wi’ gingerbread; he’d smell a thief a
11445: good deal stronger nor the gingerbread, he would. Lors, I talk to him
11446: by th’ hour together, when I’m walking i’ lone places, and if I’n done
11447: a bit o’ mischief, I allays tell him. I’n got no secrets but what Mumps
11448: knows ’em. He knows about my big thumb, he does.”
11449: 
11450: “Your big thumb—what’s that, Bob?” said Maggie.
11451: 
11452: “That’s what it is, Miss,” said Bob, quickly, exhibiting a singularly
11453: broad specimen of that difference between the man and the monkey. “It
11454: tells i’ measuring out the flannel, you see. I carry flannel, ’cause
11455: it’s light for my pack, an’ it’s dear stuff, you see, so a big thumb
11456: tells. I clap my thumb at the end o’ the yard and cut o’ the hither
11457: side of it, and the old women aren’t up to’t.”
11458: 
11459: “But Bob,” said Maggie, looking serious, “that’s cheating; I don’t like
11460: to hear you say that.”
11461: 
11462: “Don’t you, Miss?” said Bob regretfully. “Then I’m sorry I said it. But
11463: I’m so used to talking to Mumps, an’ he doesn’t mind a bit o’ cheating,
11464: when it’s them skinflint women, as haggle an’ haggle, an’ ’ud like to
11465: get their flannel for nothing, an’ ’ud niver ask theirselves how I got
11466: my dinner out on’t. I niver cheat anybody as doesn’t want to cheat me,
11467: Miss,—lors, I’m a honest chap, I am; only I must hev a bit o’ sport,
11468: an’ now I don’t go wi’ th’ ferrets, I’n got no varmint to come over but
11469: them haggling women. I wish you good evening, Miss.”
11470: 
11471: “Good-by, Bob. Thank you very much for bringing me the books. And come
11472: again to see Tom.”
11473: 
11474: “Yes, Miss,” said Bob, moving on a few steps; then turning half round
11475: he said, “I’ll leave off that trick wi’ my big thumb, if you don’t
11476: think well on me for it, Miss; but it ’ud be a pity, it would. I
11477: couldn’t find another trick so good,—an’ what ’ud be the use o’ havin’
11478: a big thumb? It might as well ha’ been narrow.”
11479: 
11480: Maggie, thus exalted into Bob’s exalting Madonna, laughed in spite of
11481: herself; at which her worshipper’s blue eyes twinkled too, and under
11482: these favouring auspices he touched his cap and walked away.
11483: 
11484: The days of chivalry are not gone, notwithstanding Burke’s grand dirge
11485: over them; they live still in that far-off worship paid by many a youth
11486: and man to the woman of whom he never dreams that he shall touch so
11487: much as her little finger or the hem of her robe. Bob, with the pack on
11488: his back, had as respectful an adoration for this dark-eyed maiden as
11489: if he had been a knight in armor calling aloud on her name as he
11490: pricked on to the fight.
11491: 
11492: That gleam of merriment soon died away from Maggie’s face, and perhaps
11493: only made the returning gloom deeper by contrast. She was too
11494: dispirited even to like answering questions about Bob’s present of
11495: books, and she carried them away to her bedroom, laying them down there
11496: and seating herself on her one stool, without caring to look at them
11497: just yet. She leaned her cheek against the window-frame, and thought
11498: that the light-hearted Bob had a lot much happier than hers.
11499: 
11500: Maggie’s sense of loneliness, and utter privation of joy, had deepened
11501: with the brightness of advancing spring. All the favourite outdoor
11502: nooks about home, which seemed to have done their part with her parents
11503: in nurturing and cherishing her, were now mixed up with the
11504: home-sadness, and gathered no smile from the sunshine. Every affection,
11505: every delight the poor child had had, was like an aching nerve to her.
11506: There was no music for her any more,—no piano, no harmonised voices, no
11507: delicious stringed instruments, with their passionate cries of
11508: imprisoned spirits sending a strange vibration through her frame. And
11509: of all her school-life there was nothing left her now but her little
11510: collection of school-books, which she turned over with a sickening
11511: sense that she knew them all, and they were all barren of comfort. Even
11512: at school she had often wished for books with _more_ in them;
11513: everything she learned there seemed like the ends of long threads that
11514: snapped immediately. And now—without the indirect charm of
11515: school-emulation—Télémaque was mere bran; so were the hard, dry
11516: questions on Christian Doctrine; there was no flavour in them, no
11517: strength. Sometimes Maggie thought she could have been contented with
11518: absorbing fancies; if she could have had all Scott’s novels and all
11519: Byron’s poems!—then, perhaps, she might have found happiness enough to
11520: dull her sensibility to her actual daily life. And yet they were hardly
11521: what she wanted. She could make dream-worlds of her own, but no
11522: dream-world would satisfy her now. She wanted some explanation of this
11523: hard, real life,—the unhappy-looking father, seated at the dull
11524: breakfast-table; the childish, bewildered mother; the little sordid
11525: tasks that filled the hours, or the more oppressive emptiness of weary,
11526: joyless leisure; the need of some tender, demonstrative love; the cruel
11527: sense that Tom didn’t mind what she thought or felt, and that they were
11528: no longer playfellows together; the privation of all pleasant things
11529: that had come to _her_ more than to others,—she wanted some key that
11530: would enable her to understand, and in understanding, to endure, the
11531: heavy weight that had fallen on her young heart. If she had been taught
11532: “real learning and wisdom, such as great men knew,” she thought she
11533: should have held the secrets of life; if she had only books, that she
11534: might learn for herself what wise men knew! Saints and martyrs had
11535: never interested Maggie so much as sages and poets. She knew little of
11536: saints and martyrs, and had gathered, as a general result of her
11537: teaching, that they were a temporary provision against the spread of
11538: Catholicism, and had all died at Smithfield.
11539: 
11540: In one of these meditations it occurred to her that she had forgotten
11541: Tom’s school-books, which had been sent home in his trunk. But she
11542: found the stock unaccountably shrunk down to the few old ones which had
11543: been well thumbed,—the Latin Dictionary and Grammar, a Delectus, a torn
11544: Eutropius, the well-worn Virgil, Aldrich’s Logic, and the exasperating
11545: Euclid. Still, Latin, Euclid, and Logic would surely be a considerable
11546: step in masculine wisdom,—in that knowledge which made men contented,
11547: and even glad to live. Not that the yearning for effectual wisdom was
11548: quite unmixed; a certain mirage would now and then rise on the desert
11549: of the future, in which she seemed to see herself honoured for her
11550: surprising attainments. And so the poor child, with her soul’s hunger
11551: and her illusions of self-flattery, began to nibble at this
11552: thick-rinded fruit of the tree of knowledge, filling her vacant hours
11553: with Latin, geometry, and the forms of the syllogism, and feeling a
11554: gleam of triumph now and then that her understanding was quite equal to
11555: these peculiarly masculine studies. For a week or two she went on
11556: resolutely enough, though with an occasional sinking of heart, as if
11557: she had set out toward the Promised Land alone, and found it a thirsty,
11558: trackless, uncertain journey. In the severity of her early resolution,
11559: she would take Aldrich out into the fields, and then look off her book
11560: toward the sky, where the lark was twinkling, or to the reeds and
11561: bushes by the river, from which the waterfowl rustled forth on its
11562: anxious, awkward flight,—with a startled sense that the relation
11563: between Aldrich and this living world was extremely remote for her. The
11564: discouragement deepened as the days went on, and the eager heart gained
11565: faster and faster on the patient mind. Somehow, when she sat at the
11566: window with her book, her eyes _would_ fix themselves blankly on the
11567: outdoor sunshine; then they would fill with tears, and sometimes, if
11568: her mother was not in the room, the studies would all end in sobbing.
11569: She rebelled against her lot, she fainted under its loneliness, and
11570: fits even of anger and hatred toward her father and mother, who were so
11571: unlike what she would have them to be; toward Tom, who checked her, and
11572: met her thought or feeling always by some thwarting difference,—would
11573: flow out over her affections and conscience like a lava stream, and
11574: frighten her with a sense that it was not difficult for her to become a
11575: demon. Then her brain would be busy with wild romances of a flight from
11576: home in search of something less sordid and dreary; she would go to
11577: some great man—Walter Scott, perhaps—and tell him how wretched and how
11578: clever she was, and he would surely do something for her. But, in the
11579: middle of her vision, her father would perhaps enter the room for the
11580: evening, and, surprised that she sat still without noticing him, would
11581: say complainingly, “Come, am I to fetch my slippers myself?” The voice
11582: pierced through Maggie like a sword; there was another sadness besides
11583: her own, and she had been thinking of turning her back on it and
11584: forsaking it.
11585: 
11586: This afternoon, the sight of Bob’s cheerful freckled face had given her
11587: discontent a new direction. She thought it was part of the hardship of
11588: her life that there was laid upon her the burthen of larger wants than
11589: others seemed to feel,—that she had to endure this wide, hopeless
11590: yearning for that something, whatever it was, that was greatest and
11591: best on this earth. She wished she could have been like Bob, with his
11592: easily satisfied ignorance, or like Tom, who had something to do on
11593: which he could fix his mind with a steady purpose, and disregard
11594: everything else. Poor child! as she leaned her head against the
11595: window-frame, with her hands clasped tighter and tighter, and her foot
11596: beating the ground, she was as lonely in her trouble as if she had been
11597: the only girl in the civilised world of that day who had come out of
11598: her school-life with a soul untrained for inevitable struggles, with no
11599: other part of her inherited share in the hard-won treasures of thought
11600: which generations of painful toil have laid up for the race of men,
11601: than shreds and patches of feeble literature and false history, with
11602: much futile information about Saxon and other kings of doubtful
11603: example, but unhappily quite without that knowledge of the irreversible
11604: laws within and without her, which, governing the habits, becomes
11605: morality, and developing the feelings of submission and dependence,
11606: becomes religion,—as lonely in her trouble as if every other girl
11607: besides herself had been cherished and watched over by elder minds, not
11608: forgetful of their own early time, when need was keen and impulse
11609: strong.
11610: 
11611: At last Maggie’s eyes glanced down on the books that lay on the
11612: window-shelf, and she half forsook her reverie to turn over listlessly
11613: the leaves of the “Portrait Gallery,” but she soon pushed this aside to
11614: examine the little row of books tied together with string. “Beauties of
11615: the Spectator,” “Rasselas,” “Economy of Human Life,” “Gregory’s
11616: Letters,”—she knew the sort of matter that was inside all these; the
11617: “Christian Year,”—that seemed to be a hymnbook, and she laid it down
11618: again; but _Thomas à Kempis?_—the name had come across her in her
11619: reading, and she felt the satisfaction, which every one knows, of
11620: getting some ideas to attach to a name that strays solitary in the
11621: memory. She took up the little, old, clumsy book with some curiosity;
11622: it had the corners turned down in many places, and some hand, now
11623: forever quiet, had made at certain passages strong pen-and-ink marks,
11624: long since browned by time. Maggie turned from leaf to leaf, and read
11625: where the quiet hand pointed: “Know that the love of thyself doth hurt
11626: thee more than anything in the world.... If thou seekest this or that,
11627: and wouldst be here or there to enjoy thy own will and pleasure, thou
11628: shalt never be quiet nor free from care; for in everything somewhat
11629: will be wanting, and in every place there will be some that will cross
11630: thee.... Both above and below, which way soever thou dost turn thee,
11631: everywhere thou shalt find the Cross; and everywhere of necessity thou
11632: must have patience, if thou wilt have inward peace, and enjoy an
11633: everlasting crown.... If thou desirest to mount unto this height, thou
11634: must set out courageously, and lay the axe to the root, that thou
11635: mayest pluck up and destroy that hidden inordinate inclination to
11636: thyself, and unto all private and earthly good. On this sin, that a man
11637: inordinately loveth himself, almost all dependeth, whatsoever is
11638: thoroughly to be overcome; which evil being once overcome and subdued,
11639: there will presently ensue great peace and tranquillity.... It is but
11640: little thou sufferest in comparison of them that have suffered so much,
11641: were so strongly tempted, so grievously afflicted, so many ways tried
11642: and exercised. Thou oughtest therefore to call to mind the more heavy
11643: sufferings of others, that thou mayest the easier bear thy little
11644: adversities. And if they seem not little unto thee, beware lest thy
11645: impatience be the cause thereof.... Blessed are those ears that receive
11646: the whispers of the divine voice, and listen not to the whisperings of
11647: the world. Blessed are those ears which hearken not unto the voice
11648: which soundeth outwardly, but unto the Truth, which teacheth inwardly.”
11649: 
11650: A strange thrill of awe passed through Maggie while she read, as if she
11651: had been wakened in the night by a strain of solemn music, telling of
11652: beings whose souls had been astir while hers was in stupor. She went on
11653: from one brown mark to another, where the quiet hand seemed to point,
11654: hardly conscious that she was reading, seeming rather to listen while a
11655: low voice said;
11656: 
11657: “Why dost thou here gaze about, since this is not the place of thy
11658: rest? In heaven ought to be thy dwelling, and all earthly things are to
11659: be looked on as they forward thy journey thither. All things pass away,
11660: and thou together with them. Beware thou cleavest not unto them, lest
11661: thou be entangled and perish.... If a man should give all his
11662: substance, yet it is as nothing. And if he should do great penances,
11663: yet are they but little. And if he should attain to all knowledge, he
11664: is yet far off. And if he should be of great virtue, and very fervent
11665: devotion, yet is there much wanting; to wit, one thing, which is most
11666: necessary for him. What is that? That having left all, he leave
11667: himself, and go wholly out of himself, and retain nothing of
11668: self-love.... I have often said unto thee, and now again I say the
11669: same, Forsake thyself, resign thyself, and thou shalt enjoy much inward
11670: peace.... Then shall all vain imaginations, evil perturbations, and
11671: superfluous cares fly away; then shall immoderate fear leave thee, and
11672: inordinate love shall die.”
11673: 
11674: Maggie drew a long breath and pushed her heavy hair back, as if to see
11675: a sudden vision more clearly. Here, then, was a secret of life that
11676: would enable her to renounce all other secrets; here was a sublime
11677: height to be reached without the help of outward things; here was
11678: insight, and strength, and conquest, to be won by means entirely within
11679: her own soul, where a supreme Teacher was waiting to be heard. It
11680: flashed through her like the suddenly apprehended solution of a
11681: problem, that all the miseries of her young life had come from fixing
11682: her heart on her own pleasure, as if that were the central necessity of
11683: the universe; and for the first time she saw the possibility of
11684: shifting the position from which she looked at the gratification of her
11685: own desires,—of taking her stand out of herself, and looking at her own
11686: life as an insignificant part of a divinely guided whole. She read on
11687: and on in the old book, devouring eagerly the dialogues with the
11688: invisible Teacher, the pattern of sorrow, the source of all strength;
11689: returning to it after she had been called away, and reading till the
11690: sun went down behind the willows. With all the hurry of an imagination
11691: that could never rest in the present, she sat in the deepening twilight
11692: forming plans of self-humiliation and entire devotedness; and in the
11693: ardor of first discovery, renunciation seemed to her the entrance into
11694: that satisfaction which she had so long been craving in vain. She had
11695: not perceived—how could she until she had lived longer?—the inmost
11696: truth of the old monk’s out-pourings, that renunciation remains sorrow,
11697: though a sorrow borne willingly. Maggie was still panting for
11698: happiness, and was in ecstasy because she had found the key to it. She
11699: knew nothing of doctrines and systems, of mysticism or quietism; but
11700: this voice out of the far-off middle ages was the direct communication
11701: of a human soul’s belief and experience, and came to Maggie as an
11702: unquestioned message.
11703: 
11704: I suppose that is the reason why the small old-fashioned book, for
11705: which you need only pay sixpence at a book-stall, works miracles to
11706: this day, turning bitter waters into sweetness; while expensive sermons
11707: and treatises, newly issued, leave all things as they were before. It
11708: was written down by a hand that waited for the heart’s prompting; it is
11709: the chronicle of a solitary, hidden anguish, struggle, trust, and
11710: triumph, not written on velvet cushions to teach endurance to those who
11711: are treading with bleeding feet on the stones. And so it remains to all
11712: time a lasting record of human needs and human consolations; the voice
11713: of a brother who, ages ago, felt and suffered and renounced,—in the
11714: cloister, perhaps, with serge gown and tonsured head, with much
11715: chanting and long fasts, and with a fashion of speech different from
11716: ours,—but under the same silent far-off heavens, and with the same
11717: passionate desires, the same strivings, the same failures, the same
11718: weariness.
11719: 
11720: In writing the history of unfashionable families, one is apt to fall
11721: into a tone of emphasis which is very far from being the tone of good
11722: society, where principles and beliefs are not only of an extremely
11723: moderate kind, but are always presupposed, no subjects being eligible
11724: but such as can be touched with a light and graceful irony. But then
11725: good society has its claret and its velvet carpets, its
11726: dinner-engagements six weeks deep, its opera and its faëry ball-rooms;
11727: rides off its _ennui_ on thoroughbred horses; lounges at the club; has
11728: to keep clear of crinoline vortices; gets its science done by Faraday,
11729: and its religion by the superior clergy who are to be met in the best
11730: houses,—how should it have time or need for belief and emphasis? But
11731: good society, floated on gossamer wings of light irony, is of very
11732: expensive production; requiring nothing less than a wide and arduous
11733: national life condensed in unfragrant deafening factories, cramping
11734: itself in mines, sweating at furnaces, grinding, hammering, weaving
11735: under more or less oppression of carbonic acid, or else, spread over
11736: sheepwalks, and scattered in lonely houses and huts on the clayey or
11737: chalky corn-lands, where the rainy days look dreary. This wide national
11738: life is based entirely on emphasis,—the emphasis of want, which urges
11739: it into all the activities necessary for the maintenance of good
11740: society and light irony; it spends its heavy years often in a chill,
11741: uncarpeted fashion, amidst family discord unsoftened by long corridors.
11742: Under such circumstances, there are many among its myriads of souls who
11743: have absolutely needed an emphatic belief, life in this unpleasurable
11744: shape demanding some solution even to unspeculative minds,—just as you
11745: inquire into the stuffing of your couch when anything galls you there,
11746: whereas eider-down and perfect French springs excite no question. Some
11747: have an emphatic belief in alcohol, and seek their _ekstasis_ or
11748: outside standing-ground in gin; but the rest require something that
11749: good society calls “enthusiasm,” something that will present motives in
11750: an entire absence of high prizes; something that will give patience and
11751: feed human love when the limbs ache with weariness, and human looks are
11752: hard upon us; something, clearly, that lies outside personal desires,
11753: that includes resignation for ourselves and active love for what is not
11754: ourselves. Now and then that sort of enthusiasm finds a far-echoing
11755: voice that comes from an experience springing out of the deepest need;
11756: and it was by being brought within the long lingering vibrations of
11757: such a voice that Maggie, with her girl’s face and unnoted sorrows,
11758: found an effort and a hope that helped her through years of loneliness,
11759: making out a faith for herself without the aid of established
11760: authorities and appointed guides; for they were not at hand, and her
11761: need was pressing. From what you know of her, you will not be surprised
11762: that she threw some exaggeration and wilfulness, some pride and
11763: impetuosity, even into her self-renunciation; her own life was still a
11764: drama for her, in which she demanded of herself that her part should be
11765: played with intensity. And so it came to pass that she often lost the
11766: spirit of humility by being excessive in the outward act; she often
11767: strove after too high a flight, and came down with her poor little
11768: half-fledged wings dabbled in the mud. For example, she not only
11769: determined to work at plain sewing, that she might contribute something
11770: toward the fund in the tin box, but she went, in the first instance, in
11771: her zeal of self-mortification, to ask for it at a linen shop in St
11772: Ogg’s, instead of getting it in a more quiet and indirect way; and
11773: could see nothing but what was entirely wrong and unkind, nay,
11774: persecuting, in Tom’s reproof of her for this unnecessary act. “I don’t
11775: like _my_ sister to do such things,” said Tom, “_I’ll_ take care that
11776: the debts are paid, without your lowering yourself in that way.” Surely
11777: there was some tenderness and bravery mingled with the worldliness and
11778: self-assertion of that little speech; but Maggie held it as dross,
11779: overlooking the grains of gold, and took Tom’s rebuke as one of her
11780: outward crosses. Tom was very hard to her, she used to think, in her
11781: long night-watchings,—to her who had always loved him so; and then she
11782: strove to be contented with that hardness, and to require nothing. That
11783: is the path we all like when we set out on our abandonment of
11784: egoism,—the path of martyrdom and endurance, where the palm-branches
11785: grow, rather than the steep highway of tolerance, just allowance, and
11786: self-blame, where there are no leafy honours to be gathered and worn.
11787: 
11788: The old books, Virgil, Euclid, and Aldrich—that wrinkled fruit of the
11789: tree of knowledge—had been all laid by; for Maggie had turned her back
11790: on the vain ambition to share the thoughts of the wise. In her first
11791: ardor she flung away the books with a sort of triumph that she had
11792: risen above the need of them; and if they had been her own, she would
11793: have burned them, believing that she would never repent. She read so
11794: eagerly and constantly in her three books, the Bible, Thomas à Kempis,
11795: and the “Christian Year” (no longer rejected as a “hymn-book”), that
11796: they filled her mind with a continual stream of rhythmic memories; and
11797: she was too ardently learning to see all nature and life in the light
11798: of her new faith, to need any other material for her mind to work on,
11799: as she sat with her well-plied needle, making shirts and other
11800: complicated stitchings, falsely called “plain,”—by no means plain to
11801: Maggie, since wristband and sleeve and the like had a capability of
11802: being sewed in wrong side outward in moments of mental wandering.
11803: 
11804: Hanging diligently over her sewing, Maggie was a sight any one might
11805: have been pleased to look at. That new inward life of hers,
11806: notwithstanding some volcanic upheavings of imprisoned passions, yet
11807: shone out in her face with a tender soft light that mingled itself as
11808: added loveliness with the gradually enriched colour and outline of her
11809: blossoming youth. Her mother felt the change in her with a sort of
11810: puzzled wonder that Maggie should be “growing up so good”; it was
11811: amazing that this once “contrairy” child was become so submissive, so
11812: backward to assert her own will. Maggie used to look up from her work
11813: and find her mother’s eyes fixed upon her; they were watching and
11814: waiting for the large young glance, as if her elder frame got some
11815: needful warmth from it. The mother was getting fond of her tall, brown
11816: girl,—the only bit of furniture now on which she could bestow her
11817: anxiety and pride; and Maggie, in spite of her own ascetic wish to have
11818: no personal adornment, was obliged to give way to her mother about her
11819: hair, and submit to have the abundant black locks plaited into a
11820: coronet on the summit of her head, after the pitiable fashion of those
11821: antiquated times.
11822: 
11823: “Let your mother have that bit o’ pleasure, my dear,” said Mrs
11824: Tulliver; “I’d trouble enough with your hair once.”
11825: 
11826: So Maggie, glad of anything that would soothe her mother, and cheer
11827: their long day together, consented to the vain decoration, and showed a
11828: queenly head above her old frocks, steadily refusing, however, to look
11829: at herself in the glass. Mrs Tulliver liked to call the father’s
11830: attention to Maggie’s hair and other unexpected virtues, but he had a
11831: brusque reply to give.
11832: 
11833: “I knew well enough what she’d be, before now,—it’s nothing new to me.
11834: But it’s a pity she isn’t made o’ commoner stuff; she’ll be thrown
11835: away, I doubt,—there’ll be nobody to marry her as is fit for her.”
11836: 
11837: And Maggie’s graces of mind and body fed his gloom. He sat patiently
11838: enough while she read him a chapter, or said something timidly when
11839: they were alone together about trouble being turned into a blessing. He
11840: took it all as part of his daughter’s goodness, which made his
11841: misfortunes the sadder to him because they damaged her chance in life.
11842: In a mind charged with an eager purpose and an unsatisfied
11843: vindictiveness, there is no room for new feelings; Mr Tulliver did not
11844: want spiritual consolation—he wanted to shake off the degradation of
11845: debt, and to have his revenge.

11848: BOOK FIFTH
11849: 
11850: WHEAT AND TARES.
11851: 
11852: 
11853: Chapter I.
11854: 
11855: In the Red Deeps
11856: 
11857: The family sitting-room was a long room with a window at each end; one
11858: looking toward the croft and along the Ripple to the banks of the
11859: Floss, the other into the mill-yard. Maggie was sitting with her work
11860: against the latter window when she saw Mr Wakem entering the yard, as
11861: usual, on his fine black horse; but not alone, as usual. Some one was
11862: with him,—a figure in a cloak, on a handsome pony. Maggie had hardly
11863: time to feel that it was Philip come back, before they were in front of
11864: the window, and he was raising his hat to her; while his father,
11865: catching the movement by a side-glance, looked sharply round at them
11866: both.
11867: 
11868: Maggie hurried away from the window and carried her work upstairs; for
11869: Mr Wakem sometimes came in and inspected the books, and Maggie felt
11870: that the meeting with Philip would be robbed of all pleasure in the
11871: presence of the two fathers. Some day, perhaps, she could see him when
11872: they could just shake hands, and she could tell him that she remembered
11873: his goodness to Tom, and the things he had said to her in the old days,
11874: though they could never be friends any more. It was not at all
11875: agitating to Maggie to see Philip again; she retained her childish
11876: gratitude and pity toward him, and remembered his cleverness; and in
11877: the early weeks of her loneliness she had continually recalled the
11878: image of him among the people who had been kind to her in life, often
11879: wishing she had him for a brother and a teacher, as they had fancied it
11880: might have been, in their talk together. But that sort of wishing had
11881: been banished along with other dreams that savored of seeking her own
11882: will; and she thought, besides, that Philip might be altered by his
11883: life abroad,—he might have become worldly, and really not care about
11884: her saying anything to him now. And yet his face was wonderfully little
11885: altered,—it was only a larger, more manly copy of the pale,
11886: small-featured boy’s face, with the gray eyes, and the boyish waving
11887: brown hair; there was the old deformity to awaken the old pity; and
11888: after all her meditations, Maggie felt that she really _should_ like to
11889: say a few words to him. He might still be melancholy, as he always used
11890: to be, and like her to look at him kindly. She wondered if he
11891: remembered how he used to like her eyes; with that thought Maggie
11892: glanced toward the square looking-glass which was condemned to hang
11893: with its face toward the wall, and she half started from her seat to
11894: reach it down; but she checked herself and snatched up her work, trying
11895: to repress the rising wishes by forcing her memory to recall snatches
11896: of hymns, until she saw Philip and his father returning along the road,
11897: and she could go down again.
11898: 
11899: It was far on in June now, and Maggie was inclined to lengthen the
11900: daily walk which was her one indulgence; but this day and the following
11901: she was so busy with work which must be finished that she never went
11902: beyond the gate, and satisfied her need of the open air by sitting out
11903: of doors. One of her frequent walks, when she was not obliged to go to
11904: St Ogg’s, was to a spot that lay beyond what was called the “Hill,”—an
11905: insignificant rise of ground crowned by trees, lying along the side of
11906: the road which ran by the gates of Dorlcote Mill. Insignificant I call
11907: it, because in height it was hardly more than a bank; but there may
11908: come moments when Nature makes a mere bank a means toward a fateful
11909: result; and that is why I ask you to imagine this high bank crowned
11910: with trees, making an uneven wall for some quarter of a mile along the
11911: left side of Dorlcote Mill and the pleasant fields behind it, bounded
11912: by the murmuring Ripple. Just where this line of bank sloped down again
11913: to the level, a by-road turned off and led to the other side of the
11914: rise, where it was broken into very capricious hollows and mounds by
11915: the working of an exhausted stone-quarry, so long exhausted that both
11916: mounds and hollows were now clothed with brambles and trees, and here
11917: and there by a stretch of grass which a few sheep kept close-nibbled.
11918: In her childish days Maggie held this place, called the Red Deeps, in
11919: very great awe, and needed all her confidence in Tom’s bravery to
11920: reconcile her to an excursion thither,—visions of robbers and fierce
11921: animals haunting every hollow. But now it had the charm for her which
11922: any broken ground, any mimic rock and ravine, have for the eyes that
11923: rest habitually on the level; especially in summer, when she could sit
11924: on a grassy hollow under the shadow of a branching ash, stooping aslant
11925: from the steep above her, and listen to the hum of insects, like
11926: tiniest bells on the garment of Silence, or see the sunlight piercing
11927: the distant boughs, as if to chase and drive home the truant heavenly
11928: blue of the wild hyacinths. In this June time, too, the dog-roses were
11929: in their glory, and that was an additional reason why Maggie should
11930: direct her walk to the Red Deeps, rather than to any other spot, on the
11931: first day she was free to wander at her will,—a pleasure she loved so
11932: well, that sometimes, in her ardors of renunciation, she thought she
11933: ought to deny herself the frequent indulgence in it.
11934: 
11935: You may see her now, as she walks down the favourite turning and enters
11936: the Deeps by a narrow path through a group of Scotch firs, her tall
11937: figure and old lavender gown visible through an hereditary black silk
11938: shawl of some wide-meshed net-like material; and now she is sure of
11939: being unseen she takes off her bonnet and ties it over her arm. One
11940: would certainly suppose her to be farther on in life than her
11941: seventeenth year—perhaps because of the slow resigned sadness of the
11942: glance from which all search and unrest seem to have departed; perhaps
11943: because her broad-chested figure has the mould of early womanhood.
11944: Youth and health have withstood well the involuntary and voluntary
11945: hardships of her lot, and the nights in which she has lain on the hard
11946: floor for a penance have left no obvious trace; the eyes are liquid,
11947: the brown cheek is firm and round, the full lips are red. With her dark
11948: colouring and jet crown surmounting her tall figure, she seems to have
11949: a sort of kinship with the grand Scotch firs, at which she is looking
11950: up as if she loved them well. Yet one has a sense of uneasiness in
11951: looking at her,—a sense of opposing elements, of which a fierce
11952: collision is imminent; surely there is a hushed expression, such as one
11953: often sees in older faces under borderless caps, out of keeping with
11954: the resistant youth, which one expects to flash out in a sudden,
11955: passionate glance, that will dissipate all the quietude, like a damp
11956: fire leaping out again when all seemed safe.
11957: 
11958: But Maggie herself was not uneasy at this moment. She was calmly
11959: enjoying the free air, while she looked up at the old fir-trees, and
11960: thought that those broken ends of branches were the records of past
11961: storms, which had only made the red stems soar higher. But while her
11962: eyes were still turned upward, she became conscious of a moving shadow
11963: cast by the evening sun on the grassy path before her, and looked down
11964: with a startled gesture to see Philip Wakem, who first raised his hat,
11965: and then, blushing deeply, came forward to her and put out his hand.
11966: Maggie, too, coloured with surprise, which soon gave way to pleasure.
11967: She put out her hand and looked down at the deformed figure before her
11968: with frank eyes, filled for the moment with nothing but the memory of
11969: her child’s feelings,—a memory that was always strong in her. She was
11970: the first to speak.
11971: 
11972: “You startled me,” she said, smiling faintly; “I never meet any one
11973: here. How came you to be walking here? Did you come to meet _me?_”
11974: 
11975: It was impossible not to perceive that Maggie felt herself a child
11976: again.
11977: 
11978: “Yes, I did,” said Philip, still embarrassed; “I wished to see you very
11979: much. I watched a long while yesterday on the bank near your house to
11980: see if you would come out, but you never came. Then I watched again
11981: to-day, and when I saw the way you took, I kept you in sight and came
11982: down the bank, behind there. I hope you will not be displeased with
11983: me.”
11984: 
11985: “No,” said Maggie, with simple seriousness, walking on as if she meant
11986: Philip to accompany her, “I’m very glad you came, for I wished very
11987: much to have an opportunity of speaking to you. I’ve never forgotten
11988: how good you were long ago to Tom, and me too; but I was not sure that
11989: you would remember us so well. Tom and I have had a great deal of
11990: trouble since then, and I think _that_ makes one think more of what
11991: happened before the trouble came.”
11992: 
11993: “I can’t believe that you have thought of me so much as I have thought
11994: of you,” said Philip, timidly. “Do you know, when I was away, I made a
11995: picture of you as you looked that morning in the study when you said
11996: you would not forget me.”
11997: 
11998: Philip drew a large miniature-case from his pocket, and opened it.
11999: Maggie saw her old self leaning on a table, with her black locks
12000: hanging down behind her ears, looking into space, with strange, dreamy
12001: eyes. It was a water-colour sketch, of real merit as a portrait.
12002: 
12003: “Oh dear,” said Maggie, smiling, and flushed with pleasure, “what a
12004: queer little girl I was! I remember myself with my hair in that way, in
12005: that pink frock. I really _was_ like a gypsy. I dare say I am now,” she
12006: added, after a little pause; “am I like what you expected me to be?”
12007: 
12008: The words might have been those of a coquette, but the full, bright
12009: glance Maggie turned on Philip was not that of a coquette. She really
12010: did hope he liked her face as it was now, but it was simply the rising
12011: again of her innate delight in admiration and love. Philip met her eyes
12012: and looked at her in silence for a long moment, before he said quietly,
12013: “No, Maggie.”
12014: 
12015: The light died out a little from Maggie’s face, and there was a slight
12016: trembling of the lip. Her eyelids fell lower, but she did not turn away
12017: her head, and Philip continued to look at her. Then he said slowly:
12018: 
12019: “You are very much more beautiful than I thought you would be.”
12020: 
12021: “Am I?” said Maggie, the pleasure returning in a deeper flush. She
12022: turned her face away from him and took some steps, looking straight
12023: before her in silence, as if she were adjusting her consciousness to
12024: this new idea. Girls are so accustomed to think of dress as the main
12025: ground of vanity, that, in abstaining from the looking-glass, Maggie
12026: had thought more of abandoning all care for adornment than of
12027: renouncing the contemplation of her face. Comparing herself with
12028: elegant, wealthy young ladies, it had not occurred to her that she
12029: could produce any effect with her person. Philip seemed to like the
12030: silence well. He walked by her side, watching her face, as if that
12031: sight left no room for any other wish. They had passed from among the
12032: fir-trees, and had now come to a green hollow almost surrounded by an
12033: amphitheatre of the pale pink dog-roses. But as the light about them
12034: had brightened, Maggie’s face had lost its glow.
12035: 
12036: She stood still when they were in the hollows, and looking at Philip
12037: again, she said in a serious, sad voice:
12038: 
12039: “I wish we could have been friends,—I mean, if it would have been good
12040: and right for us. But that is the trial I have to bear in everything; I
12041: may not keep anything I used to love when I was little. The old books
12042: went; and Tom is different, and my father. It is like death. I must
12043: part with everything I cared for when I was a child. And I must part
12044: with you; we must never take any notice of each other again. That was
12045: what I wanted to speak to you for. I wanted to let you know that Tom
12046: and I can’t do as we like about such things, and that if I behave as if
12047: I had forgotten all about you, it is not out of envy or pride—or—or any
12048: bad feeling.”
12049: 
12050: Maggie spoke with more and more sorrowful gentleness as she went on,
12051: and her eyes began to fill with tears. The deepening expression of pain
12052: on Philip’s face gave him a stronger resemblance to his boyish self,
12053: and made the deformity appeal more strongly to her pity.
12054: 
12055: “I know; I see all that you mean,” he said, in a voice that had become
12056: feebler from discouragement; “I know what there is to keep us apart on
12057: both sides. But it is not right, Maggie,—don’t you be angry with me, I
12058: am so used to call you Maggie in my thoughts,—it is not right to
12059: sacrifice everything to other people’s unreasonable feelings. I would
12060: give up a great deal for _my_ father; but I would not give up a
12061: friendship or—or an attachment of any sort, in obedience to any wish of
12062: his that I didn’t recognise as right.”
12063: 
12064: “I don’t know,” said Maggie, musingly. “Often, when I have been angry
12065: and discontented, it has seemed to me that I was not bound to give up
12066: anything; and I have gone on thinking till it has seemed to me that I
12067: could think away all my duty. But no good has ever come of that; it was
12068: an evil state of mind. I’m quite sure that whatever I might do, I
12069: should wish in the end that I had gone without anything for myself,
12070: rather than have made my father’s life harder to him.”
12071: 
12072: “But would it make his life harder if we were to see each other
12073: sometimes?” said Philip. He was going to say something else, but
12074: checked himself.
12075: 
12076: “Oh, I’m sure he wouldn’t like it. Don’t ask me why, or anything about
12077: it,” said Maggie, in a distressed tone. “My father feels so strongly
12078: about some things. He is not at all happy.”
12079: 
12080: “No more am I,” said Philip, impetuously; “I am not happy.”
12081: 
12082: “Why?” said Maggie, gently. “At least—I ought not to ask—but I’m very,
12083: very sorry.”
12084: 
12085: Philip turned to walk on, as if he had not patience to stand still any
12086: longer, and they went out of the hollow, winding amongst the trees and
12087: bushes in silence. After that last word of Philip’s, Maggie could not
12088: bear to insist immediately on their parting.
12089: 
12090: “I’ve been a great deal happier,” she said at last, timidly, “since I
12091: have given up thinking about what is easy and pleasant, and being
12092: discontented because I couldn’t have my own will. Our life is
12093: determined for us; and it makes the mind very free when we give up
12094: wishing, and only think of bearing what is laid upon us, and doing what
12095: is given us to do.”
12096: 
12097: “But I can’t give up wishing,” said Philip, impatiently. “It seems to
12098: me we can never give up longing and wishing while we are thoroughly
12099: alive. There are certain things we feel to be beautiful and good, and
12100: we _must_ hunger after them. How can we ever be satisfied without them
12101: until our feelings are deadened? I delight in fine pictures; I long to
12102: be able to paint such. I strive and strive, and can’t produce what I
12103: want. That is pain to me, and always _will_ be pain, until my faculties
12104: lose their keenness, like aged eyes. Then there are many other things I
12105: long for,”—here Philip hesitated a little, and then said,—“things that
12106: other men have, and that will always be denied me. My life will have
12107: nothing great or beautiful in it; I would rather not have lived.”
12108: 
12109: “Oh, Philip,” said Maggie, “I wish you didn’t feel so.” But her heart
12110: began to beat with something of Philip’s discontent.
12111: 
12112: “Well, then,” said he, turning quickly round and fixing his gray eyes
12113: entreatingly on her face, “I should be contented to live, if you would
12114: let me see you sometimes.” Then, checked by a fear which her face
12115: suggested, he looked away again and said more calmly, “I have no friend
12116: to whom I can tell everything, no one who cares enough about me; and if
12117: I could only see you now and then, and you would let me talk to you a
12118: little, and show me that you cared for me, and that we may always be
12119: friends in heart, and help each other, then I might come to be glad of
12120: life.”
12121: 
12122: “But how can I see you, Philip?” said Maggie, falteringly. (Could she
12123: really do him good? It would be very hard to say “good-by” this day,
12124: and not speak to him again. Here was a new interest to vary the days;
12125: it was so much easier to renounce the interest before it came.)
12126: 
12127: “If you would let me see you here sometimes,—walk with you here,—I
12128: would be contented if it were only once or twice in a month. _That_
12129: could injure no one’s happiness, and it would sweeten my life.
12130: Besides,” Philip went on, with all the inventive astuteness of love at
12131: one-and-twenty, “if there is any enmity between those who belong to us,
12132: we ought all the more to try and quench it by our friendship; I mean,
12133: that by our influence on both sides we might bring about a healing of
12134: the wounds that have been made in the past, if I could know everything
12135: about them. And I don’t believe there is any enmity in my own father’s
12136: mind; I think he has proved the contrary.”
12137: 
12138: Maggie shook her head slowly, and was silent, under conflicting
12139: thoughts. It seemed to her inclination, that to see Philip now and
12140: then, and keep up the bond of friendship with him, was something not
12141: only innocent, but good; perhaps she might really help him to find
12142: contentment as she had found it. The voice that said this made sweet
12143: music to Maggie; but athwart it there came an urgent, monotonous
12144: warning from another voice which she had been learning to obey,—the
12145: warning that such interviews implied secrecy; implied doing something
12146: she would dread to be discovered in, something that, if discovered,
12147: must cause anger and pain; and that the admission of anything so near
12148: doubleness would act as a spiritual blight. Yet the music would swell
12149: out again, like chimes borne onward by a recurrent breeze, persuading
12150: her that the wrong lay all in the faults and weaknesses of others, and
12151: that there was such a thing as futile sacrifice for one to the injury
12152: of another. It was very cruel for Philip that he should be shrunk from,
12153: because of an unjustifiable vindictiveness toward his father,—poor
12154: Philip, whom some people would shrink from only because he was
12155: deformed. The idea that he might become her lover or that her meeting
12156: him could cause disapproval in that light, had not occurred to her; and
12157: Philip saw the absence of this idea clearly enough, saw it with a
12158: certain pang, although it made her consent to his request the less
12159: unlikely. There was bitterness to him in the perception that Maggie was
12160: almost as frank and unconstrained toward him as when she was a child.
12161: 
12162: “I can’t say either yes or no,” she said at last, turning round and
12163: walking toward the way she come; “I must wait, lest I should decide
12164: wrongly. I must seek for guidance.”
12165: 
12166: “May I come again, then, to-morrow, or the next day, or next week?”
12167: 
12168: “I think I had better write,” said Maggie, faltering again. “I have to
12169: go to St Ogg’s sometimes, and I can put the letter in the post.”
12170: 
12171: “Oh no,” said Philip eagerly; “that would not be so well. My father
12172: might see the letter—and—he has not any enmity, I believe, but he views
12173: things differently from me; he thinks a great deal about wealth and
12174: position. Pray let me come here once more. _Tell_ me when it shall be;
12175: or if you can’t tell me, I will come as often as I can till I do see
12176: you.”
12177: 
12178: “I think it must be so, then,” said Maggie, “for I can’t be quite
12179: certain of coming here any particular evening.”
12180: 
12181: Maggie felt a great relief in adjourning the decision. She was free now
12182: to enjoy the minutes of companionship; she almost thought she might
12183: linger a little; the next time they met she should have to pain Philip
12184: by telling him her determination.
12185: 
12186: “I can’t help thinking,” she said, looking smilingly at him, after a
12187: few moments of silence, “how strange it is that we should have met and
12188: talked to each other, just as if it had been only yesterday when we
12189: parted at Lorton. And yet we must both be very much altered in those
12190: five years,—I think it is five years. How was it you seemed to have a
12191: sort of feeling that I was the same Maggie? I was not quite so sure
12192: that you would be the same; I know you are so clever, and you must have
12193: seen and learnt so much to fill your mind; I was not quite sure you
12194: would care about me now.”
12195: 
12196: “I have never had any doubt that you would be the same, whenever I
12197: might see you,” said Philip,—“I mean, the same in everything that made
12198: me like you better than any one else. I don’t want to explain that; I
12199: don’t think any of the strongest effects our natures are susceptible of
12200: can ever be explained. We can neither detect the process by which they
12201: are arrived at, nor the mode in which they act on us. The greatest of
12202: painters only once painted a mysteriously divine child; he couldn’t
12203: have told how he did it, and we can’t tell why we feel it to be divine.
12204: I think there are stores laid up in our human nature that our
12205: understandings can make no complete inventory of. Certain strains of
12206: music affect me so strangely; I can never hear them without their
12207: changing my whole attitude of mind for a time, and if the effect would
12208: last, I might be capable of heroisms.”
12209: 
12210: “Ah! I know what you mean about music; _I_ feel so,” said Maggie,
12211: clasping her hands with her old impetuosity. “At least,” she added, in
12212: a saddened tone, “I used to feel so when I had any music; I never have
12213: any now except the organ at church.”
12214: 
12215: “And you long for it, Maggie?” said Philip, looking at her with
12216: affectionate pity. “Ah, you can have very little that is beautiful in
12217: your life. Have you many books? You were so fond of them when you were
12218: a little girl.”
12219: 
12220: They were come back to the hollow, round which the dog-roses grew, and
12221: they both paused under the charm of the faëry evening light, reflected
12222: from the pale pink clusters.
12223: 
12224: “No, I have given up books,” said Maggie, quietly, “except a very, very
12225: few.”
12226: 
12227: Philip had already taken from his pocket a small volume, and was
12228: looking at the back as he said:
12229: 
12230: “Ah, this is the second volume, I see, else you might have liked to
12231: take it home with you. I put it in my pocket because I am studying a
12232: scene for a picture.”
12233: 
12234: Maggie had looked at the back too, and saw the title; it revived an old
12235: impression with overmastering force.
12236: 
12237: “‘The Pirate,’” she said, taking the book from Philip’s hands. “Oh, I
12238: began that once; I read to where Minna is walking with Cleveland, and I
12239: could never get to read the rest. I went on with it in my own head, and
12240: I made several endings; but they were all unhappy. I could never make a
12241: happy ending out of that beginning. Poor Minna! I wonder what is the
12242: real end. For a long while I couldn’t get my mind away from the
12243: Shetland Isles,—I used to feel the wind blowing on me from the rough
12244: sea.”
12245: 
12246: Maggie spoke rapidly, with glistening eyes.
12247: 
12248: “Take that volume home with you, Maggie,” said Philip, watching her
12249: with delight. “I don’t want it now. I shall make a picture of you
12250: instead,—you, among the Scotch firs and the slanting shadows.”
12251: 
12252: Maggie had not heard a word he had said; she was absorbed in a page at
12253: which she had opened. But suddenly she closed the book, and gave it
12254: back to Philip, shaking her head with a backward movement, as if to say
12255: “avaunt” to floating visions.
12256: 
12257: “Do keep it, Maggie,” said Philip, entreatingly; “it will give you
12258: pleasure.”
12259: 
12260: “No, thank you,” said Maggie, putting it aside with her hand and
12261: walking on. “It would make me in love with this world again, as I used
12262: to be; it would make me long to see and know many things; it would make
12263: me long for a full life.”
12264: 
12265: “But you will not always be shut up in your present lot; why should you
12266: starve your mind in that way? It is narrow asceticism; I don’t like to
12267: see you persisting in it, Maggie. Poetry and art and knowledge are
12268: sacred and pure.”
12269: 
12270: “But not for me, not for me,” said Maggie, walking more hurriedly;
12271: “because I should want too much. I must wait; this life will not last
12272: long.”
12273: 
12274: “Don’t hurry away from me without saying ‘good-by,’ Maggie,” said
12275: Philip, as they reached the group of Scotch firs, and she continued
12276: still to walk along without speaking. “I must not go any farther, I
12277: think, must I?”
12278: 
12279: “Oh no, I forgot; good-by,” said Maggie, pausing, and putting out her
12280: hand to him. The action brought her feeling back in a strong current to
12281: Philip; and after they had stood looking at each other in silence for a
12282: few moments, with their hands clasped, she said, withdrawing her hand:
12283: 
12284: “I’m very grateful to you for thinking of me all those years. It is
12285: very sweet to have people love us. What a wonderful, beautiful thing it
12286: seems that God should have made your heart so that you could care about
12287: a queer little girl whom you only knew for a few weeks! I remember
12288: saying to you that I thought you cared for me more than Tom did.”
12289: 
12290: “Ah, Maggie,” said Philip, almost fretfully, “you would never love me
12291: so well as you love your brother.”
12292: 
12293: “Perhaps not,” said Maggie, simply; “but then, you know, the first
12294: thing I ever remember in my life is standing with Tom by the side of
12295: the Floss, while he held my hand; everything before that is dark to me.
12296: But I shall never forget you, though we must keep apart.”
12297: 
12298: “Don’t say so, Maggie,” said Philip. “If I kept that little girl in my
12299: mind for five years, didn’t I earn some part in her? She ought not to
12300: take herself quite away from me.”
12301: 
12302: “Not if I were free,” said Maggie; “but I am not, I must submit.” She
12303: hesitated a moment, and then added, “And I wanted to say to you, that
12304: you had better not take more notice of my brother than just bowing to
12305: him. He once told me not to speak to you again, and he doesn’t change
12306: his mind—Oh dear, the sun is set. I am too long away. Good-by.” She
12307: gave him her hand once more.
12308: 
12309: “I shall come here as often as I can till I see you again, Maggie. Have
12310: some feeling for _me_ as well as for others.”
12311: 
12312: “Yes, yes, I have,” said Maggie, hurrying away, and quickly
12313: disappearing behind the last fir-tree; though Philip’s gaze after her
12314: remained immovable for minutes as if he saw her still.
12315: 
12316: Maggie went home, with an inward conflict already begun; Philip went
12317: home to do nothing but remember and hope. You can hardly help blaming
12318: him severely. He was four or five years older than Maggie, and had a
12319: full consciousness of his feeling toward her to aid him in foreseeing
12320: the character his contemplated interviews with her would bear in the
12321: opinion of a third person. But you must not suppose that he was capable
12322: of a gross selfishness, or that he could have been satisfied without
12323: persuading himself that he was seeking to infuse some happiness into
12324: Maggie’s life,—seeking this even more than any direct ends for himself.
12325: He could give her sympathy; he could give her help. There was not the
12326: slightest promise of love toward him in her manner; it was nothing more
12327: than the sweet girlish tenderness she had shown him when she was
12328: twelve. Perhaps she would never love him; perhaps no woman ever _could_
12329: love him. Well, then, he would endure that; he should at least have the
12330: happiness of seeing her, of feeling some nearness to her. And he
12331: clutched passionately the possibility that she _might_ love him;
12332: perhaps the feeling would grow, if she could come to associate him with
12333: that watchful tenderness which her nature would be so keenly alive to.
12334: If any woman could love him, surely Maggie was that woman; there was
12335: such wealth of love in her, and there was no one to claim it all. Then,
12336: the pity of it, that a mind like hers should be withering in its very
12337: youth, like a young forest-tree, for want of the light and space it was
12338: formed to flourish in! Could he not hinder that, by persuading her out
12339: of her system of privation? He would be her guardian angel; he would do
12340: anything, bear anything, for her sake—except not seeing her.
12341: 
12342: 
12343: Chapter II.
12344: 
12345: Aunt Glegg Learns the Breadth of Bob’s Thumb
12346: 
12347: While Maggie’s life-struggles had lain almost entirely within her own
12348: soul, one shadowy army fighting another, and the slain shadows forever
12349: rising again, Tom was engaged in a dustier, noisier warfare, grappling
12350: with more substantial obstacles, and gaining more definite conquests.
12351: So it has been since the days of Hecuba, and of Hector, Tamer of
12352: horses; inside the gates, the women with streaming hair and uplifted
12353: hands offering prayers, watching the world’s combat from afar, filling
12354: their long, empty days with memories and fears; outside, the men, in
12355: fierce struggle with things divine and human, quenching memory in the
12356: stronger light of purpose, losing the sense of dread and even of wounds
12357: in the hurrying ardor of action.
12358: 
12359: From what you have seen of Tom, I think he is not a youth of whom you
12360: would prophesy failure in anything he had thoroughly wished; the wagers
12361: are likely to be on his side, notwithstanding his small success in the
12362: classics. For Tom had never desired success in this field of
12363: enterprise; and for getting a fine flourishing growth of stupidity
12364: there is nothing like pouring out on a mind a good amount of subjects
12365: in which it feels no interest. But now Tom’s strong will bound together
12366: his integrity, his pride, his family regrets, and his personal
12367: ambition, and made them one force, concentrating his efforts and
12368: surmounting discouragements. His uncle Deane, who watched him closely,
12369: soon began to conceive hopes of him, and to be rather proud that he had
12370: brought into the employment of the firm a nephew who appeared to be
12371: made of such good commercial stuff. The real kindness of placing him in
12372: the warehouse first was soon evident to Tom, in the hints his uncle
12373: began to throw out, that after a time he might perhaps be trusted to
12374: travel at certain seasons, and buy in for the firm various vulgar
12375: commodities with which I need not shock refined ears in this place; and
12376: it was doubtless with a view to this result that Mr Deane, when he
12377: expected to take his wine alone, would tell Tom to step in and sit with
12378: him an hour, and would pass that hour in much lecturing and catechising
12379: concerning articles of export and import, with an occasional excursus
12380: of more indirect utility on the relative advantages to the merchants of
12381: St Ogg’s of having goods brought in their own and in foreign bottoms,—a
12382: subject on which Mr Deane, as a ship-owner, naturally threw off a few
12383: sparks when he got warmed with talk and wine.
12384: 
12385: Already, in the second year, Tom’s salary was raised; but all, except
12386: the price of his dinner and clothes, went home into the tin box; and he
12387: shunned comradeship, lest it should lead him into expenses in spite of
12388: himself. Not that Tom was moulded on the spoony type of the Industrious
12389: Apprentice; he had a very strong appetite for pleasure,—would have
12390: liked to be a Tamer of horses and to make a distinguished figure in all
12391: neighbouring eyes, dispensing treats and benefits to others with
12392: well-judged liberality, and being pronounced one of the finest young
12393: fellows of those parts; nay, he determined to achieve these things
12394: sooner or later; but his practical shrewdness told him that the means
12395: to such achievements could only lie for him in present abstinence and
12396: self-denial; there were certain milestones to be passed, and one of the
12397: first was the payment of his father’s debts. Having made up his mind on
12398: that point, he strode along without swerving, contracting some rather
12399: saturnine sternness, as a young man is likely to do who has a premature
12400: call upon him for self-reliance. Tom felt intensely that common cause
12401: with his father which springs from family pride, and was bent on being
12402: irreproachable as a son; but his growing experience caused him to pass
12403: much silent criticism on the rashness and imprudence of his father’s
12404: past conduct; their dispositions were not in sympathy, and Tom’s face
12405: showed little radiance during his few home hours. Maggie had an awe of
12406: him, against which she struggled as something unfair to her
12407: consciousness of wider thoughts and deeper motives; but it was of no
12408: use to struggle. A character at unity with itself—that performs what it
12409: intends, subdues every counteracting impulse, and has no visions beyond
12410: the distinctly possible—is strong by its very negations.
12411: 
12412: You may imagine that Tom’s more and more obvious unlikeness to his
12413: father was well fitted to conciliate the maternal aunts and uncles; and
12414: Mr Deane’s favourable reports and predictions to Mr Glegg concerning
12415: Tom’s qualifications for business began to be discussed amongst them
12416: with various acceptance. He was likely, it appeared, to do the family
12417: credit without causing it any expense and trouble. Mrs Pullet had
12418: always thought it strange if Tom’s excellent complexion, so entirely
12419: that of the Dodsons, did not argue a certainty that he would turn out
12420: well; his juvenile errors of running down the peacock, and general
12421: disrespect to his aunts, only indicating a tinge of Tulliver blood
12422: which he had doubtless outgrown. Mr Glegg, who had contracted a
12423: cautious liking for Tom ever since his spirited and sensible behaviour
12424: when the execution was in the house, was now warming into a resolution
12425: to further his prospects actively,—some time, when an opportunity
12426: offered of doing so in a prudent manner, without ultimate loss; but Mrs
12427: Glegg observed that she was not given to speak without book, as some
12428: people were; that those who said least were most likely to find their
12429: words made good; and that when the right moment came, it would be seen
12430: who could do something better than talk. Uncle Pullet, after silent
12431: meditation for a period of several lozenges, came distinctly to the
12432: conclusion, that when a young man was likely to do well, it was better
12433: not to meddle with him.
12434: 
12435: Tom, meanwhile, had shown no disposition to rely on any one but
12436: himself, though, with a natural sensitiveness toward all indications of
12437: favourable opinion, he was glad to see his uncle Glegg look in on him
12438: sometimes in a friendly way during business hours, and glad to be
12439: invited to dine at his house, though he usually preferred declining on
12440: the ground that he was not sure of being punctual. But about a year
12441: ago, something had occurred which induced Tom to test his uncle Glegg’s
12442: friendly disposition.
12443: 
12444: Bob Jakin, who rarely returned from one of his rounds without seeing
12445: Tom and Maggie, awaited him on the bridge as he was coming home from St
12446: Ogg’s one evening, that they might have a little private talk. He took
12447: the liberty of asking if Mr Tom had ever thought of making money by
12448: trading a bit on his own account. Trading, how? Tom wished to know.
12449: Why, by sending out a bit of a cargo to foreign ports; because Bob had
12450: a particular friend who had offered to do a little business for him in
12451: that way in Laceham goods, and would be glad to serve Mr Tom on the
12452: same footing. Tom was interested at once, and begged for full
12453: explanation, wondering he had not thought of this plan before.
12454: 
12455: He was so well pleased with the prospect of a speculation that might
12456: change the slow process of addition into multiplication, that he at
12457: once determined to mention the matter to his father, and get his
12458: consent to appropriate some of the savings in the tin box to the
12459: purchase of a small cargo. He would rather not have consulted his
12460: father, but he had just paid his last quarter’s money into the tin box,
12461: and there was no other resource. All the savings were there; for Mr
12462: Tulliver would not consent to put the money out at interest lest he
12463: should lose it. Since he had speculated in the purchase of some corn,
12464: and had lost by it, he could not be easy without keeping the money
12465: under his eye.
12466: 
12467: Tom approached the subject carefully, as he was seated on the hearth
12468: with his father that evening, and Mr Tulliver listened, leaning forward
12469: in his arm-chair and looking up in Tom’s face with a sceptical glance.
12470: His first impulse was to give a positive refusal, but he was in some
12471: awe of Tom’s wishes, and since he had the sense of being an “unlucky”
12472: father, he had lost some of his old peremptoriness and determination to
12473: be master. He took the key of the bureau from his pocket, got out the
12474: key of the large chest, and fetched down the tin box,—slowly, as if he
12475: were trying to defer the moment of a painful parting. Then he seated
12476: himself against the table, and opened the box with that little
12477: padlock-key which he fingered in his waistcoat pocket in all vacant
12478: moments. There they were, the dingy bank-notes and the bright
12479: sovereigns, and he counted them out on the table—only a hundred and
12480: sixteen pounds in two years, after all the pinching.
12481: 
12482: “How much do you want, then?” he said, speaking as if the words burnt
12483: his lips.
12484: 
12485: “Suppose I begin with the thirty-six pounds, father?” said Tom.
12486: 
12487: Mr Tulliver separated this sum from the rest, and keeping his hand over
12488: it, said:
12489: 
12490: “It’s as much as I can save out o’ my pay in a year.”
12491: 
12492: “Yes, father; it is such slow work, saving out of the little money we
12493: get. And in this way we might double our savings.”
12494: 
12495: “Ay, my lad,” said the father, keeping his hand on the money, “but you
12496: might lose it,—you might lose a year o’ my life,—and I haven’t got
12497: many.”
12498: 
12499: Tom was silent.
12500: 
12501: “And you know I wouldn’t pay a dividend with the first hundred, because
12502: I wanted to see it all in a lump,—and when I see it, I’m sure on’t. If
12503: you trust to luck, it’s sure to be against me. It’s Old Harry’s got the
12504: luck in his hands; and if I lose one year, I shall never pick it up
12505: again; death ’ull o’ertake me.”
12506: 
12507: Mr Tulliver’s voice trembled, and Tom was silent for a few minutes
12508: before he said:
12509: 
12510: “I’ll give it up, father, since you object to it so strongly.”
12511: 
12512: But, unwilling to abandon the scheme altogether, he determined to ask
12513: his uncle Glegg to venture twenty pounds, on condition of receiving
12514: five per cent. of the profits. That was really a very small thing to
12515: ask. So when Bob called the next day at the wharf to know the decision,
12516: Tom proposed that they should go together to his uncle Glegg’s to open
12517: the business; for his diffident pride clung to him, and made him feel
12518: that Bobs’ tongue would relieve him from some embarrassment.
12519: 
12520: Mr Glegg, at the pleasant hour of four in the afternoon of a hot August
12521: day, was naturally counting his wall-fruit to assure himself that the
12522: sum total had not varied since yesterday. To him entered Tom, in what
12523: appeared to Mr Glegg very questionable companionship,—that of a man
12524: with a pack on his back,—for Bob was equipped for a new journey,—and of
12525: a huge brindled bull-terrier, who walked with a slow, swaying movement
12526: from side to side, and glanced from under his eye-lids with a surly
12527: indifference which might after all be a cover to the most offensive
12528: designs.
12529: 
12530: Mr Glegg’s spectacles, which had been assisting him in counting the
12531: fruit, made these suspicious details alarmingly evident to him.
12532: 
12533: “Heigh! heigh! keep that dog back, will you?” he shouted, snatching up
12534: a stake and holding it before him as a shield when the visitors were
12535: within three yards of him.
12536: 
12537: “Get out wi’ you, Mumps,” said Bob, with a kick. “He’s as quiet as a
12538: lamb, sir,”—an observation which Mumps corroborated by a low growl as
12539: he retreated behind his master’s legs.
12540: 
12541: “Why, what ever does this mean, Tom?” said Mr Glegg. “Have you brought
12542: information about the scoundrels as cut my trees?” If Bob came in the
12543: character of “information,” Mr Glegg saw reasons for tolerating some
12544: irregularity.
12545: 
12546: “No, sir,” said Tom; “I came to speak to you about a little matter of
12547: business of my own.”
12548: 
12549: “Ay—well; but what has this dog got to do with it?” said the old
12550: gentleman, getting mild again.
12551: 
12552: “It’s my dog, sir,” said the ready Bob. “An’ it’s me as put Mr Tom up
12553: to the bit o’ business; for Mr Tom’s been a friend o’ mine iver since I
12554: was a little chap; fust thing iver I did was frightenin’ the birds for
12555: th’ old master. An’ if a bit o’ luck turns up, I’m allays thinkin’ if I
12556: can let Mr Tom have a pull at it. An’ it’s a downright roarin’ shame,
12557: as when he’s got the chance o’ making a bit o’ money wi’ sending goods
12558: out,—ten or twelve per zent clear, when freight an’ commission’s
12559: paid,—as he shouldn’t lay hold o’ the chance for want o’ money. An’
12560: when there’s the Laceham goods,—lors! they’re made o’ purpose for folks
12561: as want to send out a little carguy; light, an’ take up no room,—you
12562: may pack twenty pound so as you can’t see the passill; an’ they’re
12563: manifacturs as please fools, so I reckon they aren’t like to want a
12564: market. An’ I’d go to Laceham an’ buy in the goods for Mr Tom along wi’
12565: my own. An’ there’s the shupercargo o’ the bit of a vessel as is goin’
12566: to take ’em out. I know him partic’lar; he’s a solid man, an’ got a
12567: family i’ the town here. Salt, his name is,—an’ a briny chap he is
12568: too,—an’ if you don’t believe me, I can take you to him.”
12569: 
12570: Uncle Glegg stood open-mouthed with astonishment at this unembarrassed
12571: loquacity, with which his understanding could hardly keep pace. He
12572: looked at Bob, first over his spectacles, then through them, then over
12573: them again; while Tom, doubtful of his uncle’s impression, began to
12574: wish he had not brought this singular Aaron, or mouthpiece. Bob’s talk
12575: appeared less seemly, now some one besides himself was listening to it.
12576: 
12577: “You seem to be a knowing fellow,” said Mr Glegg, at last.
12578: 
12579: “Ay, sir, you say true,” returned Bob, nodding his head aside; “I think
12580: my head’s all alive inside like an old cheese, for I’m so full o’
12581: plans, one knocks another over. If I hadn’t Mumps to talk to, I should
12582: get top-heavy an’ tumble in a fit. I suppose it’s because I niver went
12583: to school much. That’s what I jaw my old mother for. I says, ‘You
12584: should ha’ sent me to school a bit more,’ I says, ‘an’ then I could ha’
12585: read i’ the books like fun, an’ kep’ my head cool an’ empty.’ Lors,
12586: she’s fine an’ comfor’ble now, my old mother is; she ates her baked
12587: meat an’ taters as often as she likes. For I’m gettin’ so full o’
12588: money, I must hev a wife to spend it for me. But it’s botherin,’ a wife
12589: is,—and Mumps mightn’t like her.”
12590: 
12591: Uncle Glegg, who regarded himself as a jocose man since he had retired
12592: from business, was beginning to find Bob amusing, but he had still a
12593: disapproving observation to make, which kept his face serious.
12594: 
12595: “Ah,” he said, “I should think you’re at a loss for ways o’ spending
12596: your money, else you wouldn’t keep that big dog, to eat as much as two
12597: Christians. It’s shameful—shameful!” But he spoke more in sorrow than
12598: in anger, and quickly added:
12599: 
12600: “But, come now, let’s hear more about this business, Tom. I suppose you
12601: want a little sum to make a venture with. But where’s all your own
12602: money? You don’t spend it all—eh?”
12603: 
12604: “No, sir,” said Tom, colouring; “but my father is unwilling to risk it,
12605: and I don’t like to press him. If I could get twenty or thirty pounds
12606: to begin with, I could pay five per cent for it, and then I could
12607: gradually make a little capital of my own, and do without a loan.”
12608: 
12609: “Ay—ay,” said Mr Glegg, in an approving tone; “that’s not a bad notion,
12610: and I won’t say as I wouldn’t be your man. But it ’ull be as well for
12611: me to see this Salt, as you talk on. And then—here’s this friend o’
12612: yours offers to buy the goods for you. Perhaps you’ve got somebody to
12613: stand surety for you if the money’s put into your hands?” added the
12614: cautious old gentleman, looking over his spectacles at Bob.
12615: 
12616: “I don’t think that’s necessary, uncle,” said Tom. “At least, I mean it
12617: would not be necessary for me, because I know Bob well; but perhaps it
12618: would be right for you to have some security.”
12619: 
12620: “You get your percentage out o’ the purchase, I suppose?” said Mr
12621: Glegg, looking at Bob.
12622: 
12623: “No, sir,” said Bob, rather indignantly; “I didn’t offer to get a apple
12624: for Mr Tom, o’ purpose to hev a bite out of it myself. When I play
12625: folks tricks, there’ll be more fun in ’em nor that.”
12626: 
12627: “Well, but it’s nothing but right you should have a small percentage,”
12628: said Mr Glegg. “I’ve no opinion o’ transactions where folks do things
12629: for nothing. It allays looks bad.”
12630: 
12631: “Well, then,” said Bob, whose keenness saw at once what was implied,
12632: “I’ll tell you what I get by’t, an’ it’s money in my pocket in the
12633: end,—I make myself look big, wi’ makin’ a bigger purchase. That’s what
12634: I’m thinking on. Lors! I’m a ’cute chap,—I am.”
12635: 
12636: “Mr Glegg, Mr Glegg!” said a severe voice from the open parlour window,
12637: “pray are you coming in to tea, or are you going to stand talking with
12638: packmen till you get murdered in the open daylight?”
12639: 
12640: “Murdered?” said Mr Glegg; “what’s the woman talking of? Here’s your
12641: nephey Tom come about a bit o’ business.”
12642: 
12643: “Murdered,—yes,—it isn’t many ’sizes ago since a packman murdered a
12644: young woman in a lone place, and stole her thimble, and threw her body
12645: into a ditch.”
12646: 
12647: “Nay, nay,” said Mr Glegg, soothingly, “you’re thinking o’ the man wi’
12648: no legs, as drove a dog-cart.”
12649: 
12650: “Well, it’s the same thing, Mr Glegg, only you’re fond o’ contradicting
12651: what I say; and if my nephey’s come about business, it ’ud be more
12652: fitting if you’d bring him into the house, and let his aunt know about
12653: it, instead o’ whispering in corners, in that plotting, underminding
12654: way.”
12655: 
12656: “Well, well,” said Mr Glegg, “we’ll come in now.”
12657: 
12658: “You needn’t stay here,” said the lady to Bob, in a loud voice, adapted
12659: to the moral, not the physical, distance between them. “We don’t want
12660: anything. I don’t deal wi’ packmen. Mind you shut the gate after you.”
12661: 
12662: “Stop a bit; not so fast,” said Mr Glegg; “I haven’t done with this
12663: young man yet. Come in, Tom; come in,” he added, stepping in at the
12664: French window.
12665: 
12666: “Mr Glegg,” said Mrs G., in a fatal tone, “if you’re going to let that
12667: man and his dog in on my carpet, before my very face, be so good as to
12668: let me know. A wife’s got a right to ask that, I hope.”
12669: 
12670: “Don’t you be uneasy, mum,” said Bob, touching his cap. He saw at once
12671: that Mrs Glegg was a bit of game worth running down, and longed to be
12672: at the sport; “we’ll stay out upo’ the gravel here,—Mumps and me will.
12673: Mumps knows his company,—he does. I might hish at him by th’ hour
12674: together, before he’d fly at a real gentlewoman like you. It’s
12675: wonderful how he knows which is the good-looking ladies; and’s
12676: partic’lar fond of ’em when they’ve good shapes. Lors!” added Bob,
12677: laying down his pack on the gravel, “it’s a thousand pities such a lady
12678: as you shouldn’t deal with a packman, i’ stead o’ goin’ into these
12679: newfangled shops, where there’s half-a-dozen fine gents wi’ their chins
12680: propped up wi’ a stiff stock, a-looking like bottles wi’ ornamental
12681: stoppers, an’ all got to get their dinner out of a bit o’ calico; it
12682: stan’s to reason you must pay three times the price you pay a packman,
12683: as is the nat’ral way o’ gettin’ goods,—an’ pays no rent, an’ isn’t
12684: forced to throttle himself till the lies are squeezed out on him,
12685: whether he will or no. But lors! mum, you know what it is better nor I
12686: do,—_you_ can see through them shopmen, I’ll be bound.”
12687: 
12688: “Yes, I reckon I can, and through the packmen too,” observed Mrs Glegg,
12689: intending to imply that Bob’s flattery had produced no effect on _her;_
12690: while her husband, standing behind her with his hands in his pockets
12691: and legs apart, winked and smiled with conjugal delight at the
12692: probability of his wife’s being circumvented.
12693: 
12694: “Ay, to be sure, mum,” said Bob. “Why, you must ha’ dealt wi’ no end o’
12695: packmen when you war a young lass—before the master here had the luck
12696: to set eyes on you. I know where you lived, I do,—seen th’ house many a
12697: time,—close upon Squire Darleigh’s,—a stone house wi’ steps——”
12698: 
12699: “Ah, that it had,” said Mrs Glegg, pouring out the tea. “You know
12700: something o’ my family, then? Are you akin to that packman with a
12701: squint in his eye, as used to bring th’ Irish linen?”
12702: 
12703: “Look you there now!” said Bob, evasively. “Didn’t I know as you’d
12704: remember the best bargains you’ve made in your life was made wi’
12705: packmen? Why, you see even a squintin’ packman’s better nor a shopman
12706: as can see straight. Lors! if I’d had the luck to call at the stone
12707: house wi’ my pack, as lies here,”—stooping and thumping the bundle
12708: emphatically with his fist,—“an’ th’ handsome young lasses all stannin’
12709: out on the stone steps, it ud’ ha’ been summat like openin’ a pack,
12710: that would. It’s on’y the poor houses now as a packman calls on, if it
12711: isn’t for the sake o’ the sarvant-maids. They’re paltry times, these
12712: are. Why, mum, look at the printed cottons now, an’ what they was when
12713: you wore ’em,—why, you wouldn’t put such a thing on now, I can see. It
12714: must be first-rate quality, the manifactur as you’d buy,—summat as ’ud
12715: wear as well as your own faitures.”
12716: 
12717: “Yes, better quality nor any you’re like to carry; you’ve got nothing
12718: first-rate but brazenness, I’ll be bound,” said Mrs Glegg, with a
12719: triumphant sense of her insurmountable sagacity. “Mr Glegg, are you
12720: going ever to sit down to your tea? Tom, there’s a cup for you.”
12721: 
12722: “You speak true there, mum,” said Bob. “My pack isn’t for ladies like
12723: you. The time’s gone by for that. Bargains picked up dirt cheap! A bit
12724: o’ damage here an’ there, as can be cut out, or else niver seen i’ the
12725: wearin’, but not fit to offer to rich folks as can pay for the look o’
12726: things as nobody sees. I’m not the man as ’ud offer t’ open my pack to
12727: _you_, mum; no, no; I’m a imperent chap, as you say,—these times makes
12728: folks imperent,—but I’m not up to the mark o’ that.”
12729: 
12730: “Why, what goods do you carry in your pack?” said Mrs Glegg.
12731: “Fine-coloured things, I suppose,—shawls an’ that?”
12732: 
12733: “All sorts, mum, all sorts,” said Bob,—thumping his bundle; “but let us
12734: say no more about that, if _you_ please. I’m here upo’ Mr Tom’s
12735: business, an’ I’m not the man to take up the time wi’ my own.”
12736: 
12737: “And pray, what _is_ this business as is to be kept from me?” said Mrs
12738: Glegg, who, solicited by a double curiosity, was obliged to let the
12739: one-half wait.
12740: 
12741: “A little plan o’ nephey Tom’s here,” said good-natured Mr Glegg; “and
12742: not altogether a bad ’un, I think. A little plan for making money;
12743: that’s the right sort o’ plan for young folks as have got their fortin
12744: to make, eh, Jane?”
12745: 
12746: “But I hope it isn’t a plan where he expects iverything to be done for
12747: him by his friends; that’s what the young folks think of mostly
12748: nowadays. And pray, what has this packman got to do wi’ what goes on in
12749: our family? Can’t you speak for yourself, Tom, and let your aunt know
12750: things, as a nephey should?”
12751: 
12752: “This is Bob Jakin, aunt,” said Tom, bridling the irritation that aunt
12753: Glegg’s voice always produced. “I’ve known him ever since we were
12754: little boys. He’s a very good fellow, and always ready to do me a
12755: kindness. And he has had some experience in sending goods out,—a small
12756: part of a cargo as a private speculation; and he thinks if I could
12757: begin to do a little in the same way, I might make some money. A large
12758: interest is got in that way.”
12759: 
12760: “Large int’rest?” said aunt Glegg, with eagerness; “and what do you
12761: call large int’rest?”
12762: 
12763: “Ten or twelve per cent, Bob says, after expenses are paid.”
12764: 
12765: “Then why wasn’t I let to know o’ such things before, Mr Glegg?” said
12766: Mrs Glegg, turning to her husband, with a deep grating tone of
12767: reproach. “Haven’t you allays told me as there was no getting more nor
12768: five per cent?”
12769: 
12770: “Pooh, pooh, nonsense, my good woman,” said Mr Glegg. “You couldn’t go
12771: into trade, could you? You can’t get more than five per cent with
12772: security.”
12773: 
12774: “But I can turn a bit o’ money for you, an’ welcome, mum,” said Bob,
12775: “if you’d like to risk it,—not as there’s any risk to speak on. But if
12776: you’d a mind to lend a bit o’ money to Mr Tom, he’d pay you six or
12777: seven per zent, an’ get a trifle for himself as well; an’ a
12778: good-natur’d lady like you ’ud like the feel o’ the money better if
12779: your nephey took part on it.”
12780: 
12781: “What do you say, Mrs G.?” said Mr Glegg. “I’ve a notion, when I’ve
12782: made a bit more inquiry, as I shall perhaps start Tom here with a bit
12783: of a nest-egg,—he’ll pay me int’rest, you know,—an’ if you’ve got some
12784: little sums lyin’ idle twisted up in a stockin’ toe, or that——”
12785: 
12786: “Mr Glegg, it’s beyond iverything! You’ll go and give information to
12787: the tramps next, as they may come and rob me.”
12788: 
12789: “Well, well, as I was sayin’, if you like to join me wi’ twenty pounds,
12790: you can—I’ll make it fifty. That’ll be a pretty good nest-egg, eh,
12791: Tom?”
12792: 
12793: “You’re not counting on me, Mr Glegg, I hope,” said his wife. “You
12794: could do fine things wi’ my money, I don’t doubt.”
12795: 
12796: “Very well,” said Mr Glegg, rather snappishly, “then we’ll do without
12797: you. I shall go with you to see this Salt,” he added, turning to Bob.
12798: 
12799: “And now, I suppose, you’ll go all the other way, Mr Glegg,” said Mrs
12800: G., “and want to shut me out o’ my own nephey’s business. I never said
12801: I wouldn’t put money into it,—I don’t say as it shall be twenty pounds,
12802: though you’re so ready to say it for me,—but he’ll see some day as his
12803: aunt’s in the right not to risk the money she’s saved for him till it’s
12804: proved as it won’t be lost.”
12805: 
12806: “Ay, that’s a pleasant sort o’risk, that is,” said Mr Glegg,
12807: indiscreetly winking at Tom, who couldn’t avoid smiling. But Bob
12808: stemmed the injured lady’s outburst.
12809: 
12810: “Ay, mum,” he said admiringly, “you know what’s what—you do. An’ it’s
12811: nothing but fair. _You_ see how the first bit of a job answers, an’
12812: then you’ll come down handsome. Lors, it’s a fine thing to hev good
12813: kin. I got my bit of a nest-egg, as the master calls it, all by my own
12814: sharpness,—ten suvreigns it was,—wi’ dousing the fire at Torry’s mill,
12815: an’ it’s growed an’ growed by a bit an’ a bit, till I’n got a matter o’
12816: thirty pound to lay out, besides makin’ my mother comfor’ble. I should
12817: get more, on’y I’m such a soft wi’ the women,—I can’t help lettin’ ’em
12818: hev such good bargains. There’s this bundle, now,” thumping it lustily,
12819: “any other chap ’ud make a pretty penny out on it. But me!—lors, I
12820: shall sell ’em for pretty near what I paid for ’em.”
12821: 
12822: “Have you got a bit of good net, now?” said Mrs Glegg, in a patronizing
12823: tone, moving from the tea-table, and folding her napkin.
12824: 
12825: “Eh, mum, not what you’d think it worth your while to look at. I’d
12826: scorn to show it you. It ’ud be an insult to you.”
12827: 
12828: “But let me see,” said Mrs Glegg, still patronizing. “If they’re
12829: damaged goods, they’re like enough to be a bit the better quality.”
12830: 
12831: “No, mum, I know my place,” said Bob, lifting up his pack and
12832: shouldering it. “I’m not going t’ expose the lowness o’ my trade to a
12833: lady like you. Packs is come down i’ the world; it ’ud cut you to th’
12834: heart to see the difference. I’m at your sarvice, sir, when you’ve a
12835: mind to go and see Salt.”
12836: 
12837: “All in good time,” said Mr Glegg, really unwilling to cut short the
12838: dialogue. “Are you wanted at the wharf, Tom?”
12839: 
12840: “No, sir; I left Stowe in my place.”
12841: 
12842: “Come, put down your pack, and let me see,” said Mrs Glegg, drawing a
12843: chair to the window and seating herself with much dignity.
12844: 
12845: “Don’t you ask it, mum,” said Bob, entreatingly.
12846: 
12847: “Make no more words,” said Mrs Glegg, severely, “but do as I tell you.”
12848: 
12849: “Eh mum, I’m loth, that I am,” said Bob, slowly depositing his pack on
12850: the step, and beginning to untie it with unwilling fingers. “But what
12851: you order shall be done” (much fumbling in pauses between the
12852: sentences). “It’s not as you’ll buy a single thing on me,—I’d be sorry
12853: for you to do it,—for think o’ them poor women up i’ the villages
12854: there, as niver stir a hundred yards from home,—it ’ud be a pity for
12855: anybody to buy up their bargains. Lors, it’s as good as a junketing to
12856: ’em when they see me wi’ my pack, an’ I shall niver pick up such
12857: bargains for ’em again. Least ways, I’ve no time now, for I’m off to
12858: Laceham. See here now,” Bob went on, becoming rapid again, and holding
12859: up a scarlet woollen Kerchief with an embroidered wreath in the corner;
12860: “here’s a thing to make a lass’s mouth water, an’ on’y two shillin’—an’
12861: why? Why, ’cause there’s a bit of a moth-hole ’i this plain end. Lors,
12862: I think the moths an’ the mildew was sent by Providence o’ purpose to
12863: cheapen the goods a bit for the good-lookin’ women as han’t got much
12864: money. If it hadn’t been for the moths, now, every hankicher on ’em ’ud
12865: ha’ gone to the rich, handsome ladies, like you, mum, at five shillin’
12866: apiece,—not a farthin’ less; but what does the moth do? Why, it nibbles
12867: off three shillin’ o’ the price i’ no time; an’ then a packman like me
12868: can carry ’t to the poor lasses as live under the dark thack, to make a
12869: bit of a blaze for ’em. Lors, it’s as good as a fire, to look at such a
12870: hankicher!”
12871: 
12872: Bob held it at a distance for admiration, but Mrs Glegg said sharply:
12873: 
12874: “Yes, but nobody wants a fire this time o’ year. Put these coloured
12875: things by; let me look at your nets, if you’ve got ’em.”
12876: 
12877: “Eh, mum, I told you how it ’ud be,” said Bob, flinging aside the
12878: coloured things with an air of desperation. “I knowed it ud’ turn
12879: again’ you to look at such paltry articles as I carry. Here’s a piece
12880: o’ figured muslin now, what’s the use o’ you lookin’ at it? You might
12881: as well look at poor folks’s victual, mum; it ’ud on’y take away your
12882: appetite. There’s a yard i’ the middle on’t as the pattern’s all
12883: missed,—lors, why, it’s a muslin as the Princess Victoree might ha’
12884: wore; but,” added Bob, flinging it behind him on to the turf, as if to
12885: save Mrs Glegg’s eyes, “it’ll be bought up by the huckster’s wife at
12886: Fibb’s End,—that’s where _it’ll_ go—ten shillin’ for the whole lot—ten
12887: yards, countin’ the damaged un—five-an’-twenty shillin’ ’ud ha’ been
12888: the price, not a penny less. But I’ll say no more, mum; it’s nothing to
12889: you, a piece o’ muslin like that; you can afford to pay three times the
12890: money for a thing as isn’t half so good. It’s nets _you_ talked on;
12891: well, I’ve got a piece as ’ull serve you to make fun on——”
12892: 
12893: “Bring me that muslin,” said Mrs Glegg. “It’s a buff; I’m partial to
12894: buff.”
12895: 
12896: “Eh, but a _damaged_ thing,” said Bob, in a tone of deprecating
12897: disgust. “You’d do nothing with it, mum, you’d give it to the cook, I
12898: know you would, an’ it ’ud be a pity,—she’d look too much like a lady
12899: in it; it’s unbecoming for servants.”
12900: 
12901: “Fetch it, and let me see you measure it,” said Mrs Glegg,
12902: authoritatively.
12903: 
12904: Bob obeyed with ostentatious reluctance.
12905: 
12906: “See what there is over measure!” he said, holding forth the extra
12907: half-yard, while Mrs Glegg was busy examining the damaged yard, and
12908: throwing her head back to see how far the fault would be lost on a
12909: distant view.
12910: 
12911: “I’ll give you six shilling for it,” she said, throwing it down with
12912: the air of a person who mentions an ultimatum.
12913: 
12914: “Didn’t I tell you now, mum, as it ’ud hurt your feelings to look at my
12915: pack? That damaged bit’s turned your stomach now; I see it has,” said
12916: Bob, wrapping the muslin up with the utmost quickness, and apparently
12917: about to fasten up his pack. “You’re used to seein’ a different sort o’
12918: article carried by packmen, when you lived at the stone house. Packs is
12919: come down i’ the world; I told you that; _my_ goods are for common
12920: folks. Mrs Pepper ’ull give me ten shillin’ for that muslin, an’ be
12921: sorry as I didn’t ask her more. Such articles answer i’ the
12922: wearin’,—they keep their colour till the threads melt away i’ the
12923: wash-tub, an’ that won’t be while _I’m_ a young un.”
12924: 
12925: “Well, seven shilling,” said Mrs Glegg.
12926: 
12927: “Put it out o’ your mind, mum, now do,” said Bob. “Here’s a bit o’ net,
12928: then, for you to look at before I tie up my pack, just for you to see
12929: what my trade’s come to,—spotted and sprigged, you see, beautiful but
12930: yallow,—’s been lyin’ by an’ got the wrong colour. I could niver ha’
12931: bought such net, if it hadn’t been yallow. Lors, it’s took me a deal o’
12932: study to know the vally o’ such articles; when I begun to carry a pack,
12933: I was as ignirant as a pig; net or calico was all the same to me. I
12934: thought them things the most vally as was the thickest. I was took in
12935: dreadful, for I’m a straightforrard chap,—up to no tricks, mum. I can
12936: only say my nose is my own, for if I went beyond, I should lose myself
12937: pretty quick. An’ I gev five-an’-eightpence for that piece o’ net,—if I
12938: was to tell y’ anything else I should be tellin’ you fibs,—an’
12939: five-an’-eightpence I shall ask of it, not a penny more, for it’s a
12940: woman’s article, an’ I like to ’commodate the women.
12941: Five-an’-eightpence for six yards,—as cheap as if it was only the dirt
12942: on it as was paid for.’”
12943: 
12944: “I don’t mind having three yards of it,’” said Mrs Glegg.
12945: 
12946: “Why, there’s but six altogether,” said Bob. “No, mum, it isn’t worth
12947: your while; you can go to the shop to-morrow an’ get the same pattern
12948: ready whitened. It’s on’y three times the money; what’s that to a lady
12949: like you?” He gave an emphatic tie to his bundle.
12950: 
12951: “Come, lay me out that muslin,” said Mrs Glegg. “Here’s eight shilling
12952: for it.”
12953: 
12954: “You _will_ be jokin’,” said Bob, looking up with a laughing face; “I
12955: see’d you was a pleasant lady when I fust come to the winder.”
12956: 
12957: “Well, put it me out,” said Mrs Glegg, peremptorily.
12958: 
12959: “But if I let you have it for ten shillin’, mum, you’ll be so good as
12960: not tell nobody. I should be a laughin’-stock; the trade ’ud hoot me,
12961: if they knowed it. I’m obliged to make believe as I ask more nor I do
12962: for my goods, else they’d find out I was a flat. I’m glad you don’t
12963: insist upo’ buyin’ the net, for then I should ha’ lost my two best
12964: bargains for Mrs Pepper o’ Fibb’s End, an’ she’s a rare customer.”
12965: 
12966: “Let me look at the net again,” said Mrs Glegg, yearning after the
12967: cheap spots and sprigs, now they were vanishing.
12968: 
12969: “Well, I can’t deny _you_, mum,” said Bob handing it out.
12970: 
12971: “Eh!, see what a pattern now! Real Laceham goods. Now, this is the sort
12972: o’ article I’m recommendin’ Mr Tom to send out. Lors, it’s a fine thing
12973: for anybody as has got a bit o’ money; these Laceham goods ’ud make it
12974: breed like maggits. If I was a lady wi’ a bit o’ money!—why, I know one
12975: as put thirty pounds into them goods,—a lady wi’ a cork leg, but as
12976: sharp,—you wouldn’t catch _her_ runnin’ her head into a sack; _she’d_
12977: see her way clear out o’ anything afore she’d be in a hurry to start.
12978: Well, she let out thirty pound to a young man in the drapering line,
12979: and he laid it out i’ Laceham goods, an’ a shupercargo o’ my
12980: acquinetance (not Salt) took ’em out, an’ she got her eight per zent
12981: fust go off; an’ now you can’t hold her but she must be sendin’ out
12982: carguies wi’ every ship, till she’s gettin’ as rich as a Jew. Bucks her
12983: name is, she doesn’t live i’ this town. Now then, mum, if you’ll please
12984: to give me the net——”
12985: 
12986: “Here’s fifteen shilling, then, for the two,” said Mrs Glegg. “But it’s
12987: a shameful price.”
12988: 
12989: “Nay, mum, you’ll niver say that when you’re upo’ your knees i’ church
12990: i’ five years’ time. I’m makin’ you a present o’ th’ articles; I am,
12991: indeed. That eightpence shaves off my profits as clean as a razor. Now
12992: then, sir,” continued Bob, shouldering his pack, “if you please, I’ll
12993: be glad to go and see about makin’ Mr Tom’s fortin. Eh, I wish I’d got
12994: another twenty pound to lay out _my_sen; I shouldn’t stay to say my
12995: Catechism afore I knowed what to do wi’t.”
12996: 
12997: “Stop a bit, Mr Glegg,” said the lady, as her husband took his hat,
12998: “you never _will_ give me the chance o’ speaking. You’ll go away now,
12999: and finish everything about this business, and come back and tell me
13000: it’s too late for me to speak. As if I wasn’t my nephey’s own aunt, and
13001: the head o’ the family on his mother’s side! and laid by guineas, all
13002: full weight, for him, as he’ll know who to respect when I’m laid in my
13003: coffin.”
13004: 
13005: “Well, Mrs G., say what you mean,” said Mr G., hastily.
13006: 
13007: “Well, then, I desire as nothing may be done without my knowing. I
13008: don’t say as I sha’n’t venture twenty pounds, if you make out as
13009: everything’s right and safe. And if I do, Tom,” concluded Mrs Glegg,
13010: turning impressively to her nephew, “I hope you’ll allays bear it in
13011: mind and be grateful for such an aunt. I mean you to pay me interest,
13012: you know; I don’t approve o’ giving; we niver looked for that in _my_
13013: family.”
13014: 
13015: “Thank you, aunt,” said Tom, rather proudly. “I prefer having the money
13016: only lent to me.”
13017: 
13018: “Very well; that’s the Dodson sperrit,” said Mrs Glegg, rising to get
13019: her knitting with the sense that any further remark after this would be
13020: bathos.
13021: 
13022: Salt—that eminently “briny chap”—having been discovered in a cloud of
13023: tobacco-smoke at the Anchor Tavern, Mr Glegg commenced inquiries which
13024: turned out satisfactorily enough to warrant the advance of the
13025: “nest-egg,” to which aunt Glegg contributed twenty pounds; and in this
13026: modest beginning you see the ground of a fact which might otherwise
13027: surprise you; namely, Tom’s accumulation of a fund, unknown to his
13028: father, that promised in no very long time to meet the more tardy
13029: process of saving, and quite cover the deficit. When once his attention
13030: had been turned to this source of gain, Tom determined to make the most
13031: of it, and lost no opportunity of obtaining information and extending
13032: his small enterprises. In not telling his father, he was influenced by
13033: that strange mixture of opposite feelings which often gives equal truth
13034: to those who blame an action and those who admire it,—partly, it was
13035: that disinclination to confidence which is seen between near kindred,
13036: that family repulsion which spoils the most sacred relations of our
13037: lives; partly, it was the desire to surprise his father with a great
13038: joy. He did not see that it would have been better to soothe the
13039: interval with a new hope, and prevent the delirium of a too sudden
13040: elation.
13041: 
13042: At the time of Maggie’s first meeting with Philip, Tom had already
13043: nearly a hundred and fifty pounds of his own capital; and while they
13044: were walking by the evening light in the Red Deeps, he, by the same
13045: evening light, was riding into Laceham, proud of being on his first
13046: journey on behalf of Guest & Co., and revolving in his mind all the
13047: chances that by the end of another year he should have doubled his
13048: gains, lifted off the obloquy of debt from his father’s name, and
13049: perhaps—for he should be twenty-one—have got a new start for himself,
13050: on a higher platform of employment. Did he not desire it? He was quite
13051: sure that he did.
13052: 
13053: 
13054: Chapter III.
13055: 
13056: The Wavering Balance
13057: 
13058: I said that Maggie went home that evening from the Red Deeps with a
13059: mental conflict already begun. You have seen clearly enough, in her
13060: interview with Philip, what that conflict was. Here suddenly was an
13061: opening in the rocky wall which shut in the narrow valley of
13062: humiliation, where all her prospect was the remote, unfathomed sky; and
13063: some of the memory-haunting earthly delights were no longer out of her
13064: reach. She might have books, converse, affection; she might hear
13065: tidings of the world from which her mind had not yet lost its sense of
13066: exile; and it would be a kindness to Philip too, who was
13067: pitiable,—clearly not happy. And perhaps here was an opportunity
13068: indicated for making her mind more worthy of its highest service;
13069: perhaps the noblest, completest devoutness could hardly exist without
13070: some width of knowledge; _must_ she always live in this resigned
13071: imprisonment? It was so blameless, so good a thing that there should be
13072: friendship between her and Philip; the motives that forbade it were so
13073: unreasonable, so unchristian! But the severe monotonous warning came
13074: again and again,—that she was losing the simplicity and clearness of
13075: her life by admitting a ground of concealment; and that, by forsaking
13076: the simple rule of renunciation, she was throwing herself under the
13077: seductive guidance of illimitable wants. She thought she had won
13078: strength to obey the warning before she allowed herself the next week
13079: to turn her steps in the evening to the Red Deeps. But while she was
13080: resolved to say an affectionate farewell to Philip, how she looked
13081: forward to that evening walk in the still, fleckered shade of the
13082: hollows, away from all that was harsh and unlovely; to the
13083: affectionate, admiring looks that would meet her; to the sense of
13084: comradeship that childish memories would give to wiser, older talk; to
13085: the certainty that Philip would care to hear everything she said, which
13086: no one else cared for! It was a half-hour that it would be very hard to
13087: turn her back upon, with the sense that there would be no other like
13088: it. Yet she said what she meant to say; she looked firm as well as sad.
13089: 
13090: “Philip, I have made up my mind; it is right that we should give each
13091: other up, in everything but memory. I could not see you without
13092: concealment—stay, I know what you are going to say,—it is other
13093: people’s wrong feelings that make concealment necessary; but
13094: concealment is bad, however it may be caused. I feel that it would be
13095: bad for me, for us both. And then, if our secret were discovered, there
13096: would be nothing but misery,—dreadful anger; and then we must part
13097: after all, and it would be harder, when we were used to seeing each
13098: other.”
13099: 
13100: Philip’s face had flushed, and there was a momentary eagerness of
13101: expression, as if he had been about to resist this decision with all
13102: his might.
13103: 
13104: But he controlled himself, and said, with assumed calmness: “Well,
13105: Maggie, if we must part, let us try and forget it for one half hour;
13106: let us talk together a little while, for the last time.”
13107: 
13108: He took her hand, and Maggie felt no reason to withdraw it; his
13109: quietness made her all the more sure she had given him great pain, and
13110: she wanted to show him how unwillingly she had given it. They walked
13111: together hand in hand in silence.
13112: 
13113: “Let us sit down in the hollow,” said Philip, “where we stood the last
13114: time. See how the dog-roses have strewed the ground, and spread their
13115: opal petals over it.”
13116: 
13117: They sat down at the roots of the slanting ash.
13118: 
13119: “I’ve begun my picture of you among the Scotch firs, Maggie,” said
13120: Philip, “so you must let me study your face a little, while you
13121: stay,—since I am not to see it again. Please turn your head this way.”
13122: 
13123: This was said in an entreating voice, and it would have been very hard
13124: of Maggie to refuse. The full, lustrous face, with the bright black
13125: coronet, looked down like that of a divinity well pleased to be
13126: worshipped, on the pale-hued, small-featured face that was turned up to
13127: it.
13128: 
13129: “I shall be sitting for my second portrait then,” she said, smiling.
13130: “Will it be larger than the other?”
13131: 
13132: “Oh yes, much larger. It is an oil-painting. You will look like a tall
13133: Hamadryad, dark and strong and noble, just issued from one of the
13134: fir-trees, when the stems are casting their afternoon shadows on the
13135: grass.”
13136: 
13137: “You seem to think more of painting than of anything now, Philip?”
13138: 
13139: “Perhaps I do,” said Philip, rather sadly; “but I think of too many
13140: things,—sow all sorts of seeds, and get no great harvest from any one
13141: of them. I’m cursed with susceptibility in every direction, and
13142: effective faculty in none. I care for painting and music; I care for
13143: classic literature, and mediæval literature, and modern literature; I
13144: flutter all ways, and fly in none.”
13145: 
13146: “But surely that is a happiness to have so many tastes,—to enjoy so
13147: many beautiful things, when they are within your reach,” said Maggie,
13148: musingly. “It always seemed to me a sort of clever stupidity only to
13149: have one sort of talent,—almost like a carrier-pigeon.”
13150: 
13151: “It might be a happiness to have many tastes if I were like other men,”
13152: said Philip, bitterly. “I might get some power and distinction by mere
13153: mediocrity, as they do; at least I should get those middling
13154: satisfactions which make men contented to do without great ones. I
13155: might think society at St Ogg’s agreeable then. But nothing could make
13156: life worth the purchase-money of pain to me, but some faculty that
13157: would lift me above the dead level of provincial existence. Yes, there
13158: is one thing,—a passion answers as well as a faculty.”
13159: 
13160: Maggie did not hear the last words; she was struggling against the
13161: consciousness that Philip’s words had set her own discontent vibrating
13162: again as it used to do.
13163: 
13164: “I understand what you mean,” she said, “though I know so much less
13165: than you do. I used to think I could never bear life if it kept on
13166: being the same every day, and I must always be doing things of no
13167: consequence, and never know anything greater. But, dear Philip, I think
13168: we are only like children that some one who is wiser is taking care of.
13169: Is it not right to resign ourselves entirely, whatever may be denied
13170: us? I have found great peace in that for the last two or three years,
13171: even joy in subduing my own will.”
13172: 
13173: “Yes, Maggie,” said Philip, vehemently; “and you are shutting yourself
13174: up in a narrow, self-delusive fanaticism, which is only a way of
13175: escaping pain by starving into dulness all the highest powers of your
13176: nature. Joy and peace are not resignation; resignation is the willing
13177: endurance of a pain that is not allayed, that you don’t expect to be
13178: allayed. Stupefaction is not resignation; and it is stupefaction to
13179: remain in ignorance,—to shut up all the avenues by which the life of
13180: your fellow-men might become known to you. I am not resigned; I am not
13181: sure that life is long enough to learn that lesson. _You_ are not
13182: resigned; you are only trying to stupefy yourself.”
13183: 
13184: Maggie’s lips trembled; she felt there was some truth in what Philip
13185: said, and yet there was a deeper consciousness that, for any immediate
13186: application it had to her conduct, it was no better than falsity. Her
13187: double impression corresponded to the double impulse of the speaker.
13188: Philip seriously believed what he said, but he said it with vehemence
13189: because it made an argument against the resolution that opposed his
13190: wishes. But Maggie’s face, made more childlike by the gathering tears,
13191: touched him with a tenderer, less egotistic feeling. He took her hand
13192: and said gently:
13193: 
13194: “Don’t let us think of such things in this short half-hour, Maggie. Let
13195: us only care about being together. We shall be friends in spite of
13196: separation. We shall always think of each other. I shall be glad to
13197: live as long as you are alive, because I shall think there may always
13198: come a time when I can—when you will let me help you in some way.”
13199: 
13200: “What a dear, good brother you would have been, Philip,” said Maggie,
13201: smiling through the haze of tears. “I think you would have made as much
13202: fuss about me, and been as pleased for me to love you, as would have
13203: satisfied even me. You would have loved me well enough to bear with me,
13204: and forgive me everything. That was what I always longed that Tom
13205: should do. I was never satisfied with a _little_ of anything. That is
13206: why it is better for me to do without earthly happiness altogether. I
13207: never felt that I had enough music,—I wanted more instruments playing
13208: together; I wanted voices to be fuller and deeper. Do you ever sing
13209: now, Philip?” she added abruptly, as if she had forgotten what went
13210: before.
13211: 
13212: “Yes,” he said, “every day, almost. But my voice is only middling, like
13213: everything else in me.”
13214: 
13215: “Oh, sing me something,—just one song. I _may_ listen to that before I
13216: go,—something you used to sing at Lorton on a Saturday afternoon, when
13217: we had the drawing-room all to ourselves, and I put my apron over my
13218: head to listen.”
13219: 
13220: “_I_ know,” said Philip; and Maggie buried her face in her hands while
13221: he sang _sotto voce_, “Love in her eyes sits playing,” and then said,
13222: “That’s it, isn’t it?”
13223: 
13224: “Oh no, I won’t stay,” said Maggie, starting up. “It will only haunt
13225: me. Let us walk, Philip. I must go home.”
13226: 
13227: She moved away, so that he was obliged to rise and follow her.
13228: 
13229: “Maggie,” he said, in a tone of remonstrance, “don’t persist in this
13230: wilful, senseless privation. It makes me wretched to see you benumbing
13231: and cramping your nature in this way. You were so full of life when you
13232: were a child; I thought you would be a brilliant woman,—all wit and
13233: bright imagination. And it flashes out in your face still, until you
13234: draw that veil of dull quiescence over it.”
13235: 
13236: “Why do you speak so bitterly to me, Philip?” said Maggie.
13237: 
13238: “Because I foresee it will not end well; you can never carry on this
13239: self-torture.”
13240: 
13241: “I shall have strength given me,” said Maggie, tremulously.
13242: 
13243: “No, you will not, Maggie; no one has strength given to do what is
13244: unnatural. It is mere cowardice to seek safety in negations. No
13245: character becomes strong in that way. You will be thrown into the world
13246: some day, and then every rational satisfaction of your nature that you
13247: deny now will assault you like a savage appetite.”
13248: 
13249: Maggie started and paused, looking at Philip with alarm in her face.
13250: 
13251: “Philip, how dare you shake me in this way? You are a tempter.”
13252: 
13253: “No, I am not; but love gives insight, Maggie, and insight often gives
13254: foreboding. _Listen_ to me,—let _me_ supply you with books; do let me
13255: see you sometimes,—be your brother and teacher, as you said at Lorton.
13256: It is less wrong that you should see me than that you should be
13257: committing this long suicide.”
13258: 
13259: Maggie felt unable to speak. She shook her head and walked on in
13260: silence, till they came to the end of the Scotch firs, and she put out
13261: her hand in sign of parting.
13262: 
13263: “Do you banish me from this place forever, then, Maggie? Surely I may
13264: come and walk in it sometimes? If I meet you by chance, there is no
13265: concealment in that?”
13266: 
13267: It is the moment when our resolution seems about to become
13268: irrevocable—when the fatal iron gates are about to close upon us—that
13269: tests our strength. Then, after hours of clear reasoning and firm
13270: conviction, we snatch at any sophistry that will nullify our long
13271: struggles, and bring us the defeat that we love better than victory.
13272: 
13273: Maggie felt her heart leap at this subterfuge of Philip’s, and there
13274: passed over her face that almost imperceptible shock which accompanies
13275: any relief. He saw it, and they parted in silence.
13276: 
13277: Philip’s sense of the situation was too complete for him not to be
13278: visited with glancing fears lest he had been intervening too
13279: presumptuously in the action of Maggie’s conscience, perhaps for a
13280: selfish end. But no!—he persuaded himself his end was not selfish. He
13281: had little hope that Maggie would ever return the strong feeling he had
13282: for her; and it must be better for Maggie’s future life, when these
13283: petty family obstacles to her freedom had disappeared, that the present
13284: should not be entirely sacrificed, and that she should have some
13285: opportunity of culture,—some interchange with a mind above the vulgar
13286: level of those she was now condemned to live with. If we only look far
13287: enough off for the consequence of our actions, we can always find some
13288: point in the combination of results by which those actions can be
13289: justified; by adopting the point of view of a Providence who arranges
13290: results, or of a philosopher who traces them, we shall find it possible
13291: to obtain perfect complacency in choosing to do what is most agreeable
13292: to us in the present moment. And it was in this way that Philip
13293: justified his subtle efforts to overcome Maggie’s true prompting
13294: against a concealment that would introduce doubleness into her own
13295: mind, and might cause new misery to those who had the primary natural
13296: claim on her. But there was a surplus of passion in him that made him
13297: half independent of justifying motives. His longing to see Maggie, and
13298: make an element in her life, had in it some of that savage impulse to
13299: snatch an offered joy which springs from a life in which the mental and
13300: bodily constitution have made pain predominate. He had not his full
13301: share in the common good of men; he could not even pass muster with the
13302: insignificant, but must be singled out for pity, and excepted from what
13303: was a matter of course with others. Even to Maggie he was an exception;
13304: it was clear that the thought of his being her lover had never entered
13305: her mind.
13306: 
13307: Do not think too hardly of Philip. Ugly and deformed people have great
13308: need of unusual virtues, because they are likely to be extremely
13309: uncomfortable without them; but the theory that unusual virtues spring
13310: by a direct consequence out of personal disadvantages, as animals get
13311: thicker wool in severe climates, is perhaps a little overstrained. The
13312: temptations of beauty are much dwelt upon, but I fancy they only bear
13313: the same relation to those of ugliness, as the temptation to excess at
13314: a feast, where the delights are varied for eye and ear as well as
13315: palate, bears to the temptations that assail the desperation of hunger.
13316: Does not the Hunger Tower stand as the type of the utmost trial to what
13317: is human in us?
13318: 
13319: Philip had never been soothed by that mother’s love which flows out to
13320: us in the greater abundance because our need is greater, which clings
13321: to us the more tenderly because we are the less likely to be winners in
13322: the game of life; and the sense of his father’s affection and
13323: indulgence toward him was marred by the keener perception of his
13324: father’s faults. Kept aloof from all practical life as Philip had been,
13325: and by nature half feminine in sensitiveness, he had some of the
13326: woman’s intolerant repulsion toward worldliness and the deliberate
13327: pursuit of sensual enjoyment; and this one strong natural tie in his
13328: life,—his relation as a son,—was like an aching limb to him. Perhaps
13329: there is inevitably something morbid in a human being who is in any way
13330: unfavourably excepted from ordinary conditions, until the good force
13331: has had time to triumph; and it has rarely had time for that at
13332: two-and-twenty. That force was present in Philip in much strength, but
13333: the sun himself looks feeble through the morning mists.
13334: 
13335: 
13336: Chapter IV.
13337: 
13338: Another Love-Scene
13339: 
13340: Early in the following April, nearly a year after that dubious parting
13341: you have just witnessed, you may, if you like, again see Maggie
13342: entering the Red Deeps through the group of Scotch firs. But it is
13343: early afternoon and not evening, and the edge of sharpness in the
13344: spring air makes her draw her large shawl close about her and trip
13345: along rather quickly; though she looks round, as usual, that she may
13346: take in the sight of her beloved trees. There is a more eager,
13347: inquiring look in her eyes than there was last June, and a smile is
13348: hovering about her lips, as if some playful speech were awaiting the
13349: right hearer. The hearer was not long in appearing.
13350: 
13351: “Take back your _Corinne_,” said Maggie, drawing a book from under her
13352: shawl. “You were right in telling me she would do me no good; but you
13353: were wrong in thinking I should wish to be like her.”
13354: 
13355: “Wouldn’t you really like to be a tenth Muse, then, Maggie?” said
13356: Philip looking up in her face as we look at a first parting in the
13357: clouds that promises us a bright heaven once more.
13358: 
13359: “Not at all,” said Maggie, laughing. “The Muses were uncomfortable
13360: goddesses, I think,—obliged always to carry rolls and musical
13361: instruments about with them. If I carried a harp in this climate, you
13362: know, I must have a green baize cover for it; and I should be sure to
13363: leave it behind me by mistake.”
13364: 
13365: “You agree with me in not liking Corinne, then?”
13366: 
13367: “I didn’t finish the book,” said Maggie. “As soon as I came to the
13368: blond-haired young lady reading in the park, I shut it up, and
13369: determined to read no further. I foresaw that that light-complexioned
13370: girl would win away all the love from Corinne and make her miserable.
13371: I’m determined to read no more books where the blond-haired women carry
13372: away all the happiness. I should begin to have a prejudice against
13373: them. If you could give me some story, now, where the dark woman
13374: triumphs, it would restore the balance. I want to avenge Rebecca and
13375: Flora MacIvor and Minna, and all the rest of the dark unhappy ones.
13376: Since you are my tutor, you ought to preserve my mind from prejudices;
13377: you are always arguing against prejudices.”
13378: 
13379: “Well, perhaps you will avenge the dark women in your own person, and
13380: carry away all the love from your cousin Lucy. She is sure to have some
13381: handsome young man of St Ogg’s at her feet now; and you have only to
13382: shine upon him—your fair little cousin will be quite quenched in your
13383: beams.”
13384: 
13385: “Philip, that is not pretty of you, to apply my nonsense to anything
13386: real,” said Maggie, looking hurt. “As if I, with my old gowns and want
13387: of all accomplishments, could be a rival of dear little Lucy,—who knows
13388: and does all sorts of charming things, and is ten times prettier than I
13389: am,—even if I were odious and base enough to wish to be her rival.
13390: Besides, I never go to aunt Deane’s when any one is there; it is only
13391: because dear Lucy is good, and loves me, that she comes to see me, and
13392: will have me go to see her sometimes.”
13393: 
13394: “Maggie,” said Philip, with surprise, “it is not like you to take
13395: playfulness literally. You must have been in St Ogg’s this morning, and
13396: brought away a slight infection of dulness.”
13397: 
13398: “Well,” said Maggie, smiling, “if you meant that for a joke, it was a
13399: poor one; but I thought it was a very good reproof. I thought you
13400: wanted to remind me that I am vain, and wish every one to admire me
13401: most. But it isn’t for that that I’m jealous for the dark women,—not
13402: because I’m dark myself; it’s because I always care the most about the
13403: unhappy people. If the blond girl were forsaken, I should like _her_
13404: best. I always take the side of the rejected lover in the stories.”
13405: 
13406: “Then you would never have the heart to reject one yourself, should
13407: you, Maggie?” said Philip, flushing a little.
13408: 
13409: “I don’t know,” said Maggie, hesitatingly. Then with a bright smile, “I
13410: think perhaps I could if he were very conceited; and yet, if he got
13411: extremely humiliated afterward, I should relent.”
13412: 
13413: “I’ve often wondered, Maggie,” Philip said, with some effort, “whether
13414: you wouldn’t really be more likely to love a man that other women were
13415: not likely to love.”
13416: 
13417: “That would depend on what they didn’t like him for,” said Maggie,
13418: laughing. “He might be very disagreeable. He might look at me through
13419: an eye-glass stuck in his eye, making a hideous face, as young Torry
13420: does. I should think other women are not fond of that; but I never felt
13421: any pity for young Torry. I’ve never any pity for conceited people,
13422: because I think they carry their comfort about with them.”
13423: 
13424: “But suppose, Maggie,—suppose it was a man who was not conceited, who
13425: felt he had nothing to be conceited about; who had been marked from
13426: childhood for a peculiar kind of suffering, and to whom you were the
13427: day-star of his life; who loved you, worshipped you, so entirely that
13428: he felt it happiness enough for him if you would let him see you at
13429: rare moments——”
13430: 
13431: Philip paused with a pang of dread lest his confession should cut short
13432: this very happiness,—a pang of the same dread that had kept his love
13433: mute through long months. A rush of self-consciousness told him that he
13434: was besotted to have said all this. Maggie’s manner this morning had
13435: been as unconstrained and indifferent as ever.
13436: 
13437: But she was not looking indifferent now. Struck with the unusual
13438: emotion in Philip’s tone, she had turned quickly to look at him; and as
13439: he went on speaking, a great change came over her face,—a flush and
13440: slight spasm of the features, such as we see in people who hear some
13441: news that will require them to readjust their conceptions of the past.
13442: She was quite silent, and walking on toward the trunk of a fallen tree,
13443: she sat down, as if she had no strength to spare for her muscles. She
13444: was trembling.
13445: 
13446: “Maggie,” said Philip, getting more and more alarmed in every fresh
13447: moment of silence, “I was a fool to say it; forget that I’ve said it. I
13448: shall be contented if things can be as they were.”
13449: 
13450: The distress with which he spoke urged Maggie to say something. “I am
13451: so surprised, Philip; I had not thought of it.” And the effort to say
13452: this brought the tears down too.
13453: 
13454: “Has it made you hate me, Maggie?” said Philip, impetuously. “Do you
13455: think I’m a presumptuous fool?”
13456: 
13457: “Oh, Philip!” said Maggie, “how can you think I have such feelings? As
13458: if I were not grateful for _any_ love. But—but I had never thought of
13459: your being my lover. It seemed so far off—like a dream—only like one of
13460: the stories one imagines—that I should ever have a lover.”
13461: 
13462: “Then can you bear to think of me as your lover, Maggie?” said Philip,
13463: seating himself by her, and taking her hand, in the elation of a sudden
13464: hope. “_Do_ you love me?”
13465: 
13466: Maggie turned rather pale; this direct question seemed not easy to
13467: answer. But her eyes met Philip’s, which were in this moment liquid and
13468: beautiful with beseeching love. She spoke with hesitation, yet with
13469: sweet, simple, girlish tenderness.
13470: 
13471: “I think I could hardly love any one better; there is nothing but what
13472: I love you for.” She paused a little while, and then added: “But it
13473: will be better for us not to say any more about it, won’t it, dear
13474: Philip? You know we couldn’t even be friends, if our friendship were
13475: discovered. I have never felt that I was right in giving way about
13476: seeing you, though it has been so precious to me in some ways; and now
13477: the fear comes upon me strongly again, that it will lead to evil.”
13478: 
13479: “But no evil has come, Maggie; and if you had been guided by that fear
13480: before, you would only have lived through another dreary, benumbing
13481: year, instead of reviving into your real self.”
13482: 
13483: Maggie shook her head. “It has been very sweet, I know,—all the talking
13484: together, and the books, and the feeling that I had the walk to look
13485: forward to, when I could tell you the thoughts that had come into my
13486: head while I was away from you. But it has made me restless; it has
13487: made me think a great deal about the world; and I have impatient
13488: thoughts again,—I get weary of my home; and then it cuts me to the
13489: heart afterward, that I should ever have felt weary of my father and
13490: mother. I think what you call being benumbed was better—better for
13491: me—for then my selfish desires were benumbed.”
13492: 
13493: Philip had risen again, and was walking backward and forward
13494: impatiently.
13495: 
13496: “No, Maggie, you have wrong ideas of self-conquest, as I’ve often told
13497: you. What you call self-conquest—blinding and deafening yourself to all
13498: but one train of impressions—is only the culture of monomania in a
13499: nature like yours.”
13500: 
13501: He had spoken with some irritation, but now he sat down by her again
13502: and took her hand.
13503: 
13504: “Don’t think of the past now, Maggie; think only of our love. If you
13505: can really cling to me with all your heart, every obstacle will be
13506: overcome in time; we need only wait. I can live on hope. Look at me,
13507: Maggie; tell me again it is possible for you to love me. Don’t look
13508: away from me to that cloven tree; it is a bad omen.”
13509: 
13510: She turned her large dark glance upon him with a sad smile.
13511: 
13512: “Come, Maggie, say one kind word, or else you were better to me at
13513: Lorton. You asked me if I should like you to kiss me,—don’t you
13514: remember?—and you promised to kiss me when you met me again. You never
13515: kept the promise.”
13516: 
13517: The recollection of that childish time came as a sweet relief to
13518: Maggie. It made the present moment less strange to her. She kissed him
13519: almost as simply and quietly as she had done when she was twelve years
13520: old. Philip’s eyes flashed with delight, but his next words were words
13521: of discontent.
13522: 
13523: “You don’t seem happy enough, Maggie; you are forcing yourself to say
13524: you love me, out of pity.”
13525: 
13526: “No, Philip,” said Maggie, shaking her head, in her old childish way;
13527: “I’m telling you the truth. It is all new and strange to me; but I
13528: don’t think I could love any one better than I love you. I should like
13529: always to live with you—to make you happy. I have always been happy
13530: when I have been with you. There is only one thing I will not do for
13531: your sake; I will never do anything to wound my father. You must never
13532: ask that from me.”
13533: 
13534: “No, Maggie, I will ask nothing; I will bear everything; I’ll wait
13535: another year only for a kiss, if you will only give me the first place
13536: in your heart.”
13537: 
13538: “No,” said Maggie, smiling, “I won’t make you wait so long as that.”
13539: But then, looking serious again, she added, as she rose from her seat,—
13540: 
13541: “But what would your own father say, Philip? Oh, it is quite impossible
13542: we can ever be more than friends,—brother and sister in secret, as we
13543: have been. Let us give up thinking of everything else.”
13544: 
13545: “No, Maggie, I can’t give you up,—unless you are deceiving me; unless
13546: you really only care for me as if I were your brother. Tell me the
13547: truth.”
13548: 
13549: “Indeed I do, Philip. What happiness have I ever had so great as being
13550: with you,—since I was a little girl,—the days Tom was good to me? And
13551: your mind is a sort of world to me; you can tell me all I want to know.
13552: I think I should never be tired of being with you.”
13553: 
13554: They were walking hand in hand, looking at each other; Maggie, indeed,
13555: was hurrying along, for she felt it time to be gone. But the sense that
13556: their parting was near made her more anxious lest she should have
13557: unintentionally left some painful impression on Philip’s mind. It was
13558: one of those dangerous moments when speech is at once sincere and
13559: deceptive; when feeling, rising high above its average depth, leaves
13560: floodmarks which are never reached again.
13561: 
13562: They stopped to part among the Scotch firs.
13563: 
13564: “Then my life will be filled with hope, Maggie, and I shall be happier
13565: than other men, in spite of all? We _do_ belong to each other—for
13566: always—whether we are apart or together?”
13567: 
13568: “Yes, Philip; I should like never to part; I should like to make your
13569: life very happy.”
13570: 
13571: “I am waiting for something else. I wonder whether it will come.”
13572: 
13573: Maggie smiled, with glistening tears, and then stooped her tall head to
13574: kiss the pale face that was full of pleading, timid love,—like a
13575: woman’s.
13576: 
13577: She had a moment of real happiness then,—a moment of belief that, if
13578: there were sacrifice in this love, it was all the richer and more
13579: satisfying.
13580: 
13581: She turned away and hurried home, feeling that in the hour since she
13582: had trodden this road before, a new era had begun for her. The tissue
13583: of vague dreams must now get narrower and narrower, and all the threads
13584: of thought and emotion be gradually absorbed in the woof of her actual
13585: daily life.
13586: 
13587: 
13588: Chapter V.
13589: 
13590: The Cloven Tree
13591: 
13592: Secrets are rarely betrayed or discovered according to any programme
13593: our fear has sketched out. Fear is almost always haunted by terrible
13594: dramatic scenes, which recur in spite of the best-argued probabilities
13595: against them; and during a year that Maggie had had the burthen of
13596: concealment on her mind, the possibility of discovery had continually
13597: presented itself under the form of a sudden meeting with her father or
13598: Tom when she was walking with Philip in the Red Deeps. She was aware
13599: that this was not one of the most likely events; but it was the scene
13600: that most completely symbolised her inward dread. Those slight indirect
13601: suggestions which are dependent on apparently trivial coincidences and
13602: incalculable states of mind, are the favourite machinery of Fact, but
13603: are not the stuff in which Imagination is apt to work.
13604: 
13605: Certainly one of the persons about whom Maggie’s fears were furthest
13606: from troubling themselves was her aunt Pullet, on whom, seeing that she
13607: did not live in St Ogg’s, and was neither sharp-eyed nor
13608: sharp-tempered, it would surely have been quite whimsical of them to
13609: fix rather than on aunt Glegg. And yet the channel of fatality—the
13610: pathway of the lightning—was no other than aunt Pullet. She did not
13611: live at St Ogg’s, but the road from Garum Firs lay by the Red Deeps, at
13612: the end opposite that by which Maggie entered.
13613: 
13614: The day after Maggie’s last meeting with Philip, being a Sunday on
13615: which Mr Pullet was bound to appear in funeral hatband and scarf at St
13616: Ogg’s church, Mrs Pullet made this the occasion of dining with sister
13617: Glegg, and taking tea with poor sister Tulliver. Sunday was the one day
13618: in the week on which Tom was at home in the afternoon; and today the
13619: brighter spirits he had been in of late had flowed over in unusually
13620: cheerful open chat with his father, and in the invitation, “Come,
13621: Magsie, you come too!” when he strolled out with his mother in the
13622: garden to see the advancing cherry-blossoms. He had been better pleased
13623: with Maggie since she had been less odd and ascetic; he was even
13624: getting rather proud of her; several persons had remarked in his
13625: hearing that his sister was a very fine girl. To-day there was a
13626: peculiar brightness in her face, due in reality to an undercurrent of
13627: excitement, which had as much doubt and pain as pleasure in it; but it
13628: might pass for a sign of happiness.
13629: 
13630: “You look very well, my dear,” said aunt Pullet, shaking her head
13631: sadly, as they sat round the tea-table. “I niver thought your girl ’ud
13632: be so good-looking, Bessy. But you must wear pink, my dear; that blue
13633: thing as your aunt Glegg gave you turns you into a crowflower. Jane
13634: never _was_ tasty. Why don’t you wear that gown o’ mine?”
13635: 
13636: “It is so pretty and so smart, aunt. I think it’s too showy for me,—at
13637: least for my other clothes, that I must wear with it.
13638: 
13639: “To be sure, it ’ud be unbecoming if it wasn’t well known you’ve got
13640: them belonging to you as can afford to give you such things when
13641: they’ve done with ’em themselves. It stands to reason I must give my
13642: own niece clothes now and then,—such things as _I_ buy every year, and
13643: never wear anything out. And as for Lucy, there’s no giving to her, for
13644: she’s got everything o’ the choicest; sister Deane may well hold her
13645: head up,—though she looks dreadful yallow, poor thing—I doubt this
13646: liver complaint ’ull carry her off. That’s what this new vicar, this Dr
13647: Kenn, said in the funeral sermon to-day.”
13648: 
13649: “Ah, he’s a wonderful preacher, by all account,—isn’t he, Sophy?” said
13650: Mrs Tulliver.
13651: 
13652: “Why, Lucy had got a collar on this blessed day,” continued Mrs Pullet,
13653: with her eyes fixed in a ruminating manner, “as I don’t say I haven’t
13654: got as good, but I must look out my best to match it.”
13655: 
13656: “Miss Lucy’s called the bell o’ St Ogg’s, they say; that’s a cur’ous
13657: word,” observed Mr Pullet, on whom the mysteries of etymology sometimes
13658: fell with an oppressive weight.
13659: 
13660: “Pooh!” said Mr Tulliver, jealous for Maggie, “she’s a small thing, not
13661: much of a figure. But fine feathers make fine birds. I see nothing to
13662: admire so much in those diminutive women; they look silly by the side
13663: o’ the men,—out o’ proportion. When I chose my wife, I chose her the
13664: right size,—neither too little nor too big.”
13665: 
13666: The poor wife, with her withered beauty, smiled complacently.
13667: 
13668: “But the men aren’t _all_ big,” said uncle Pullet, not without some
13669: self-reference; “a young fellow may be good-looking and yet not be a
13670: six-foot, like Master Tom here.
13671: 
13672: “Ah, it’s poor talking about littleness and bigness,—anybody may think
13673: it’s a mercy they’re straight,” said aunt Pullet. “There’s that mismade
13674: son o’ Lawyer Wakem’s, I saw him at church to-day. Dear, dear! to think
13675: o’ the property he’s like to have; and they say he’s very queer and
13676: lonely, doesn’t like much company. I shouldn’t wonder if he goes out of
13677: his mind; for we never come along the road but he’s a-scrambling out o’
13678: the trees and brambles at the Red Deeps.”
13679: 
13680: This wide statement, by which Mrs Pullet represented the fact that she
13681: had twice seen Philip at the spot indicated, produced an effect on
13682: Maggie which was all the stronger because Tom sate opposite her, and
13683: she was intensely anxious to look indifferent. At Philip’s name she had
13684: blushed, and the blush deepened every instant from consciousness, until
13685: the mention of the Red Deeps made her feel as if the whole secret were
13686: betrayed, and she dared not even hold her tea-spoon lest she should
13687: show how she trembled. She sat with her hands clasped under the table,
13688: not daring to look round. Happily, her father was seated on the same
13689: side with herself, beyond her uncle Pullet, and could not see her face
13690: without stooping forward. Her mother’s voice brought the first relief,
13691: turning the conversation; for Mrs Tulliver was always alarmed when the
13692: name of Wakem was mentioned in her husband’s presence. Gradually Maggie
13693: recovered composure enough to look up; her eyes met Tom’s, but he
13694: turned away his head immediately; and she went to bed that night
13695: wondering if he had gathered any suspicion from her confusion. Perhaps
13696: not; perhaps he would think it was only her alarm at her aunt’s mention
13697: of Wakem before her father; that was the interpretation her mother had
13698: put on it. To her father, Wakem was like a disfiguring disease, of
13699: which he was obliged to endure the consciousness, but was exasperated
13700: to have the existence recognised by others; and no amount of
13701: sensitiveness in her about her father could be surprising, Maggie
13702: thought.
13703: 
13704: But Tom was too keen-sighted to rest satisfied with such an
13705: interpretation; he had seen clearly enough that there was something
13706: distinct from anxiety about her father in Maggie’s excessive confusion.
13707: In trying to recall all the details that could give shape to his
13708: suspicions, he remembered only lately hearing his mother scold Maggie
13709: for walking in the Red Deeps when the ground was wet, and bringing home
13710: shoes clogged with red soil; still Tom, retaining all his old repulsion
13711: for Philip’s deformity, shrank from attributing to his sister the
13712: probability of feeling more than a friendly interest in such an
13713: unfortunate exception to the common run of men. Tom’s was a nature
13714: which had a sort of superstitious repugnance to everything exceptional.
13715: A love for a deformed man would be odious in any woman, in a sister
13716: intolerable. But if she had been carrying on any kind of intercourse
13717: whatever with Philip, a stop must be put to it at once; she was
13718: disobeying her father’s strongest feelings and her brother’s express
13719: commands, besides compromising herself by secret meetings. He left home
13720: the next morning in that watchful state of mind which turns the most
13721: ordinary course of things into pregnant coincidences.
13722: 
13723: That afternoon, about half-past three o’clock, Tom was standing on the
13724: wharf, talking with Bob Jakin about the probability of the good ship
13725: Adelaide coming in, in a day or two, with results highly important to
13726: both of them.
13727: 
13728: “Eh,” said Bob, parenthetically, as he looked over the fields on the
13729: other side of the river, “there goes that crooked young Wakem. I know
13730: him or his shadder as far off as I can see ’em; I’m allays lighting on
13731: him o’ that side the river.”
13732: 
13733: A sudden thought seemed to have darted through Tom’s mind. “I must go,
13734: Bob,” he said; “I’ve something to attend to,” hurrying off to the
13735: warehouse, where he left notice for some one to take his place; he was
13736: called away home on peremptory business.
13737: 
13738: The swiftest pace and the shortest road took him to the gate, and he
13739: was pausing to open it deliberately, that he might walk into the house
13740: with an appearance of perfect composure, when Maggie came out at the
13741: front door in bonnet and shawl. His conjecture was fulfilled, and he
13742: waited for her at the gate. She started violently when she saw him.
13743: 
13744: “Tom, how is it you are come home? Is there anything the matter?”
13745: Maggie spoke in a low, tremulous voice.
13746: 
13747: “I’m come to walk with you to the Red Deeps, and meet Philip Wakem,”
13748: said Tom, the central fold in his brow, which had become habitual with
13749: him, deepening as he spoke.
13750: 
13751: Maggie stood helpless, pale and cold. By some means, then, Tom knew
13752: everything. At last she said, “I’m not going,” and turned round.
13753: 
13754: “Yes, you are; but I want to speak to you first. Where is my father?”
13755: 
13756: “Out on horseback.”
13757: 
13758: “And my mother?”
13759: 
13760: “In the yard, I think, with the poultry.”
13761: 
13762: “I can go in, then, without her seeing me?”
13763: 
13764: They walked in together, and Tom, entering the parlour, said to Maggie,
13765: “Come in here.”
13766: 
13767: She obeyed, and he closed the door behind her.
13768: 
13769: “Now, Maggie, tell me this instant everything that has passed between
13770: you and Philip Wakem.”
13771: 
13772: “Does my father know anything?” said Maggie, still trembling.
13773: 
13774: “No,” said Tom indignantly. “But he _shall_ know, if you attempt to use
13775: deceit toward me any further.”
13776: 
13777: “I don’t wish to use deceit,” said Maggie, flushing into resentment at
13778: hearing this word applied to her conduct.
13779: 
13780: “Tell me the whole truth, then.”
13781: 
13782: “Perhaps you know it.”
13783: 
13784: “Never mind whether I know it or not. Tell me exactly what has
13785: happened, or my father shall know everything.”
13786: 
13787: “I tell it for my father’s sake, then.”
13788: 
13789: “Yes, it becomes you to profess affection for your father, when you
13790: have despised his strongest feelings.”
13791: 
13792: “You never do wrong, Tom,” said Maggie, tauntingly.
13793: 
13794: “Not if I know it,” answered Tom, with proud sincerity.
13795: 
13796: “But I have nothing to say to you beyond this: tell me what has passed
13797: between you and Philip Wakem. When did you first meet him in the Red
13798: Deeps?”
13799: 
13800: “A year ago,” said Maggie, quietly. Tom’s severity gave her a certain
13801: fund of defiance, and kept her sense of error in abeyance. “You need
13802: ask me no more questions. We have been friendly a year. We have met and
13803: walked together often. He has lent me books.”
13804: 
13805: “Is that all?” said Tom, looking straight at her with his frown.
13806: 
13807: Maggie paused a moment; then, determined to make an end of Tom’s right
13808: to accuse her of deceit, she said haughtily:
13809: 
13810: “No, not quite all. On Saturday he told me that he loved me. I didn’t
13811: think of it before then; I had only thought of him as an old friend.”
13812: 
13813: “And you _encouraged_ him?” said Tom, with an expression of disgust.
13814: 
13815: “I told him that I loved him too.”
13816: 
13817: Tom was silent a few moments, looking on the ground and frowning, with
13818: his hands in his pockets. At last he looked up and said coldly,—
13819: 
13820: “Now, then, Maggie, there are but two courses for you to take,—either
13821: you vow solemnly to me, with your hand on my father’s Bible, that you
13822: will never have another meeting or speak another word in private with
13823: Philip Wakem, or you refuse, and I tell my father everything; and this
13824: month, when by my exertions he might be made happy once more, you will
13825: cause him the blow of knowing that you are a disobedient, deceitful
13826: daughter, who throws away her own respectability by clandestine
13827: meetings with the son of a man that has helped to ruin her father.
13828: Choose!” Tom ended with cold decision, going up to the large Bible,
13829: drawing it forward, and opening it at the fly-leaf, where the writing
13830: was.
13831: 
13832: It was a crushing alternative to Maggie.
13833: 
13834: “Tom,” she said, urged out of pride into pleading, “don’t ask me that.
13835: I will promise you to give up all intercourse with Philip, if you will
13836: let me see him once, or even only write to him and explain
13837: everything,—to give it up as long as it would ever cause any pain to my
13838: father. I feel something for Philip too. _He_ is not happy.”
13839: 
13840: “I don’t wish to hear anything of your feelings; I have said exactly
13841: what I mean. Choose, and quickly, lest my mother should come in.”
13842: 
13843: “If I give you my word, that will be as strong a bond to me as if I
13844: laid my hand on the Bible. I don’t require that to bind me.”
13845: 
13846: “Do what _I_ require,” said Tom. “I can’t trust you, Maggie. There is
13847: no consistency in you. Put your hand on this Bible, and say, ‘I
13848: renounce all private speech and intercourse with Philip Wakem from this
13849: time forth.’ Else you will bring shame on us all, and grief on my
13850: father; and what is the use of my exerting myself and giving up
13851: everything else for the sake of paying my father’s debts, if you are to
13852: bring madness and vexation on him, just when he might be easy and hold
13853: up his head once more?”
13854: 
13855: “Oh, Tom, _will_ the debts be paid soon?” said Maggie, clasping her
13856: hands, with a sudden flash of joy across her wretchedness.
13857: 
13858: “If things turn out as I expect,” said Tom. “But,” he added, his voice
13859: trembling with indignation, “while I have been contriving and working
13860: that my father may have some peace of mind before he dies,—working for
13861: the respectability of our family,—you have done all you can to destroy
13862: both.”
13863: 
13864: Maggie felt a deep movement of compunction; for the moment, her mind
13865: ceased to contend against what she felt to be cruel and unreasonable,
13866: and in her self-blame she justified her brother.
13867: 
13868: “Tom,” she said in a low voice, “it was wrong of me; but I was so
13869: lonely, and I was sorry for Philip. And I think enmity and hatred are
13870: wicked.”
13871: 
13872: “Nonsense!” said Tom. “Your duty was clear enough. Say no more; but
13873: promise, in the words I told you.”
13874: 
13875: “I _must_ speak to Philip once more.”
13876: 
13877: “You will go with me now and speak to him.”
13878: 
13879: “I give you my word not to meet him or write to him again without your
13880: knowledge. That is the only thing I will say. I will put my hand on the
13881: Bible if you like.”
13882: 
13883: “Say it, then.”
13884: 
13885: Maggie laid her hand on the page of manuscript and repeated the
13886: promise. Tom closed the book, and said, “Now let us go.”
13887: 
13888: Not a word was spoken as they walked along. Maggie was suffering in
13889: anticipation of what Philip was about to suffer, and dreading the
13890: galling words that would fall on him from Tom’s lips; but she felt it
13891: was in vain to attempt anything but submission. Tom had his terrible
13892: clutch on her conscience and her deepest dread; she writhed under the
13893: demonstrable truth of the character he had given to her conduct, and
13894: yet her whole soul rebelled against it as unfair from its
13895: incompleteness. He, meanwhile, felt the impetus of his indignation
13896: diverted toward Philip. He did not know how much of an old boyish
13897: repulsion and of mere personal pride and animosity was concerned in the
13898: bitter severity of the words by which he meant to do the duty of a son
13899: and a brother. Tom was not given to inquire subtly into his own motives
13900: any more than into other matters of an intangible kind; he was quite
13901: sure that his own motives as well as actions were good, else he would
13902: have had nothing to do with them.
13903: 
13904: Maggie’s only hope was that something might, for the first time, have
13905: prevented Philip from coming. Then there would be delay,—then she might
13906: get Tom’s permission to write to him. Her heart beat with double
13907: violence when they got under the Scotch firs. It was the last moment of
13908: suspense, she thought; Philip always met her soon after she got beyond
13909: them. But they passed across the more open green space, and entered the
13910: narrow bushy path by the mound. Another turning, and they came so close
13911: upon him that both Tom and Philip stopped suddenly within a yard of
13912: each other. There was a moment’s silence, in which Philip darted a look
13913: of inquiry at Maggie’s face. He saw an answer there, in the pale,
13914: parted lips, and the terrified tension of the large eyes. Her
13915: imagination, always rushing extravagantly beyond an immediate
13916: impression, saw her tall, strong brother grasping the feeble Philip
13917: bodily, crushing him and trampling on him.
13918: 
13919: “Do you call this acting the part of a man and a gentleman, sir?” Tom
13920: said, in a voice of harsh scorn, as soon as Philip’s eyes were turned
13921: on him again.
13922: 
13923: “What do you mean?” answered Philip, haughtily.
13924: 
13925: “Mean? Stand farther from me, lest I should lay hands on you, and I’ll
13926: tell you what I mean. I mean, taking advantage of a young girl’s
13927: foolishness and ignorance to get her to have secret meetings with you.
13928: I mean, daring to trifle with the respectability of a family that has a
13929: good and honest name to support.”
13930: 
13931: “I deny that,” interrupted Philip, impetuously. “I could never trifle
13932: with anything that affected your sister’s happiness. She is dearer to
13933: me than she is to you; I honour her more than you can ever honour her;
13934: I would give up my life to her.”
13935: 
13936: “Don’t talk high-flown nonsense to me, sir! Do you mean to pretend that
13937: you didn’t know it would be injurious to her to meet you here week
13938: after week? Do you pretend you had any right to make professions of
13939: love to her, even if you had been a fit husband for her, when neither
13940: her father nor your father would ever consent to a marriage between
13941: you? And _you_,—_you_ to try and worm yourself into the affections of a
13942: handsome girl who is not eighteen, and has been shut out from the world
13943: by her father’s misfortunes! That’s your crooked notion of honour, is
13944: it? I call it base treachery; I call it taking advantage of
13945: circumstances to win what’s too good for you,—what you’d never get by
13946: fair means.”
13947: 
13948: “It is manly of you to talk in this way to _me_,” said Philip,
13949: bitterly, his whole frame shaken by violent emotions. “Giants have an
13950: immemorial right to stupidity and insolent abuse. You are incapable
13951: even of understanding what I feel for your sister. I feel so much for
13952: her that I could even desire to be at friendship with _you_.”
13953: 
13954: “I should be very sorry to understand your feelings,” said Tom, with
13955: scorching contempt. “What I wish is that you should understand
13956: _me_,—that I shall take care of _my_ sister, and that if you dare to
13957: make the least attempt to come near her, or to write to her, or to keep
13958: the slightest hold on her mind, your puny, miserable body, that ought
13959: to have put some modesty into your mind, shall not protect you. I’ll
13960: thrash you; I’ll hold you up to public scorn. Who wouldn’t laugh at the
13961: idea of _your_ turning lover to a fine girl?”
13962: 
13963: Tom and Maggie walked on in silence for some yards. He burst out, in a
13964: convulsed voice.
13965: 
13966: “Stay, Maggie!” said Philip, making a strong effort to speak. Then
13967: looking at Tom, “You have dragged your sister here, I suppose, that she
13968: may stand by while you threaten and insult me. These naturally seemed
13969: to you the right means to influence me. But you are mistaken. Let your
13970: sister speak. If she says she is bound to give me up, I shall abide by
13971: her wishes to the slightest word.”
13972: 
13973: “It was for my father’s sake, Philip,” said Maggie, imploringly. “Tom
13974: threatens to tell my father, and he couldn’t bear it; I have promised,
13975: I have vowed solemnly, that we will not have any intercourse without my
13976: brother’s knowledge.”
13977: 
13978: “It is enough, Maggie. _I_ shall not change; but I wish you to hold
13979: yourself entirely free. But trust me; remember that I can never seek
13980: for anything but good to what belongs to you.”
13981: 
13982: “Yes,” said Tom, exasperated by this attitude of Philip’s, “you can
13983: talk of seeking good for her and what belongs to her now; did you seek
13984: her good before?”
13985: 
13986: “I did,—at some risk, perhaps. But I wished her to have a friend for
13987: life,—who would cherish her, who would do her more justice than a
13988: coarse and narrow-minded brother, that she has always lavished her
13989: affections on.”
13990: 
13991: “Yes, my way of befriending her is different from yours; and I’ll tell
13992: you what is my way. I’ll save her from disobeying and disgracing her
13993: father; I’ll save her from throwing herself away on you,—from making
13994: herself a laughing-stock,—from being flouted by a man like _your_
13995: father, because she’s not good enough for his son. You know well enough
13996: what sort of justice and cherishing you were preparing for her. I’m not
13997: to be imposed upon by fine words; I can see what actions mean. Come
13998: away, Maggie.”
13999: 
14000: He seized Maggie’s right wrist as he spoke, and she put out her left
14001: hand. Philip clasped it an instant, with one eager look, and then
14002: hurried away.
14003: 
14004: Tom and Maggie walked on in silence for some yards. He was still
14005: holding her wrist tightly, as if he were compelling a culprit from the
14006: scene of action. At last Maggie, with a violent snatch, drew her hand
14007: away, and her pent-up, long-gathered irritation burst into utterance.
14008: 
14009: “Don’t suppose that I think you are right, Tom, or that I bow to your
14010: will. I despise the feelings you have shown in speaking to Philip; I
14011: detest your insulting, unmanly allusions to his deformity. You have
14012: been reproaching other people all your life; you have been always sure
14013: you yourself are right. It is because you have not a mind large enough
14014: to see that there is anything better than your own conduct and your own
14015: petty aims.”
14016: 
14017: “Certainly,” said Tom, coolly. “I don’t see that your conduct is
14018: better, or your aims either. If your conduct, and Philip Wakem’s
14019: conduct, has been right, why are you ashamed of its being known? Answer
14020: me that. I know what I have aimed at in my conduct, and I’ve succeeded;
14021: pray, what good has your conduct brought to you or any one else?”
14022: 
14023: “I don’t want to defend myself,” said Maggie, still with vehemence: “I
14024: know I’ve been wrong,—often, continually. But yet, sometimes when I
14025: have done wrong, it has been because I have feelings that you would be
14026: the better for, if you had them. If _you_ were in fault ever, if you
14027: had done anything very wrong, I should be sorry for the pain it brought
14028: you; I should not want punishment to be heaped on you. But you have
14029: always enjoyed punishing me; you have always been hard and cruel to me;
14030: even when I was a little girl, and always loved you better than any one
14031: else in the world, you would let me go crying to bed without forgiving
14032: me. You have no pity; you have no sense of your own imperfection and
14033: your own sins. It is a sin to be hard; it is not fitting for a mortal,
14034: for a Christian. You are nothing but a Pharisee. You thank God for
14035: nothing but your own virtues; you think they are great enough to win
14036: you everything else. You have not even a vision of feelings by the side
14037: of which your shining virtues are mere darkness!”
14038: 
14039: “Well,” said Tom, with cold scorn, “if your feelings are so much better
14040: than mine, let me see you show them in some other way than by conduct
14041: that’s likely to disgrace us all,—than by ridiculous flights first into
14042: one extreme and then into another. Pray, how have you shown your love,
14043: that you talk of, either to me or my father? By disobeying and
14044: deceiving us. I have a different way of showing my affection.”
14045: 
14046: “Because you are a man, Tom, and have power, and can do something in
14047: the world.”
14048: 
14049: “Then, if you can do nothing, submit to those that can.”
14050: 
14051: “So I _will_ submit to what I acknowledge and feel to be right. I will
14052: submit even to what is unreasonable from my father, but I will not
14053: submit to it from you. You boast of your virtues as if they purchased
14054: you a right to be cruel and unmanly, as you’ve been to-day. Don’t
14055: suppose I would give up Philip Wakem in obedience to you. The deformity
14056: you insult would make me cling to him and care for him the more.”
14057: 
14058: “Very well; that is your view of things.” said Tom, more coldly than
14059: ever; “you need say no more to show me what a wide distance there is
14060: between us. Let us remember that in future, and be silent.”
14061: 
14062: Tom went back to St Ogg’s, to fulfill an appointment with his uncle
14063: Deane, and receive directions about a journey on which he was to set
14064: out the next morning.
14065: 
14066: Maggie went up to her own room to pour out all that indignant
14067: remonstrance, against which Tom’s mind was close barred, in bitter
14068: tears. Then, when the first burst of unsatisfied anger was gone by,
14069: came the recollection of that quiet time before the pleasure which had
14070: ended in to-day’s misery had perturbed the clearness and simplicity of
14071: her life. She used to think in that time that she had made great
14072: conquests, and won a lasting stand on serene heights above worldly
14073: temptations and conflict. And here she was down again in the thick of a
14074: hot strife with her own and others’ passions. Life was not so short,
14075: then, and perfect rest was not so near as she had dreamed when she was
14076: two years younger. There was more struggle for her, and perhaps more
14077: falling. If she had felt that she was entirely wrong, and that Tom had
14078: been entirely right, she could sooner have recovered more inward
14079: harmony; but now her penitence and submission were constantly
14080: obstructed by resentment that would present itself to her no otherwise
14081: than as a just indignation. Her heart bled for Philip; she went on
14082: recalling the insults that had been flung at him with so vivid a
14083: conception of what he had felt under them, that it was almost like a
14084: sharp bodily pain to her, making her beat the floor with her foot and
14085: tighten her fingers on her palm.
14086: 
14087: And yet, how was it that she was now and then conscious of a certain
14088: dim background of relief in the forced separation from Philip? Surely
14089: it was only because the sense of a deliverance from concealment was
14090: welcome at any cost.
14091: 
14092: 
14093: Chapter VI.
14094: 
14095: The Hard-Won Triumph
14096: 
14097: Three weeks later, when Dorlcote Mill was at its prettiest moment in
14098: all the year,—the great chestnuts in blossom, and the grass all deep
14099: and daisied,—Tom Tulliver came home to it earlier than usual in the
14100: evening, and as he passed over the bridge, he looked with the old
14101: deep-rooted affection at the respectable red brick house, which always
14102: seemed cheerful and inviting outside, let the rooms be as bare and the
14103: hearts as sad as they might inside. There is a very pleasant light in
14104: Tom’s blue-gray eyes as he glances at the house-windows; that fold in
14105: his brow never disappears, but it is not unbecoming; it seems to imply
14106: a strength of will that may possibly be without harshness, when the
14107: eyes and mouth have their gentlest expression. His firm step becomes
14108: quicker, and the corners of his mouth rebel against the compression
14109: which is meant to forbid a smile.
14110: 
14111: The eyes in the parlour were not turned toward the bridge just then,
14112: and the group there was sitting in unexpectant silence,—Mr Tulliver in
14113: his arm-chair, tired with a long ride, and ruminating with a worn look,
14114: fixed chiefly on Maggie, who was bending over her sewing while her
14115: mother was making the tea.
14116: 
14117: They all looked up with surprise when they heard the well-known foot.
14118: 
14119: “Why, what’s up now, Tom?” said his father. “You’re a bit earlier than
14120: usual.”
14121: 
14122: “Oh, there was nothing more for me to do, so I came away. Well,
14123: mother!”
14124: 
14125: Tom went up to his mother and kissed her, a sign of unusual good-humour
14126: with him. Hardly a word or look had passed between him and Maggie in
14127: all the three weeks; but his usual incommunicativeness at home
14128: prevented this from being noticeable to their parents.
14129: 
14130: “Father,” said Tom, when they had finished tea, “do you know exactly
14131: how much money there is in the tin box?”
14132: 
14133: “Only a hundred and ninety-three pound,” said Mr Tulliver. “You’ve
14134: brought less o’ late; but young fellows like to have their own way with
14135: their money. Though I didn’t do as I liked before _I_ was of age.” He
14136: spoke with rather timid discontent.
14137: 
14138: “Are you quite sure that’s the sum, father?” said Tom. “I wish you
14139: would take the trouble to fetch the tin box down. I think you have
14140: perhaps made a mistake.”
14141: 
14142: “How should I make a mistake?” said his father, sharply. “I’ve counted
14143: it often enough; but I can fetch it, if you won’t believe me.”
14144: 
14145: It was always an incident Mr Tulliver liked, in his gloomy life, to
14146: fetch the tin box and count the money.
14147: 
14148: “Don’t go out of the room, mother,” said Tom, as he saw her moving when
14149: his father was gone upstairs.
14150: 
14151: “And isn’t Maggie to go?” said Mrs Tulliver; “because somebody must
14152: take away the things.”
14153: 
14154: “Just as she likes,” said Tom indifferently.
14155: 
14156: That was a cutting word to Maggie. Her heart had leaped with the sudden
14157: conviction that Tom was going to tell their father the debts could be
14158: paid; and Tom would have let her be absent when that news was told! But
14159: she carried away the tray and came back immediately. The feeling of
14160: injury on her own behalf could not predominate at that moment.
14161: 
14162: Tom drew to the corner of the table near his father when the tin box
14163: was set down and opened, and the red evening light falling on them made
14164: conspicuous the worn, sour gloom of the dark-eyed father and the
14165: suppressed joy in the face of the fair-complexioned son. The mother and
14166: Maggie sat at the other end of the table, the one in blank patience,
14167: the other in palpitating expectation.
14168: 
14169: Mr Tulliver counted out the money, setting it in order on the table,
14170: and then said, glancing sharply at Tom:
14171: 
14172: “There now! you see I was right enough.”
14173: 
14174: He paused, looking at the money with bitter despondency.
14175: 
14176: “There’s more nor three hundred wanting; it’ll be a fine while before
14177: _I_ can save that. Losing that forty-two pound wi’ the corn was a sore
14178: job. This world’s been too many for me. It’s took four year to lay
14179: _this_ by; it’s much if I’m above ground for another four year. I must
14180: trusten to you to pay ’em,” he went on, with a trembling voice, “if you
14181: keep i’ the same mind now you’re coming o’ age. But you’re like enough
14182: to bury me first.”
14183: 
14184: He looked up in Tom’s face with a querulous desire for some assurance.
14185: 
14186: “No, father,” said Tom, speaking with energetic decision, though there
14187: was tremor discernible in his voice too, “you will live to see the
14188: debts all paid. You shall pay them with your own hand.”
14189: 
14190: His tone implied something more than mere hopefulness or resolution. A
14191: slight electric shock seemed to pass through Mr Tulliver, and he kept
14192: his eyes fixed on Tom with a look of eager inquiry, while Maggie,
14193: unable to restrain herself, rushed to her father’s side and knelt down
14194: by him. Tom was silent a little while before he went on.
14195: 
14196: “A good while ago, my uncle Glegg lent me a little money to trade with,
14197: and that has answered. I have three hundred and twenty pounds in the
14198: bank.”
14199: 
14200: His mother’s arms were round his neck as soon as the last words were
14201: uttered, and she said, half crying:
14202: 
14203: “Oh, my boy, I knew you’d make iverything right again, when you got a
14204: man.”
14205: 
14206: But his father was silent; the flood of emotion hemmed in all power of
14207: speech. Both Tom and Maggie were struck with fear lest the shock of joy
14208: might even be fatal. But the blessed relief of tears came. The broad
14209: chest heaved, the muscles of the face gave way, and the gray-haired man
14210: burst into loud sobs. The fit of weeping gradually subsided, and he sat
14211: quiet, recovering the regularity of his breathing. At last he looked up
14212: at his wife and said, in a gentle tone:
14213: 
14214: “Bessy, you must come and kiss me now—the lad has made you amends.
14215: You’ll see a bit o’ comfort again, belike.”
14216: 
14217: When she had kissed him, and he had held her hand a minute, his
14218: thoughts went back to the money.
14219: 
14220: “I wish you’d brought me the money to look at, Tom,” he said, fingering
14221: the sovereigns on the table; “I should ha’ felt surer.”
14222: 
14223: “You shall see it to-morrow, father,” said Tom. “My uncle Deane has
14224: appointed the creditors to meet to-morrow at the Golden Lion, and he
14225: has ordered a dinner for them at two o’clock. My uncle Glegg and he
14226: will both be there. It was advertised in the ‘Messenger’ on Saturday.”
14227: 
14228: “Then Wakem knows on’t!” said Mr Tulliver, his eye kindling with
14229: triumphant fire. “Ah!” he went on, with a long-drawn guttural
14230: enunciation, taking out his snuff-box, the only luxury he had left
14231: himself, and tapping it with something of his old air of defiance.
14232: “I’ll get from under _his_ thumb now, though I _must_ leave the old
14233: mill. I thought I could ha’ held out to die here—but I can’t——we’ve got
14234: a glass o’ nothing in the house, have we, Bessy?”
14235: 
14236: “Yes,” said Mrs Tulliver, drawing out her much-reduced bunch of keys,
14237: “there’s some brandy sister Deane brought me when I was ill.”
14238: 
14239: “Get it me, then; get it me. I feel a bit weak.”
14240: 
14241: “Tom, my lad,” he said, in a stronger voice, when he had taken some
14242: brandy-and-water, “you shall make a speech to ’em. I’ll tell ’em it’s
14243: you as got the best part o’ the money. They’ll see I’m honest at last,
14244: and ha’ got an honest son. Ah! Wakem ’ud be fine and glad to have a son
14245: like mine,—a fine straight fellow,—i’stead o’ that poor crooked
14246: creatur! You’ll prosper i’ the world, my lad; you’ll maybe see the day
14247: when Wakem and his son ’ull be a round or two below you. You’ll like
14248: enough be ta’en into partnership, as your uncle Deane was before
14249: you,—you’re in the right way for’t; and then there’s nothing to hinder
14250: your getting rich. And if ever you’re rich enough—mind this—try and get
14251: th’ old mill again.”
14252: 
14253: Mr Tulliver threw himself back in his chair; his mind, which had so
14254: long been the home of nothing but bitter discontent and foreboding,
14255: suddenly filled, by the magic of joy, with visions of good fortune. But
14256: some subtle influence prevented him from foreseeing the good fortune as
14257: happening to himself.
14258: 
14259: “Shake hands wi’ me, my lad,” he said, suddenly putting out his hand.
14260: “It’s a great thing when a man can be proud as he’s got a good son.
14261: I’ve had _that_ luck.”
14262: 
14263: Tom never lived to taste another moment so delicious as that; and
14264: Maggie couldn’t help forgetting her own grievances. Tom _was_ good; and
14265: in the sweet humility that springs in us all in moments of true
14266: admiration and gratitude, she felt that the faults he had to pardon in
14267: her had never been redeemed, as his faults were. She felt no jealousy
14268: this evening that, for the first time, she seemed to be thrown into the
14269: background in her father’s mind.
14270: 
14271: There was much more talk before bedtime. Mr Tulliver naturally wanted
14272: to hear all the particulars of Tom’s trading adventures, and he
14273: listened with growing excitement and delight. He was curious to know
14274: what had been said on every occasion; if possible, what had been
14275: thought; and Bob Jakin’s part in the business threw him into peculiar
14276: outbursts of sympathy with the triumphant knowingness of that
14277: remarkable packman. Bob’s juvenile history, so far as it had come under
14278: Mr Tulliver’s knowledge, was recalled with that sense of astonishing
14279: promise it displayed, which is observable in all reminiscences of the
14280: childhood of great men.
14281: 
14282: It was well that there was this interest of narrative to keep under the
14283: vague but fierce sense of triumph over Wakem, which would otherwise
14284: have been the channel his joy would have rushed into with dangerous
14285: force. Even as it was, that feeling from time to time gave threats of
14286: its ultimate mastery, in sudden bursts of irrelevant exclamation.
14287: 
14288: It was long before Mr Tulliver got to sleep that night; and the sleep,
14289: when it came, was filled with vivid dreams. At half-past five o’clock
14290: in the morning, when Mrs Tulliver was already rising, he alarmed her by
14291: starting up with a sort of smothered shout, and looking round in a
14292: bewildered way at the walls of the bedroom.
14293: 
14294: “What’s the matter, Mr Tulliver?” said his wife. He looked at her,
14295: still with a puzzled expression, and said at last:
14296: 
14297: “Ah!—I was dreaming—did I make a noise?—I thought I’d got hold of him.”
14298: 
14299: 
14300: Chapter VII.
14301: 
14302: A Day of Reckoning
14303: 
14304: Mr Tulliver was an essentially sober man,—able to take his glass and
14305: not averse to it, but never exceeding the bounds of moderation. He had
14306: naturally an active Hotspur temperament, which did not crave liquid
14307: fire to set it aglow; his impetuosity was usually equal to an exciting
14308: occasion without any such reinforcements; and his desire for the
14309: brandy-and-water implied that the too sudden joy had fallen with a
14310: dangerous shock on a frame depressed by four years of gloom and
14311: unaccustomed hard fare. But that first doubtful tottering moment
14312: passed, he seemed to gather strength with his gathering excitement; and
14313: the next day, when he was seated at table with his creditors, his eye
14314: kindling and his cheek flushed with the consciousness that he was about
14315: to make an honourable figure once more, he looked more like the proud,
14316: confident, warm-hearted, and warm-tempered Tulliver of old times than
14317: might have seemed possible to any one who had met him a week before,
14318: riding along as had been his wont for the last four years since the
14319: sense of failure and debt had been upon him,—with his head hanging
14320: down, casting brief, unwilling looks on those who forced themselves on
14321: his notice. He made his speech, asserting his honest principles with
14322: his old confident eagerness, alluding to the rascals and the luck that
14323: had been against him, but that he had triumphed over, to some extent,
14324: by hard efforts and the aid of a good son; and winding up with the
14325: story of how Tom had got the best part of the needful money. But the
14326: streak of irritation and hostile triumph seemed to melt for a little
14327: while into purer fatherly pride and pleasure, when, Tom’s health having
14328: been proposed, and uncle Deane having taken occasion to say a few words
14329: of eulogy on his general character and conduct, Tom himself got up and
14330: made the single speech of his life. It could hardly have been briefer.
14331: He thanked the gentlemen for the honour they had done him. He was glad
14332: that he had been able to help his father in proving his integrity and
14333: regaining his honest name; and, for his own part, he hoped he should
14334: never undo that work and disgrace that name. But the applause that
14335: followed was so great, and Tom looked so gentlemanly as well as tall
14336: and straight, that Mr Tulliver remarked, in an explanatory manner, to
14337: his friends on his right and left, that he had spent a deal of money on
14338: his son’s education.
14339: 
14340: The party broke up in very sober fashion at five o’clock. Tom remained
14341: in St Ogg’s to attend to some business, and Mr Tulliver mounted his
14342: horse to go home, and describe the memorable things that had been said
14343: and done, to “poor Bessy and the little wench.” The air of excitement
14344: that hung about him was but faintly due to good cheer or any stimulus
14345: but the potent wine of triumphant joy. He did not choose any back
14346: street to-day, but rode slowly, with uplifted head and free glances,
14347: along the principal street all the way to the bridge.
14348: 
14349: Why did he not happen to meet Wakem? The want of that coincidence vexed
14350: him, and set his mind at work in an irritating way. Perhaps Wakem was
14351: gone out of town to-day on purpose to avoid seeing or hearing anything
14352: of an honourable action which might well cause him some unpleasant
14353: twinges. If Wakem were to meet him then, Mr Tulliver would look
14354: straight at him, and the rascal would perhaps be forsaken a little by
14355: his cool, domineering impudence. He would know by and by that an honest
14356: man was not going to serve _him_ any longer, and lend his honesty to
14357: fill a pocket already over-full of dishonest gains. Perhaps the luck
14358: was beginning to turn; perhaps the Devil didn’t always hold the best
14359: cards in this world.
14360: 
14361: Simmering in this way, Mr Tulliver approached the yardgates of Dorlcote
14362: Mill, near enough to see a well-known figure coming out of them on a
14363: fine black horse. They met about fifty yards from the gates, between
14364: the great chestnuts and elms and the high bank.
14365: 
14366: “Tulliver,” said Wakem, abruptly, in a haughtier tone than usual, “what
14367: a fool’s trick you did,—spreading those hard lumps on that Far Close! I
14368: told you how it would be; but you men never learn to farm with any
14369: method.”
14370: 
14371: “Oh!” said Tulliver, suddenly boiling up; “get somebody else to farm
14372: for you, then, as’ll ask _you_ to teach him.”
14373: 
14374: “You have been drinking, I suppose,” said Wakem, really believing that
14375: this was the meaning of Tulliver’s flushed face and sparkling eyes.
14376: 
14377: “No, I’ve not been drinking,” said Tulliver; “I want no drinking to
14378: help me make up my mind as I’ll serve no longer under a scoundrel.”
14379: 
14380: “Very well! you may leave my premises to-morrow, then; hold your
14381: insolent tongue and let me pass.” (Tulliver was backing his horse
14382: across the road to hem Wakem in.)
14383: 
14384: “No, I _sha’n’t_ let you pass,” said Tulliver, getting fiercer. “I
14385: shall tell you what I think of you first. You’re too big a raskill to
14386: get hanged—you’re——”
14387: 
14388: “Let me pass, you ignorant brute, or I’ll ride over you.”
14389: 
14390: Mr Tulliver, spurring his horse and raising his whip, made a rush
14391: forward; and Wakem’s horse, rearing and staggering backward, threw his
14392: rider from the saddle and sent him sideways on the ground. Wakem had
14393: had the presence of mind to loose the bridle at once, and as the horse
14394: only staggered a few paces and then stood still, he might have risen
14395: and remounted without more inconvenience than a bruise and a shake. But
14396: before he could rise, Tulliver was off his horse too. The sight of the
14397: long-hated predominant man down, and in his power, threw him into a
14398: frenzy of triumphant vengeance, which seemed to give him preternatural
14399: agility and strength. He rushed on Wakem, who was in the act of trying
14400: to recover his feet, grasped him by the left arm so as to press Wakem’s
14401: whole weight on the right arm, which rested on the ground, and flogged
14402: him fiercely across the back with his riding-whip. Wakem shouted for
14403: help, but no help came, until a woman’s scream was heard, and the cry
14404: of “Father, father!”
14405: 
14406: Suddenly, Wakem felt, something had arrested Mr Tulliver’s arm; for the
14407: flogging ceased, and the grasp on his own arm was relaxed.
14408: 
14409: “Get away with you—go!” said Tulliver, angrily. But it was not to Wakem
14410: that he spoke. Slowly the lawyer rose, and, as he turned his head, saw
14411: that Tulliver’s arms were being held by a girl, rather by the fear of
14412: hurting the girl that clung to him with all her young might.
14413: 
14414: “Oh, Luke—mother—come and help Mr Wakem!” Maggie cried, as she heard
14415: the longed-for footsteps.
14416: 
14417: “Help me on to that low horse,” said Wakem to Luke, “then I shall
14418: perhaps manage; though—confound it—I think this arm is sprained.”
14419: 
14420: With some difficulty, Wakem was heaved on to Tulliver’s horse. Then he
14421: turned toward the miller and said, with white rage, “You’ll suffer for
14422: this, sir. Your daughter is a witness that you’ve assaulted me.”
14423: 
14424: “I don’t care,” said Mr Tulliver, in a thick, fierce voice; “go and
14425: show your back, and tell ’em I thrashed you. Tell ’em I’ve made things
14426: a bit more even i’ the world.”
14427: 
14428: “Ride my horse home with me,” said Wakem to Luke. “By the Tofton Ferry,
14429: not through the town.”
14430: 
14431: “Father, come in!” said Maggie, imploringly. Then, seeing that Wakem
14432: had ridden off, and that no further violence was possible, she
14433: slackened her hold and burst into hysteric sobs, while poor Mrs
14434: Tulliver stood by in silence, quivering with fear. But Maggie became
14435: conscious that as she was slackening her hold her father was beginning
14436: to grasp her and lean on her. The surprise checked her sobs.
14437: 
14438: “I feel ill—faintish,” he said. “Help me in, Bessy—I’m giddy—I’ve a
14439: pain i’ the head.”
14440: 
14441: He walked in slowly, propped by his wife and daughter and tottered into
14442: his arm-chair. The almost purple flush had given way to paleness, and
14443: his hand was cold.
14444: 
14445: “Hadn’t we better send for the doctor?” said Mrs Tulliver.
14446: 
14447: He seemed to be too faint and suffering to hear her; but presently,
14448: when she said to Maggie, “Go and seek for somebody to fetch the
14449: doctor,” he looked up at her with full comprehension, and said,
14450: “Doctor? No—no doctor. It’s my head, that’s all. Help me to bed.”
14451: 
14452: Sad ending to the day that had risen on them all like a beginning of
14453: better times! But mingled seed must bear a mingled crop.
14454: 
14455: In half an hour after his father had lain down Tom came home. Bob Jakin
14456: was with him, come to congratulate “the old master,” not without some
14457: excusable pride that he had had his share in bringing about Mr Tom’s
14458: good luck; and Tom had thought his father would like nothing better, as
14459: a finish to the day, than a talk with Bob. But now Tom could only spend
14460: the evening in gloomy expectation of the unpleasant consequences that
14461: must follow on this mad outbreak of his father’s long-smothered hate.
14462: After the painful news had been told, he sat in silence; he had not
14463: spirit or inclination to tell his mother and sister anything about the
14464: dinner; they hardly cared to ask it. Apparently the mingled thread in
14465: the web of their life was so curiously twisted together that there
14466: could be no joy without a sorrow coming close upon it. Tom was dejected
14467: by the thought that his exemplary effort must always be baffled by the
14468: wrong-doing of others; Maggie was living through, over and over again,
14469: the agony of the moment in which she had rushed to throw herself on her
14470: father’s arm, with a vague, shuddering foreboding of wretched scenes to
14471: come. Not one of the three felt any particular alarm about Mr
14472: Tulliver’s health; the symptoms did not recall his former dangerous
14473: attack, and it seemed only a necessary consequence that his violent
14474: passion and effort of strength, after many hours of unusual excitement,
14475: should have made him feel ill. Rest would probably cure him.
14476: 
14477: Tom, tired out by his active day, fell asleep soon, and slept soundly;
14478: it seemed to him as if he had only just come to bed, when he waked to
14479: see his mother standing by him in the gray light of early morning.
14480: 
14481: “My boy, you must get up this minute; I’ve sent for the doctor, and
14482: your father wants you and Maggie to come to him.”
14483: 
14484: “Is he worse, mother?”
14485: 
14486: “He’s been very ill all night with his head, but he doesn’t say it’s
14487: worse; he only said suddenly, ‘Bessy, fetch the boy and girl. Tell ’em
14488: to make haste.’”
14489: 
14490: Maggie and Tom threw on their clothes hastily in the chill gray light,
14491: and reached their father’s room almost at the same moment. He was
14492: watching for them with an expression of pain on his brow, but with
14493: sharpened, anxious consciousness in his eyes. Mrs Tulliver stood at the
14494: foot of the bed, frightened and trembling, looking worn and aged from
14495: disturbed rest. Maggie was at the bedside first, but her father’s
14496: glance was toward Tom, who came and stood next to her.
14497: 
14498: “Tom, my lad, it’s come upon me as I sha’n’t get up again. This world’s
14499: been too many for me, my lad, but you’ve done what you could to make
14500: things a bit even. Shake hands wi’ me again, my lad, before I go away
14501: from you.”
14502: 
14503: The father and son clasped hands and looked at each other an instant.
14504: Then Tom said, trying to speak firmly,—
14505: 
14506: “Have you any wish, father—that I can fulfil, when——”
14507: 
14508: “Ay, my lad—you’ll try and get the old mill back.”
14509: 
14510: “Yes, father.”
14511: 
14512: “And there’s your mother—you’ll try and make her amends, all you can,
14513: for my bad luck—and there’s the little wench——”
14514: 
14515: The father turned his eyes on Maggie with a still more eager look,
14516: while she, with a bursting heart, sank on her knees, to be closer to
14517: the dear, time-worn face which had been present with her through long
14518: years, as the sign of her deepest love and hardest trial.
14519: 
14520: “You must take care of her, Tom—don’t you fret, my wench—there’ll come
14521: somebody as’ll love you and take your part—and you must be good to her,
14522: my lad. I was good to _my_ sister. Kiss me, Maggie.—Come, Bessy.—You’ll
14523: manage to pay for a brick grave, Tom, so as your mother and me can lie
14524: together.”
14525: 
14526: He looked away from them all when he had said this, and lay silent for
14527: some minutes, while they stood watching him, not daring to move. The
14528: morning light was growing clearer for them, and they could see the
14529: heaviness gathering in his face, and the dulness in his eyes. But at
14530: last he looked toward Tom and said,—
14531: 
14532: “I had my turn—I beat him. That was nothing but fair. I never wanted
14533: anything but what was fair.”
14534: 
14535: “But, father, dear father,” said Maggie, an unspeakable anxiety
14536: predominating over her grief, “you forgive him—you forgive every one
14537: now?”
14538: 
14539: He did not move his eyes to look at her, but he said,—
14540: 
14541: “No, my wench. I don’t forgive him. What’s forgiving to do? I can’t
14542: love a raskill——”
14543: 
14544: His voice had become thicker; but he wanted to say more, and moved his
14545: lips again and again, struggling in vain to speak. At length the words
14546: forced their way.
14547: 
14548: “Does God forgive raskills?—but if He does, He won’t be hard wi’ me.”
14549: 
14550: His hands moved uneasily, as if he wanted them to remove some
14551: obstruction that weighed upon him. Two or three times there fell from
14552: him some broken words,—
14553: 
14554: “This world’s—too many—honest man—puzzling——”
14555: 
14556: Soon they merged into mere mutterings; the eyes had ceased to discern;
14557: and then came the final silence.
14558: 
14559: But not of death. For an hour or more the chest heaved, the loud, hard
14560: breathing continued, getting gradually slower, as the cold dews
14561: gathered on the brow.
14562: 
14563: At last there was total stillness, and poor Tulliver’s dimly lighted
14564: soul had forever ceased to be vexed with the painful riddle of this
14565: world.
14566: 
14567: Help was come now; Luke and his wife were there, and Mr Turnbull had
14568: arrived, too late for everything but to say, “This is death.”
14569: 
14570: Tom and Maggie went downstairs together into the room where their
14571: father’s place was empty. Their eyes turned to the same spot, and
14572: Maggie spoke,—
14573: 
14574: “Tom, forgive me—let us always love each other”; and they clung and
14575: wept together.
14576: 
14577: 
14578: BOOK SIXTH
14579: 
14580: THE GREAT TEMPTATION.
14581: 
14582: 
14583: Chapter I.
14584: 
14585: A Duet in Paradise
14586: 
14587: The well-furnished drawing-room, with the open grand piano, and the
14588: pleasant outlook down a sloping garden to a boat-house by the side of
14589: the Floss, is Mr Deane’s. The neat little lady in mourning, whose
14590: light-brown ringlets are falling over the coloured embroidery with
14591: which her fingers are busy, is of course Lucy Deane; and the fine young
14592: man who is leaning down from his chair to snap the scissors in the
14593: extremely abbreviated face of the “King Charles” lying on the young
14594: lady’s feet is no other than Mr Stephen Guest, whose diamond ring,
14595: attar of roses, and air of _nonchalant_ leisure, at twelve o’clock in
14596: the day, are the graceful and odoriferous result of the largest
14597: oil-mill and the most extensive wharf in St Ogg’s. There is an apparent
14598: triviality in the action with the scissors, but your discernment
14599: perceives at once that there is a design in it which makes it eminently
14600: worthy of a large-headed, long-limbed young man; for you see that Lucy
14601: wants the scissors, and is compelled, reluctant as she may be, to shake
14602: her ringlets back, raise her soft hazel eyes, smile playfully down on
14603: the face that is so very nearly on a level with her knee, and holding
14604: out her little shell-pink palm, to say,—
14605: 
14606: “My scissors, please, if you can renounce the great pleasure of
14607: persecuting my poor Minny.”
14608: 
14609: The foolish scissors have slipped too far over the knuckles, it seems,
14610: and Hercules holds out his entrapped fingers hopelessly.
14611: 
14612: “Confound the scissors! The oval lies the wrong way. Please draw them
14613: off for me.”
14614: 
14615: “Draw them off with your other hand,” says Miss Lucy, roguishly.
14616: 
14617: “Oh, but that’s my left hand; I’m not left-handed.”
14618: 
14619: Lucy laughs, and the scissors are drawn off with gentle touches from
14620: tiny tips, which naturally dispose Mr Stephen for a repetition _da
14621: capo_. Accordingly, he watches for the release of the scissors, that he
14622: may get them into his possession again.
14623: 
14624: “No, no,” said Lucy, sticking them in her band, “you shall not have my
14625: scissors again,—you have strained them already. Now don’t set Minny
14626: growling again. Sit up and behave properly, and then I will tell you
14627: some news.”
14628: 
14629: “What is that?” said Stephen, throwing himself back and hanging his
14630: right arm over the corner of his chair. He might have been sitting for
14631: his portrait, which would have represented a rather striking young man
14632: of five-and-twenty, with a square forehead, short dark-brown hair,
14633: standing erect, with a slight wave at the end, like a thick crop of
14634: corn, and a half-ardent, half-sarcastic glance from under his
14635: well-marked horizontal eyebrows. “Is it very important news?”
14636: 
14637: “Yes, very. Guess.”
14638: 
14639: “You are going to change Minny’s diet, and give him three ratafias
14640: soaked in a dessert-spoonful of cream daily?”
14641: 
14642: “Quite wrong.”
14643: 
14644: “Well, then, Dr Kenn has been preaching against buckram, and you ladies
14645: have all been sending him a roundrobin, saying, ‘This is a hard
14646: doctrine; who can bear it?’”
14647: 
14648: “For shame!” said Lucy, adjusting her little mouth gravely. “It is
14649: rather dull of you not to guess my news, because it is about something
14650: I mentioned to you not very long ago.”
14651: 
14652: “But you have mentioned many things to me not long ago. Does your
14653: feminine tyranny require that when you say the thing you mean is one of
14654: several things, I should know it immediately by that mark?”
14655: 
14656: “Yes, I know you think I am silly.”
14657: 
14658: “I think you are perfectly charming.”
14659: 
14660: “And my silliness is part of my charm?”
14661: 
14662: “I didn’t say _that_.”
14663: 
14664: “But I know you like women to be rather insipid. Philip Wakem betrayed
14665: you; he said so one day when you were not here.”
14666: 
14667: “Oh, I know Phil is fierce on that point; he makes it quite a personal
14668: matter. I think he must be love-sick for some unknown lady,—some
14669: exalted Beatrice whom he met abroad.”
14670: 
14671: “By the by,” said Lucy, pausing in her work, “it has just occurred to
14672: me that I never found out whether my cousin Maggie will object to see
14673: Philip, as her brother does. Tom will not enter a room where Philip is,
14674: if he knows it; perhaps Maggie may be the same, and then we sha’n’t be
14675: able to sing our glees, shall we?”
14676: 
14677: “What! is your cousin coming to stay with you?” said Stephen, with a
14678: look of slight annoyance.
14679: 
14680: “Yes; that was my news, which you have forgotten. She’s going to leave
14681: her situation, where she has been nearly two years, poor thing,—ever
14682: since her father’s death; and she will stay with me a month or
14683: two,—many months, I hope.”
14684: 
14685: “And am I bound to be pleased at that news?”
14686: 
14687: “Oh no, not at all,” said Lucy, with a little air of pique. “_I_ am
14688: pleased, but that, of course, is no reason why _you_ should be pleased.
14689: There is no girl in the world I love so well as my cousin Maggie.”
14690: 
14691: “And you will be inseparable I suppose, when she comes. There will be
14692: no possibility of a _tête-à-tête_ with you any more, unless you can
14693: find an admirer for her, who will pair off with her occasionally. What
14694: is the ground of dislike to Philip? He might have been a resource.”
14695: 
14696: “It is a family quarrel with Philip’s father. There were very painful
14697: circumstances, I believe. I never quite understood them, or knew them
14698: all. My uncle Tulliver was unfortunate and lost all his property, and I
14699: think he considered Mr Wakem was somehow the cause of it. Mr Wakem
14700: bought Dorlcote Mill, my uncle’s old place, where he always lived. You
14701: must remember my uncle Tulliver, don’t you?”
14702: 
14703: “No,” said Stephen, with rather supercilious indifference. “I’ve always
14704: known the name, and I dare say I knew the man by sight, apart from his
14705: name. I know half the names and faces in the neighbourhood in that
14706: detached, disjointed way.”
14707: 
14708: “He was a very hot-tempered man. I remember, when I was a little girl
14709: and used to go to see my cousins, he often frightened me by talking as
14710: if he were angry. Papa told me there was a dreadful quarrel, the very
14711: day before my uncle’s death, between him and Mr Wakem, but it was
14712: hushed up. That was when you were in London. Papa says my uncle was
14713: quite mistaken in many ways; his mind had become embittered. But Tom
14714: and Maggie must naturally feel it very painful to be reminded of these
14715: things. They have had so much, so very much trouble. Maggie was at
14716: school with me six years ago, when she was fetched away because of her
14717: father’s misfortunes, and she has hardly had any pleasure since, I
14718: think. She has been in a dreary situation in a school since uncle’s
14719: death, because she is determined to be independent, and not live with
14720: aunt Pullet; and I could hardly wish her to come to me then, because
14721: dear mamma was ill, and everything was so sad. That is why I want her
14722: to come to me now, and have a long, long holiday.”
14723: 
14724: “Very sweet and angelic of you,” said Stephen, looking at her with an
14725: admiring smile; “and all the more so if she has the conversational
14726: qualities of her mother.”
14727: 
14728: “Poor aunty! You are cruel to ridicule her. She is very valuable to
14729: _me_, I know. She manages the house beautifully,—much better than any
14730: stranger would,—and she was a great comfort to me in mamma’s illness.”
14731: 
14732: “Yes, but in point of companionship one would prefer that she should be
14733: represented by her brandy-cherries and cream-cakes. I think with a
14734: shudder that her daughter will always be present in person, and have no
14735: agreeable proxies of that kind,—a fat, blond girl, with round blue
14736: eyes, who will stare at us silently.”
14737: 
14738: “Oh yes!” exclaimed Lucy, laughing wickedly, and clapping her hands,
14739: “that is just my cousin Maggie. You must have seen her!”
14740: 
14741: “No, indeed; I’m only guessing what Mrs Tulliver’s daughter must be;
14742: and then if she is to banish Philip, our only apology for a tenor, that
14743: will be an additional bore.”
14744: 
14745: “But I hope that may not be. I think I will ask you to call on Philip
14746: and tell him Maggie is coming to-morrow. He is quite aware of Tom’s
14747: feeling, and always keeps out of his way; so he will understand, if you
14748: tell him, that I asked you to warn him not to come until I write to ask
14749: him.”
14750: 
14751: “I think you had better write a pretty note for me to take; Phil is so
14752: sensitive, you know, the least thing might frighten him off coming at
14753: all, and we had hard work to get him. I can never induce him to come to
14754: the park; he doesn’t like my sisters, I think. It is only your faëry
14755: touch that can lay his ruffled feathers.”
14756: 
14757: Stephen mastered the little hand that was straying toward the table,
14758: and touched it lightly with his lips. Little Lucy felt very proud and
14759: happy. She and Stephen were in that stage of courtship which makes the
14760: most exquisite moment of youth, the freshest blossom-time of
14761: passion,—when each is sure of the other’s love, but no formal
14762: declaration has been made, and all is mutual divination, exalting the
14763: most trivial word, the lightest gesture, into thrills delicate and
14764: delicious as wafted jasmine scent. The explicitness of an engagement
14765: wears off this finest edge of susceptibility; it is jasmine gathered
14766: and presented in a large bouquet.
14767: 
14768: “But it is really odd that you should have hit so exactly on Maggie’s
14769: appearance and manners,” said the cunning Lucy, moving to reach her
14770: desk, “because she might have been like her brother, you know; and Tom
14771: has not round eyes; and he is as far as possible from staring at
14772: people.”
14773: 
14774: “Oh, I suppose he is like the father; he seems to be as proud as
14775: Lucifer. Not a brilliant companion, though, I should think.”
14776: 
14777: “I like Tom. He gave me my Minny when I lost Lolo; and papa is very
14778: fond of him: he says Tom has excellent principles. It was through him
14779: that his father was able to pay all his debts before he died.”
14780: 
14781: “Oh, ah; I’ve heard about that. I heard your father and mine talking
14782: about it a little while ago, after dinner, in one of their interminable
14783: discussions about business. They think of doing something for young
14784: Tulliver; he saved them from a considerable loss by riding home in some
14785: marvellous way, like Turpin, to bring them news about the stoppage of a
14786: bank, or something of that sort. But I was rather drowsy at the time.”
14787: 
14788: Stephen rose from his seat, and sauntered to the piano, humming in
14789: falsetto, “Graceful Consort,” as he turned over the volume of “The
14790: Creation,” which stood open on the desk.
14791: 
14792: “Come and sing this,” he said, when he saw Lucy rising.
14793: 
14794: “What, ‘Graceful Consort’? I don’t think it suits your voice.”
14795: 
14796: “Never mind; it exactly suits my feeling, which, Philip will have it,
14797: is the grand element of good singing. I notice men with indifferent
14798: voices are usually of that opinion.”
14799: 
14800: “Philip burst into one of his invectives against ‘The Creation’ the
14801: other day,” said Lucy, seating herself at the piano. “He says it has a
14802: sort of sugared complacency and flattering make-believe in it, as if it
14803: were written for the birthday _fête_ of a German Grand-Duke.”
14804: 
14805: “Oh, pooh! He is the fallen Adam with a soured temper. We are Adam and
14806: Eve unfallen, in Paradise. Now, then,—the recitative, for the sake of
14807: the moral. You will sing the whole duty of woman,—‘And from obedience
14808: grows my pride and happiness.’”
14809: 
14810: “Oh no, I shall not respect an Adam who drags the _tempo_, as you
14811: will,” said Lucy, beginning to play the duet.
14812: 
14813: Surely the only courtship unshaken by doubts and fears must be that in
14814: which the lovers can sing together. The sense of mutual fitness that
14815: springs from the two deep notes fulfilling expectation just at the
14816: right moment between the notes of the silvery soprano, from the perfect
14817: accord of descending thirds and fifths, from the preconcerted loving
14818: chase of a fugue, is likely enough to supersede any immediate demand
14819: for less impassioned forms of agreement. The contralto will not care to
14820: catechise the bass; the tenor will foresee no embarrassing dearth of
14821: remark in evenings spent with the lovely soprano. In the provinces,
14822: too, where music was so scarce in that remote time, how could the
14823: musical people avoid falling in love with each other? Even political
14824: principle must have been in danger of relaxation under such
14825: circumstances; and the violin, faithful to rotten boroughs, must have
14826: been tempted to fraternise in a demoralizing way with a reforming
14827: violoncello. In that case, the linnet-throated soprano and the
14828: full-toned bass singing,—
14829: 
14830:      “With thee delight is ever new,
14831:      With thee is life incessant bliss,”
14832: 
14833: 
14834: believed what they sang all the more _because_ they sang it.
14835: 
14836: “Now for Raphael’s great song,” said Lucy, when they had finished the
14837: duet. “You do the ‘heavy beasts’ to perfection.”
14838: 
14839: “That sounds complimentary,” said Stephen, looking at his watch. “By
14840: Jove, it’s nearly half-past one! Well, I can just sing this.”
14841: 
14842: Stephen delivered with admirable ease the deep notes representing the
14843: tread of the heavy beasts; but when a singer has an audience of two,
14844: there is room for divided sentiments. Minny’s mistress was charmed; but
14845: Minny, who had intrenched himself, trembling, in his basket as soon as
14846: the music began, found this thunder so little to his taste that he
14847: leaped out and scampered under the remotest _chiffonnier_, as the most
14848: eligible place in which a small dog could await the crack of doom.
14849: 
14850: “Adieu, ‘graceful consort,’” said Stephen, buttoning his coat across
14851: when he had done singing, and smiling down from his tall height, with
14852: the air of rather a patronizing lover, at the little lady on the
14853: music-stool. “My bliss is not incessant, for I must gallop home. I
14854: promised to be there at lunch.”
14855: 
14856: “You will not be able to call on Philip, then? It is of no consequence;
14857: I have said everything in my note.”
14858: 
14859: “You will be engaged with your cousin to-morrow, I suppose?”
14860: 
14861: “Yes, we are going to have a little family-party. My cousin Tom will
14862: dine with us; and poor aunty will have her two children together for
14863: the first time. It will be very pretty; I think a great deal about it.”
14864: 
14865: “But I may come the next day?”
14866: 
14867: “Oh yes! Come and be introduced to my cousin Maggie; though you can
14868: hardly be said not to have seen her, you have described her so well.”
14869: 
14870: “Good-bye, then.” And there was that slight pressure of the hands, and
14871: momentary meeting of the eyes, which will often leave a little lady
14872: with a slight flush and smile on her face that do not subside
14873: immediately when the door is closed, and with an inclination to walk up
14874: and down the room rather than to seat herself quietly at her
14875: embroidery, or other rational and improving occupation. At least this
14876: was the effect on Lucy; and you will not, I hope, consider it an
14877: indication of vanity predominating over more tender impulses, that she
14878: just glanced in the chimney-glass as her walk brought her near it. The
14879: desire to know that one has not looked an absolute fright during a few
14880: hours of conversation may be construed as lying within the bounds of a
14881: laudable benevolent consideration for others. And Lucy had so much of
14882: this benevolence in her nature that I am inclined to think her small
14883: egoisms were impregnated with it, just as there are people not
14884: altogether unknown to you whose small benevolences have a predominant
14885: and somewhat rank odor of egoism. Even now, that she is walking up and
14886: down with a little triumphant flutter of her girlish heart at the sense
14887: that she is loved by the person of chief consequence in her small
14888: world, you may see in her hazel eyes an ever-present sunny benignity,
14889: in which the momentary harmless flashes of personal vanity are quite
14890: lost; and if she is happy in thinking of her lover, it is because the
14891: thought of him mingles readily with all the gentle affections and
14892: good-natured offices with which she fills her peaceful days. Even now,
14893: her mind, with that instantaneous alternation which makes two currents
14894: of feeling or imagination seem simultaneous, is glancing continually
14895: from Stephen to the preparations she has only half finished in Maggie’s
14896: room. Cousin Maggie should be treated as well as the grandest
14897: lady-visitor,—nay, better, for she should have Lucy’s best prints and
14898: drawings in her bedroom, and the very finest bouquet of spring flowers
14899: on her table. Maggie would enjoy all that, she was so found of pretty
14900: things! And there was poor aunt Tulliver, that no one made any account
14901: of, she was to be surprised with the present of a cap of superlative
14902: quality, and to have her health drunk in a gratifying manner, for which
14903: Lucy was going to lay a plot with her father this evening. Clearly, she
14904: had not time to indulge in long reveries about her own happy
14905: love-affairs. With this thought she walked toward the door, but paused
14906: there.
14907: 
14908: “What’s the matter, then, Minny?” she said, stooping in answer to some
14909: whimpering of that small quadruped, and lifting his glossy head against
14910: her pink cheek. “Did you think I was going without you? Come, then, let
14911: us go and see Sinbad.”
14912: 
14913: Sinbad was Lucy’s chestnut horse, that she always fed with her own hand
14914: when he was turned out in the paddock. She was fond of feeding
14915: dependent creatures, and knew the private tastes of all the animals
14916: about the house, delighting in the little rippling sounds of her
14917: canaries when their beaks were busy with fresh seed, and in the small
14918: nibbling pleasures of certain animals which, lest she should appear too
14919: trivial, I will here call “the more familiar rodents.”
14920: 
14921: Was not Stephen Guest right in his decided opinion that this slim
14922: maiden of eighteen was quite the sort of wife a man would not be likely
14923: to repent of marrying,—a woman who was loving and thoughtful for other
14924: women, not giving them Judas-kisses with eyes askance on their welcome
14925: defects, but with real care and vision for their half-hidden pains and
14926: mortifications, with long ruminating enjoyment of little pleasures
14927: prepared for them? Perhaps the emphasis of his admiration did not fall
14928: precisely on this rarest quality in her; perhaps he approved his own
14929: choice of her chiefly because she did not strike him as a remarkable
14930: rarity. A man likes his wife to be pretty; well, Lucy was pretty, but
14931: not to a maddening extent. A man likes his wife to be accomplished,
14932: gentle, affectionate, and not stupid; and Lucy had all these
14933: qualifications. Stephen was not surprised to find himself in love with
14934: her, and was conscious of excellent judgment in preferring her to Miss
14935: Leyburn, the daughter of the county member, although Lucy was only the
14936: daughter of his father’s subordinate partner; besides, he had had to
14937: defy and overcome a slight unwillingness and disappointment in his
14938: father and sisters,—a circumstance which gives a young man an agreeable
14939: consciousness of his own dignity. Stephen was aware that he had sense
14940: and independence enough to choose the wife who was likely to make him
14941: happy, unbiassed by any indirect considerations. He meant to choose
14942: Lucy; she was a little darling, and exactly the sort of woman he had
14943: always admired.
14944: 
14945: 
14946: Chapter II.
14947: 
14948: First Impressions
14949: 
14950: “He is very clever, Maggie,” said Lucy. She was kneeling on a footstool
14951: at Maggie’s feet, after placing that dark lady in the large
14952: crimson-velvet chair. “I feel sure you will like him. I hope you will.”
14953: 
14954: “I shall be very difficult to please,” said Maggie, smiling, and
14955: holding up one of Lucy’s long curls, that the sunlight might shine
14956: through it. “A gentleman who thinks he is good enough for Lucy must
14957: expect to be sharply criticised.”
14958: 
14959: “Indeed, he’s a great deal too good for me. And sometimes, when he is
14960: away, I almost think it can’t really be that he loves me. But I can
14961: never doubt it when he is with me, though I couldn’t bear any one but
14962: you to know that I feel in that way, Maggie.”
14963: 
14964: “Oh, then, if I disapprove of him you can give him up, since you are
14965: not engaged,” said Maggie, with playful gravity.
14966: 
14967: “I would rather not be engaged. When people are engaged, they begin to
14968: think of being married soon,” said Lucy, too thoroughly preoccupied to
14969: notice Maggie’s joke; “and I should like everything to go on for a long
14970: while just as it is. Sometimes I am quite frightened lest Stephen
14971: should say that he has spoken to papa; and from something that fell
14972: from papa the other day, I feel sure he and Mr Guest are expecting
14973: that. And Stephen’s sisters are very civil to me now. At first, I think
14974: they didn’t like his paying me attention; and that was natural. It
14975: _does_ seem out of keeping that I should ever live in a great place
14976: like the Park House, such a little insignificant thing as I am.”
14977: 
14978: “But people are not expected to be large in proportion to the houses
14979: they live in, like snails,” said Maggie, laughing. “Pray, are Mr
14980: Guest’s sisters giantesses?”
14981: 
14982: “Oh no; and not handsome,—that is, not very,” said Lucy, half-penitent
14983: at this uncharitable remark. “But _he_ is—at least he is generally
14984: considered very handsome.”
14985: 
14986: “Though you are unable to share that opinion?”
14987: 
14988: “Oh, I don’t know,” said Lucy, blushing pink over brow and neck. “It is
14989: a bad plan to raise expectation; you will perhaps be disappointed. But
14990: I have prepared a charming surprise for _him;_ I shall have a glorious
14991: laugh against him. I shall not tell you what it is, though.”
14992: 
14993: Lucy rose from her knees and went to a little distance, holding her
14994: pretty head on one side, as if she had been arranging Maggie for a
14995: portrait, and wished to judge of the general effect.
14996: 
14997: “Stand up a moment, Maggie.”
14998: 
14999: “What is your pleasure now?” said Maggie, smiling languidly as she rose
15000: from her chair and looked down on her slight, aerial cousin, whose
15001: figure was quite subordinate to her faultless drapery of silk and
15002: crape.
15003: 
15004: Lucy kept her contemplative attitude a moment or two in silence, and
15005: then said,—
15006: 
15007: “I can’t think what witchery it is in you, Maggie, that makes you look
15008: best in shabby clothes; though you really must have a new dress now.
15009: But do you know, last night I was trying to fancy you in a handsome,
15010: fashionable dress, and do what I would, that old limp merino would come
15011: back as the only right thing for you. I wonder if Marie Antoinette
15012: looked all the grander when her gown was darned at the elbows. Now, if
15013: _I_ were to put anything shabby on, I should be quite unnoticeable. I
15014: should be a mere rag.”
15015: 
15016: “Oh, quite,” said Maggie, with mock gravity. “You would be liable to be
15017: swept out of the room with the cobwebs and carpet-dust, and to find
15018: yourself under the grate, like Cinderella. Mayn’t I sit down now?”
15019: 
15020: “Yes, now you may,” said Lucy, laughing. Then, with an air of serious
15021: reflection, unfastening her large jet brooch, “But you must change
15022: brooches, Maggie; that little butterfly looks silly on you.”
15023: 
15024: “But won’t that mar the charming effect of my consistent shabbiness?”
15025: said Maggie, seating herself submissively, while Lucy knelt again and
15026: unfastened the contemptible butterfly. “I wish my mother were of your
15027: opinion, for she was fretting last night because this is my best frock.
15028: I’ve been saving my money to pay for some lessons; I shall never get a
15029: better situation without more accomplishments.”
15030: 
15031: Maggie gave a little sigh.
15032: 
15033: “Now, don’t put on that sad look again,” said Lucy, pinning the large
15034: brooch below Maggie’s fine throat. “You’re forgetting that you’ve left
15035: that dreary schoolroom behind you, and have no little girls’ clothes to
15036: mend.”
15037: 
15038: “Yes,” said Maggie. “It is with me as I used to think it would be with
15039: the poor uneasy white bear I saw at the show. I thought he must have
15040: got so stupid with the habit of turning backward and forward in that
15041: narrow space that he would keep doing it if they set him free. One gets
15042: a bad habit of being unhappy.”
15043: 
15044: “But I shall put you under a discipline of pleasure that will make you
15045: lose that bad habit,” said Lucy, sticking the black butterfly absently
15046: in her own collar, while her eyes met Maggie’s affectionately.
15047: 
15048: “You dear, tiny thing,” said Maggie, in one of her bursts of loving
15049: admiration, “you enjoy other people’s happiness so much, I believe you
15050: would do without any of your own. I wish I were like you.”
15051: 
15052: “I’ve never been tried in that way,” said Lucy. “I’ve always been so
15053: happy. I don’t know whether I could bear much trouble; I never had any
15054: but poor mamma’s death. You _have_ been tried, Maggie; and I’m sure you
15055: feel for other people quite as much as I do.”
15056: 
15057: “No, Lucy,” said Maggie, shaking her head slowly, “I don’t enjoy their
15058: happiness as you do, else I should be more contented. I do feel for
15059: them when they are in trouble; I don’t think I could ever bear to make
15060: any one _un_happy; and yet I often hate myself, because I get angry
15061: sometimes at the sight of happy people. I think I get worse as I get
15062: older, more selfish. That seems very dreadful.”
15063: 
15064: “Now, Maggie!” said Lucy, in a tone of remonstrance, “I don’t believe a
15065: word of that. It is all a gloomy fancy, just because you are depressed
15066: by a dull, wearisome life.”
15067: 
15068: “Well, perhaps it is,” said Maggie, resolutely clearing away the clouds
15069: from her face with a bright smile, and throwing herself backward in her
15070: chair. “Perhaps it comes from the school diet,—watery rice-pudding
15071: spiced with Pinnock. Let us hope it will give way before my mother’s
15072: custards and this charming Geoffrey Crayon.”
15073: 
15074: Maggie took up the “Sketch Book,” which lay by her on the table.
15075: 
15076: “Do I look fit to be seen with this little brooch?” said Lucy, going to
15077: survey the effect in the chimney-glass.
15078: 
15079: “Oh no, Mr Guest will be obliged to go out of the room again if he sees
15080: you in it. Pray make haste and put another on.”
15081: 
15082: Lucy hurried out of the room, but Maggie did not take the opportunity
15083: of opening her book; she let it fall on her knees, while her eyes
15084: wandered to the window, where she could see the sunshine falling on the
15085: rich clumps of spring flowers and on the long hedge of laurels, and
15086: beyond, the silvery breadth of the dear old Floss, that at this
15087: distance seemed to be sleeping in a morning holiday. The sweet fresh
15088: garden-scent came through the open window, and the birds were busy
15089: flitting and alighting, gurgling and singing. Yet Maggie’s eyes began
15090: to fill with tears. The sight of the old scenes had made the rush of
15091: memories so painful that even yesterday she had only been able to
15092: rejoice in her mother’s restored comfort and Tom’s brotherly
15093: friendliness as we rejoice in good news of friends at a distance,
15094: rather than in the presence of a happiness which we share. Memory and
15095: imagination urged upon her a sense of privation too keen to let her
15096: taste what was offered in the transient present. Her future, she
15097: thought, was likely to be worse than her past, for after her years of
15098: contented renunciation, she had slipped back into desire and longing;
15099: she found joyless days of distasteful occupation harder and harder; she
15100: found the image of the intense and varied life she yearned for, and
15101: despaired of, becoming more and more importunate. The sound of the
15102: opening door roused her, and hastily wiping away her tears, she began
15103: to turn over the leaves of her book.
15104: 
15105: “There is one pleasure, I know, Maggie, that your deepest dismalness
15106: will never resist,” said Lucy, beginning to speak as soon as she
15107: entered the room. “That is music, and I mean you to have quite a
15108: riotous feast of it. I mean you to get up your playing again, which
15109: used to be so much better than mine, when we were at Laceham.”
15110: 
15111: “You would have laughed to see me playing the little girls’ tunes over
15112: and over to them, when I took them to practise,” said Maggie, “just for
15113: the sake of fingering the dear keys again. But I don’t know whether I
15114: could play anything more difficult now than ‘Begone, dull care!’”
15115: 
15116: “I know what a wild state of joy you used to be in when the glee-men
15117: came round,” said Lucy, taking up her embroidery; “and we might have
15118: all those old glees that you used to love so, if I were certain that
15119: you don’t feel exactly as Tom does about some things.”
15120: 
15121: “I should have thought there was nothing you might be more certain of,”
15122: said Maggie, smiling.
15123: 
15124: “I ought rather to have said, one particular thing. Because if you feel
15125: just as he does about that, we shall want our third voice. St Ogg’s is
15126: so miserably provided with musical gentlemen. There are really only
15127: Stephen and Philip Wakem who have any knowledge of music, so as to be
15128: able to sing a part.”
15129: 
15130: Lucy had looked up from her work as she uttered the last sentence, and
15131: saw that there was a change in Maggie’s face.
15132: 
15133: “Does it hurt you to hear the name mentioned, Maggie? If it does, I
15134: will not speak of him again. I know Tom will not see him if he can
15135: avoid it.”
15136: 
15137: “I don’t feel at all as Tom does on that subject,” said Maggie, rising
15138: and going to the window as if she wanted to see more of the landscape.
15139: “I’ve always liked Philip Wakem ever since I was a little girl, and saw
15140: him at Lorton. He was so good when Tom hurt his foot.”
15141: 
15142: “Oh, I’m so glad!” said Lucy. “Then you won’t mind his coming
15143: sometimes, and we can have much more music than we could without him.
15144: I’m very fond of poor Philip, only I wish he were not so morbid about
15145: his deformity. I suppose it _is_ his deformity that makes him so sad,
15146: and sometimes bitter. It is certainly very piteous to see his poor
15147: little crooked body and pale face among great, strong people.”
15148: 
15149: “But, Lucy——” said Maggie, trying to arrest the prattling stream.
15150: 
15151: “Ah, there is the door-bell. That must be Stephen,” Lucy went on, not
15152: noticing Maggie’s faint effort to speak. “One of the things I most
15153: admire in Stephen is that he makes a greater friend of Philip than any
15154: one.”
15155: 
15156: It was too late for Maggie to speak now; the drawingroom door was
15157: opening, and Minny was already growling in a small way at the entrance
15158: of a tall gentleman, who went up to Lucy and took her hand with a
15159: half-polite, half-tender glance and tone of inquiry, which seemed to
15160: indicate that he was unconscious of any other presence.
15161: 
15162: “Let me introduce you to my cousin, Miss Tulliver,” said Lucy, turning
15163: with wicked enjoyment toward Maggie, who now approached from the
15164: farther window. “This is Mr Stephen Guest.”
15165: 
15166: For one instant Stephen could not conceal his astonishment at the sight
15167: of this tall, dark-eyed nymph with her jet-black coronet of hair; the
15168: next, Maggie felt herself, for the first time in her life, receiving
15169: the tribute of a very deep blush and a very deep bow from a person
15170: toward whom she herself was conscious of timidity.
15171: 
15172: This new experience was very agreeable to her, so agreeable that it
15173: almost effaced her previous emotion about Philip. There was a new
15174: brightness in her eyes, and a very becoming flush on her cheek, as she
15175: seated herself.
15176: 
15177: “I hope you perceive what a striking likeness you drew the day before
15178: yesterday,” said Lucy, with a pretty laugh of triumph. She enjoyed her
15179: lover’s confusion; the advantage was usually on his side.
15180: 
15181: “This designing cousin of yours quite deceived me, Miss Tulliver,” said
15182: Stephen, seating himself by Lucy, and stooping to play with Minny, only
15183: looking at Maggie furtively. “She said you had light hair and blue
15184: eyes.”
15185: 
15186: “Nay, it was you who said so,” remonstrated Lucy. “I only refrained
15187: from destroying your confidence in your own second-sight.”
15188: 
15189: “I wish I could always err in the same way,” said Stephen, “and find
15190: reality so much more beautiful than my preconceptions.”
15191: 
15192: “Now you have proved yourself equal to the occasion,” said Maggie, “and
15193: said what it was incumbent on you to say under the circumstances.”
15194: 
15195: She flashed a slightly defiant look at him; it was clear to her that he
15196: had been drawing a satirical portrait of her beforehand. Lucy had said
15197: he was inclined to be satirical, and Maggie had mentally supplied the
15198: addition, “and rather conceited.”
15199: 
15200: “An alarming amount of devil there,” was Stephen’s first thought. The
15201: second, when she had bent over her work, was, “I wish she would look at
15202: me again.” The next was to answer,—
15203: 
15204: “I suppose all phrases of mere compliment have their turn to be true. A
15205: man is occasionally grateful when he says ‘Thank you.’ It’s rather hard
15206: upon him that he must use the same words with which all the world
15207: declines a disagreeable invitation, don’t you think so, Miss Tulliver?”
15208: 
15209: “No,” said Maggie, looking at him with her direct glance; “if we use
15210: common words on a great occasion, they are the more striking, because
15211: they are felt at once to have a particular meaning, like old banners,
15212: or everyday clothes, hung up in a sacred place.”
15213: 
15214: “Then my compliment ought to be eloquent,” said Stephen, really not
15215: quite knowing what he said while Maggie looked at him, “seeing that the
15216: words were so far beneath the occasion.”
15217: 
15218: “No compliment can be eloquent, except as an expression of
15219: indifference,” said Maggie, flushing a little.
15220: 
15221: Lucy was rather alarmed; she thought Stephen and Maggie were not going
15222: to like each other. She had always feared lest Maggie should appear too
15223: old and clever to please that critical gentleman. “Why, dear Maggie,”
15224: she interposed, “you have always pretended that you are too fond of
15225: being admired; and now, I think, you are angry because some one
15226: ventures to admire you.”
15227: 
15228: “Not at all,” said Maggie; “I like too well to feel that I am admired,
15229: but compliments never make me feel that.”
15230: 
15231: “I will never pay you a compliment again, Miss Tulliver,” said Stephen.
15232: 
15233: “Thank you; that will be a proof of respect.”
15234: 
15235: Poor Maggie! She was so unused to society that she could take nothing
15236: as a matter of course, and had never in her life spoken from the lips
15237: merely, so that she must necessarily appear absurd to more experienced
15238: ladies, from the excessive feeling she was apt to throw into very
15239: trivial incidents. But she was even conscious herself of a little
15240: absurdity in this instance. It was true she had a theoretic objection
15241: to compliments, and had once said impatiently to Philip that she didn’t
15242: see why women were to be told with a simper that they were beautiful,
15243: any more than old men were to be told that they were venerable; still,
15244: to be so irritated by a common practice in the case of a stranger like
15245: Mr Stephen Guest, and to care about his having spoken slightingly of
15246: her before he had seen her, was certainly unreasonable, and as soon as
15247: she was silent she began to be ashamed of herself. It did not occur to
15248: her that her irritation was due to the pleasanter emotion which
15249: preceded it, just as when we are satisfied with a sense of glowing
15250: warmth an innocent drop of cold water may fall upon us as a sudden
15251: smart.
15252: 
15253: Stephen was too well bred not to seem unaware that the previous
15254: conversation could have been felt embarrassing, and at once began to
15255: talk of impersonal matters, asking Lucy if she knew when the bazaar was
15256: at length to take place, so that there might be some hope of seeing her
15257: rain the influence of her eyes on objects more grateful than those
15258: worsted flowers that were growing under her fingers.
15259: 
15260: “Some day next month, I believe,” said Lucy. “But your sisters are
15261: doing more for it than I am; they are to have the largest stall.”
15262: 
15263: “Ah yes; but they carry on their manufactures in their own
15264: sitting-room, where I don’t intrude on them. I see you are not addicted
15265: to the fashionable vice of fancy-work, Miss Tulliver,” said Stephen,
15266: looking at Maggie’s plain hemming.
15267: 
15268: “No,” said Maggie, “I can do nothing more difficult or more elegant
15269: than shirt-making.”
15270: 
15271: “And your plain sewing is so beautiful, Maggie,” said Lucy, “that I
15272: think I shall beg a few specimens of you to show as fancy-work. Your
15273: exquisite sewing is quite a mystery to me, you used to dislike that
15274: sort of work so much in old days.”
15275: 
15276: “It is a mystery easily explained, dear,” said Maggie, looking up
15277: quietly. “Plain sewing was the only thing I could get money by, so I
15278: was obliged to try and do it well.”
15279: 
15280: Lucy, good and simple as she was, could not help blushing a little. She
15281: did not quite like that Stephen should know that; Maggie need not have
15282: mentioned it. Perhaps there was some pride in the confession,—the pride
15283: of poverty that will not be ashamed of itself. But if Maggie had been
15284: the queen of coquettes she could hardly have invented a means of giving
15285: greater piquancy to her beauty in Stephen’s eyes; I am not sure that
15286: the quiet admission of plain sewing and poverty would have done alone,
15287: but assisted by the beauty, they made Maggie more unlike other women
15288: even than she had seemed at first.
15289: 
15290: “But I can knit, Lucy,” Maggie went on, “if that will be of any use for
15291: your bazaar.”
15292: 
15293: “Oh yes, of infinite use. I shall set you to work with scarlet wool
15294: to-morrow. But your sister is the most enviable person,” continued
15295: Lucy, turning to Stephen, “to have the talent of modelling. She is
15296: doing a wonderful bust of Dr Kenn entirely from memory.”
15297: 
15298: “Why, if she can remember to put the eyes very near together, and the
15299: corners of the mouth very far apart, the likeness can hardly fail to be
15300: striking in St Ogg’s.”
15301: 
15302: “Now that is very wicked of you,” said Lucy, looking rather hurt. “I
15303: didn’t think you would speak disrespectfully of Dr Kenn.”
15304: 
15305: “I say anything disrespectful of Dr Kenn? Heaven forbid! But I am not
15306: bound to respect a libellous bust of him. I think Kenn one of the
15307: finest fellows in the world. I don’t care much about the tall
15308: candlesticks he has put on the communion-table, and I shouldn’t like to
15309: spoil my temper by getting up to early prayers every morning. But he’s
15310: the only man I ever knew personally who seems to me to have anything of
15311: the real apostle in him,—a man who has eight hundred a-year and is
15312: contented with deal furniture and boiled beef because he gives away
15313: two-thirds of his income. That was a very fine thing of him,—taking
15314: into his house that poor lad Grattan, who shot his mother by accident.
15315: He sacrifices more time than a less busy man could spare, to save the
15316: poor fellow from getting into a morbid state of mind about it. He takes
15317: the lad out with him constantly, I see.”
15318: 
15319: “That is beautiful,” said Maggie, who had let her work fall, and was
15320: listening with keen interest. “I never knew any one who did such
15321: things.”
15322: 
15323: “And one admires that sort of action in Kenn all the more,” said
15324: Stephen, “because his manners in general are rather cold and severe.
15325: There’s nothing sugary and maudlin about him.”
15326: 
15327: “Oh, I think he’s a perfect character!” said Lucy, with pretty
15328: enthusiasm.
15329: 
15330: “No; there I can’t agree with you,” said Stephen, shaking his head with
15331: sarcastic gravity.
15332: 
15333: “Now, what fault can you point out in him?”
15334: 
15335: “He’s an Anglican.”
15336: 
15337: “Well, those are the right views, I think,” said Lucy, gravely.
15338: 
15339: “That settles the question in the abstract,” said Stephen, “but not
15340: from a parliamentary point of view. He has set the Dissenters and the
15341: Church people by the ears; and a rising senator like myself, of whose
15342: services the country is very much in need, will find it inconvenient
15343: when he puts up for the honour of representing St Ogg’s in Parliament.”
15344: 
15345: “Do you really think of that?” said Lucy, her eyes brightening with a
15346: proud pleasure that made her neglect the argumentative interests of
15347: Anglicanism.
15348: 
15349: “Decidedly, whenever old Mr Leyburn’s public spirit and gout induce him
15350: to give way. My father’s heart is set on it; and gifts like mine, you
15351: know”—here Stephen drew himself up, and rubbed his large white hands
15352: over his hair with playful self-admiration—“gifts like mine involve
15353: great responsibilities. Don’t you think so, Miss Tulliver?”
15354: 
15355: “Yes,” said Maggie, smiling, but not looking up; “so much fluency and
15356: self-possession should not be wasted entirely on private occasions.”
15357: 
15358: “Ah, I see how much penetration you have,” said Stephen. “You have
15359: discovered already that I am talkative and impudent. Now superficial
15360: people never discern that, owing to my manner, I suppose.”
15361: 
15362: “She doesn’t look at me when I talk of myself,” he thought, while his
15363: listeners were laughing. “I must try other subjects.”
15364: 
15365: Did Lucy intend to be present at the meeting of the Book Club next
15366: week? was the next question. Then followed the recommendation to choose
15367: Southey’s “Life of Cowper,” unless she were inclined to be
15368: philosophical, and startle the ladies of St Ogg’s by voting for one of
15369: the Bridgewater Treatises. Of course Lucy wished to know what these
15370: alarmingly learned books were; and as it is always pleasant to improve
15371: the minds of ladies by talking to them at ease on subjects of which
15372: they know nothing, Stephen became quite brilliant in an account of
15373: Buckland’s Treatise, which he had just been reading. He was rewarded by
15374: seeing Maggie let her work fall, and gradually get so absorbed in his
15375: wonderful geological story that she sat looking at him, leaning forward
15376: with crossed arms, and with an entire absence of self-consciousness, as
15377: if he had been the snuffiest of old professors, and she a downy-lipped
15378: alumna. He was so fascinated by the clear, large gaze that at last he
15379: forgot to look away from it occasionally toward Lucy; but she, sweet
15380: child, was only rejoicing that Stephen was proving to Maggie how clever
15381: he was, and that they would certainly be good friends after all.
15382: 
15383: “I will bring you the book, shall I, Miss Tulliver?” said Stephen, when
15384: he found the stream of his recollections running rather shallow. “There
15385: are many illustrations in it that you will like to see.”
15386: 
15387: “Oh, thank you,” said Maggie, blushing with returning
15388: self-consciousness at this direct address, and taking up her work
15389: again.
15390: 
15391: “No, no,” Lucy interposed. “I must forbid your plunging Maggie in
15392: books. I shall never get her away from them; and I want her to have
15393: delicious do-nothing days, filled with boating and chatting and riding
15394: and driving; that is the holiday she needs.”
15395: 
15396: “Apropos!” said Stephen, looking at his watch. “Shall we go out for a
15397: row on the river now? The tide will suit for us to the Tofton way, and
15398: we can walk back.”
15399: 
15400: That was a delightful proposition to Maggie, for it was years since she
15401: had been on the river. When she was gone to put on her bonnet, Lucy
15402: lingered to give an order to the servant, and took the opportunity of
15403: telling Stephen that Maggie had no objection to seeing Philip, so that
15404: it was a pity she had sent that note the day before yesterday. But she
15405: would write another to-morrow and invite him.
15406: 
15407: “I’ll call and beat him up to-morrow,” said Stephen, “and bring him
15408: with me in the evening, shall I? My sisters will want to call on you
15409: when I tell them your cousin is with you. I must leave the field clear
15410: for them in the morning.”
15411: 
15412: “Oh yes, pray bring him,” said Lucy. “And you _will_ like Maggie,
15413: sha’n’t you?” she added, in a beseeching tone. “Isn’t she a dear,
15414: noble-looking creature?”
15415: 
15416: “Too tall,” said Stephen, smiling down upon her, “and a little too
15417: fiery. She is not my type of woman, you know.”
15418: 
15419: Gentlemen, you are aware, are apt to impart these imprudent confidences
15420: to ladies concerning their unfavourable opinion of sister fair ones.
15421: That is why so many women have the advantage of knowing that they are
15422: secretly repulsive to men who have self-denyingly made ardent love to
15423: them. And hardly anything could be more distinctively characteristic of
15424: Lucy than that she both implicitly believed what Stephen said, and was
15425: determined that Maggie should not know it. But you, who have a higher
15426: logic than the verbal to guide you, have already foreseen, as the
15427: direct sequence to that unfavourable opinion of Stephen’s, that he
15428: walked down to the boathouse calculating, by the aid of a vivid
15429: imagination, that Maggie must give him her hand at least twice in
15430: consequence of this pleasant boating plan, and that a gentleman who
15431: wishes ladies to look at him is advantageously situated when he is
15432: rowing them in a boat. What then? Had he fallen in love with this
15433: surprising daughter of Mrs Tulliver at first sight? Certainly not. Such
15434: passions are never heard of in real life. Besides, he was in love
15435: already, and half-engaged to the dearest little creature in the world;
15436: and he was not a man to make a fool of himself in any way. But when one
15437: is five-and-twenty, one has not chalk-stones at one’s finger-ends that
15438: the touch of a handsome girl should be entirely indifferent. It was
15439: perfectly natural and safe to admire beauty and enjoy looking at it,—at
15440: least under such circumstances as the present. And there was really
15441: something very interesting about this girl, with her poverty and
15442: troubles; it was gratifying to see the friendship between the two
15443: cousins. Generally, Stephen admitted, he was not fond of women who had
15444: any peculiarity of character, but here the peculiarity seemed really of
15445: a superior kind, and provided one is not obliged to marry such women,
15446: why, they certainly make a variety in social intercourse.
15447: 
15448: Maggie did not fulfil Stephen’s hope by looking at him during the first
15449: quarter of an hour; her eyes were too full of the old banks that she
15450: knew so well. She felt lonely, cut off from Philip,—the only person who
15451: had ever seemed to love her devotedly, as she had always longed to be
15452: loved. But presently the rhythmic movement of the oars attracted her,
15453: and she thought she should like to learn how to row. This roused her
15454: from her reverie, and she asked if she might take an oar. It appeared
15455: that she required much teaching, and she became ambitious. The exercise
15456: brought the warm blood into her cheeks, and made her inclined to take
15457: her lesson merrily.
15458: 
15459: “I shall not be satisfied until I can manage both oars, and row you and
15460: Lucy,” she said, looking very bright as she stepped out of the boat.
15461: Maggie, we know, was apt to forget the thing she was doing, and she had
15462: chosen an inopportune moment for her remark; her foot slipped, but
15463: happily Mr Stephen Guest held her hand, and kept her up with a firm
15464: grasp.
15465: 
15466: “You have not hurt yourself at all, I hope?” he said, bending to look
15467: in her face with anxiety. It was very charming to be taken care of in
15468: that kind, graceful manner by some one taller and stronger than one’s
15469: self. Maggie had never felt just in the same way before.
15470: 
15471: When they reached home again, they found uncle and aunt Pullet seated
15472: with Mrs Tulliver in the drawing-room, and Stephen hurried away, asking
15473: leave to come again in the evening.
15474: 
15475: “And pray bring with you the volume of Purcell that you took away,”
15476: said Lucy. “I want Maggie to hear your best songs.”
15477: 
15478: Aunt Pullet, under the certainty that Maggie would be invited to go out
15479: with Lucy, probably to Park House, was much shocked at the shabbiness
15480: of her clothes, which when witnessed by the higher society of St Ogg’s,
15481: would be a discredit to the family, that demanded a strong and prompt
15482: remedy; and the consultation as to what would be most suitable to this
15483: end from among the superfluities of Mrs Pullet’s wardrobe was one that
15484: Lucy as well as Mrs Tulliver entered into with some zeal. Maggie must
15485: really have an evening dress as soon as possible, and she was about the
15486: same height as aunt Pullet.
15487: 
15488: “But she’s so much broader across the shoulders than I am, it’s very
15489: ill-convenient,” said Mrs Pullet, “else she might wear that beautiful
15490: black brocade o’ mine without any alteration; and her arms are beyond
15491: everything,” added Mrs Pullet, sorrowfully, as she lifted Maggie’s
15492: large round arm, “She’d never get my sleeves on.”
15493: 
15494: “Oh, never mind that, aunt; send us the dress,” said Lucy. “I don’t
15495: mean Maggie to have long sleeves, and I have abundance of black lace
15496: for trimming. Her arms will look beautiful.”
15497: 
15498: “Maggie’s arms _are_ a pretty shape,” said Mrs Tulliver. “They’re like
15499: mine used to be, only mine was never brown; I wish she’d had _our_
15500: family skin.”
15501: 
15502: “Nonsense, aunty!” said Lucy, patting her aunt Tulliver’s shoulder,
15503: “you don’t understand those things. A painter would think Maggie’s
15504: complexion beautiful.”
15505: 
15506: “Maybe, my dear,” said Mrs Tulliver, submissively. “You know better
15507: than I do. Only when I was young a brown skin wasn’t thought well on
15508: among respectable folks.”
15509: 
15510: “No,” said uncle Pullet, who took intense interest in the ladies’
15511: conversation as he sucked his lozenges. “Though there was a song about
15512: the ‘Nut-brown Maid’ too; I think she was crazy,—crazy Kate,—but I
15513: can’t justly remember.”
15514: 
15515: “Oh dear, dear!” said Maggie, laughing, but impatient; “I think that
15516: will be the end of _my_ brown skin, if it is always to be talked about
15517: so much.”
15518: 
15519: 
15520: Chapter III.
15521: 
15522: Confidential Moments
15523: 
15524: When Maggie went up to her bedroom that night, it appeared that she was
15525: not at all inclined to undress. She set down her candle on the first
15526: table that presented itself, and began to walk up and down her room,
15527: which was a large one, with a firm, regular, and rather rapid step,
15528: which showed that the exercise was the instinctive vent of strong
15529: excitement. Her eyes and cheeks had an almost feverish brilliancy; her
15530: head was thrown backward, and her hands were clasped with the palms
15531: outward, and with that tension of the arms which is apt to accompany
15532: mental absorption.
15533: 
15534: Had anything remarkable happened?
15535: 
15536: Nothing that you are not likely to consider in the highest degree
15537: unimportant. She had been hearing some fine music sung by a fine bass
15538: voice,—but then it was sung in a provincial, amateur fashion, such as
15539: would have left a critical ear much to desire. And she was conscious of
15540: having been looked at a great deal, in rather a furtive manner, from
15541: beneath a pair of well-marked horizontal eyebrows, with a glance that
15542: seemed somehow to have caught the vibratory influence of the voice.
15543: Such things could have had no perceptible effect on a thoroughly
15544: well-educated young lady, with a perfectly balanced mind, who had had
15545: all the advantages of fortune, training, and refined society. But if
15546: Maggie had been that young lady, you would probably have known nothing
15547: about her: her life would have had so few vicissitudes that it could
15548: hardly have been written; for the happiest women, like the happiest
15549: nations, have no history.
15550: 
15551: In poor Maggie’s highly-strung, hungry nature,—just come away from a
15552: third-rate schoolroom, with all its jarring sounds and petty round of
15553: tasks,—these apparently trivial causes had the effect of rousing and
15554: exalting her imagination in a way that was mysterious to herself. It
15555: was not that she thought distinctly of Mr Stephen Guest, or dwelt on
15556: the indications that he looked at her with admiration; it was rather
15557: that she felt the half-remote presence of a world of love and beauty
15558: and delight, made up of vague, mingled images from all the poetry and
15559: romance she had ever read, or had ever woven in her dreamy reveries.
15560: Her mind glanced back once or twice to the time when she had courted
15561: privation, when she had thought all longing, all impatience was
15562: subdued; but that condition seemed irrecoverably gone, and she recoiled
15563: from the remembrance of it. No prayer, no striving now, would bring
15564: back that negative peace; the battle of her life, it seemed, was not to
15565: be decided in that short and easy way,—by perfect renunciation at the
15566: very threshold of her youth.
15567: 
15568: The music was vibrating in her still,—Purcell’s music, with its wild
15569: passion and fancy,—and she could not stay in the recollection of that
15570: bare, lonely past. She was in her brighter aerial world again, when a
15571: little tap came at the door; of course it was her cousin, who entered
15572: in ample white dressing-gown.
15573: 
15574: “Why, Maggie, you naughty child, haven’t you begun to undress?” said
15575: Lucy, in astonishment. “I promised not to come and talk to you, because
15576: I thought you must be tired. But here you are, looking as if you were
15577: ready to dress for a ball. Come, come, get on your dressing-gown and
15578: unplait your hair.”
15579: 
15580: “Well, _you_ are not very forward,” retorted Maggie, hastily reaching
15581: her own pink cotton gown, and looking at Lucy’s light-brown hair
15582: brushed back in curly disorder.
15583: 
15584: “Oh, I have not much to do. I shall sit down and talk to you till I see
15585: you are really on the way to bed.”
15586: 
15587: While Maggie stood and unplaited her long black hair over her pink
15588: drapery, Lucy sat down near the toilette-table, watching her with
15589: affectionate eyes, and head a little aside, like a pretty spaniel. If
15590: it appears to you at all incredible that young ladies should be led on
15591: to talk confidentially in a situation of this kind, I will beg you to
15592: remember that human life furnishes many exceptional cases.
15593: 
15594: “You really _have_ enjoyed the music to-night, haven’t you Maggie?”
15595: 
15596: “Oh yes, that is what prevented me from feeling sleepy. I think I
15597: should have no other mortal wants, if I could always have plenty of
15598: music. It seems to infuse strength into my limbs, and ideas into my
15599: brain. Life seems to go on without effort, when I am filled with music.
15600: At other times one is conscious of carrying a weight.”
15601: 
15602: “And Stephen has a splendid voice, hasn’t he?”
15603: 
15604: “Well, perhaps we are neither of us judges of that,” said Maggie,
15605: laughing, as she seated herself and tossed her long hair back. “You are
15606: not impartial, and _I_ think any barrel-organ splendid.”
15607: 
15608: “But tell me what you think of him, now. Tell me exactly; good and bad
15609: too.”
15610: 
15611: “Oh, I think you should humiliate him a little. A lover should not be
15612: so much at ease, and so self-confident. He ought to tremble more.”
15613: 
15614: “Nonsense, Maggie! As if any one could tremble at me! You think he is
15615: conceited, I see that. But you don’t dislike him, do you?”
15616: 
15617: “Dislike him! No. Am I in the habit of seeing such charming people,
15618: that I should be very difficult to please? Besides, how could I dislike
15619: any one that promised to make you happy, my dear thing!” Maggie pinched
15620: Lucy’s dimpled chin.
15621: 
15622: “We shall have more music to-morrow evening,” said Lucy, looking happy
15623: already, “for Stephen will bring Philip Wakem with him.”
15624: 
15625: “Oh, Lucy, I can’t see him,” said Maggie, turning pale. “At least, I
15626: could not see him without Tom’s leave.”
15627: 
15628: “Is Tom such a tyrant as that?” said Lucy, surprised. “I’ll take the
15629: responsibility, then,—tell him it was my fault.”
15630: 
15631: “But, dear,” said Maggie, falteringly, “I promised Tom very solemnly,
15632: before my father’s death,—I promised him I would not speak to Philip
15633: without his knowledge and consent. And I have a great dread of opening
15634: the subject with Tom,—of getting into a quarrel with him again.”
15635: 
15636: “But I never heard of anything so strange and unreasonable. What harm
15637: can poor Philip have done? May I speak to Tom about it?”
15638: 
15639: “Oh no, pray don’t, dear,” said Maggie. “I’ll go to him myself
15640: to-morrow, and tell him that you wish Philip to come. I’ve thought
15641: before of asking him to absolve me from my promise, but I’ve not had
15642: the courage to determine on it.”
15643: 
15644: They were both silent for some moments, and then Lucy said,—
15645: 
15646: “Maggie, you have secrets from me, and I have none from you.”
15647: 
15648: Maggie looked meditatively away from Lucy. Then she turned to her and
15649: said, “I _should_ like to tell you about Philip. But, Lucy, you must
15650: not betray that you know it to any one—least of all to Philip himself,
15651: or to Mr Stephen Guest.”
15652: 
15653: The narrative lasted long, for Maggie had never before known the relief
15654: of such an outpouring; she had never before told Lucy anything of her
15655: inmost life; and the sweet face bent toward her with sympathetic
15656: interest, and the little hand pressing hers, encouraged her to speak
15657: on. On two points only she was not expansive. She did not betray fully
15658: what still rankled in her mind as Tom’s great offence,—the insults he
15659: had heaped on Philip. Angry as the remembrance still made her, she
15660: could not bear that any one else should know it at all, both for Tom’s
15661: sake and Philip’s. And she could not bear to tell Lucy of the last
15662: scene between her father and Wakem, though it was this scene which she
15663: had ever since felt to be a new barrier between herself and Philip. She
15664: merely said, she saw now that Tom was, on the whole, right in regarding
15665: any prospect of love and marriage between her and Philip as put out of
15666: the question by the relation of the two families. Of course Philip’s
15667: father would never consent.
15668: 
15669: “There, Lucy, you have had my story,” said Maggie, smiling, with the
15670: tears in her eyes. “You see I am like Sir Andrew Aguecheek. _I_ was
15671: adored once.”
15672: 
15673: “Ah, now I see how it is you know Shakespeare and everything, and have
15674: learned so much since you left school; which always seemed to me
15675: witchcraft before,—part of your general uncanniness,” said Lucy.
15676: 
15677: She mused a little with her eyes downward, and then added, looking at
15678: Maggie, “It is very beautiful that you should love Philip; I never
15679: thought such a happiness would befall him. And in my opinion, you ought
15680: not to give him up. There are obstacles now; but they may be done away
15681: with in time.”
15682: 
15683: Maggie shook her head.
15684: 
15685: “Yes, yes,” persisted Lucy; “I can’t help being hopeful about it. There
15686: is something romantic in it,—out of the common way,—just what
15687: everything that happens to you ought to be. And Philip will adore you
15688: like a husband in a fairy tale. Oh, I shall puzzle my small brain to
15689: contrive some plot that will bring everybody into the right mind, so
15690: that you may marry Philip when I marry—somebody else. Wouldn’t that be
15691: a pretty ending to all my poor, poor Maggie’s troubles?”
15692: 
15693: Maggie tried to smile, but shivered, as if she felt a sudden chill.
15694: 
15695: “Ah, dear, you are cold,” said Lucy. “You must go to bed; and so must
15696: I. I dare not think what time it is.”
15697: 
15698: They kissed each other, and Lucy went away, possessed of a confidence
15699: which had a strong influence over her subsequent impressions. Maggie
15700: had been thoroughly sincere; her nature had never found it easy to be
15701: otherwise. But confidences are sometimes blinding, even when they are
15702: sincere.
15703: 
15704: 
15705: Chapter IV.
15706: 
15707: Brother and Sister
15708: 
15709: Maggie was obliged to go to Tom’s lodgings in the middle of the day,
15710: when he would be coming in to dinner, else she would not have found him
15711: at home. He was not lodging with entire strangers. Our friend Bob Jakin
15712: had, with Mumps’s tacit consent, taken not only a wife about eight
15713: months ago, but also one of those queer old houses, pierced with
15714: surprising passages, by the water-side, where, as he observed, his wife
15715: and mother could keep themselves out of mischief by letting out two
15716: “pleasure-boats,” in which he had invested some of his savings, and by
15717: taking in a lodger for the parlour and spare bedroom. Under these
15718: circumstances, what could be better for the interests of all parties,
15719: sanitary considerations apart, than that the lodger should be Mr Tom?
15720: 
15721: It was Bob’s wife who opened the door to Maggie. She was a tiny woman,
15722: with the general physiognomy of a Dutch doll, looking, in comparison
15723: with Bob’s mother, who filled up the passage in the rear, very much
15724: like one of those human figures which the artist finds conveniently
15725: standing near a colossal statue to show the proportions. The tiny woman
15726: curtsied and looked up at Maggie with some awe as soon as she had
15727: opened the door; but the words, “Is my brother at home?” which Maggie
15728: uttered smilingly, made her turn round with sudden excitement, and
15729: say,—
15730: 
15731: “Eh, mother, mother—tell Bob!—it’s Miss Maggie! Come in, Miss, for
15732: goodness do,” she went on, opening a side door, and endeavoring to
15733: flatten her person against the wall to make the utmost space for the
15734: visitor.
15735: 
15736: Sad recollections crowded on Maggie as she entered the small parlour,
15737: which was now all that poor Tom had to call by the name of “home,”—that
15738: name which had once, so many years ago, meant for both of them the same
15739: sum of dear familiar objects. But everything was not strange to her in
15740: this new room; the first thing her eyes dwelt on was the large old
15741: Bible, and the sight was not likely to disperse the old memories. She
15742: stood without speaking.
15743: 
15744: “If you please to take the privilege o’ sitting down, Miss,” said Mrs
15745: Jakin, rubbing her apron over a perfectly clean chair, and then lifting
15746: up the corner of that garment and holding it to her face with an air of
15747: embarrassment, as she looked wonderingly at Maggie.
15748: 
15749: “Bob is at home, then?” said Maggie, recovering herself, and smiling at
15750: the bashful Dutch doll.
15751: 
15752: “Yes, Miss; but I think he must be washing and dressing himself; I’ll
15753: go and see,” said Mrs Jakin, disappearing.
15754: 
15755: But she presently came back walking with new courage a little way
15756: behind her husband, who showed the brilliancy of his blue eyes and
15757: regular white teeth in the doorway, bowing respectfully.
15758: 
15759: “How do you do, Bob?” said Maggie, coming forward and putting out her
15760: hand to him; “I always meant to pay your wife a visit, and I shall come
15761: another day on purpose for that, if she will let me. But I was obliged
15762: to come to-day to speak to my brother.”
15763: 
15764: “He’ll be in before long, Miss. He’s doin’ finely, Mr Tom is; he’ll be
15765: one o’ the first men hereabouts,—you’ll see that.”
15766: 
15767: “Well, Bob, I’m sure he’ll be indebted to you, whatever he becomes; he
15768: said so himself only the other night, when he was talking of you.”
15769: 
15770: “Eh, Miss, that’s his way o’ takin’ it. But I think the more on’t when
15771: he says a thing, because his tongue doesn’t overshoot him as mine does.
15772: Lors! I’m no better nor a tilted bottle, I ar’n’t,—I can’t stop mysen
15773: when once I begin. But you look rarely, Miss; it does me good to see
15774: you. What do you say now, Prissy?”—here Bob turned to his wife,—“Isn’t
15775: it all come true as I said? Though there isn’t many sorts o’ goods as I
15776: can’t over-praise when I set my tongue to’t.”
15777: 
15778: Mrs Bob’s small nose seemed to be following the example of her eyes in
15779: turning up reverentially toward Maggie, but she was able now to smile
15780: and curtsey, and say, “I’d looked forrard like aenything to seein’ you,
15781: Miss, for my husband’s tongue’s been runnin’ on you, like as if he was
15782: light-headed, iver since first he come a-courtin’ on me.”
15783: 
15784: “Well, well,” said Bob, looking rather silly. “Go an’ see after the
15785: taters, else Mr Tom ’ull have to wait for ’em.”
15786: 
15787: “I hope Mumps is friendly with Mrs Jakin, Bob,” said Maggie, smiling.
15788: “I remember you used to say he wouldn’t like your marrying.”
15789: 
15790: “Eh, Miss,” said Bob, “he made up his mind to’t when he see’d what a
15791: little un she was. He pretends not to see her mostly, or else to think
15792: as she isn’t full-growed. But about Mr Tom, Miss,” said Bob, speaking
15793: lower and looking serious, “he’s as close as a iron biler, he is; but
15794: I’m a ’cutish chap, an’ when I’ve left off carrying my pack, an’ am at
15795: a loose end, I’ve got more brains nor I know what to do wi’, an’ I’m
15796: forced to busy myself wi’ other folks’s insides. An’ it worrets me as
15797: Mr Tom’ll sit by himself so glumpish, a-knittin’ his brow, an’
15798: a-lookin’ at the fire of a night. He should be a bit livelier now, a
15799: fine young fellow like him. My wife says, when she goes in sometimes,
15800: an’ he takes no notice of her, he sits lookin’ into the fire, and
15801: frownin’ as if he was watchin’ folks at work in it.”
15802: 
15803: “He thinks so much about business,” said Maggie.
15804: 
15805: “Ay,” said Bob, speaking lower; “but do you think it’s nothin’ else,
15806: Miss? He’s close, Mr Tom is; but I’m a ’cute chap, I am, an’ I thought
15807: tow’rt last Christmas as I’d found out a soft place in him. It was
15808: about a little black spaniel—a rare bit o’ breed—as he made a fuss to
15809: get. But since then summat’s come over him, as he’s set his teeth
15810: again’ things more nor iver, for all he’s had such good luck. An’ I
15811: wanted to tell _you_, Miss, ’cause I thought you might work it out of
15812: him a bit, now you’re come. He’s a deal too lonely, and doesn’t go into
15813: company enough.”
15814: 
15815: “I’m afraid I have very little power over him, Bob,” said Maggie, a
15816: good deal moved by Bob’s suggestion. It was a totally new idea to her
15817: mind that Tom could have his love troubles. Poor fellow!—and in love
15818: with Lucy too! But it was perhaps a mere fancy of Bob’s too officious
15819: brain. The present of the dog meant nothing more than cousinship and
15820: gratitude. But Bob had already said, “Here’s Mr Tom,” and the outer
15821: door was opening.
15822: 
15823: “There is no time to spare, Tom,” said Maggie, as soon as Bob left the
15824: room. “I must tell you at once what I came about, else I shall be
15825: hindering you from taking your dinner.”
15826: 
15827: Tom stood with his back against the chimney-piece, and Maggie was
15828: seated opposite the light. He noticed that she was tremulous, and he
15829: had a presentiment of the subject she was going to speak about. The
15830: presentiment made his voice colder and harder as he said, “What is it?”
15831: 
15832: This tone roused a spirit of resistance in Maggie, and she put her
15833: request in quite a different form from the one she had predetermined
15834: on. She rose from her seat, and looking straight at Tom, said,—
15835: 
15836: “I want you to absolve me from my promise about Philip Wakem. Or
15837: rather, I promised you not to see him without telling you. I am come to
15838: tell you that I wish to see him.”
15839: 
15840: “Very well,” said Tom, still more coldly.
15841: 
15842: But Maggie had hardly finished speaking in that chill, defiant manner,
15843: before she repented, and felt the dread of alienation from her brother.
15844: 
15845: “Not for myself, dear Tom. Don’t be angry. I shouldn’t have asked it,
15846: only that Philip, you know, is a friend of Lucy’s and she wishes him to
15847: come, has invited him to come this evening; and I told her I couldn’t
15848: see him without telling you. I shall only see him in the presence of
15849: other people. There will never be anything secret between us again.”
15850: 
15851: Tom looked away from Maggie, knitting his brow more strongly for a
15852: little while. Then he turned to her and said, slowly and emphatically,—
15853: 
15854: “You know what is my feeling on that subject, Maggie. There is no need
15855: for my repeating anything I said a year ago. While my father was
15856: living, I felt bound to use the utmost power over you, to prevent you
15857: from disgracing him as well as yourself, and all of us. But now I must
15858: leave you to your own choice. You wish to be independent; you told me
15859: so after my father’s death. My opinion is not changed. If you think of
15860: Philip Wakem as a lover again, you must give up me.”
15861: 
15862: “I don’t wish it, dear Tom, at least as things are; I see that it would
15863: lead to misery. But I shall soon go away to another situation, and I
15864: should like to be friends with him again while I am here. Lucy wishes
15865: it.”
15866: 
15867: The severity of Tom’s face relaxed a little.
15868: 
15869: “I shouldn’t mind your seeing him occasionally at my uncle’s—I don’t
15870: want you to make a fuss on the subject. But I have no confidence in
15871: you, Maggie. You would be led away to do anything.”
15872: 
15873: That was a cruel word. Maggie’s lip began to tremble.
15874: 
15875: “Why will you say that, Tom? It is very hard of you. Have I not done
15876: and borne everything as well as I could? And I kept my word to
15877: you—when—when——My life has not been a happy one, any more than yours.”
15878: 
15879: She was obliged to be childish; the tears would come. When Maggie was
15880: not angry, she was as dependent on kind or cold words as a daisy on the
15881: sunshine or the cloud; the need of being loved would always subdue her,
15882: as, in old days, it subdued her in the worm-eaten attic. The brother’s
15883: goodness came uppermost at this appeal, but it could only show itself
15884: in Tom’s fashion. He put his hand gently on her arm, and said, in the
15885: tone of a kind pedagogue,—
15886: 
15887: “Now listen to me, Maggie. I’ll tell you what I mean. You’re always in
15888: extremes; you have no judgment and self-command; and yet you think you
15889: know best, and will not submit to be guided. You know I didn’t wish you
15890: to take a situation. My aunt Pullet was willing to give you a good
15891: home, and you might have lived respectably amongst your relations,
15892: until I could have provided a home for you with my mother. And that is
15893: what I should like to do. I wished my sister to be a lady, and I always
15894: have taken care of you, as my father desired, until you were well
15895: married. But your ideas and mine never accord, and you will not give
15896: way. Yet you might have sense enough to see that a brother, who goes
15897: out into the world and mixes with men, necessarily knows better what is
15898: right and respectable for his sister than she can know herself. You
15899: think I am not kind; but my kindness can only be directed by what I
15900: believe to be good for you.”
15901: 
15902: “Yes, I know, dear Tom,” said Maggie, still half-sobbing, but trying to
15903: control her tears. “I know you would do a great deal for me; I know how
15904: you work, and don’t spare yourself. I am grateful to you. But, indeed,
15905: you can’t quite judge for me; our natures are very different. You don’t
15906: know how differently things affect me from what they do you.”
15907: 
15908: “Yes, I _do_ know; I know it too well. I know how differently you must
15909: feel about all that affects our family, and your own dignity as a young
15910: woman, before you could think of receiving secret addresses from Philip
15911: Wakem. If it was not disgusting to me in every other way, I should
15912: object to my sister’s name being associated for a moment with that of a
15913: young man whose father must hate the very thought of us all, and would
15914: spurn you. With any one but you, I should think it quite certain that
15915: what you witnessed just before my father’s death would secure you from
15916: ever thinking again of Philip Wakem as a lover. But I don’t feel
15917: certain of it with you; I never feel certain about anything with _you_.
15918: At one time you take pleasure in a sort of perverse self-denial, and at
15919: another you have not resolution to resist a thing that you know to be
15920: wrong.”
15921: 
15922: There was a terrible cutting truth in Tom’s words,—that hard rind of
15923: truth which is discerned by unimaginative, unsympathetic minds. Maggie
15924: always writhed under this judgment of Tom’s; she rebelled and was
15925: humiliated in the same moment; it seemed as if he held a glass before
15926: her to show her her own folly and weakness, as if he were a prophetic
15927: voice predicting her future fallings; and yet, all the while, she
15928: judged him in return; she said inwardly that he was narrow and unjust,
15929: that he was below feeling those mental needs which were often the
15930: source of the wrong-doing or absurdity that made her life a planless
15931: riddle to him.
15932: 
15933: She did not answer directly; her heart was too full, and she sat down,
15934: leaning her arm on the table. It was no use trying to make Tom feel
15935: that she was near to him. He always repelled her. Her feeling under his
15936: words was complicated by the allusion to the last scene between her
15937: father and Wakem; and at length that painful, solemn memory surmounted
15938: the immediate grievance. No! She did not think of such things with
15939: frivolous indifference, and Tom must not accuse her of that. She looked
15940: up at him with a grave, earnest gaze and said,—
15941: 
15942: “I can’t make you think better of me, Tom, by anything I can say. But I
15943: am not so shut out from all your feelings as you believe me to be. I
15944: see as well as you do that from our position with regard to Philip’s
15945: father—not on other grounds—it would be unreasonable, it would be
15946: wrong, for us to entertain the idea of marriage; and I have given up
15947: thinking of him as a lover. I am telling you the truth, and you have no
15948: right to disbelieve me; I have kept my word to you, and you have never
15949: detected me in a falsehood. I should not only not encourage, I should
15950: carefully avoid, any intercourse with Philip on any other footing than
15951: of quiet friendship. You may think that I am unable to keep my
15952: resolutions; but at least you ought not to treat me with hard contempt
15953: on the ground of faults that I have not committed yet.”
15954: 
15955: “Well, Maggie,” said Tom, softening under this appeal, “I don’t want to
15956: overstrain matters. I think, all things considered, it will be best for
15957: you to see Philip Wakem, if Lucy wishes him to come to the house. I
15958: believe what you say,—at least you believe it yourself, I know; I can
15959: only warn you. I wish to be as good a brother to you as you will let
15960: me.”
15961: 
15962: There was a little tremor in Tom’s voice as he uttered the last words,
15963: and Maggie’s ready affection came back with as sudden a glow as when
15964: they were children, and bit their cake together as a sacrament of
15965: conciliation. She rose and laid her hand on Tom’s shoulder.
15966: 
15967: “Dear Tom, I know you mean to be good. I know you have had a great deal
15968: to bear, and have done a great deal. I should like to be a comfort to
15969: you, not to vex you. You don’t think I’m altogether naughty, now, do
15970: you?”
15971: 
15972: Tom smiled at the eager face; his smiles were very pleasant to see when
15973: they did come, for the gray eyes could be tender underneath the frown.
15974: 
15975: “No, Maggie.”
15976: 
15977: “I may turn out better than you expect.”
15978: 
15979: “I hope you will.”
15980: 
15981: “And may I come some day and make tea for you, and see this extremely
15982: small wife of Bob’s again?”
15983: 
15984: “Yes; but trot away now, for I’ve no more time to spare,” said Tom,
15985: looking at his watch.
15986: 
15987: “Not to give me a kiss?”
15988: 
15989: Tom bent to kiss her cheek, and then said,—
15990: 
15991: “There! Be a good girl. I’ve got a great deal to think of to-day. I’m
15992: going to have a long consultation with my uncle Deane this afternoon.”
15993: 
15994: “You’ll come to aunt Glegg’s to-morrow? We’re going all to dine early,
15995: that we may go there to tea. You _must_ come; Lucy told me to say so.”
15996: 
15997: “Oh, pooh! I’ve plenty else to do,” said Tom, pulling his bell
15998: violently, and bringing down the small bell-rope.
15999: 
16000: “I’m frightened; I shall run away,” said Maggie, making a laughing
16001: retreat; while Tom, with masculine philosophy, flung the bell-rope to
16002: the farther end of the room; not very far either,—a touch of human
16003: experience which I flatter myself will come home to the bosoms of not a
16004: few substantial or distinguished men who were once at an early stage of
16005: their rise in the world, and were cherishing very large hopes in very
16006: small lodgings.

16009: Chapter V.
16010: 
16011: Showing That Tom Had Opened the Oyster
16012: 
16013: “And now we’ve settled this Newcastle business, Tom,” said Mr Deane,
16014: that same afternoon, as they were seated in the private room at the
16015: Bank together, “there’s another matter I want to talk to you about.
16016: Since you’re likely to have rather a smoky, unpleasant time of it at
16017: Newcastle for the next few weeks, you’ll want a good prospect of some
16018: sort to keep up your spirits.”
16019: 
16020: Tom waited less nervously than he had done on a former occasion in this
16021: apartment, while his uncle took out his snuff-box and gratified each
16022: nostril with deliberate impartiality.
16023: 
16024: “You see, Tom,” said Mr Deane at last, throwing himself backward, “the
16025: world goes on at a smarter pace now than it did when I was a young
16026: fellow. Why, sir, forty years ago, when I was much such a strapping
16027: youngster as you, a man expected to pull between the shafts the best
16028: part of his life, before he got the whip in his hand. The looms went
16029: slowish, and fashions didn’t alter quite so fast; I’d a best suit that
16030: lasted me six years. Everything was on a lower scale, sir,—in point of
16031: expenditure, I mean. It’s this steam, you see, that has made the
16032: difference; it drives on every wheel double pace, and the wheel of
16033: fortune along with ’em, as our Mr Stephen Guest said at the anniversary
16034: dinner (he hits these things off wonderfully, considering he’s seen
16035: nothing of business). I don’t find fault with the change, as some
16036: people do. Trade, sir, opens a man’s eyes; and if the population is to
16037: get thicker upon the ground, as it’s doing, the world must use its wits
16038: at inventions of one sort or other. I know I’ve done my share as an
16039: ordinary man of business. Somebody has said it’s a fine thing to make
16040: two ears of corn grow where only one grew before; but, sir, it’s a fine
16041: thing, too, to further the exchange of commodities, and bring the
16042: grains of corn to the mouths that are hungry. And that’s our line of
16043: business; and I consider it as honourable a position as a man can hold,
16044: to be connected with it.”
16045: 
16046: Tom knew that the affair his uncle had to speak of was not urgent; Mr
16047: Deane was too shrewd and practical a man to allow either his
16048: reminiscences or his snuff to impede the progress of trade. Indeed, for
16049: the last month or two, there had been hints thrown out to Tom which
16050: enabled him to guess that he was going to hear some proposition for his
16051: own benefit. With the beginning of the last speech he had stretched out
16052: his legs, thrust his hands in his pockets, and prepared himself for
16053: some introductory diffuseness, tending to show that Mr Deane had
16054: succeeded by his own merit, and that what he had to say to young men in
16055: general was, that if they didn’t succeed too it was because of their
16056: own demerit. He was rather surprised, then, when his uncle put a direct
16057: question to him.
16058: 
16059: “Let me see,—it’s going on for seven years now since you applied to me
16060: for a situation, eh, Tom?”
16061: 
16062: “Yes, sir; I’m three-and-twenty now,” said Tom.
16063: 
16064: “Ah, it’s as well not to say that, though; for you’d pass for a good
16065: deal older, and age tells well in business. I remember your coming very
16066: well; I remember I saw there was some pluck in you, and that was what
16067: made me give you encouragement. And I’m happy to say I was right; I’m
16068: not often deceived. I was naturally a little shy at pushing my nephew,
16069: but I’m happy to say you’ve done me credit, sir; and if I’d had a son
16070: o’ my own, I shouldn’t have been sorry to see him like you.”
16071: 
16072: Mr Deane tapped his box and opened it again, repeating in a tone of
16073: some feeling, “No, I shouldn’t have been sorry to see him like you.”
16074: 
16075: “I’m very glad I’ve given you satisfaction, sir; I’ve done my best,”
16076: said Tom, in his proud, independent way.
16077: 
16078: “Yes, Tom, you’ve given me satisfaction. I don’t speak of your conduct
16079: as a son; though that weighs with me in my opinion of you. But what I
16080: have to do with, as a partner in our firm, is the qualities you’ve
16081: shown as a man o’ business. Ours is a fine business,—a splendid
16082: concern, sir,—and there’s no reason why it shouldn’t go on growing;
16083: there’s a growing capital, and growing outlets for it; but there’s
16084: another thing that’s wanted for the prosperity of every concern, large
16085: or small, and that’s men to conduct it,—men of the right habits; none
16086: o’ your flashy fellows, but such as are to be depended on. Now this is
16087: what Mr Guest and I see clear enough. Three years ago we took Gell into
16088: the concern; we gave him a share in the oil-mill. And why? Why, because
16089: Gell was a fellow whose services were worth a premium. So it will
16090: always be, sir. So it was with me. And though Gell is pretty near ten
16091: years older than you, there are other points in your favour.”
16092: 
16093: Tom was getting a little nervous as Mr Deane went on speaking; he was
16094: conscious of something he had in his mind to say, which might not be
16095: agreeable to his uncle, simply because it was a new suggestion rather
16096: than an acceptance of the proposition he foresaw.
16097: 
16098: “It stands to reason,” Mr Deane went on, when he had finished his new
16099: pinch, “that your being my nephew weighs in your favour; but I don’t
16100: deny that if you’d been no relation of mine at all, your conduct in
16101: that affair of Pelley’s bank would have led Mr Guest and myself to make
16102: some acknowledgment of the service you’ve been to us; and, backed by
16103: your general conduct and business ability, it has made us determine on
16104: giving you a share in the business,—a share which we shall be glad to
16105: increase as the years go on. We think that’ll be better, on all
16106: grounds, than raising your salary. It’ll give you more importance, and
16107: prepare you better for taking some of the anxiety off my shoulders by
16108: and by. I’m equal to a good deal o’ work at present, thank God; but I’m
16109: getting older,—there’s no denying that. I told Mr Guest I would open
16110: the subject to you; and when you come back from this northern business,
16111: we can go into particulars. This is a great stride for a young fellow
16112: of three-and-twenty, but I’m bound to say you’ve deserved it.”
16113: 
16114: “I’m very grateful to Mr Guest and you, sir; of course I feel the most
16115: indebted to _you_, who first took me into the business, and have taken
16116: a good deal of pains with me since.”
16117: 
16118: Tom spoke with a slight tremor, and paused after he had said this.
16119: 
16120: “Yes, yes,” said Mr Deane. “I don’t spare pains when I see they’ll be
16121: of any use. I gave myself some trouble with Gell, else he wouldn’t have
16122: been what he is.”
16123: 
16124: “But there’s one thing I should like to mention to you uncle. I’ve
16125: never spoken to you of it before. If you remember, at the time my
16126: father’s property was sold, there was some thought of your firm buying
16127: the Mill; I know you thought it would be a very good investment,
16128: especially if steam were applied.”
16129: 
16130: “To be sure, to be sure. But Wakem outbid us; he’d made up his mind to
16131: that. He’s rather fond of carrying everything over other people’s
16132: heads.”
16133: 
16134: “Perhaps it’s of no use my mentioning it at present,” Tom went on, “but
16135: I wish you to know what I have in my mind about the Mill. I’ve a strong
16136: feeling about it. It was my father’s dying wish that I should try and
16137: get it back again whenever I could; it was in his family for five
16138: generations. I promised my father; and besides that, I’m attached to
16139: the place. I shall never like any other so well. And if it should ever
16140: suit your views to buy it for the firm, I should have a better chance
16141: of fulfilling my father’s wish. I shouldn’t have liked to mention the
16142: thing to you, only you’ve been kind enough to say my services have been
16143: of some value. And I’d give up a much greater chance in life for the
16144: sake of having the Mill again,—I mean having it in my own hands, and
16145: gradually working off the price.”
16146: 
16147: Mr Deane had listened attentively, and now looked thoughtful.
16148: 
16149: “I see, I see,” he said, after a while; “the thing would be possible if
16150: there were any chance of Wakem’s parting with the property. But that I
16151: _don’t_ see. He’s put that young Jetsome in the place; and he had his
16152: reasons when he bought it, I’ll be bound.”
16153: 
16154: “He’s a loose fish, that young Jetsome,” said Tom. “He’s taking to
16155: drinking, and they say he’s letting the business go down. Luke told me
16156: about it,—our old miller. He says he sha’n’t stay unless there’s an
16157: alteration. I was thinking, if things went on that way, Wakem might be
16158: more willing to part with the Mill. Luke says he’s getting very sour
16159: about the way things are going on.”
16160: 
16161: “Well, I’ll turn it over, Tom. I must inquire into the matter, and go
16162: into it with Mr Guest. But, you see, it’s rather striking out a new
16163: branch, and putting you to that, instead of keeping you where you are,
16164: which was what we’d wanted.”
16165: 
16166: “I should be able to manage more than the Mill when things were once
16167: set properly going, sir. I want to have plenty of work. There’s nothing
16168: else I care about much.”
16169: 
16170: There was something rather sad in that speech from a young man of
16171: three-and-twenty, even in uncle Deane’s business-loving ears.
16172: 
16173: “Pooh, pooh! you’ll be having a wife to care about one of these days,
16174: if you get on at this pace in the world. But as to this Mill, we
16175: mustn’t reckon on our chickens too early. However, I promise you to
16176: bear it in mind, and when you come back we’ll talk of it again. I am
16177: going to dinner now. Come and breakfast with us to-morrow morning, and
16178: say good-bye to your mother and sister before you start.”
16179: 
16180: 
16181: Chapter VI.
16182: 
16183: Illustrating the Laws of Attraction
16184: 
16185: It is evident to you now that Maggie had arrived at a moment in her
16186: life which must be considered by all prudent persons as a great
16187: opportunity for a young woman. Launched into the higher society of St
16188: Ogg’s, with a striking person, which had the advantage of being quite
16189: unfamiliar to the majority of beholders, and with such moderate
16190: assistance of costume as you have seen foreshadowed in Lucy’s anxious
16191: colloquy with aunt Pullet, Maggie was certainly at a new starting-point
16192: in life. At Lucy’s first evening party, young Torry fatigued his facial
16193: muscles more than usual in order that “the dark-eyed girl there in the
16194: corner” might see him in all the additional style conferred by his
16195: eyeglass; and several young ladies went home intending to have short
16196: sleeves with black lace, and to plait their hair in a broad coronet at
16197: the back of their head,—“That cousin of Miss Deane’s looked so very
16198: well.” In fact, poor Maggie, with all her inward consciousness of a
16199: painful past and her presentiment of a troublous future, was on the way
16200: to become an object of some envy,—a topic of discussion in the newly
16201: established billiard-room, and between fair friends who had no secrets
16202: from each other on the subject of trimmings. The Miss Guests, who
16203: associated chiefly on terms of condescension with the families of St
16204: Ogg’s, and were the glass of fashion there, took some exception to
16205: Maggie’s manners. She had a way of not assenting at once to the
16206: observations current in good society, and of saying that she didn’t
16207: know whether those observations were true or not, which gave her an air
16208: of _gaucherie_, and impeded the even flow of conversation; but it is a
16209: fact capable of an amiable interpretation that ladies are not the worst
16210: disposed toward a new acquaintance of their own sex because she has
16211: points of inferiority. And Maggie was so entirely without those pretty
16212: airs of coquetry which have the traditional reputation of driving
16213: gentlemen to despair that she won some feminine pity for being so
16214: ineffective in spite of her beauty. She had not had many advantages,
16215: poor thing! and it must be admitted there was no pretension about her;
16216: her abruptness and unevenness of manner were plainly the result of her
16217: secluded and lowly circumstances. It was only a wonder that there was
16218: no tinge of vulgarity about her, considering what the rest of poor
16219: Lucy’s relations were—an allusion which always made the Miss Guests
16220: shudder a little. It was not agreeable to think of any connection by
16221: marriage with such people as the Gleggs and the Pullets; but it was of
16222: no use to contradict Stephen when once he had set his mind on anything,
16223: and certainly there was no possible objection to Lucy in herself,—no
16224: one could help liking her. She would naturally desire that the Miss
16225: Guests should behave kindly to this cousin of whom she was so fond, and
16226: Stephen would make a great fuss if they were deficient in civility.
16227: Under these circumstances the invitations to Park House were not
16228: wanting; and elsewhere, also, Miss Deane was too popular and too
16229: distinguished a member of society in St Ogg’s for any attention toward
16230: her to be neglected.
16231: 
16232: Thus Maggie was introduced for the first time to the young lady’s life,
16233: and knew what it was to get up in the morning without any imperative
16234: reason for doing one thing more than another. This new sense of leisure
16235: and unchecked enjoyment amidst the soft-breathing airs and
16236: garden-scents of advancing spring—amidst the new abundance of music,
16237: and lingering strolls in the sunshine, and the delicious dreaminess of
16238: gliding on the river—could hardly be without some intoxicating effect
16239: on her, after her years of privation; and even in the first week Maggie
16240: began to be less haunted by her sad memories and anticipations. Life
16241: was certainly very pleasant just now; it was becoming very pleasant to
16242: dress in the evening, and to feel that she was one of the beautiful
16243: things of this spring-time. And there were admiring eyes always
16244: awaiting her now; she was no longer an unheeded person, liable to be
16245: chid, from whom attention was continually claimed, and on whom no one
16246: felt bound to confer any. It was pleasant, too, when Stephen and Lucy
16247: were gone out riding, to sit down at the piano alone, and find that the
16248: old fitness between her fingers and the keys remained, and revived,
16249: like a sympathetic kinship not to be worn out by separation; to get the
16250: tunes she had heard the evening before, and repeat them again and again
16251: until she had found out a way of producing them so as to make them a
16252: more pregnant, passionate language to her. The mere concord of octaves
16253: was a delight to Maggie, and she would often take up a book of studies
16254: rather than any melody, that she might taste more keenly by abstraction
16255: the more primitive sensation of intervals. Not that her enjoyment of
16256: music was of the kind that indicates a great specific talent; it was
16257: rather that her sensibility to the supreme excitement of music was only
16258: one form of that passionate sensibility which belonged to her whole
16259: nature, and made her faults and virtues all merge in each other; made
16260: her affections sometimes an impatient demand, but also prevented her
16261: vanity from taking the form of mere feminine coquetry and device, and
16262: gave it the poetry of ambition. But you have known Maggie a long while,
16263: and need to be told, not her characteristics, but her history, which is
16264: a thing hardly to be predicted even from the completest knowledge of
16265: characteristics. For the tragedy of our lives is not created entirely
16266: from within. “Character,” says Novalis, in one of his questionable
16267: aphorisms,—“character is destiny.” But not the whole of our destiny.
16268: Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, was speculative and irresolute, and we have
16269: a great tragedy in consequence. But if his father had lived to a good
16270: old age, and his uncle had died an early death, we can conceive
16271: Hamlet’s having married Ophelia, and got through life with a reputation
16272: of sanity, notwithstanding many soliloquies, and some moody sarcasms
16273: toward the fair daughter of Polonius, to say nothing of the frankest
16274: incivility to his father-in-law.
16275: 
16276: Maggie’s destiny, then, is at present hidden, and we must wait for it
16277: to reveal itself like the course of an unmapped river; we only know
16278: that the river is full and rapid, and that for all rivers there is the
16279: same final home. Under the charm of her new pleasures, Maggie herself
16280: was ceasing to think, with her eager prefiguring imagination, of her
16281: future lot; and her anxiety about her first interview with Philip was
16282: losing its predominance; perhaps, unconsciously to herself, she was not
16283: sorry that the interview had been deferred.
16284: 
16285: For Philip had not come the evening he was expected, and Mr Stephen
16286: Guest brought word that he was gone to the coast,—probably, he thought,
16287: on a sketching expedition; but it was not certain when he would return.
16288: It was just like Philip, to go off in that way without telling any one.
16289: It was not until the twelfth day that he returned, to find both Lucy’s
16290: notes awaiting him; he had left before he knew of Maggie’s arrival.
16291: 
16292: Perhaps one had need be nineteen again to be quite convinced of the
16293: feelings that were crowded for Maggie into those twelve days; of the
16294: length to which they were stretched for her by the novelty of her
16295: experience in them, and the varying attitudes of her mind. The early
16296: days of an acquaintance almost always have this importance for us, and
16297: fill up a larger space in our memory than longer subsequent periods,
16298: which have been less filled with discovery and new impressions. There
16299: were not many hours in those ten days in which Mr Stephen Guest was not
16300: seated by Lucy’s side, or standing near her at the piano, or
16301: accompanying her on some outdoor excursion; his attentions were clearly
16302: becoming more assiduous, and that was what every one had expected. Lucy
16303: was very happy, all the happier because Stephen’s society seemed to
16304: have become much more interesting and amusing since Maggie had been
16305: there. Playful discussions—sometimes serious ones—were going forward,
16306: in which both Stephen and Maggie revealed themselves, to the admiration
16307: of the gentle, unobtrusive Lucy; and it more than once crossed her mind
16308: what a charming quartet they should have through life when Maggie
16309: married Philip. Is it an inexplicable thing that a girl should enjoy
16310: her lover’s society the more for the presence of a third person, and be
16311: without the slightest spasm of jealousy that the third person had the
16312: conversation habitually directed to her? Not when that girl is as
16313: tranquil-hearted as Lucy, thoroughly possessed with a belief that she
16314: knows the state of her companions’ affections, and not prone to the
16315: feelings which shake such a belief in the absence of positive evidence
16316: against it. Besides, it was Lucy by whom Stephen sat, to whom he gave
16317: his arm, to whom he appealed as the person sure to agree with him; and
16318: every day there was the same tender politeness toward her, the same
16319: consciousness of her wants and care to supply them. Was there really
16320: the same? It seemed to Lucy that there was more; and it was no wonder
16321: that the real significance of the change escaped her. It was a subtle
16322: act of conscience in Stephen that even he himself was not aware of. His
16323: personal attentions to Maggie were comparatively slight, and there had
16324: even sprung up an apparent distance between them, that prevented the
16325: renewal of that faint resemblance to gallantry into which he had fallen
16326: the first day in the boat. If Stephen came in when Lucy was out of the
16327: room, if Lucy left them together, they never spoke to each other;
16328: Stephen, perhaps, seemed to be examining books or music, and Maggie
16329: bent her head assiduously over her work. Each was oppressively
16330: conscious of the other’s presence, even to the finger-ends. Yet each
16331: looked and longed for the same thing to happen the next day. Neither of
16332: them had begun to reflect on the matter, or silently to ask, “To what
16333: does all this tend?” Maggie only felt that life was revealing something
16334: quite new to her; and she was absorbed in the direct, immediate
16335: experience, without any energy left for taking account of it and
16336: reasoning about it. Stephen wilfully abstained from self-questioning,
16337: and would not admit to himself that he felt an influence which was to
16338: have any determining effect on his conduct. And when Lucy came into the
16339: room again, they were once more unconstrained; Maggie could contradict
16340: Stephen, and laugh at him, and he could recommend to her consideration
16341: the example of that most charming heroine, Miss Sophia Western, who had
16342: a great “respect for the understandings of men.” Maggie could look at
16343: Stephen, which, for some reason or other she always avoided when they
16344: were alone; and he could even ask her to play his accompaniment for
16345: him, since Lucy’s fingers were so busy with that bazaar-work, and
16346: lecture her on hurrying the tempo, which was certainly Maggie’s weak
16347: point.
16348: 
16349: One day—it was the day of Philip’s return—Lucy had formed a sudden
16350: engagement to spend the evening with Mrs Kenn, whose delicate state of
16351: health, threatening to become confirmed illness through an attack of
16352: bronchitis, obliged her to resign her functions at the coming bazaar
16353: into the hands of other ladies, of whom she wished Lucy to be one. The
16354: engagement had been formed in Stephen’s presence, and he had heard Lucy
16355: promise to dine early and call at six o’clock for Miss Torry, who
16356: brought Mrs Kenn’s request.
16357: 
16358: “Here is another of the moral results of this idiotic bazaar,” Stephen
16359: burst forth, as soon as Miss Torry had left the room,—“taking young
16360: ladies from the duties of the domestic hearth into scenes of
16361: dissipation among urn-rugs and embroidered reticules! I should like to
16362: know what is the proper function of women, if it is not to make reasons
16363: for husbands to stay at home, and still stronger reasons for bachelors
16364: to go out. If this goes on much longer, the bonds of society will be
16365: dissolved.”
16366: 
16367: “Well, it will not go on much longer,” said Lucy, laughing, “for the
16368: bazaar is to take place on Monday week.”
16369: 
16370: “Thank Heaven!” said Stephen. “Kenn himself said the other day that he
16371: didn’t like this plan of making vanity do the work of charity; but just
16372: as the British public is not reasonable enough to bear direct taxation,
16373: so St Ogg’s has not got force of motive enough to build and endow
16374: schools without calling in the force of folly.”
16375: 
16376: “Did he say so?” said little Lucy, her hazel eyes opening wide with
16377: anxiety. “I never heard him say anything of that kind; I thought he
16378: approved of what we were doing.”
16379: 
16380: “I’m sure he approves _you_,” said Stephen, smiling at her
16381: affectionately; “your conduct in going out to-night looks vicious, I
16382: own, but I know there is benevolence at the bottom of it.”
16383: 
16384: “Oh, you think too well of me,” said Lucy, shaking her head, with a
16385: pretty blush, and there the subject ended. But it was tacitly
16386: understood that Stephen would not come in the evening; and on the
16387: strength of that tacit understanding he made his morning visit the
16388: longer, not saying good-bye until after four.
16389: 
16390: Maggie was seated in the drawing-room, alone, shortly after dinner,
16391: with Minny on her lap, having left her uncle to his wine and his nap,
16392: and her mother to the compromise between knitting and nodding, which,
16393: when there was no company, she always carried on in the dining-room
16394: till tea-time. Maggie was stooping to caress the tiny silken pet, and
16395: comforting him for his mistress’s absence, when the sound of a footstep
16396: on the gravel made her look up, and she saw Mr Stephen Guest walking up
16397: the garden, as if he had come straight from the river. It was very
16398: unusual to see him so soon after dinner! He often complained that their
16399: dinner-hour was late at Park House. Nevertheless, there he was, in his
16400: black dress; he had evidently been home, and must have come again by
16401: the river. Maggie felt her cheeks glowing and her heart beating; it was
16402: natural she should be nervous, for she was not accustomed to receive
16403: visitors alone. He had seen her look up through the open window, and
16404: raised his hat as he walked toward it, to enter that way instead of by
16405: the door. He blushed too, and certainly looked as foolish as a young
16406: man of some wit and self-possession can be expected to look, as he
16407: walked in with a roll of music in his hand, and said, with an air of
16408: hesitating improvisation,—
16409: 
16410: “You are surprised to see me again, Miss Tulliver; I ought to apologise
16411: for coming upon you by surprise, but I wanted to come into the town,
16412: and I got our man to row me; so I thought I would bring these things
16413: from the ‘Maid of Artois’ for your cousin; I forgot them this morning.
16414: Will you give them to her?”
16415: 
16416: “Yes,” said Maggie, who had risen confusedly with Minny in her arms,
16417: and now, not quite knowing what else to do, sat down again.
16418: 
16419: Stephen laid down his hat, with the music, which rolled on the floor,
16420: and sat down in the chair close by her. He had never done so before,
16421: and both he and Maggie were quite aware that it was an entirely new
16422: position.
16423: 
16424: “Well, you pampered minion!” said Stephen, leaning to pull the long
16425: curly ears that drooped over Maggie’s arm. It was not a suggestive
16426: remark, and as the speaker did not follow it up by further development,
16427: it naturally left the conversation at a standstill. It seemed to
16428: Stephen like some action in a dream that he was obliged to do, and
16429: wonder at himself all the while,—to go on stroking Minny’s head. Yet it
16430: was very pleasant; he only wished he dared look at Maggie, and that she
16431: would look at him,—let him have one long look into those deep, strange
16432: eyes of hers, and then he would be satisfied and quite reasonable after
16433: that. He thought it was becoming a sort of monomania with him, to want
16434: that long look from Maggie; and he was racking his invention
16435: continually to find out some means by which he could have it without
16436: its appearing singular and entailing subsequent embarrassment. As for
16437: Maggie, she had no distinct thought, only the sense of a presence like
16438: that of a closely hovering broad-winged bird in the darkness, for she
16439: was unable to look up, and saw nothing but Minny’s black wavy coat.
16440: 
16441: But this must end some time, perhaps it ended very soon, and only
16442: _seemed_ long, as a minute’s dream does. Stephen at last sat upright
16443: sideways in his chair, leaning one hand and arm over the back and
16444: looking at Maggie. What should he say?
16445: 
16446: “We shall have a splendid sunset, I think; sha’n’t you go out and see
16447: it?”
16448: 
16449: “I don’t know,” said Maggie. Then courageously raising her eyes and
16450: looking out of the window, “if I’m not playing cribbage with my uncle.”
16451: 
16452: A pause; during which Minny is stroked again, but has sufficient
16453: insight not to be grateful for it, to growl rather.
16454: 
16455: “Do you like sitting alone?”
16456: 
16457: A rather arch look came over Maggie’s face, and, just glancing at
16458: Stephen, she said, “Would it be quite civil to say ‘yes’?”
16459: 
16460: “It _was_ rather a dangerous question for an intruder to ask,” said
16461: Stephen, delighted with that glance, and getting determined to stay for
16462: another. “But you will have more than half an hour to yourself after I
16463: am gone,” he added, taking out his watch. “I know Mr Deane never comes
16464: in till half-past seven.”
16465: 
16466: Another pause, during which Maggie looked steadily out of the window,
16467: till by a great effort she moved her head to look down at Minny’s back
16468: again, and said,—
16469: 
16470: “I wish Lucy had not been obliged to go out. We lose our music.”
16471: 
16472: “We shall have a new voice to-morrow night,” said Stephen. “Will you
16473: tell your cousin that our friend Philip Wakem is come back? I saw him
16474: as I went home.”
16475: 
16476: Maggie gave a little start,—it seemed hardly more than a vibration that
16477: passed from head to foot in an instant. But the new images summoned by
16478: Philip’s name dispersed half the oppressive spell she had been under.
16479: She rose from her chair with a sudden resolution, and laying Minny on
16480: his cushion, went to reach Lucy’s large work-basket from its corner.
16481: Stephen was vexed and disappointed; he thought perhaps Maggie didn’t
16482: like the name of Wakem to be mentioned to her in that abrupt way, for
16483: he now recalled what Lucy had told him of the family quarrel. It was of
16484: no use to stay any longer. Maggie was seating herself at the table with
16485: her work, and looking chill and proud; and he—he looked like a
16486: simpleton for having come. A gratuitous, entirely superfluous visit of
16487: that sort was sure to make a man disagreeable and ridiculous. Of course
16488: it was palpable to Maggie’s thinking that he had dined hastily in his
16489: own room for the sake of setting off again and finding her alone.
16490: 
16491: A boyish state of mind for an accomplished young gentleman of
16492: five-and-twenty, not without legal knowledge! But a reference to
16493: history, perhaps, may make it not incredible.
16494: 
16495: At this moment Maggie’s ball of knitting-wool rolled along the ground,
16496: and she started up to reach it. Stephen rose too, and picking up the
16497: ball, met her with a vexed, complaining look that gave his eyes quite a
16498: new expression to Maggie, whose own eyes met them as he presented the
16499: ball to her.
16500: 
16501: “Good-bye,” said Stephen, in a tone that had the same beseeching
16502: discontent as his eyes. He dared not put out his hand; he thrust both
16503: hands into his tail-pockets as he spoke. Maggie thought she had perhaps
16504: been rude.
16505: 
16506: “Won’t you stay?” she said timidly, not looking away, for that would
16507: have seemed rude again.
16508: 
16509: “No, thank you,” said Stephen, looking still into the half-unwilling,
16510: half-fascinated eyes, as a thirsty man looks toward the track of the
16511: distant brook. “The boat is waiting for me. You’ll tell your cousin?”
16512: 
16513: “Yes.”
16514: 
16515: “That I brought the music, I mean?”
16516: 
16517: “Yes.”
16518: 
16519: “And that Philip is come back?”
16520: 
16521: “Yes.” (Maggie did not notice Philip’s name this time.)
16522: 
16523: “Won’t you come out a little way into the garden?” said Stephen, in a
16524: still gentler tone; but the next moment he was vexed that she did not
16525: say “No,” for she moved away now toward the open window, and he was
16526: obliged to take his hat and walk by her side. But he thought of
16527: something to make him amends.
16528: 
16529: “Do take my arm,” he said, in a low tone, as if it were a secret.
16530: 
16531: There is something strangely winning to most women in that offer of the
16532: firm arm; the help is not wanted physically at that moment, but the
16533: sense of help, the presence of strength that is outside them and yet
16534: theirs, meets a continual want of the imagination. Either on that
16535: ground or some other, Maggie took the arm. And they walked together
16536: round the grassplot and under the drooping green of the laburnums, in
16537: the same dim, dreamy state as they had been in a quarter of an hour
16538: before; only that Stephen had had the look he longed for, without yet
16539: perceiving in himself the symptoms of returning reasonableness, and
16540: Maggie had darting thoughts across the dimness,—how came he to be
16541: there? Why had she come out? Not a word was spoken. If it had been,
16542: each would have been less intensely conscious of the other.
16543: 
16544: “Take care of this step,” said Stephen at last.
16545: 
16546: “Oh, I will go in now,” said Maggie, feeling that the step had come
16547: like a rescue. “Good-evening.”
16548: 
16549: In an instant she had withdrawn her arm, and was running back to the
16550: house. She did not reflect that this sudden action would only add to
16551: the embarrassing recollections of the last half-hour. She had no
16552: thought left for that. She only threw herself into the low arm-chair,
16553: and burst into tears.
16554: 
16555: “Oh, Philip, Philip, I wish we were together again—so quietly—in the
16556: Red Deeps.”
16557: 
16558: Stephen looked after her a moment, then went on to the boat, and was
16559: soon landed at the wharf. He spent the evening in the billiard-room,
16560: smoking one cigar after another, and losing “lives” at pool. But he
16561: would not leave off. He was determined not to think,—not to admit any
16562: more distinct remembrance than was urged upon him by the perpetual
16563: presence of Maggie. He was looking at her, and she was on his arm.
16564: 
16565: But there came the necessity of walking home in the cool starlight, and
16566: with it the necessity of cursing his own folly, and bitterly
16567: determining that he would never trust himself alone with Maggie again.
16568: It was all madness; he was in love, thoroughly attached to Lucy, and
16569: engaged,—engaged as strongly as an honourable man need be. He wished he
16570: had never seen this Maggie Tulliver, to be thrown into a fever by her
16571: in this way; she would make a sweet, strange, troublesome, adorable
16572: wife to some man or other, but he would never have chosen her himself.
16573: Did she feel as he did? He hoped she did—not. He ought not to have
16574: gone. He would master himself in future. He would make himself
16575: disagreeable to her, quarrel with her perhaps. Quarrel with her? Was it
16576: possible to quarrel with a creature who had such eyes,—defying and
16577: deprecating, contradicting and clinging, imperious and beseeching,—full
16578: of delicious opposites? To see such a creature subdued by love for one
16579: would be a lot worth having—to another man.
16580: 
16581: There was a muttered exclamation which ended this inward soliloquy, as
16582: Stephen threw away the end of his last cigar, and thrusting his hands
16583: into his pockets, stalked along at a quieter pace through the
16584: shrubbery. It was not of a benedictory kind.
16585: 
16586: 
16587: Chapter VII.
16588: 
16589: Philip Re-enters
16590: 
16591: The next morning was very wet,—the sort of morning on which male
16592: neighbours who have no imperative occupation at home are likely to pay
16593: their fair friends an illimitable visit. The rain, which has been
16594: endurable enough for the walk or ride one way, is sure to become so
16595: heavy, and at the same time so certain to clear up by and by, that
16596: nothing but an open quarrel can abbreviate the visit; latent
16597: detestation will not do at all. And if people happen to be lovers, what
16598: can be so delightful, in England, as a rainy morning? English sunshine
16599: is dubious; bonnets are never quite secure; and if you sit down on the
16600: grass, it may lead to catarrhs. But the rain is to be depended on. You
16601: gallop through it in a mackintosh, and presently find yourself in the
16602: seat you like best,—a little above or a little below the one on which
16603: your goddess sits (it is the same thing to the metaphysical mind, and
16604: that is the reason why women are at once worshipped and looked down
16605: upon), with a satisfactory confidence that there will be no
16606: lady-callers.
16607: 
16608: “Stephen will come earlier this morning, I know,” said Lucy; “he always
16609: does when it’s rainy.”
16610: 
16611: Maggie made no answer. She was angry with Stephen; she began to think
16612: she should dislike him; and if it had not been for the rain, she would
16613: have gone to her aunt Glegg’s this morning, and so have avoided him
16614: altogether. As it was, she must find some reason for remaining out of
16615: the room with her mother.
16616: 
16617: But Stephen did not come earlier, and there was another visitor—a
16618: nearer neighbour—who preceded him. When Philip entered the room, he was
16619: going merely to bow to Maggie, feeling that their acquaintance was a
16620: secret which he was bound not to betray; but when she advanced toward
16621: him and put out her hand, he guessed at once that Lucy had been taken
16622: into her confidence. It was a moment of some agitation to both, though
16623: Philip had spent many hours in preparing for it; but like all persons
16624: who have passed through life with little expectation of sympathy, he
16625: seldom lost his self-control, and shrank with the most sensitive pride
16626: from any noticeable betrayal of emotion. A little extra paleness, a
16627: little tension of the nostril when he spoke, and the voice pitched in
16628: rather a higher key, that to strangers would seem expressive of cold
16629: indifference, were all the signs Philip usually gave of an inward drama
16630: that was not without its fierceness. But Maggie, who had little more
16631: power of concealing the impressions made upon her than if she had been
16632: constructed of musical strings, felt her eyes getting larger with tears
16633: as they took each other’s hands in silence. They were not painful
16634: tears; they had rather something of the same origin as the tears women
16635: and children shed when they have found some protection to cling to and
16636: look back on the threatened danger. For Philip, who a little while ago
16637: was associated continually in Maggie’s mind with the sense that Tom
16638: might reproach her with some justice, had now, in this short space,
16639: become a sort of outward conscience to her, that she might fly to for
16640: rescue and strength. Her tranquil, tender affection for Philip, with
16641: its root deep down in her childhood, and its memories of long quiet
16642: talk confirming by distinct successive impressions the first
16643: instinctive bias,—the fact that in him the appeal was more strongly to
16644: her pity and womanly devotedness than to her vanity or other egoistic
16645: excitability of her nature,—seemed now to make a sort of sacred place,
16646: a sanctuary where she could find refuge from an alluring influence
16647: which the best part of herself must resist; which must bring horrible
16648: tumult within, wretchedness without. This new sense of her relation to
16649: Philip nullified the anxious scruples she would otherwise have felt,
16650: lest she should overstep the limit of intercourse with him that Tom
16651: would sanction; and she put out her hand to him, and felt the tears in
16652: her eyes without any consciousness of an inward check. The scene was
16653: just what Lucy expected, and her kind heart delighted in bringing
16654: Philip and Maggie together again; though, even with all _her_ regard
16655: for Philip, she could not resist the impression that her cousin Tom had
16656: some excuse for feeling shocked at the physical incongruity between the
16657: two,—a prosaic person like cousin Tom, who didn’t like poetry and fairy
16658: tales. But she began to speak as soon as possible, to set them at ease.
16659: 
16660: “This was very good and virtuous of you,” she said, in her pretty
16661: treble, like the low conversational notes of little birds, “to come so
16662: soon after your arrival. And as it is, I think I will pardon you for
16663: running away in an inopportune manner, and giving your friends no
16664: notice. Come and sit down here,” she went on, placing the chair that
16665: would suit him best, “and you shall find yourself treated mercifully.”
16666: 
16667: “You will never govern well, Miss Deane,” said Philip, as he seated
16668: himself, “because no one will ever believe in your severity. People
16669: will always encourage themselves in misdemeanours by the certainty that
16670: you will be indulgent.”
16671: 
16672: Lucy gave some playful contradiction, but Philip did not hear what it
16673: was, for he had naturally turned toward Maggie, and she was looking at
16674: him with that open, affectionate scrutiny which we give to a friend
16675: from whom we have been long separated. What a moment their parting had
16676: been! And Philip felt as if he were only in the morrow of it. He felt
16677: this so keenly,—with such intense, detailed remembrance, with such
16678: passionate revival of all that had been said and looked in their last
16679: conversation,—that with that jealousy and distrust which in diffident
16680: natures is almost inevitably linked with a strong feeling, he thought
16681: he read in Maggie’s glance and manner the evidence of a change. The
16682: very fact that he feared and half expected it would be sure to make
16683: this thought rush in, in the absence of positive proof to the contrary.
16684: 
16685: “I am having a great holiday, am I not?” said Maggie. “Lucy is like a
16686: fairy godmother; she has turned me from a drudge into a princess in no
16687: time. I do nothing but indulge myself all day long, and she always
16688: finds out what I want before I know it myself.”
16689: 
16690: “I am sure she is the happier for having you, then,” said Philip. “You
16691: must be better than a whole menagerie of pets to her. And you look
16692: well. You are benefiting by the change.”
16693: 
16694: Artificial conversation of this sort went on a little while, till Lucy,
16695: determined to put an end to it, exclaimed, with a good imitation of
16696: annoyance, that she had forgotten something, and was quickly out of the
16697: room.
16698: 
16699: In a moment Maggie and Philip leaned forward, and the hands were
16700: clasped again, with a look of sad contentment, like that of friends who
16701: meet in the memory of recent sorrow.
16702: 
16703: “I told my brother I wished to see you, Philip; I asked him to release
16704: me from my promise, and he consented.”
16705: 
16706: Maggie, in her impulsiveness, wanted Philip to know at once the
16707: position they must hold toward each other; but she checked herself. The
16708: things that had happened since he had spoken of his love for her were
16709: so painful that she shrank from being the first to allude to them. It
16710: seemed almost like an injury toward Philip even to mention her
16711: brother,—her brother, who had insulted him. But he was thinking too
16712: entirely of her to be sensitive on any other point at that moment.
16713: 
16714: “Then we can at least be friends, Maggie? There is nothing to hinder
16715: that now?”
16716: 
16717: “Will not your father object?” said Maggie, withdrawing her hand.
16718: 
16719: “I should not give you up on any ground but your own wish, Maggie,”
16720: said Philip, colouring. “There are points on which I should always
16721: resist my father, as I used to tell you. _That_ is one.”
16722: 
16723: “Then there is nothing to hinder our being friends, Philip,—seeing each
16724: other and talking to each other while I am here; I shall soon go away
16725: again. I mean to go very soon, to a new situation.”
16726: 
16727: “Is that inevitable, Maggie?”
16728: 
16729: “Yes; I must not stay here long. It would unfit me for the life I must
16730: begin again at last. I can’t live in dependence,—I can’t live with my
16731: brother, though he is very good to me. He would like to provide for me;
16732: but that would be intolerable to me.”
16733: 
16734: Philip was silent a few moments, and then said, in that high, feeble
16735: voice which with him indicated the resolute suppression of emotion,—
16736: 
16737: “Is there no other alternative, Maggie? Is that life, away from those
16738: who love you, the only one you will allow yourself to look forward to?”
16739: 
16740: “Yes, Philip,” she said, looking at him pleadingly, as if she entreated
16741: him to believe that she was compelled to this course. “At least, as
16742: things are; I don’t know what may be in years to come. But I begin to
16743: think there can never come much happiness to me from loving; I have
16744: always had so much pain mingled with it. I wish I could make myself a
16745: world outside it, as men do.”
16746: 
16747: “Now you are returning to your old thought in a new form, Maggie,—the
16748: thought I used to combat,” said Philip, with a slight tinge of
16749: bitterness. “You want to find out a mode of renunciation that will be
16750: an escape from pain. I tell you again, there is no such escape possible
16751: except by perverting or mutilating one’s nature. What would become of
16752: me, if I tried to escape from pain? Scorn and cynicism would be my only
16753: opium; unless I could fall into some kind of conceited madness, and
16754: fancy myself a favourite of Heaven because I am not a favourite with
16755: men.”
16756: 
16757: The bitterness had taken on some impetuosity as Philip went on
16758: speaking; the words were evidently an outlet for some immediate feeling
16759: of his own, as well as an answer to Maggie. There was a pain pressing
16760: on him at that moment. He shrank with proud delicacy from the faintest
16761: allusion to the words of love, of plighted love that had passed between
16762: them. It would have seemed to him like reminding Maggie of a promise;
16763: it would have had for him something of the baseness of compulsion. He
16764: could not dwell on the fact that he himself had not changed; for that
16765: too would have had the air of an appeal. His love for Maggie was
16766: stamped, even more than the rest of his experience, with the
16767: exaggerated sense that he was an exception,—that she, that every one,
16768: saw him in the light of an exception.
16769: 
16770: But Maggie was conscience-stricken.
16771: 
16772: “Yes, Philip,” she said, with her childish contrition when he used to
16773: chide her, “you are right, I know. I do always think too much of my own
16774: feelings, and not enough of others’,—not enough of yours. I had need
16775: have you always to find fault with me and teach me; so many things have
16776: come true that you used to tell me.”
16777: 
16778: Maggie was resting her elbow on the table, leaning her head on her hand
16779: and looking at Philip with half-penitent dependent affection, as she
16780: said this; while he was returning her gaze with an expression that, to
16781: her consciousness, gradually became less vague,—became charged with a
16782: specific recollection. Had his mind flown back to something that _she_
16783: now remembered,—something about a lover of Lucy’s? It was a thought
16784: that made her shudder; it gave new definiteness to her present
16785: position, and to the tendency of what had happened the evening before.
16786: She moved her arm from the table, urged to change her position by that
16787: positive physical oppression at the heart that sometimes accompanies a
16788: sudden mental pang.
16789: 
16790: “What is the matter, Maggie? Has something happened?” Philip said, in
16791: inexpressible anxiety, his imagination being only too ready to weave
16792: everything that was fatal to them both.
16793: 
16794: “No, nothing,” said Maggie, rousing her latent will. Philip must not
16795: have that odious thought in his mind; she would banish it from her own.
16796: “Nothing,” she repeated, “except in my own mind. You used to say I
16797: should feel the effect of my starved life, as you called it; and I do.
16798: I am too eager in my enjoyment of music and all luxuries, now they are
16799: come to me.”
16800: 
16801: She took up her work and occupied herself resolutely, while Philip
16802: watched her, really in doubt whether she had anything more than this
16803: general allusion in her mind. It was quite in Maggie’s character to be
16804: agitated by vague self-reproach. But soon there came a violent
16805: well-known ring at the door-bell resounding through the house.
16806: 
16807: “Oh, what a startling announcement!” said Maggie, quite mistress of
16808: herself, though not without some inward flutter. “I wonder where Lucy
16809: is.”
16810: 
16811: Lucy had not been deaf to the signal, and after an interval long enough
16812: for a few solicitous but not hurried inquiries, she herself ushered
16813: Stephen in.
16814: 
16815: “Well, old fellow,” he said, going straight up to Philip and shaking
16816: him heartily by the hand, bowing to Maggie in passing, “it’s glorious
16817: to have you back again; only I wish you’d conduct yourself a little
16818: less like a sparrow with a residence on the house-top, and not go in
16819: and out constantly without letting the servants know. This is about the
16820: twentieth time I’ve had to scamper up those countless stairs to that
16821: painting-room of yours, all to no purpose, because your people thought
16822: you were at home. Such incidents embitter friendship.”
16823: 
16824: “I’ve so few visitors, it seems hardly worth while to leave notice of
16825: my exit and entrances,” said Philip, feeling rather oppressed just then
16826: by Stephen’s bright strong presence and strong voice.
16827: 
16828: “Are you quite well this morning, Miss Tulliver?” said Stephen, turning
16829: to Maggie with stiff politeness, and putting out his hand with the air
16830: of fulfilling a social duty.
16831: 
16832: Maggie gave the tips of her fingers, and said, “Quite well, thank you,”
16833: in a tone of proud indifference. Philip’s eyes were watching them
16834: keenly; but Lucy was used to seeing variations in their manner to each
16835: other, and only thought with regret that there was some natural
16836: antipathy which every now and then surmounted their mutual good-will.
16837: “Maggie is not the sort of woman Stephen admires, and she is irritated
16838: by something in him which she interprets as conceit,” was the silent
16839: observation that accounted for everything to guileless Lucy. Stephen
16840: and Maggie had no sooner completed this studied greeting than each felt
16841: hurt by the other’s coldness. And Stephen, while rattling on in
16842: questions to Philip about his recent sketching expedition, was thinking
16843: all the more about Maggie because he was not drawing her into the
16844: conversation as he had invariably done before. “Maggie and Philip are
16845: not looking happy,” thought Lucy; “this first interview has been
16846: saddening to them.”
16847: 
16848: “I think we people who have not been galloping,” she said to Stephen,
16849: “are all a little damped by the rain. Let us have some music. We ought
16850: to take advantage of having Philip and you together. Give us the duet
16851: in ‘Masaniello’; Maggie has not heard that, and I know it will suit
16852: her.”
16853: 
16854: “Come, then,” said Stephen, going toward the piano, and giving a
16855: foretaste of the tune in his deep “brum-brum,” very pleasant to hear.
16856: 
16857: “You, please, Philip,—you play the accompaniment,” said Lucy, “and then
16858: I can go on with my work. You _will_ like to play, sha’n’t you?” she
16859: added, with a pretty, inquiring look, anxious, as usual, lest she
16860: should have proposed what was not pleasant to another; but with
16861: yearnings toward her unfinished embroidery.
16862: 
16863: Philip had brightened at the proposition, for there is no feeling,
16864: perhaps, except the extremes of fear and grief, that does not find
16865: relief in music,—that does not make a man sing or play the better; and
16866: Philip had an abundance of pent-up feeling at this moment, as complex
16867: as any trio or quartet that was ever meant to express love and jealousy
16868: and resignation and fierce suspicion, all at the same time.
16869: 
16870: “Oh, yes,” he said, seating himself at the piano, “it is a way of eking
16871: out one’s imperfect life and being three people at once,—to sing and
16872: make the piano sing, and hear them both all the while,—or else to sing
16873: and paint.”
16874: 
16875: “Ah, there you are an enviable fellow. I can do nothing with my hands,”
16876: said Stephen. “That has generally been observed in men of great
16877: administrative capacity, I believe,—a tendency to predominance of the
16878: reflective powers in me! Haven’t you observed that, Miss Tulliver?”
16879: 
16880: Stephen had fallen by mistake into his habit of playful appeal to
16881: Maggie, and she could not repress the answering flush and epigram.
16882: 
16883: “I _have_ observed a tendency to predominance,” she said, smiling; and
16884: Philip at that moment devoutly hoped that she found the tendency
16885: disagreeable.
16886: 
16887: “Come, come,” said Lucy; “music, music! We will discuss each other’s
16888: qualities another time.”
16889: 
16890: Maggie always tried in vain to go on with her work when music began.
16891: She tried harder than ever to-day; for the thought that Stephen knew
16892: how much she cared for his singing was one that no longer roused a
16893: merely playful resistance; and she knew, too, that it was his habit
16894: always to stand so that he could look at her. But it was of no use; she
16895: soon threw her work down, and all her intentions were lost in the vague
16896: state of emotion produced by the inspiring duet,—emotion that seemed to
16897: make her at once strong and weak; strong for all enjoyment, weak for
16898: all resistance. When the strain passed into the minor, she half started
16899: from her seat with the sudden thrill of that change. Poor Maggie! She
16900: looked very beautiful when her soul was being played on in this way by
16901: the inexorable power of sound. You might have seen the slightest
16902: perceptible quivering through her whole frame as she leaned a little
16903: forward, clasping her hands as if to steady herself; while her eyes
16904: dilated and brightened into that wide-open, childish expression of
16905: wondering delight which always came back in her happiest moments. Lucy,
16906: who at other times had always been at the piano when Maggie was looking
16907: in this way, could not resist the impulse to steal up to her and kiss
16908: her. Philip, too, caught a glimpse of her now and then round the open
16909: book on the desk, and felt that he had never before seen her under so
16910: strong an influence.
16911: 
16912: “More, more!” said Lucy, when the duet had been encored. “Something
16913: spirited again. Maggie always says she likes a great rush of sound.”
16914: 
16915: “It must be ‘Let us take the road,’ then,” said Stephen,—“so suitable
16916: for a wet morning. But are you prepared to abandon the most sacred
16917: duties of life, and come and sing with us?”
16918: 
16919: “Oh, yes,” said Lucy, laughing. “If you will look out the ‘Beggar’s
16920: Opera’ from the large canterbury. It has a dingy cover.”
16921: 
16922: “That is a great clue, considering there are about a score covers here
16923: of rival dinginess,” said Stephen, drawing out the canterbury.
16924: 
16925: “Oh, play something the while, Philip,” said Lucy, noticing that his
16926: fingers were wandering over the keys. “What is that you are falling
16927: into?—something delicious that I don’t know.”
16928: 
16929: “Don’t you know that?” said Philip, bringing out the tune more
16930: definitely. “It’s from the ‘Sonnambula’—‘Ah! perchè non posso odiarti.’
16931: I don’t know the opera, but it appears the tenor is telling the heroine
16932: that he shall always love her though she may forsake him. You’ve heard
16933: me sing it to the English words, ‘I love thee still.’”
16934: 
16935: It was not quite unintentionally that Philip had wandered into this
16936: song, which might be an indirect expression to Maggie of what he could
16937: not prevail on himself to say to her directly. Her ears had been open
16938: to what he was saying, and when he began to sing, she understood the
16939: plaintive passion of the music. That pleading tenor had no very fine
16940: qualities as a voice, but it was not quite new to her; it had sung to
16941: her by snatches, in a subdued way, among the grassy walks and hollows,
16942: and underneath the leaning ash-tree in the Red Deeps. There seemed to
16943: be some reproach in the words; did Philip mean that? She wished she had
16944: assured him more distinctly in their conversation that she desired not
16945: to renew the hope of love between them, _only_ because it clashed with
16946: her inevitable circumstances. She was touched, not thrilled by the
16947: song; it suggested distinct memories and thoughts, and brought quiet
16948: regret in the place of excitement.
16949: 
16950: “That’s the way with you tenors,” said Stephen, who was waiting with
16951: music in his hand while Philip finished the song. “You demoralise the
16952: fair sex by warbling your sentimental love and constancy under all
16953: sorts of vile treatment. Nothing short of having your heads served up
16954: in a dish like that mediæval tenor or troubadour, would prevent you
16955: from expressing your entire resignation. I must administer an antidote,
16956: while Miss Deane prepares to tear herself away from her bobbins.”
16957: 
16958: Stephen rolled out, with saucy energy,—
16959: 
16960:      “Shall I, wasting in despair,
16961:      Die because a woman’s fair?”
16962: 
16963: 
16964: and seemed to make all the air in the room alive with a new influence.
16965: Lucy, always proud of what Stephen did, went toward the piano with
16966: laughing, admiring looks at him; and Maggie, in spite of her resistance
16967: to the spirit of the song and to the singer, was taken hold of and
16968: shaken by the invisible influence,—was borne along by a wave too strong
16969: for her.
16970: 
16971: But, angrily resolved not to betray herself, she seized her work, and
16972: went on making false stitches and pricking her fingers with much
16973: perseverance, not looking up or taking notice of what was going
16974: forward, until all the three voices united in “Let us take the road.”
16975: 
16976: I am afraid there would have been a subtle, stealing gratification in
16977: her mind if she had known how entirely this saucy, defiant Stephen was
16978: occupied with her; how he was passing rapidly from a determination to
16979: treat her with ostentatious indifference to an irritating desire for
16980: some sign of inclination from her,—some interchange of subdued word or
16981: look with her. It was not long before he found an opportunity, when
16982: they had passed to the music of “The Tempest.” Maggie, feeling the need
16983: of a footstool, was walking across the room to get one, when Stephen,
16984: who was not singing just then, and was conscious of all her movements,
16985: guessed her want, and flew to anticipate her, lifting the footstool
16986: with an entreating look at her, which made it impossible not to return
16987: a glance of gratitude. And then, to have the footstool placed carefully
16988: by a too self-confident personage,—not _any_ self-confident personage,
16989: but one in particular, who suddenly looks humble and anxious, and
16990: lingers, bending still, to ask if there is not some draught in that
16991: position between the window and the fireplace, and if he may not be
16992: allowed to move the work-table for her,—these things will summon a
16993: little of the too ready, traitorous tenderness into a woman’s eyes,
16994: compelled as she is in her girlish time to learn her life-lessons in
16995: very trivial language. And to Maggie such things had not been everyday
16996: incidents, but were a new element in her life, and found her keen
16997: appetite for homage quite fresh. That tone of gentle solicitude obliged
16998: her to look at the face that was bent toward her, and to say, “No,
16999: thank you”; and nothing could prevent that mutual glance from being
17000: delicious to both, as it had been the evening before.
17001: 
17002: It was but an ordinary act of politeness in Stephen; it had hardly
17003: taken two minutes; and Lucy, who was singing, scarcely noticed it. But
17004: to Philip’s mind, filled already with a vague anxiety that was likely
17005: to find a definite ground for itself in any trivial incident, this
17006: sudden eagerness in Stephen, and the change in Maggie’s face, which was
17007: plainly reflecting a beam from his, seemed so strong a contrast with
17008: the previous overwrought signs of indifference, as to be charged with
17009: painful meaning. Stephen’s voice, pouring in again, jarred upon his
17010: nervous susceptibility as if it had been the clang of sheet-iron, and
17011: he felt inclined to make the piano shriek in utter discord. He had
17012: really seen no communicable ground for suspecting any ususual feeling
17013: between Stephen and Maggie; his own reason told him so, and he wanted
17014: to go home at once that he might reflect coolly on these false images,
17015: till he had convinced himself of their nullity. But then, again, he
17016: wanted to stay as long as Stephen stayed,—always to be present when
17017: Stephen was present with Maggie. It seemed to poor Philip so natural,
17018: nay, inevitable, that any man who was near Maggie should fall in love
17019: with her! There was no promise of happiness for her if she were
17020: beguiled into loving Stephen Guest; and this thought emboldened Philip
17021: to view his own love for her in the light of a less unequal offering.
17022: He was beginning to play very falsely under this deafening inward
17023: tumult, and Lucy was looking at him in astonishment, when Mrs
17024: Tulliver’s entrance to summon them to lunch came as an excuse for
17025: abruptly breaking off the music.
17026: 
17027: “Ah, Mr Philip!” said Mr Deane, when they entered the dining-room,
17028: “I’ve not seen you for a long while. Your father’s not at home, I
17029: think, is he? I went after him to the office the other day, and they
17030: said he was out of town.”
17031: 
17032: “He’s been to Mudport on business for several days,” said Philip; “but
17033: he’s come back now.”
17034: 
17035: “As fond of his farming hobby as ever, eh?”
17036: 
17037: “I believe so,” said Philip, rather wondering at this sudden interest
17038: in his father’s pursuits.
17039: 
17040: “Ah!” said Mr Deane, “he’s got some land in his own hands on this side
17041: the river as well as the other, I think?”
17042: 
17043: “Yes, he has.”
17044: 
17045: “Ah!” continued Mr Deane, as he dispensed the pigeonpie, “he must find
17046: farming a heavy item,—an expensive hobby. I never had a hobby myself,
17047: never would give in to that. And the worst of all hobbies are those
17048: that people think they can get money at. They shoot their money down
17049: like corn out of a sack then.”
17050: 
17051: Lucy felt a little nervous under her father’s apparently gratuitous
17052: criticism of Mr Wakem’s expenditure. But it ceased there, and Mr Deane
17053: became unusually silent and meditative during his luncheon. Lucy,
17054: accustomed to watch all indications in her father, and having reasons,
17055: which had recently become strong, for an extra interest in what
17056: referred to the Wakems, felt an unusual curiosity to know what had
17057: prompted her father’s questions. His subsequent silence made her
17058: suspect there had been some special reason for them in his mind.
17059: 
17060: With this idea in her head, she resorted to her usual plan when she
17061: wanted to tell or ask her father anything particular: she found a
17062: reason for her aunt Tulliver to leave the dining-room after dinner, and
17063: seated herself on a small stool at her father’s knee. Mr Deane, under
17064: those circumstances, considered that he tasted some of the most
17065: agreeable moments his merits had purchased him in life, notwithstanding
17066: that Lucy, disliking to have her hair powdered with snuff, usually
17067: began by mastering his snuff-box on such occasions.
17068: 
17069: “You don’t want to go to sleep yet, papa, _do_ you?” she said, as she
17070: brought up her stool and opened the large fingers that clutched the
17071: snuff-box.
17072: 
17073: “Not yet,” said Mr Deane, glancing at the reward of merit in the
17074: decanter. “But what do _you_ want?” he added, pinching the dimpled chin
17075: fondly,—“to coax some more sovereigns out of my pocket for your bazaar?
17076: Eh?”
17077: 
17078: “No, I have no base motives at all to-day. I only want to talk, not to
17079: beg. I want to know what made you ask Philip Wakem about his father’s
17080: farming to-day, papa? It seemed rather odd, because you never hardly
17081: say anything to him about his father; and why should you care about Mr
17082: Wakem’s losing money by his hobby?”
17083: 
17084: “Something to do with business,” said Mr Deane, waving his hands, as if
17085: to repel intrusion into that mystery.
17086: 
17087: “But, papa, you always say Mr Wakem has brought Philip up like a girl;
17088: how came you to think you should get any business knowledge out of him?
17089: Those abrupt questions sounded rather oddly. Philip thought them
17090: queer.”
17091: 
17092: “Nonsense, child!” said Mr Deane, willing to justify his social
17093: demeanour, with which he had taken some pains in his upward progress.
17094: “There’s a report that Wakem’s mill and farm on the other side of the
17095: river—Dorlcote Mill, your uncle Tulliver’s, you know—isn’t answering so
17096: well as it did. I wanted to see if your friend Philip would let
17097: anything out about his father’s being tired of farming.”
17098: 
17099: “Why? Would you buy the mill, papa, if he would part with it?” said
17100: Lucy, eagerly. “Oh, tell me everything; here, you shall have your
17101: snuff-box if you’ll tell me. Because Maggie says all their hearts are
17102: set on Tom’s getting back the mill some time. It was one of the last
17103: things her father said to Tom, that he must get back the mill.”
17104: 
17105: “Hush, you little puss,” said Mr Deane, availing himself of the
17106: restored snuff-box. “You must not say a word about this thing; do you
17107: hear? There’s very little chance of their getting the mill or of
17108: anybody’s getting it out of Wakem’s hands. And if he knew that we
17109: wanted it with a view to the Tulliver’s getting it again, he’d be the
17110: less likely to part with it. It’s natural, after what happened. He
17111: behaved well enough to Tulliver before; but a horsewhipping is not
17112: likely to be paid for with sugar-plums.”
17113: 
17114: “Now, papa,” said Lucy, with a little air of solemnity, “will you trust
17115: me? You must not ask me all my reasons for what I’m going to say, but I
17116: have very strong reasons. And I’m very cautious; I am, indeed.”
17117: 
17118: “Well, let us hear.”
17119: 
17120: “Why, I believe, if you will let me take Philip Wakem into our
17121: confidence,—let me tell him all about your wish to buy, and what it’s
17122: for; that my cousins wish to have it, and why they wish to have it,—I
17123: believe Philip would help to bring it about. I know he would desire to
17124: do it.”
17125: 
17126: “I don’t see how that can be, child,” said Mr Deane, looking puzzled.
17127: “Why should _he_ care?”—then, with a sudden penetrating look at his
17128: daughter, “You don’t think the poor lad’s fond of you, and so you can
17129: make him do what you like?” (Mr Deane felt quite safe about his
17130: daughter’s affections.)
17131: 
17132: “No, papa; he cares very little about me,—not so much as I care about
17133: him. But I have a reason for being quite sure of what I say. Don’t you
17134: ask me. And if you ever guess, don’t tell me. Only give me leave to do
17135: as I think fit about it.”
17136: 
17137: Lucy rose from her stool to seat herself on her father’s knee, and
17138: kissed him with that last request.
17139: 
17140: “Are you sure you won’t do mischief, now?” he said, looking at her with
17141: delight.
17142: 
17143: “Yes, papa, quite sure. I’m very wise; I’ve got all your business
17144: talents. Didn’t you admire my accompt-book, now, when I showed it you?”
17145: 
17146: “Well, well, if this youngster will keep his counsel, there won’t be
17147: much harm done. And to tell the truth, I think there’s not much chance
17148: for us any other way. Now, let me go off to sleep.”
17149: 
17150: 
17151: Chapter VIII.
17152: 
17153: Wakem in a New Light
17154: 
17155: Before three days had passed after the conversation you have just
17156: overheard between Lucy and her father she had contrived to have a
17157: private interview with Philip during a visit of Maggie’s to her aunt
17158: Glegg. For a day and a night Philip turned over in his mind with
17159: restless agitation all that Lucy had told him in that interview, till
17160: he had thoroughly resolved on a course of action. He thought he saw
17161: before him now a possibility of altering his position with respect to
17162: Maggie, and removing at least one obstacle between them. He laid his
17163: plan and calculated all his moves with the fervid deliberation of a
17164: chess-player in the days of his first ardor, and was amazed himself at
17165: his sudden genius as a tactician. His plan was as bold as it was
17166: thoroughly calculated. Having watched for a moment when his father had
17167: nothing more urgent on his hands than the newspaper, he went behind
17168: him, laid a hand on his shoulder, and said,—
17169: 
17170: “Father, will you come up into my sanctum, and look at my new sketches?
17171: I’ve arranged them now.”
17172: 
17173: “I’m getting terrible stiff in the joints, Phil, for climbing those
17174: stairs of yours,” said Wakem, looking kindly at his son as he laid down
17175: his paper. “But come along, then.”
17176: 
17177: “This is a nice place for you, isn’t it, Phil?—a capital light that
17178: from the roof, eh?” was, as usual, the first thing he said on entering
17179: the painting-room. He liked to remind himself and his son too that his
17180: fatherly indulgence had provided the accommodation. He had been a good
17181: father. Emily would have nothing to reproach him with there, if she
17182: came back again from her grave.
17183: 
17184: “Come, come,” he said, putting his double eye-glass over his nose, and
17185: seating himself to take a general view while he rested, “you’ve got a
17186: famous show here. Upon my word, I don’t see that your things aren’t as
17187: good as that London artist’s—what’s his name—that Leyburn gave so much
17188: money for.”
17189: 
17190: Philip shook his head and smiled. He had seated himself on his
17191: painting-stool, and had taken a lead pencil in his hand, with which he
17192: was making strong marks to counteract the sense of tremulousness. He
17193: watched his father get up, and walk slowly round, good-naturedly
17194: dwelling on the pictures much longer than his amount of genuine taste
17195: for landscape would have prompted, till he stopped before a stand on
17196: which two pictures were placed,—one much larger than the other, the
17197: smaller one in a leather case.
17198: 
17199: “Bless me! what have you here?” said Wakem, startled by a sudden
17200: transition from landscape to portrait. “I thought you’d left off
17201: figures. Who are these?”
17202: 
17203: “They are the same person,” said Philip, with calm promptness, “at
17204: different ages.”
17205: 
17206: “And what person?” said Wakem, sharply fixing his eyes with a growing
17207: look of suspicion on the larger picture.
17208: 
17209: “Miss Tulliver. The small one is something like what she was when I was
17210: at school with her brother at King’s Lorton; the larger one is not
17211: quite so good a likeness of what she was when I came from abroad.”
17212: 
17213: Wakem turned round fiercely, with a flushed face, letting his eye-glass
17214: fall, and looking at his son with a savage expression for a moment, as
17215: if he was ready to strike that daring feebleness from the stool. But he
17216: threw himself into the armchair again, and thrust his hands into his
17217: trouser-pockets, still looking angrily at his son, however. Philip did
17218: not return the look, but sat quietly watching the point of his pencil.
17219: 
17220: “And do you mean to say, then, that you have had any acquaintance with
17221: her since you came from abroad?” said Wakem, at last, with that vain
17222: effort which rage always makes to throw as much punishment as it
17223: desires to inflict into words and tones, since blows are forbidden.
17224: 
17225: “Yes; I saw a great deal of her for a whole year before her father’s
17226: death. We met often in that thicket—the Red Deeps—near Dorlcote Mill. I
17227: love her dearly; I shall never love any other woman. I have thought of
17228: her ever since she was a little girl.”
17229: 
17230: “Go on, sir! And you have corresponded with her all this while?”
17231: 
17232: “No. I never told her I loved her till just before we parted, and she
17233: promised her brother not to see me again or to correspond with me. I am
17234: not sure that she loves me or would consent to marry me. But if she
17235: would consent,—if she _did_ love me well enough,—I should marry her.”
17236: 
17237: “And this is the return you make me for all the indulgences I’ve heaped
17238: on you?” said Wakem, getting white, and beginning to tremble under an
17239: enraged sense of impotence before Philip’s calm defiance and
17240: concentration of purpose.
17241: 
17242: “No, father,” said Philip, looking up at him for the first time; “I
17243: don’t regard it as a return. You have been an indulgent father to me;
17244: but I have always felt that it was because you had an affectionate wish
17245: to give me as much happiness as my unfortunate lot would admit, not
17246: that it was a debt you expected me to pay by sacrificing all my chances
17247: of happiness to satisfy feelings of yours which I can never share.”
17248: 
17249: “I think most sons would share their father’s feelings in this case,”
17250: said Wakem, bitterly. “The girl’s father was an ignorant mad brute, who
17251: was within an inch of murdering me. The whole town knows it. And the
17252: brother is just as insolent, only in a cooler way. He forbade her
17253: seeing you, you say; he’ll break every bone in your body, for your
17254: greater happiness, if you don’t take care. But you seem to have made up
17255: your mind; you have counted the consequences, I suppose. Of course you
17256: are independent of me; you can marry this girl to-morrow, if you like;
17257: you are a man of five-and-twenty,—you can go your way, and I can go
17258: mine. We need have no more to do with each other.”
17259: 
17260: Wakem rose and walked toward the door, but something held him back, and
17261: instead of leaving the room, he walked up and down it. Philip was slow
17262: to reply, and when he spoke, his tone had a more incisive quietness and
17263: clearness than ever.
17264: 
17265: “No; I can’t marry Miss Tulliver, even if she would have me, if I have
17266: only my own resources to maintain her with. I have been brought up to
17267: no profession. I can’t offer her poverty as well as deformity.”
17268: 
17269: “Ah, _there_ is a reason for your clinging to me, doubtless,” said
17270: Wakem, still bitterly, though Philip’s last words had given him a pang;
17271: they had stirred a feeling which had been a habit for a quarter of a
17272: century. He threw himself into the chair again.
17273: 
17274: “I expected all this,” said Philip. “I know these scenes are often
17275: happening between father and son. If I were like other men of my age, I
17276: might answer your angry words by still angrier; we might part; I should
17277: marry the woman I love, and have a chance of being as happy as the
17278: rest. But if it will be a satisfaction to you to annihilate the very
17279: object of everything you’ve done for me, you have an advantage over
17280: most fathers; you can completely deprive me of the only thing that
17281: would make my life worth having.”
17282: 
17283: Philip paused, but his father was silent.
17284: 
17285: “You know best what satisfaction you would have, beyond that of
17286: gratifying a ridiculous rancor worthy only of wandering savages.”
17287: 
17288: “Ridiculous rancor!” Wakem burst out. “What do you mean? Damn it! is a
17289: man to be horsewhipped by a boor and love him for it? Besides, there’s
17290: that cold, proud devil of a son, who said a word to me I shall not
17291: forget when we had the settling. He would be as pleasant a mark for a
17292: bullet as I know, if he were worth the expense.”
17293: 
17294: “I don’t mean your resentment toward them,” said Philip, who had his
17295: reasons for some sympathy with this view of Tom, “though a feeling of
17296: revenge is not worth much, that you should care to keep it. I mean your
17297: extending the enmity to a helpless girl, who has too much sense and
17298: goodness to share their narrow prejudices. _She_ has never entered into
17299: the family quarrels.”
17300: 
17301: “What does that signify? We don’t ask what a woman does; we ask whom
17302: she belongs to. It’s altogether a degrading thing to you, to think of
17303: marrying old Tulliver’s daughter.”
17304: 
17305: For the first time in the dialogue, Philip lost some of his
17306: self-control, and coloured with anger.
17307: 
17308: “Miss Tulliver,” he said, with bitter incisiveness, “has the only
17309: grounds of rank that anything but vulgar folly can suppose to belong to
17310: the middle class; she is thoroughly refined, and her friends, whatever
17311: else they may be, are respected for irreproachable honour and
17312: integrity. All St Ogg’s, I fancy, would pronounce her to be more than
17313: my equal.”
17314: 
17315: Wakem darted a glance of fierce question at his son; but Philip was not
17316: looking at him, and with a certain penitent consciousness went on, in a
17317: few moments, as if in amplification of his last words,—
17318: 
17319: “Find a single person in St Ogg’s who will not tell you that a
17320: beautiful creature like her would be throwing herself away on a
17321: pitiable object like me.”
17322: 
17323: “Not she!” said Wakem, rising again, and forgetting everything else in
17324: a burst of resentful pride, half fatherly, half personal. “It would be
17325: a deuced fine match for her. It’s all stuff about an accidental
17326: deformity, when a girl’s really attached to a man.”
17327: 
17328: “But girls are not apt to get attached under those circumstances,” said
17329: Philip.
17330: 
17331: “Well, then,” said Wakem, rather brutally, trying to recover his
17332: previous position, “if she doesn’t care for you, you might have spared
17333: yourself the trouble of talking to me about her, and you might have
17334: spared me the trouble of refusing my consent to what was never likely
17335: to happen.”
17336: 
17337: Wakem strode to the door, and without looking round again, banged it
17338: after him.
17339: 
17340: Philip was not without confidence that his father would be ultimately
17341: wrought upon as he had expected, by what had passed; but the scene had
17342: jarred upon his nerves, which were as sensitive as a woman’s. He
17343: determined not to go down to dinner; he couldn’t meet his father again
17344: that day. It was Wakem’s habit, when he had no company at home, to go
17345: out in the evening, often as early as half-past seven; and as it was
17346: far on in the afternoon now, Philip locked up his room and went out for
17347: a long ramble, thinking he would not return until his father was out of
17348: the house again. He got into a boat, and went down the river to a
17349: favourite village, where he dined, and lingered till it was late enough
17350: for him to return. He had never had any sort of quarrel with his father
17351: before, and had a sickening fear that this contest, just begun, might
17352: go on for weeks; and what might not happen in that time? He would not
17353: allow himself to define what that involuntary question meant. But if he
17354: could once be in the position of Maggie’s accepted, acknowledged lover,
17355: there would be less room for vague dread. He went up to his
17356: painting-room again, and threw himself with a sense of fatigue into the
17357: armchair, looking round absently at the views of water and rock that
17358: were ranged around, till he fell into a doze, in which he fancied
17359: Maggie was slipping down a glistening, green, slimy channel of a
17360: waterfall, and he was looking on helpless, till he was awakened by what
17361: seemed a sudden, awful crash.
17362: 
17363: It was the opening of the door, and he could hardly have dozed more
17364: than a few moments, for there was no perceptible change in the evening
17365: light. It was his father who entered; and when Philip moved to vacate
17366: the chair for him, he said,—
17367: 
17368: “Sit still. I’d rather walk about.”
17369: 
17370: He stalked up and down the room once or twice, and then, standing
17371: opposite Philip with his hands thrust in his side pockets, he said, as
17372: if continuing a conversation that had not been broken off,—
17373: 
17374: “But this girl seems to have been fond of you, Phil, else she wouldn’t
17375: have met you in that way.”
17376: 
17377: Philip’s heart was beating rapidly, and a transient flush passed over
17378: his face like a gleam. It was not quite easy to speak at once.
17379: 
17380: “She liked me at King’s Lorton, when she was a little girl, because I
17381: used to sit with her brother a great deal when he had hurt his foot.
17382: She had kept that in her memory, and thought of me as a friend of a
17383: long while ago. She didn’t think of me as a lover when she met me.”
17384: 
17385: “Well, but you made love to her at last. What did she say then?” said
17386: Wakem, walking about again.
17387: 
17388: “She said she _did_ love me then.”
17389: 
17390: “Confound it, then; what else do you want? Is she a jilt?”
17391: 
17392: “She was very young then,” said Philip, hesitatingly. “I’m afraid she
17393: hardly knew what she felt. I’m afraid our long separation, and the idea
17394: that events must always divide us, may have made a difference.”
17395: 
17396: “But she’s in the town. I’ve seen her at church. Haven’t you spoken to
17397: her since you came back?”
17398: 
17399: “Yes, at Mr Deane’s. But I couldn’t renew my proposals to her on
17400: several grounds. One obstacle would be removed if you would give your
17401: consent,—if you would be willing to think of her as a daughter-in-law.”
17402: 
17403: Wakem was silent a little while, pausing before Maggie’s picture.
17404: 
17405: “She’s not the sort of woman your mother was, though, Phil,” he said,
17406: at last. “I saw her at church,—she’s handsomer than this,—deuced fine
17407: eyes and fine figure, I saw; but rather dangerous and unmanageable,
17408: eh?”
17409: 
17410: “She’s very tender and affectionate, and so simple,—without the airs
17411: and petty contrivances other women have.”
17412: 
17413: “Ah?” said Wakem. Then looking round at his son, “But your mother
17414: looked gentler; she had that brown wavy hair and gray eyes, like yours.
17415: You can’t remember her very well. It was a thousand pities I’d no
17416: likeness of her.”
17417: 
17418: “Then, shouldn’t you be glad for me to have the same sort of happiness,
17419: father, to sweeten my life for me? There can never be another tie so
17420: strong to you as that which began eight-and-twenty years ago, when you
17421: married my mother, and you have been tightening it ever since.”
17422: 
17423: “Ah, Phil, you’re the only fellow that knows the best of me,” said
17424: Wakem, giving his hand to his son. “We must keep together if we can.
17425: And now, what am I to do? You must come downstairs and tell me. Am I to
17426: go and call on this dark-eyed damsel?”
17427: 
17428: The barrier once thrown down in this way, Philip could talk freely to
17429: his father of their entire relation with the Tullivers,—of the desire
17430: to get the mill and land back into the family, and of its transfer to
17431: Guest & Co. as an intermediate step. He could venture now to be
17432: persuasive and urgent, and his father yielded with more readiness than
17433: he had calculated on.
17434: 
17435: “_I_ don’t care about the mill,” he said at last, with a sort of angry
17436: compliance. “I’ve had an infernal deal of bother lately about the mill.
17437: Let them pay me for my improvements, that’s all. But there’s one thing
17438: you needn’t ask me. I shall have no direct transactions with young
17439: Tulliver. If you like to swallow him for his sister’s sake, you may;
17440: but I’ve no sauce that will make him go down.”
17441: 
17442: I leave you to imagine the agreeable feelings with which Philip went to
17443: Mr Deane the next day, to say that Mr Wakem was ready to open the
17444: negotiations, and Lucy’s pretty triumph as she appealed to her father
17445: whether she had not proved her great business abilities. Mr Deane was
17446: rather puzzled, and suspected that there had been something “going on”
17447: among the young people to which he wanted a clew. But to men of Mr
17448: Deane’s stamp, what goes on among the young people is as extraneous to
17449: the real business of life as what goes on among the birds and
17450: butterflies, until it can be shown to have a malign bearing on monetary
17451: affairs. And in this case the bearing appeared to be entirely
17452: propitious.

17455: Chapter IX.
17456: 
17457: Charity in Full-Dress
17458: 
17459: The culmination of Maggie’s career as an admired member of society in
17460: St Ogg’s was certainly the day of the bazaar, when her simple noble
17461: beauty, clad in a white muslin of some soft-floating kind, which I
17462: suspect must have come from the stores of aunt Pullet’s wardrobe,
17463: appeared with marked distinction among the more adorned and
17464: conventional women around her. We perhaps never detect how much of our
17465: social demeanour is made up of artificial airs until we see a person
17466: who is at once beautiful and simple; without the beauty, we are apt to
17467: call simplicity awkwardness. The Miss Guests were much too well-bred to
17468: have any of the grimaces and affected tones that belong to pretentious
17469: vulgarity; but their stall being next to the one where Maggie sat, it
17470: seemed newly obvious to-day that Miss Guest held her chin too high, and
17471: that Miss Laura spoke and moved continually with a view to effect.
17472: 
17473: All well-dressed St Ogg’s and its neighbourhood were there; and it
17474: would have been worth while to come even from a distance, to see the
17475: fine old hall, with its open roof and carved oaken rafters, and great
17476: oaken folding-doors, and light shed down from a height on the
17477: many-coloured show beneath; a very quaint place, with broad faded
17478: stripes painted on the walls, and here and there a show of heraldic
17479: animals of a bristly, long-snouted character, the cherished emblems of
17480: a noble family once the seigniors of this now civic hall. A grand arch,
17481: cut in the upper wall at one end, surmounted an oaken orchestra, with
17482: an open room behind it, where hothouse plants and stalls for
17483: refreshments were disposed; an agreeable resort for gentlemen disposed
17484: to loiter, and yet to exchange the occasional crush down below for a
17485: more commodious point of view. In fact, the perfect fitness of this
17486: ancient building for an admirable modern purpose, that made charity
17487: truly elegant, and led through vanity up to the supply of a deficit,
17488: was so striking that hardly a person entered the room without
17489: exchanging the remark more than once. Near the great arch over the
17490: orchestra was the stone oriel with painted glass, which was one of the
17491: venerable inconsistencies of the old hall; and it was close by this
17492: that Lucy had her stall, for the convenience of certain large plain
17493: articles which she had taken charge of for Mrs Kenn. Maggie had begged
17494: to sit at the open end of the stall, and to have the sale of these
17495: articles rather than of bead-mats and other elaborate products of which
17496: she had but a dim understanding. But it soon appeared that the
17497: gentlemen’s dressing-gowns, which were among her commodities, were
17498: objects of such general attention and inquiry, and excited so
17499: troublesome a curiosity as to their lining and comparative merits,
17500: together with a determination to test them by trying on, as to make her
17501: post a very conspicuous one. The ladies who had commodities of their
17502: own to sell, and did not want dressing-gowns, saw at once the frivolity
17503: and bad taste of this masculine preference for goods which any tailor
17504: could furnish; and it is possible that the emphatic notice of various
17505: kinds which was drawn toward Miss Tulliver on this public occasion,
17506: threw a very strong and unmistakable light on her subsequent conduct in
17507: many minds then present. Not that anger, on account of spurned beauty
17508: can dwell in the celestial breasts of charitable ladies, but rather
17509: that the errors of persons who have once been much admired necessarily
17510: take a deeper tinge from the mere force of contrast; and also, that
17511: to-day Maggie’s conspicuous position, for the first time, made evident
17512: certain characteristics which were subsequently felt to have an
17513: explanatory bearing. There was something rather bold in Miss Tulliver’s
17514: direct gaze, and something undefinably coarse in the style of her
17515: beauty, which placed her, in the opinion of all feminine judges, far
17516: below her cousin Miss Deane; for the ladies of St Ogg’s had now
17517: completely ceded to Lucy their hypothetic claims on the admiration of
17518: Mr Stephen Guest.
17519: 
17520: As for dear little Lucy herself, her late benevolent triumph about the
17521: Mill, and all the affectionate projects she was cherishing for Maggie
17522: and Philip, helped to give her the highest spirits to-day, and she felt
17523: nothing but pleasure in the evidence of Maggie’s attractiveness. It is
17524: true, she was looking very charming herself, and Stephen was paying her
17525: the utmost attention on this public occasion; jealously buying up the
17526: articles he had seen under her fingers in the process of making, and
17527: gayly helping her to cajole the male customers into the purchase of the
17528: most effeminate futilities. He chose to lay aside his hat and wear a
17529: scarlet fez of her embroidering; but by superficial observers this was
17530: necessarily liable to be interpreted less as a compliment to Lucy than
17531: as a mark of coxcombry. “Guest is a great coxcomb,” young Torry
17532: observed; “but then he is a privileged person in St Ogg’s—he carries
17533: all before him; if another fellow did such things, everybody would say
17534: he made a fool of himself.”
17535: 
17536: And Stephen purchased absolutely nothing from Maggie, until Lucy said,
17537: in rather a vexed undertone,—
17538: 
17539: “See, now; all the things of Maggie’s knitting will be gone, and you
17540: will not have bought one. There are those deliciously soft warm things
17541: for the wrists,—do buy them.”
17542: 
17543: “Oh no,” said Stephen, “they must be intended for imaginative persons,
17544: who can chill themselves on this warm day by thinking of the frosty
17545: Caucasus. Stern reason is my forte, you know. You must get Philip to
17546: buy those. By the way, why doesn’t he come?”
17547: 
17548: “He never likes going where there are many people, though I enjoined
17549: him to come. He said he would buy up any of my goods that the rest of
17550: the world rejected. But now, do go and buy something of Maggie.”
17551: 
17552: “No, no; see, she has got a customer; there is old Wakem himself just
17553: coming up.”
17554: 
17555: Lucy’s eyes turned with anxious interest toward Maggie to see how she
17556: went through this first interview, since a sadly memorable time, with a
17557: man toward whom she must have so strange a mixture of feelings; but she
17558: was pleased to notice that Wakem had tact enough to enter at once into
17559: talk about the bazaar wares, and appear interested in purchasing,
17560: smiling now and then kindly at Maggie, and not calling on her to speak
17561: much, as if he observed that she was rather pale and tremulous.
17562: 
17563: “Why, Wakem is making himself particularly amiable to your cousin,”
17564: said Stephen, in an undertone to Lucy; “is it pure magnanimity? You
17565: talked of a family quarrel.”
17566: 
17567: “Oh, that will soon be quite healed, I hope,” said Lucy, becoming a
17568: little indiscreet in her satisfaction, and speaking with an air of
17569: significance. But Stephen did not appear to notice this, and as some
17570: lady-purchasers came up, he lounged on toward Maggie’s end, handling
17571: trifles and standing aloof until Wakem, who had taken out his purse,
17572: had finished his transactions.
17573: 
17574: “My son came with me,” he overheard Wakem saying, “but he has vanished
17575: into some other part of the building, and has left all these charitable
17576: gallantries to me. I hope you’ll reproach him for his shabby conduct.”
17577: 
17578: She returned his smile and bow without speaking, and he turned away,
17579: only then observing Stephen and nodding to him. Maggie, conscious that
17580: Stephen was still there, busied herself with counting money, and
17581: avoided looking up. She had been well pleased that he had devoted
17582: himself to Lucy to-day, and had not come near her. They had begun the
17583: morning with an indifferent salutation, and both had rejoiced in being
17584: aloof from each other, like a patient who has actually done without his
17585: opium, in spite of former failures in resolution. And during the last
17586: few days they had even been making up their minds to failures, looking
17587: to the outward events that must soon come to separate them, as a reason
17588: for dispensing with self-conquest in detail.
17589: 
17590: Stephen moved step by step as if he were being unwillingly dragged,
17591: until he had got round the open end of the stall, and was half hidden
17592: by a screen of draperies. Maggie went on counting her money till she
17593: suddenly heard a deep gentle voice saying, “Aren’t you very tired? Do
17594: let me bring you something,—some fruit or jelly, mayn’t I?”
17595: 
17596: The unexpected tones shook her like a sudden accidental vibration of a
17597: harp close by her.
17598: 
17599: “Oh no, thank you,” she said faintly, and only half looking up for an
17600: instant.
17601: 
17602: “You look so pale,” Stephen insisted, in a more entreating tone. “I’m
17603: sure you’re exhausted. I must disobey you, and bring something.”
17604: 
17605: “No, indeed, I couldn’t take it.”
17606: 
17607: “Are you angry with me? What have I done? _Do_ look at me.”
17608: 
17609: “Pray, go away,” said Maggie, looking at him helplessly, her eyes
17610: glancing immediately from him to the opposite corner of the orchestra,
17611: which was half hidden by the folds of the old faded green curtain.
17612: Maggie had no sooner uttered this entreaty than she was wretched at the
17613: admission it implied; but Stephen turned away at once, and following
17614: her upward glance, he saw Philip Wakem sealed in the half-hidden
17615: corner, so that he could command little more than that angle of the
17616: hall in which Maggie sat. An entirely new thought occurred to Stephen,
17617: and linking itself with what he had observed of Wakem’s manner, and
17618: with Lucy’s reply to his observation, it convinced him that there had
17619: been some former relation between Philip and Maggie beyond that
17620: childish one of which he had heard. More than one impulse made him
17621: immediately leave the hall and go upstairs to the refreshment-room,
17622: where, walking up to Philip, he sat down behind him, and put his hand
17623: on his shoulder.
17624: 
17625: “Are you studying for a portrait, Phil,” he said, “or for a sketch of
17626: that oriel window? By George, it makes a capital bit from this dark
17627: corner, with the curtain just marking it off.”
17628: 
17629: “I have been studying expression,” said Philip, curtly.
17630: 
17631: “What! Miss Tulliver’s? It’s rather of the savage-moody order to-day, I
17632: think,—something of the fallen princess serving behind a counter. Her
17633: cousin sent me to her with a civil offer to get her some refreshment,
17634: but I have been snubbed, as usual. There’s natural antipathy between
17635: us, I suppose; I have seldom the honour to please her.”
17636: 
17637: “What a hypocrite you are!” said Philip, flushing angrily.
17638: 
17639: “What! because experience must have told me that I’m universally
17640: pleasing? I admit the law, but there’s some disturbing force here.”
17641: 
17642: “I am going,” said Philip, rising abruptly.
17643: 
17644: “So am I—to get a breath of fresh air; this place gets oppressive. I
17645: think I have done suit and service long enough.”
17646: 
17647: The two friends walked downstairs together without speaking. Philip
17648: turned through the outer door into the court-yard; but Stephen, saying,
17649: “Oh, by the by, I must call in here,” went on along the passage to one
17650: of the rooms at the other end of the building, which were appropriated
17651: to the town library. He had the room all to himself, and a man requires
17652: nothing less than this when he wants to dash his cap on the table,
17653: throw himself astride a chair, and stare at a high brick wall with a
17654: frown which would not have been beneath the occasion if he had been
17655: slaying “the giant Python.” The conduct that issues from a moral
17656: conflict has often so close a resemblance to vice that the distinction
17657: escapes all outward judgments founded on a mere comparison of actions.
17658: It is clear to you, I hope, that Stephen was not a hypocrite,—capable
17659: of deliberate doubleness for a selfish end; and yet his fluctuations
17660: between the indulgence of a feeling and the systematic concealment of
17661: it might have made a good case in support of Philip’s accusation.
17662: 
17663: Meanwhile, Maggie sat at her stall cold and trembling, with that
17664: painful sensation in the eyes which comes from resolutely repressed
17665: tears. Was her life to be always like this,—always bringing some new
17666: source of inward strife? She heard confusedly the busy, indifferent
17667: voices around her, and wished her mind could flow into that easy
17668: babbling current. It was at this moment that Dr Kenn, who had quite
17669: lately come into the hall, and was now walking down the middle with his
17670: hands behind him, taking a general view, fixed his eyes on Maggie for
17671: the first time, and was struck with the expression of pain on her
17672: beautiful face. She was sitting quite still, for the stream of
17673: customers had lessened at this late hour in the afternoon; the
17674: gentlemen had chiefly chosen the middle of the day, and Maggie’s stall
17675: was looking rather bare. This, with her absent, pained expression,
17676: finished the contrast between her and her companions, who were all
17677: bright, eager, and busy. He was strongly arrested. Her face had
17678: naturally drawn his attention as a new and striking one at church, and
17679: he had been introduced to her during a short call on business at Mr
17680: Deane’s, but he had never spoken more than three words to her. He
17681: walked toward her now, and Maggie, perceiving some one approaching,
17682: roused herself to look up and be prepared to speak. She felt a
17683: childlike, instinctive relief from the sense of uneasiness in this
17684: exertion, when she saw it was Dr Kenn’s face that was looking at her;
17685: that plain, middle-aged face, with a grave, penetrating kindness in it,
17686: seeming to tell of a human being who had reached a firm, safe strand,
17687: but was looking with helpful pity toward the strugglers still tossed by
17688: the waves, had an effect on Maggie at this moment which was afterward
17689: remembered by her as if it had been a promise. The middle-aged, who
17690: have lived through their strongest emotions, but are yet in the time
17691: when memory is still half passionate and not merely contemplative,
17692: should surely be a sort of natural priesthood, whom life has
17693: disciplined and consecrated to be the refuge and rescue of early
17694: stumblers and victims of self-despair. Most of us, at some moment in
17695: our young lives, would have welcomed a priest of that natural order in
17696: any sort of canonicals or uncanonicals, but had to scramble upward into
17697: all the difficulties of nineteen entirely without such aid, as Maggie
17698: did.
17699: 
17700: “You find your office rather a fatiguing one, I fear, Miss Tulliver,”
17701: said Dr Kenn.
17702: 
17703: “It is, rather,” said Maggie, simply, not being accustomed to simpler
17704: amiable denials of obvious facts.
17705: 
17706: “But I can tell Mrs Kenn that you have disposed of her goods very
17707: quickly,” he added; “she will be very much obliged to you.”
17708: 
17709: “Oh, I have done nothing; the gentlemen came very fast to buy the
17710: dressing-gowns and embroidered waistcoats, but I think any of the other
17711: ladies would have sold more; I didn’t know what to say about them.”
17712: 
17713: Dr Kenn smiled. “I hope I’m going to have you as a permanent
17714: parishioner now, Miss Tulliver; am I? You have been at a distance from
17715: us hitherto.”
17716: 
17717: “I have been a teacher in a school, and I’m going into another
17718: situation of the same kind very soon.”
17719: 
17720: “Ah? I was hoping you would remain among your friends, who are all in
17721: this neighbourhood, I believe.”
17722: 
17723: “Oh, _I must go_,” said Maggie, earnestly, looking at Dr Kenn with an
17724: expression of reliance, as if she had told him her history in those
17725: three words. It was one of those moments of implicit revelation which
17726: will sometimes happen even between people who meet quite
17727: transiently,—on a mile’s journey, perhaps, or when resting by the
17728: wayside. There is always this possibility of a word or look from a
17729: stranger to keep alive the sense of human brotherhood.
17730: 
17731: Dr Kenn’s ear and eye took in all the signs that this brief confidence
17732: of Maggie’s was charged with meaning.
17733: 
17734: “I understand,” he said; “you feel it right to go. But that will not
17735: prevent our meeting again, I hope; it will not prevent my knowing you
17736: better, if I can be of any service to you.”
17737: 
17738: He put out his hand and pressed hers kindly before he turned away.
17739: 
17740: “She has some trouble or other at heart,” he thought. “Poor child! she
17741: looks as if she might turn out to be one of
17742: 
17743:      ‘The souls by nature pitched too high,
17744:      By suffering plunged too low.’
17745: 
17746: 
17747: “There’s something wonderfully honest in those beautiful eyes.”
17748: 
17749: It may be surprising that Maggie, among whose many imperfections an
17750: excessive delight in admiration and acknowledged supremacy were not
17751: absent now, any more than when she was instructing the gypsies with a
17752: view toward achieving a royal position among them, was not more elated
17753: on a day when she had had the tribute of so many looks and smiles,
17754: together with that satisfactory consciousness which had necessarily
17755: come from being taken before Lucy’s chevalglass, and made to look at
17756: the full length of her tall beauty, crowned by the night of her massy
17757: hair. Maggie had smiled at herself then, and for the moment had
17758: forgotten everything in the sense of her own beauty. If that state of
17759: mind could have lasted, her choice would have been to have Stephen
17760: Guest at her feet, offering her a life filled with all luxuries, with
17761: daily incense of adoration near and distant, and with all possibilities
17762: of culture at her command. But there were things in her stronger than
17763: vanity,—passion and affection, and long, deep memories of early
17764: discipline and effort, of early claims on her love and pity; and the
17765: stream of vanity was soon swept along and mingled imperceptibly with
17766: that wider current which was at its highest force today, under the
17767: double urgency of the events and inward impulses brought by the last
17768: week.
17769: 
17770: Philip had not spoken to her himself about the removal of obstacles
17771: between them on his father’s side,—he shrank from that; but he had told
17772: everything to Lucy, with the hope that Maggie, being informed through
17773: her, might give him some encouraging sign that their being brought thus
17774: much nearer to each other was a happiness to her. The rush of
17775: conflicting feelings was too great for Maggie to say much when Lucy,
17776: with a face breathing playful joy, like one of Correggio’s cherubs,
17777: poured forth her triumphant revelation; and Lucy could hardly be
17778: surprised that she could do little more than cry with gladness at the
17779: thought of her father’s wish being fulfilled, and of Tom’s getting the
17780: Mill again in reward for all his hard striving. The details of
17781: preparation for the bazaar had then come to usurp Lucy’s attention for
17782: the next few days, and nothing had been said by the cousins on subjects
17783: that were likely to rouse deeper feelings. Philip had been to the house
17784: more than once, but Maggie had had no private conversation with him,
17785: and thus she had been left to fight her inward battle without
17786: interference.
17787: 
17788: But when the bazaar was fairly ended, and the cousins were alone again,
17789: resting together at home, Lucy said,—
17790: 
17791: “You must give up going to stay with your aunt Moss the day after
17792: to-morrow, Maggie; write a note to her, and tell her you have put it
17793: off at my request, and I’ll send the man with it. She won’t be
17794: displeased; you’ll have plenty of time to go by-and-by; and I don’t
17795: want you to go out of the way just now.”
17796: 
17797: “Yes, indeed I must go, dear; I can’t put it off. I wouldn’t leave aunt
17798: Gritty out for the world. And I shall have very little time, for I’m
17799: going away to a new situation on the 25th of June.”
17800: 
17801: “Maggie!” said Lucy, almost white with astonishment.
17802: 
17803: “I didn’t tell you, dear,” said Maggie, making a great effort to
17804: command herself, “because you’ve been so busy. But some time ago I
17805: wrote to our old governess, Miss Firniss, to ask her to let me know if
17806: she met with any situation that I could fill, and the other day I had a
17807: letter from her telling me that I could take three orphan pupils of
17808: hers to the coast during the holidays, and then make trial of a
17809: situation with her as teacher. I wrote yesterday to accept the offer.”
17810: 
17811: Lucy felt so hurt that for some moments she was unable to speak.
17812: 
17813: “Maggie,” she said at last, “how could you be so unkind to me—not to
17814: tell me—to take _such_ a step—and now!” She hesitated a little, and
17815: then added, “And Philip? I thought everything was going to be so happy.
17816: Oh, Maggie, what is the reason? Give it up; let me write. There is
17817: nothing now to keep you and Philip apart.”
17818: 
17819: “Yes,” said Maggie, faintly. “There is Tom’s feeling. He said I must
17820: give him up if I married Philip. And I know he will not change—at least
17821: not for a long while—unless something happened to soften him.”
17822: 
17823: “But I will talk to him; he’s coming back this week. And this good news
17824: about the Mill will soften him. And I’ll talk to him about Philip.
17825: Tom’s always very compliant to me; I don’t think he’s so obstinate.”
17826: 
17827: “But I must go,” said Maggie, in a distressed voice. “I must leave some
17828: time to pack. Don’t press me to stay, dear Lucy.”
17829: 
17830: Lucy was silent for two or three minutes, looking away and ruminating.
17831: At length she knelt down by her cousin, and looking up in her face with
17832: anxious seriousness, said,—
17833: 
17834: “Maggie, is it that you don’t love Philip well enough to marry him?
17835: Tell me—trust me.”
17836: 
17837: Maggie held Lucy’s hands tightly in silence a little while. Her own
17838: hands were quite cold. But when she spoke, her voice was quite clear
17839: and distinct.
17840: 
17841: “Yes, Lucy, I would choose to marry him. I think it would be the best
17842: and highest lot for me,—to make his life happy. He loved me first. No
17843: one else could be quite what he is to me. But I can’t divide myself
17844: from my brother for life. I must go away, and wait. Pray don’t speak to
17845: me again about it.”
17846: 
17847: Lucy obeyed in pain and wonder. The next word she said was,—
17848: 
17849: “Well, dear Maggie, at least you will go to the dance at Park House
17850: to-morrow, and have some music and brightness, before you go to pay
17851: these dull dutiful visits. Ah! here come aunty and the tea.”
17852: 
17853: 
17854: Chapter X.
17855: 
17856: The Spell Seems Broken
17857: 
17858: The suite of rooms opening into each other at Park House looked duly
17859: brilliant with lights and flowers and the personal splendors of sixteen
17860: couples, with attendant parents and guardians. The focus of brilliancy
17861: was the long drawing-room, where the dancing went forward, under the
17862: inspiration of the grand piano; the library, into which it opened at
17863: one end, had the more sober illumination of maturity, with caps and
17864: cards; and at the other end the pretty sitting-room, with a
17865: conservatory attached, was left as an occasional cool retreat. Lucy,
17866: who had laid aside her black for the first time, and had her pretty
17867: slimness set off by an abundant dress of white crape, was the
17868: acknowledged queen of the occasion; for this was one of the Miss
17869: Guests’ thoroughly condescending parties, including no member of any
17870: aristocracy higher than that of St Ogg’s, and stretching to the extreme
17871: limits of commercial and professional gentility.
17872: 
17873: Maggie at first refused to dance, saying that she had forgotten all the
17874: figures—it was so many years since she had danced at school; and she
17875: was glad to have that excuse, for it is ill dancing with a heavy heart.
17876: But at length the music wrought in her young limbs, and the longing
17877: came; even though it was the horrible young Torry, who walked up a
17878: second time to try and persuade her. She warned him that she could not
17879: dance anything but a country-dance; but he, of course, was willing to
17880: wait for that high felicity, meaning only to be complimentary when he
17881: assured her at several intervals that it was a “great bore” that she
17882: couldn’t waltz, he would have liked so much to waltz with her. But at
17883: last it was the turn of the good old-fashioned dance which has the
17884: least of vanity and the most of merriment in it, and Maggie quite
17885: forgot her troublous life in a childlike enjoyment of that half-rustic
17886: rhythm which seems to banish pretentious etiquette. She felt quite
17887: charitably toward young Torry, as his hand bore her along and held her
17888: up in the dance; her eyes and cheeks had that fire of young joy in them
17889: which will flame out if it can find the least breath to fan it; and her
17890: simple black dress, with its bit of black lace, seemed like the dim
17891: setting of a jewel.
17892: 
17893: Stephen had not yet asked her to dance; had not yet paid her more than
17894: a passing civility. Since yesterday, that inward vision of her which
17895: perpetually made part of his consciousness, had been half screened by
17896: the image of Philip Wakem, which came across it like a blot; there was
17897: some attachment between her and Philip; at least there was an
17898: attachment on his side, which made her feel in some bondage. Here,
17899: then, Stephen told himself, was another claim of honour which called on
17900: him to resist the attraction that was continually threatening to
17901: overpower him. He told himself so; and yet he had once or twice felt a
17902: certain savage resistance, and at another moment a shuddering
17903: repugnance, to this intrusion of Philip’s image, which almost made it a
17904: new incitement to rush toward Maggie and claim her for himself.
17905: Nevertheless, he had done what he meant to do this evening,—he had kept
17906: aloof from her; he had hardly looked at her; and he had been gayly
17907: assiduous to Lucy. But now his eyes were devouring Maggie; he felt
17908: inclined to kick young Torry out of the dance, and take his place. Then
17909: he wanted the dance to end that he might get rid of his partner. The
17910: possibility that he too should dance with Maggie, and have her hand in
17911: his so long, was beginning to possess him like a thirst. But even now
17912: their hands were meeting in the dance,—were meeting still to the very
17913: end of it, though they were far off each other.
17914: 
17915: Stephen hardly knew what happened, or in what automatic way he got
17916: through the duties of politeness in the interval, until he was free and
17917: saw Maggie seated alone again, at the farther end of the room. He made
17918: his way toward her round the couples that were forming for the waltz;
17919: and when Maggie became conscious that she was the person he sought, she
17920: felt, in spite of all the thoughts that had gone before, a glowing
17921: gladness at heart. Her eyes and cheeks were still brightened with her
17922: childlike enthusiasm in the dance; her whole frame was set to joy and
17923: tenderness; even the coming pain could not seem bitter,—she was ready
17924: to welcome it as a part of life, for life at this moment seemed a keen,
17925: vibrating consciousness poised above pleasure or pain. This one, this
17926: last night, she might expand unrestrainedly in the warmth of the
17927: present, without those chill, eating thoughts of the past and the
17928: future.
17929: 
17930: “They’re going to waltz again,” said Stephen, bending to speak to her,
17931: with that glance and tone of subdued tenderness which young dreams
17932: create to themselves in the summer woods when low, cooing voices fill
17933: the air. Such glances and tones bring the breath of poetry with them
17934: into a room that is half stifling with glaring gas and hard flirtation.
17935: 
17936: “They are going to waltz again. It is rather dizzy work to look on, and
17937: the room is very warm; shall we walk about a little?”
17938: 
17939: He took her hand and placed it within his arm, and they walked on into
17940: the sitting-room, where the tables were strewn with engravings for the
17941: accommodation of visitors who would not want to look at them. But no
17942: visitors were here at this moment. They passed on into the
17943: conservatory.
17944: 
17945: “How strange and unreal the trees and flowers look with the lights
17946: among them!” said Maggie, in a low voice. “They look as if they
17947: belonged to an enchanted land, and would never fade away; I could fancy
17948: they were all made of jewels.”
17949: 
17950: She was looking at the tier of geraniums as she spoke, and Stephen made
17951: no answer; but he was looking at her; and does not a supreme poet blend
17952: light and sound into one, calling darkness mute, and light eloquent?
17953: Something strangely powerful there was in the light of Stephen’s long
17954: gaze, for it made Maggie’s face turn toward it and look upward at it,
17955: slowly, like a flower at the ascending brightness. And they walked
17956: unsteadily on, without feeling that they were walking; without feeling
17957: anything but that long, grave, mutual gaze which has the solemnity
17958: belonging to all deep human passion. The hovering thought that they
17959: must and would renounce each other made this moment of mute confession
17960: more intense in its rapture.
17961: 
17962: But they had reached the end of the conservatory, and were obliged to
17963: pause and turn. The change of movement brought a new consciousness to
17964: Maggie; she blushed deeply, turned away her head, and drew her arm from
17965: Stephen’s, going up to some flowers to smell them. Stephen stood
17966: motionless, and still pale.
17967: 
17968: “Oh, may I get this rose?” said Maggie, making a great effort to say
17969: something, and dissipate the burning sense of irretrievable confession.
17970: “I think I am quite wicked with roses; I like to gather them and smell
17971: them till they have no scent left.”
17972: 
17973: Stephen was mute; he was incapable of putting a sentence together, and
17974: Maggie bent her arm a little upward toward the large half-opened rose
17975: that had attracted her. Who has not felt the beauty of a woman’s arm?
17976: The unspeakable suggestions of tenderness that lie in the dimpled
17977: elbow, and all the varied gently lessening curves, down to the delicate
17978: wrist, with its tiniest, almost imperceptible nicks in the firm
17979: softness. A woman’s arm touched the soul of a great sculptor two
17980: thousand years ago, so that he wrought an image of it for the Parthenon
17981: which moves us still as it clasps lovingly the timeworn marble of a
17982: headless trunk. Maggie’s was such an arm as that, and it had the warm
17983: tints of life.
17984: 
17985: A mad impulse seized on Stephen; he darted toward the arm, and showered
17986: kisses on it, clasping the wrist.
17987: 
17988: But the next moment Maggie snatched it from him, and glared at him like
17989: a wounded war-goddess, quivering with rage and humiliation.
17990: 
17991: “How dare you?” She spoke in a deeply shaken, half-smothered voice.
17992: “What right have I given you to insult me?”
17993: 
17994: She darted from him into the adjoining room, and threw herself on the
17995: sofa, panting and trembling.
17996: 
17997: A horrible punishment was come upon her for the sin of allowing a
17998: moment’s happiness that was treachery to Lucy, to Philip, to her own
17999: better soul. That momentary happiness had been smitten with a blight, a
18000: leprosy; Stephen thought more lightly of _her_ than he did of Lucy.
18001: 
18002: As for Stephen, he leaned back against the framework of the
18003: conservatory, dizzy with the conflict of passions,—love, rage, and
18004: confused despair; despair at his want of self-mastery, and despair that
18005: he had offended Maggie.
18006: 
18007: The last feeling surmounted every other; to be by her side again and
18008: entreat forgiveness was the only thing that had the force of a motive
18009: for him, and she had not been seated more than a few minutes when he
18010: came and stood humbly before her. But Maggie’s bitter rage was unspent.
18011: 
18012: “Leave me to myself, if you please,” she said, with impetuous
18013: haughtiness, “and for the future avoid me.”
18014: 
18015: Stephen turned away, and walked backward and forward at the other end
18016: of the room. There was the dire necessity of going back into the
18017: dancing-room again, and he was beginning to be conscious of that. They
18018: had been absent so short a time, that when he went in again the waltz
18019: was not ended.
18020: 
18021: Maggie, too, was not long before she re-entered. All the pride of her
18022: nature was stung into activity; the hateful weakness which had dragged
18023: her within reach of this wound to her self-respect had at least wrought
18024: its own cure. The thoughts and temptations of the last month should all
18025: be flung away into an unvisited chamber of memory. There was nothing to
18026: allure her now; duty would be easy, and all the old calm purposes would
18027: reign peacefully once more. She re-entered the drawing-room still with
18028: some excited brightness in her face, but with a sense of proud
18029: self-command that defied anything to agitate her. She refused to dance
18030: again, but she talked quite readily and calmly with every one who
18031: addressed her. And when they got home that night, she kissed Lucy with
18032: a free heart, almost exulting in this scorching moment, which had
18033: delivered her from the possibility of another word or look that would
18034: have the stamp of treachery toward that gentle, unsuspicious sister.
18035: 
18036: The next morning Maggie did not set off to Basset quite so soon as she
18037: had expected. Her mother was to accompany her in the carriage, and
18038: household business could not be dispatched hastily by Mrs Tulliver. So
18039: Maggie, who had been in a hurry to prepare herself, had to sit waiting,
18040: equipped for the drive, in the garden. Lucy was busy in the house
18041: wrapping up some bazaar presents for the younger ones at Basset, and
18042: when there was a loud ring at the door-bell, Maggie felt some alarm
18043: lest Lucy should bring out Stephen to her; it was sure to be Stephen.
18044: 
18045: But presently the visitor came out into the garden alone, and seated
18046: himself by her on the garden-chair. It was not Stephen.
18047: 
18048: “We can just catch the tips of the Scotch firs, Maggie, from this
18049: seat,” said Philip.
18050: 
18051: They had taken each other’s hands in silence, but Maggie had looked at
18052: him with a more complete revival of the old childlike affectionate
18053: smile than he had seen before, and he felt encouraged.
18054: 
18055: “Yes,” she said, “I often look at them, and wish I could see the low
18056: sunlight on the stems again. But I have never been that way but
18057: once,—to the churchyard with my mother.”
18058: 
18059: “I have been there, I go there, continually,” said Philip. “I have
18060: nothing but the past to live upon.”
18061: 
18062: A keen remembrance and keen pity impelled Maggie to put her hand in
18063: Philip’s. They had so often walked hand in hand!
18064: 
18065: “I remember all the spots,” she said,—“just where you told me of
18066: particular things, beautiful stories that I had never heard of before.”
18067: 
18068: “You will go there again soon, won’t you, Maggie?” said Philip, getting
18069: timid. “The Mill will soon be your brother’s home again.”
18070: 
18071: “Yes; but I shall not be there,” said Maggie. “I shall only hear of
18072: that happiness. I am going away again; Lucy has not told you, perhaps?”
18073: 
18074: “Then the future will never join on to the past again, Maggie? That
18075: book is quite closed?”
18076: 
18077: The gray eyes that had so often looked up at her with entreating
18078: worship, looked up at her now, with a last struggling ray of hope in
18079: them, and Maggie met them with her large sincere gaze.
18080: 
18081: “That book never will be closed, Philip,” she said, with grave sadness;
18082: “I desire no future that will break the ties of the past. But the tie
18083: to my brother is one of the strongest. I can do nothing willingly that
18084: will divide me always from him.”
18085: 
18086: “Is that the only reason that would keep us apart forever, Maggie?”
18087: said Philip, with a desperate determination to have a definite answer.
18088: 
18089: “The only reason,” said Maggie, with calm decision. And she believed
18090: it. At that moment she felt as if the enchanted cup had been dashed to
18091: the ground. The reactionary excitement that gave her a proud
18092: self-mastery had not subsided, and she looked at the future with a
18093: sense of calm choice.
18094: 
18095: They sat hand in hand without looking at each other or speaking for a
18096: few minutes; in Maggie’s mind the first scenes of love and parting were
18097: more present than the actual moment, and she was looking at Philip in
18098: the Red Deeps.
18099: 
18100: Philip felt that he ought to have been thoroughly happy in that answer
18101: of hers; she was as open and transparent as a rock-pool. Why was he not
18102: thoroughly happy? Jealousy is never satisfied with anything short of an
18103: omniscience that would detect the subtlest fold of the heart.
18104: 
18105: 
18106: Chapter XI.
18107: 
18108: In the Lane
18109: 
18110: Maggie had been four days at her aunt Moss’s giving the early June
18111: sunshine quite a new brightness in the care-dimmed eyes of that
18112: affectionate woman, and making an epoch for her cousins great and
18113: small, who were learning her words and actions by heart, as if she had
18114: been a transient avatar of perfect wisdom and beauty.
18115: 
18116: She was standing on the causeway with her aunt and a group of cousins
18117: feeding the chickens, at that quiet moment in the life of the farmyards
18118: before the afternoon milking-time. The great buildings round the hollow
18119: yard were as dreary and tumbledown as ever, but over the old
18120: garden-wall the straggling rose-bushes were beginning to toss their
18121: summer weight, and the gray wood and old bricks of the house, on its
18122: higher level, had a look of sleepy age in the broad afternoon sunlight,
18123: that suited the quiescent time. Maggie, with her bonnet over her arm,
18124: was smiling down at the hatch of small fluffy chickens, when her aunt
18125: exclaimed,—
18126: 
18127: “Goodness me! who is that gentleman coming in at the gate?”
18128: 
18129: It was a gentleman on a tall bay horse; and the flanks and neck of the
18130: horse were streaked black with fast riding. Maggie felt a beating at
18131: head and heart, horrible as the sudden leaping to life of a savage
18132: enemy who had feigned death.
18133: 
18134: “Who is it, my dear?” said Mrs Moss, seeing in Maggie’s face the
18135: evidence that she knew.
18136: 
18137: “It is Mr Stephen Guest,” said Maggie, rather faintly. “My cousin
18138: Lucy’s—a gentleman who is very intimate at my cousin’s.”
18139: 
18140: Stephen was already close to them, had jumped off his horse, and now
18141: raised his hat as he advanced.
18142: 
18143: “Hold the horse, Willy,” said Mrs Moss to the twelve-year-old boy.
18144: 
18145: “No, thank you,” said Stephen, pulling at the horse’s impatiently
18146: tossing head. “I must be going again immediately. I have a message to
18147: deliver to you, Miss Tulliver, on private business. May I take the
18148: liberty of asking you to walk a few yards with me?”
18149: 
18150: He had a half-jaded, half-irritated look, such as a man gets when he
18151: has been dogged by some care or annoyance that makes his bed and his
18152: dinner of little use to him. He spoke almost abruptly, as if his errand
18153: were too pressing for him to trouble himself about what would be
18154: thought by Mrs Moss of his visit and request. Good Mrs Moss, rather
18155: nervous in the presence of this apparently haughty gentleman, was
18156: inwardly wondering whether she would be doing right or wrong to invite
18157: him again to leave his horse and walk in, when Maggie, feeling all the
18158: embarrassment of the situation, and unable to say anything, put on her
18159: bonnet, and turned to walk toward the gate.
18160: 
18161: Stephen turned too, and walked by her side, leading his horse.
18162: 
18163: Not a word was spoken till they were out in the lane, and had walked
18164: four or five yards, when Maggie, who had been looking straight before
18165: her all the while, turned again to walk back, saying, with haughty
18166: resentment,—
18167: 
18168: “There is no need for me to go any farther. I don’t know whether you
18169: consider it gentlemanly and delicate conduct to place me in a position
18170: that forced me to come out with you, or whether you wished to insult me
18171: still further by thrusting an interview upon me in this way.”
18172: 
18173: “Of course you are angry with me for coming,” said Stephen, bitterly.
18174: “Of course it is of no consequence what a man has to suffer; it is only
18175: your woman’s dignity that you care about.”
18176: 
18177: Maggie gave a slight start, such as might have come from the slightest
18178: possible electric shock.
18179: 
18180: “As if it were not enough that I’m entangled in this way; that I’m mad
18181: with love for you; that I resist the strongest passion a man can feel,
18182: because I try to be true to other claims; but you must treat me as if I
18183: were a coarse brute, who would willingly offend you. And when, if I had
18184: my own choice, I should ask you to take my hand and my fortune and my
18185: whole life, and do what you liked with them! I know I forgot myself. I
18186: took an unwarrantable liberty. I hate myself for having done it. But I
18187: repented immediately; I’ve been repenting ever since. You ought not to
18188: think it unpardonable; a man who loves with his whole soul, as I do
18189: you, is liable to be mastered by his feelings for a moment; but you
18190: know—you must believe—that the worst pain I could have is to have
18191: pained you; that I would give the world to recall the error.”
18192: 
18193: Maggie dared not speak, dared not turn her head. The strength that had
18194: come from resentment was all gone, and her lips were quivering visibly.
18195: She could not trust herself to utter the full forgiveness that rose in
18196: answer to that confession.
18197: 
18198: They were come nearly in front of the gate again, and she paused,
18199: trembling.
18200: 
18201: “You must not say these things; I must not hear them,” she said,
18202: looking down in misery, as Stephen came in front of her, to prevent her
18203: from going farther toward the gate. “I’m very sorry for any pain you
18204: have to go through; but it is of no use to speak.”
18205: 
18206: “Yes, it _is_ of use,” said Stephen, impetuously. “It would be of use
18207: if you would treat me with some sort of pity and consideration, instead
18208: of doing me vile injustice in your mind. I could bear everything more
18209: quietly if I knew you didn’t hate me for an insolent coxcomb. Look at
18210: me; see what a hunted devil I am; I’ve been riding thirty miles every
18211: day to get away from the thought of you.”
18212: 
18213: Maggie did not—dared not—look. She had already seen the harassed face.
18214: But she said gently,—
18215: 
18216: “I don’t think any evil of you.”
18217: 
18218: “Then, dearest, look at me,” said Stephen, in deepest, tenderest tones
18219: of entreaty. “Don’t go away from me yet. Give me a moment’s happiness;
18220: make me feel you’ve forgiven me.”
18221: 
18222: “Yes, I do forgive you,” said Maggie, shaken by those tones, and all
18223: the more frightened at herself. “But pray let me go in again. Pray go
18224: away.”
18225: 
18226: A great tear fell from under her lowered eyelids.
18227: 
18228: “I can’t go away from you; I can’t leave you,” said Stephen, with still
18229: more passionate pleading. “I shall come back again if you send me away
18230: with this coldness; I can’t answer for myself. But if you will go with
18231: me only a little way I can live on that. You see plainly enough that
18232: your anger has only made me ten times more unreasonable.”
18233: 
18234: Maggie turned. But Tancred, the bay horse, began to make such spirited
18235: remonstrances against this frequent change of direction, that Stephen,
18236: catching sight of Willy Moss peeping through the gate, called out,
18237: “Here! just come and hold my horse for five minutes.”
18238: 
18239: “Oh, no,” said Maggie, hurriedly, “my aunt will think it so strange.”
18240: 
18241: “Never mind,” Stephen answered impatiently; “they don’t know the people
18242: at St Ogg’s. Lead him up and down just here for five minutes,” he added
18243: to Willy, who was now close to them; and then he turned to Maggie’s
18244: side, and they walked on. It was clear that she _must_ go on now.
18245: 
18246: “Take my arm,” said Stephen, entreatingly; and she took it, feeling all
18247: the while as if she were sliding downward in a nightmare.
18248: 
18249: “There is no end to this misery,” she began, struggling to repel the
18250: influence by speech. “It is wicked—base—ever allowing a word or look
18251: that Lucy—that others might not have seen. Think of Lucy.”
18252: 
18253: “I do think of her—bless her. If I didn’t——” Stephen had laid his hand
18254: on Maggie’s that rested on his arm, and they both felt it difficult to
18255: speak.
18256: 
18257: “And I have other ties,” Maggie went on, at last, with a desperate
18258: effort, “even if Lucy did not exist.”
18259: 
18260: “You are engaged to Philip Wakem?” said Stephen, hastily. “Is it so?”
18261: 
18262: “I consider myself engaged to him; I don’t mean to marry any one else.”
18263: 
18264: Stephen was silent again until they had turned out of the sun into a
18265: side lane, all grassy and sheltered. Then he burst out impetuously,—
18266: 
18267: “It is unnatural, it is horrible. Maggie, if you loved me as I love
18268: you, we should throw everything else to the winds for the sake of
18269: belonging to each other. We should break all these mistaken ties that
18270: were made in blindness, and determine to marry each other.”
18271: 
18272: “I would rather die than fall into that temptation,” said Maggie, with
18273: deep, slow distinctness, all the gathered spiritual force of painful
18274: years coming to her aid in this extremity. She drew her arm from his as
18275: she spoke.
18276: 
18277: “Tell me, then, that you don’t care for me,” he said, almost violently.
18278: “Tell me that you love some one else better.”
18279: 
18280: It darted through Maggie’s mind that here was a mode of releasing
18281: herself from outward struggle,—to tell Stephen that her whole heart was
18282: Philip’s. But her lips would not utter that, and she was silent.
18283: 
18284: “If you do love me, dearest,” said Stephen, gently, taking her hand
18285: again and laying it within his arm, “it is better—it is right that we
18286: should marry each other. We can’t help the pain it will give. It is
18287: come upon us without our seeking; it is natural; it has taken hold of
18288: me in spite of every effort I have made to resist it. God knows, I’ve
18289: been trying to be faithful to tacit engagements, and I’ve only made
18290: things worse; I’d better have given way at first.”
18291: 
18292: Maggie was silent. If it were _not_ wrong—if she were once convinced of
18293: that, and need no longer beat and struggle against this current, soft
18294: and yet strong as the summer stream!
18295: 
18296: “Say ‘yes,’ dearest,” said Stephen, leaning to look entreatingly in her
18297: face. “What could we care about in the whole world beside, if we
18298: belonged to each other?”
18299: 
18300: Her breath was on his face, his lips were very near hers, but there was
18301: a great dread dwelling in his love for her.
18302: 
18303: Her lips and eyelids quivered; she opened her eyes full on his for an
18304: instant, like a lovely wild animal timid and struggling under caresses,
18305: and then turned sharp round toward home again.
18306: 
18307: “And after all,” he went on, in an impatient tone, trying to defeat his
18308: own scruples as well as hers, “I am breaking no positive engagement; if
18309: Lucy’s affections had been withdrawn from me and given to some one
18310: else, I should have felt no right to assert a claim on her. If you are
18311: not absolutely pledged to Philip, we are neither of us bound.”
18312: 
18313: “You don’t believe that; it is not your real feeling,” said Maggie,
18314: earnestly. “You feel, as I do, that the real tie lies in the feelings
18315: and expectations we have raised in other minds. Else all pledges might
18316: be broken, when there was no outward penalty. There would be no such
18317: thing as faithfulness.”
18318: 
18319: Stephen was silent; he could not pursue that argument; the opposite
18320: conviction had wrought in him too strongly through his previous time of
18321: struggle. But it soon presented itself in a new form.
18322: 
18323: “The pledge _can’t_ be fulfilled,” he said, with impetuous insistence.
18324: “It is unnatural; we can only pretend to give ourselves to any one
18325: else. There is wrong in that too; there may be misery in it for _them_
18326: as well as for us. Maggie, you must see that; you do see that.”
18327: 
18328: He was looking eagerly at her face for the least sign of compliance;
18329: his large, firm, gentle grasp was on her hand. She was silent for a few
18330: moments, with her eyes fixed on the ground; then she drew a deep
18331: breath, and said, looking up at him with solemn sadness,—
18332: 
18333: “Oh, it is difficult,—life is very difficult! It seems right to me
18334: sometimes that we should follow our strongest feeling; but then, such
18335: feelings continually come across the ties that all our former life has
18336: made for us,—the ties that have made others dependent on us,—and would
18337: cut them in two. If life were quite easy and simple, as it might have
18338: been in Paradise, and we could always see that one being first toward
18339: whom—I mean, if life did not make duties for us before love comes, love
18340: would be a sign that two people ought to belong to each other. But I
18341: see—I feel it is not so now; there are things we must renounce in life;
18342: some of us must resign love. Many things are difficult and dark to me;
18343: but I see one thing quite clearly,—that I must not, cannot, seek my own
18344: happiness by sacrificing others. Love is natural; but surely pity and
18345: faithfulness and memory are natural too. And they would live in me
18346: still, and punish me if I did not obey them. I should be haunted by the
18347: suffering I had caused. Our love would be poisoned. Don’t urge me; help
18348: me,—help me, _because_ I love you.”
18349: 
18350: Maggie had become more and more earnest as she went on; her face had
18351: become flushed, and her eyes fuller and fuller of appealing love.
18352: Stephen had the fibre of nobleness in him that vibrated to her appeal;
18353: but in the same moment—how could it be otherwise?—that pleading beauty
18354: gained new power over him.
18355: 
18356: “Dearest,” he said, in scarcely more than a whisper, while his arm
18357: stole round her, “I’ll do, I’ll bear anything you wish. But—one
18358: kiss—one—the last—before we part.”
18359: 
18360: One kiss, and then a long look, until Maggie said tremulously, “Let me
18361: go,—let me make haste back.”
18362: 
18363: She hurried along, and not another word was spoken. Stephen stood still
18364: and beckoned when they came within sight of Willy and the horse, and
18365: Maggie went on through the gate. Mrs Moss was standing alone at the
18366: door of the old porch; she had sent all the cousins in, with kind
18367: thoughtfulness. It might be a joyful thing that Maggie had a rich and
18368: handsome lover, but she would naturally feel embarrassed at coming in
18369: again; and it might _not_ be joyful. In either case Mrs Moss waited
18370: anxiously to receive Maggie by herself. The speaking face told plainly
18371: enough that, if there was joy, it was of a very agitating, dubious
18372: sort.
18373: 
18374: “Sit down here a bit, my dear.” She drew Maggie into the porch, and sat
18375: down on the bench by her; there was no privacy in the house.
18376: 
18377: “Oh, aunt Gritty, I’m very wretched! I wish I could have died when I
18378: was fifteen. It seemed so easy to give things up then; it is so hard
18379: now.”
18380: 
18381: The poor child threw her arms round her aunt’s neck, and fell into
18382: long, deep sobs.
18383: 
18384: 
18385: Chapter XII.
18386: 
18387: A Family Party
18388: 
18389: Maggie left her good aunt Gritty at the end of the week, and went to
18390: Garum Firs to pay her visit to aunt Pullet according to agreement. In
18391: the mean time very unexpected things had happened, and there was to be
18392: a family party at Garum to discuss and celebrate a change in the
18393: fortunes of the Tullivers, which was likely finally to carry away the
18394: shadow of their demerits like the last limb of an eclipse, and cause
18395: their hitherto obscured virtues to shine forth in full-rounded
18396: splendor. It is pleasant to know that a new ministry just come into
18397: office are not the only fellow-men who enjoy a period of high
18398: appreciation and full-blown eulogy; in many respectable families
18399: throughout this realm, relatives becoming creditable meet with a
18400: similar cordiality of recognition, which in its fine freedom from the
18401: coercion of any antecedents, suggests the hopeful possibility that we
18402: may some day without any notice find ourselves in full millennium, with
18403: cockatrices who have ceased to bite, and wolves that no longer show
18404: their teeth with any but the blandest intentions.
18405: 
18406: Lucy came so early as to have the start even of aunt Glegg; for she
18407: longed to have some undisturbed talk with Maggie about the wonderful
18408: news. It seemed, did it not? said Lucy, with her prettiest air of
18409: wisdom, as if everything, even other people’s misfortunes (poor
18410: creatures!) were conspiring now to make poor dear aunt Tulliver, and
18411: cousin Tom, and naughty Maggie too, if she were not obstinately bent on
18412: the contrary, as happy as they deserved to be after all their troubles.
18413: To think that the very day—the _very day_—after Tom had come back from
18414: Newcastle, that unfortunate young Jetsome, whom Mr Wakem had placed at
18415: the Mill, had been pitched off his horse in a drunken fit, and was
18416: lying at St Ogg’s in a dangerous state, so that Wakem had signified his
18417: wish that the new purchasers should enter on the premises at once!
18418: 
18419: It was very dreadful for that unhappy young man, but it did seem as if
18420: the misfortune had happened then, rather than at any other time, in
18421: order that cousin Tom might all the sooner have the fit reward of his
18422: exemplary conduct,—papa thought so very highly of him. Aunt Tulliver
18423: must certainly go to the Mill now, and keep house for Tom; that was
18424: rather a loss to Lucy in the matter of household comfort; but then, to
18425: think of poor aunty being in her old place again, and gradually getting
18426: comforts about her there!
18427: 
18428: On this last point Lucy had her cunning projects, and when she and
18429: Maggie had made their dangerous way down the bright stairs into the
18430: handsome parlour, where the very sunbeams seemed cleaner than
18431: elsewhere, she directed her manœuvres, as any other great tactician
18432: would have done, against the weaker side of the enemy.
18433: 
18434: “Aunt Pullet,” she said, seating herself on the sofa, and caressingly
18435: adjusting that lady’s floating cap-string, “I want you to make up your
18436: mind what linen and things you will give Tom toward housekeeping;
18437: because you are always so generous,—you give such nice things, you
18438: know; and if you set the example, aunt Glegg will follow.”
18439: 
18440: “That she never can, my dear,” said Mrs Pullet, with unusual vigor,
18441: “for she hasn’t got the linen to follow suit wi’ mine, I can tell you.
18442: She’d niver the taste, not if she’d spend the money. Big checks and
18443: live things, like stags and foxes, all her table-linen is,—not a spot
18444: nor a diamond among ’em. But it’s poor work dividing one’s linen before
18445: one dies,—I niver thought to ha’ done that, Bessy,” Mrs Pullet
18446: continued, shaking her head and looking at her sister Tulliver, “when
18447: you and me chose the double diamont, the first flax iver we’d spun, and
18448: the Lord knows where yours is gone.”
18449: 
18450: “I’d no choice, I’m sure, sister,” said poor Mrs Tulliver, accustomed
18451: to consider herself in the light of an accused person. “I’m sure it was
18452: no wish o’ mine, iver, as I should lie awake o’ nights thinking o’ my
18453: best bleached linen all over the country.”
18454: 
18455: “Take a peppermint, Mrs Tulliver,” said uncle Pullet, feeling that he
18456: was offering a cheap and wholesome form of comfort, which he was
18457: recommending by example.
18458: 
18459: “Oh, but, aunt Pullet,” said Lucy, “you’ve so much beautiful linen. And
18460: suppose you had had daughters! Then you must have divided it when they
18461: were married.”
18462: 
18463: “Well, I don’t say as I won’t do it,” said Mrs Pullet, “for now Tom’s
18464: so lucky, it’s nothing but right his friends should look on him and
18465: help him. There’s the tablecloths I bought at your sale, Bessy; it was
18466: nothing but good natur’ o’ me to buy ’em, for they’ve been lying in the
18467: chest ever since. But I’m not going to give Maggie any more o’ my Indy
18468: muslin and things, if she’s to go into service again, when she might
18469: stay and keep me company, and do my sewing for me, if she wasn’t wanted
18470: at her brother’s.”
18471: 
18472: “Going into service” was the expression by which the Dodson mind
18473: represented to itself the position of teacher or governess; and
18474: Maggie’s return to that menial condition, now circumstances offered her
18475: more eligible prospects, was likely to be a sore point with all her
18476: relatives, besides Lucy. Maggie in her crude form, with her hair down
18477: her back, and altogether in a state of dubious promise, was a most
18478: undesirable niece; but now she was capable of being at once ornamental
18479: and useful. The subject was revived in aunt and uncle Glegg’s presence,
18480: over the tea and muffins.
18481: 
18482: “Hegh, hegh!” said Mr Glegg, good-naturedly patting Maggie on the back,
18483: “nonsense, nonsense! Don’t let us hear of you taking a place again,
18484: Maggie. Why, you must ha’ picked up half-a-dozen sweethearts at the
18485: bazaar; isn’t there one of ’em the right sort of article? Come, now?”
18486: 
18487: “Mr Glegg,” said his wife, with that shade of increased politeness in
18488: her severity which she always put on with her crisper fronts, “you’ll
18489: excuse me, but you’re far too light for a man of your years. It’s
18490: respect and duty to her aunts, and the rest of her kin as are so good
18491: to her, should have kept my niece from fixing about going away again
18492: without consulting us; not sweethearts, if I’m to use such a word,
18493: though it was never heared in _my_ family.”
18494: 
18495: “Why, what did they call us, when we went to see ’em, then, eh,
18496: neighbour Pullet? They thought us sweet enough then,” said Mr Glegg,
18497: winking pleasantly; while Mr Pullet, at the suggestion of sweetness,
18498: took a little more sugar.
18499: 
18500: “Mr Glegg,” said Mrs G., “if you’re going to be undelicate, let me
18501: know.”
18502: 
18503: “La, Jane, your husband’s only joking,” said Mrs Pullet; “let him joke
18504: while he’s got health and strength. There’s poor Mr Tilt got his mouth
18505: drawn all o’ one side, and couldn’t laugh if he was to try.”
18506: 
18507: “I’ll trouble you for the muffineer, then, Mr Glegg,” said Mrs G., “if
18508: I may be so bold to interrupt your joking. Though it’s other people
18509: must see the joke in a niece’s putting a slight on her mother’s eldest
18510: sister, as is the head o’ the family; and only coming in and out on
18511: short visits, all the time she’s been in the town, and then settling to
18512: go away without my knowledge,—as I’d laid caps out on purpose for her
18513: to make ’em up for me,—and me as have divided my money so equal——”
18514: 
18515: “Sister,” Mrs Tulliver broke in anxiously, “I’m sure Maggie never
18516: thought o’ going away without staying at your house as well as the
18517: others. Not as it’s my wish she should go away at all, but quite
18518: contrairy. I’m sure I’m innocent. I’ve said over and over again, ‘My
18519: dear, you’ve no call to go away.’ But there’s ten days or a fortnight
18520: Maggie’ll have before she’s fixed to go; she can stay at your house
18521: just as well, and I’ll step in when I can, and so will Lucy.”
18522: 
18523: “Bessy,” said Mrs Glegg, “if you’d exercise a little more thought, you
18524: might know I should hardly think it was worth while to unpin a bed, and
18525: go to all that trouble now, just at the end o’ the time, when our house
18526: isn’t above a quarter of an hour’s walk from Mr Deane’s. She can come
18527: the first thing in the morning, and go back the last at night, and be
18528: thankful she’s got a good aunt so close to her to come and sit with. I
18529: know _I_ should, when I was her age.”
18530: 
18531: “La, Jane,” said Mrs Pullet, “it ’ud do your beds good to have somebody
18532: to sleep in ’em. There’s that striped room smells dreadful mouldy, and
18533: the glass mildewed like anything. I’m sure I thought I should be struck
18534: with death when you took me in.”
18535: 
18536: “Oh, there is Tom!” exclaimed Lucy, clapping her hands. “He’s come on
18537: Sindbad, as I told him. I was afraid he was not going to keep his
18538: promise.”
18539: 
18540: Maggie jumped up to kiss Tom as he entered, with strong feeling, at
18541: this first meeting since the prospect of returning to the Mill had been
18542: opened to him; and she kept his hand, leading him to the chair by her
18543: side. To have no cloud between herself and Tom was still a perpetual
18544: yearning in her, that had its root deeper than all change. He smiled at
18545: her very kindly this evening, and said, “Well, Magsie, how’s aunt
18546: Moss?”
18547: 
18548: “Come, come, sir,” said Mr Glegg putting out his hand. “Why, you’re
18549: such a big man, you carry all before you, it, seems. You’re come into
18550: your luck a good deal earlier than us old folks did; but I wish you
18551: joy, I wish you joy. You’ll get the Mill all for your own again some
18552: day, I’ll be bound. You won’t stop half-way up the hill.”
18553: 
18554: “But I hope he’ll bear in mind as it’s his mother’s family as he owes
18555: it to,” said Mrs Glegg. “If he hadn’t had them to take after, he’d ha’
18556: been poorly off. There was never any failures, nor lawing, nor
18557: wastefulness in our family, nor dying without wills——”
18558: 
18559: “No, nor sudden deaths,” said aunt Pullet; “allays the doctor called
18560: in. But Tom had the Dodson skin; I said that from the first. And I
18561: don’t know what _you_ mean to do, sister Glegg, but I mean to give him
18562: a tablecloth of all my three biggest sizes but one, besides sheets. I
18563: don’t say what more I shall do; but _that_ I shall do, and if I should
18564: die to-morrow, Mr Pullet, you’ll bear it in mind,—though you’ll be
18565: blundering with the keys, and never remember as that on the third shelf
18566: o’ the left-hand wardrobe, behind the night-caps with the broad
18567: ties,—not the narrow-frilled uns,—is the key of the drawer in the Blue
18568: Room, where the key o’ the Blue Closet is. You’ll make a mistake, and I
18569: shall niver be worthy to know it. You’ve a memory for my pills and
18570: draughts, wonderful,—I’ll allays say that of you,—but you’re lost among
18571: the keys.” This gloomy prospect of the confusion that would ensue on
18572: her decease was very affecting to Mrs Pullet.
18573: 
18574: “You carry it too far, Sophy,—that locking in and out,” said Mrs Glegg,
18575: in a tone of some disgust at this folly. “You go beyond your own
18576: family. There’s nobody can say I don’t lock up; but I do what’s
18577: reasonable, and no more. And as for the linen, I shall look out what’s
18578: serviceable, to make a present of to my nephey; I’ve got cloth as has
18579: never been whitened, better worth having than other people’s fine
18580: holland; and I hope he’ll lie down in it and think of his aunt.”
18581: 
18582: Tom thanked Mrs Glegg, but evaded any promise to meditate nightly on
18583: her virtues; and Mr Glegg effected a diversion for him by asking about
18584: Mr Deane’s intentions concerning steam.
18585: 
18586: Lucy had had her far-sighted views in begging Tom to come on Sindbad.
18587: It appeared, when it was time to go home, that the man-servant was to
18588: ride the horse, and cousin Tom was to drive home his mother and Lucy.
18589: “You must sit by yourself, aunty,” said that contriving young lady,
18590: “because I must sit by Tom; I’ve a great deal to say to him.”
18591: 
18592: In the eagerness of her affectionate anxiety for Maggie, Lucy could not
18593: persuade herself to defer a conversation about her with Tom, who, she
18594: thought, with such a cup of joy before him as this rapid fulfilment of
18595: his wish about the Mill, must become pliant and flexible. Her nature
18596: supplied her with no key to Tom’s; and she was puzzled as well as
18597: pained to notice the unpleasant change on his countenance when she gave
18598: him the history of the way in which Philip had used his influence with
18599: his father. She had counted on this revelation as a great stroke of
18600: policy, which was to turn Tom’s heart toward Philip at once, and,
18601: besides that, prove that the elder Wakem was ready to receive Maggie
18602: with all the honours of a daughter-in-law. Nothing was wanted, then,
18603: but for dear Tom, who always had that pleasant smile when he looked at
18604: cousin Lucy, to turn completely round, say the opposite of what he had
18605: always said before, and declare that he, for his part, was delighted
18606: that all the old grievances should be healed, and that Maggie should
18607: have Philip with all suitable despatch; in cousin Lucy’s opinion
18608: nothing could be easier.
18609: 
18610: But to minds strongly marked by the positive and negative qualities
18611: that create severity,—strength of will, conscious rectitude of purpose,
18612: narrowness of imagination and intellect, great power of self-control,
18613: and a disposition to exert control over others,—prejudices come as the
18614: natural food of tendencies which can get no sustenance out of that
18615: complex, fragmentary, doubt-provoking knowledge which we call truth.
18616: Let a prejudice be bequeathed, carried in the air, adopted by hearsay,
18617: caught in through the eye,—however it may come, these minds will give
18618: it a habitation; it is something to assert strongly and bravely,
18619: something to fill up the void of spontaneous ideas, something to impose
18620: on others with the authority of conscious right; it is at once a staff
18621: and a baton. Every prejudice that will answer these purposes is
18622: self-evident. Our good, upright Tom Tulliver’s mind was of this class;
18623: his inward criticism of his father’s faults did not prevent him from
18624: adopting his father’s prejudice; it was a prejudice against a man of
18625: lax principle and lax life, and it was a meeting-point for all the
18626: disappointed feelings of family and personal pride. Other feelings
18627: added their force to produce Tom’s bitter repugnance to Philip, and to
18628: Maggie’s union with him; and notwithstanding Lucy’s power over her
18629: strong-willed cousin, she got nothing but a cold refusal ever to
18630: sanction such a marriage; “but of course Maggie could do as she
18631: liked,—she had declared her determination to be independent. For Tom’s
18632: part, he held himself bound by his duty to his father’s memory, and by
18633: every manly feeling, never to consent to any relation with the Wakems.”
18634: 
18635: Thus, all that Lucy had effected by her zealous mediation was to fill
18636: Tom’s mind with the expectation that Maggie’s perverse resolve to go
18637: into a situation again would presently metamorphose itself, as her
18638: resolves were apt to do, into something equally perverse, but entirely
18639: different,—a marriage with Philip Wakem.
18640: 
18641: 
18642: Chapter XIII.
18643: 
18644: Borne Along by the Tide
18645: 
18646: In less than a week Maggie was at St Ogg’s again,—outwardly in much the
18647: same position as when her visit there had just begun. It was easy for
18648: her to fill her mornings apart from Lucy without any obvious effort;
18649: for she had her promised visits to pay to her aunt Glegg, and it was
18650: natural that she should give her mother more than usual of her
18651: companionship in these last weeks, especially as there were
18652: preparations to be thought of for Tom’s housekeeping. But Lucy would
18653: hear of no pretext for her remaining away in the evenings; she must
18654: always come from aunt Glegg’s before dinner,—“else what shall I have of
18655: you?” said Lucy, with a tearful pout that could not be resisted.
18656: 
18657: And Mr Stephen Guest had unaccountably taken to dining at Mr Deane’s as
18658: often as possible, instead of avoiding that, as he used to do. At first
18659: he began his mornings with a resolution that he would not dine there,
18660: not even go in the evening, till Maggie was away. He had even devised a
18661: plan of starting off on a journey in this agreeable June weather; the
18662: headaches which he had constantly been alleging as a ground for
18663: stupidity and silence were a sufficient ostensible motive. But the
18664: journey was not taken, and by the fourth morning no distinct resolution
18665: was formed about the evenings; they were only foreseen as times when
18666: Maggie would still be present for a little while,—when one more touch,
18667: one more glance, might be snatched. For why not? There was nothing to
18668: conceal between them; they knew, they had confessed their love, and
18669: they had renounced each other; they were going to part. Honour and
18670: conscience were going to divide them; Maggie, with that appeal from her
18671: inmost soul, had decided it; but surely they might cast a lingering
18672: look at each other across the gulf, before they turned away never to
18673: look again till that strange light had forever faded out of their eyes.
18674: 
18675: Maggie, all this time, moved about with a quiescence and even torpor of
18676: manner, so contrasted with her usual fitful brightness and ardor, that
18677: Lucy would have had to seek some other cause for such a change, if she
18678: had not been convinced that the position in which Maggie stood between
18679: Philip and her brother, and the prospect of her self-imposed wearisome
18680: banishment, were quite enough to account for a large amount of
18681: depression. But under this torpor there was a fierce battle of
18682: emotions, such as Maggie in all her life of struggle had never known or
18683: foreboded; it seemed to her as if all the worst evil in her had lain in
18684: ambush till now, and had suddenly started up full-armed, with hideous,
18685: overpowering strength! There were moments in which a cruel selfishness
18686: seemed to be getting possession of her; why should not Lucy, why should
18687: not Philip, suffer? _She_ had had to suffer through many years of her
18688: life; and who had renounced anything for her? And when something like
18689: that fulness of existence—love, wealth, ease, refinement, all that her
18690: nature craved—was brought within her reach, why was she to forego it,
18691: that another might have it,—another, who perhaps needed it less? But
18692: amidst all this new passionate tumult there were the old voices making
18693: themselves heard with rising power, till, from time to time, the tumult
18694: seemed quelled. _Was_ that existence which tempted her the full
18695: existence she dreamed? Where, then, would be all the memories of early
18696: striving; all the deep pity for another’s pain, which had been nurtured
18697: in her through years of affection and hardship; all the divine
18698: presentiment of something higher than mere personal enjoyment, which
18699: had made the sacredness of life? She might as well hope to enjoy
18700: walking by maiming her feet, as hope to enjoy an existence in which she
18701: set out by maiming the faith and sympathy that were the best organs of
18702: her soul. And then, if pain were so hard to _her_, what was it to
18703: others? “Ah, God! preserve me from inflicting—give me strength to bear
18704: it.” How had she sunk into this struggle with a temptation that she
18705: would once have thought herself as secure from as from deliberate
18706: crime? When was that first hateful moment in which she had been
18707: conscious of a feeling that clashed with her truth, affection, and
18708: gratitude, and had not shaken it from her with horror, as if it had
18709: been a loathsome thing? And yet, since this strange, sweet, subduing
18710: influence did not, should not, conquer her,—since it was to remain
18711: simply her own suffering,—her mind was meeting Stephen’s in that
18712: thought of his, that they might still snatch moments of mute confession
18713: before the parting came. For was not he suffering too? She saw it
18714: daily—saw it in the sickened look of fatigue with which, as soon as he
18715: was not compelled to exert himself, he relapsed into indifference
18716: toward everything but the possibility of watching her. Could she refuse
18717: sometimes to answer that beseeching look which she felt to be following
18718: her like a low murmur of love and pain? She refused it less and less,
18719: till at last the evening for them both was sometimes made of a moment’s
18720: mutual gaze; they thought of it till it came, and when it had come,
18721: they thought of nothing else.
18722: 
18723: One other thing Stephen seemed now and then to care for, and that was
18724: to sing; it was a way of speaking to Maggie. Perhaps he was not
18725: distinctly conscious that he was impelled to it by a secret
18726: longing—running counter to all his self-confessed resolves—to deepen
18727: the hold he had on her. Watch your own speech, and notice how it is
18728: guided by your less conscious purposes, and you will understand that
18729: contradiction in Stephen.
18730: 
18731: Philip Wakem was a less frequent visitor, but he came occasionally in
18732: the evening, and it happened that he was there when Lucy said, as they
18733: sat out on the lawn, near sunset,—
18734: 
18735: “Now Maggie’s tale of visits to aunt Glegg is completed, I mean that we
18736: shall go out boating every day until she goes. She has not had half
18737: enough boating because of these tiresome visits, and she likes it
18738: better than anything. Don’t you, Maggie?”
18739: 
18740: “Better than any sort of locomotion, I hope you mean,” said Philip,
18741: smiling at Maggie, who was lolling backward in a low garden-chair;
18742: “else she will be selling her soul to that ghostly boatman who haunts
18743: the Floss, only for the sake of being drifted in a boat forever.”
18744: 
18745: “Should you like to be her boatman?” said Lucy. “Because, if you would,
18746: you can come with us and take an oar. If the Floss were but a quiet
18747: lake instead of a river, we should be independent of any gentleman, for
18748: Maggie can row splendidly. As it is, we are reduced to ask services of
18749: knights and squires, who do not seem to offer them with great
18750: alacrity.”
18751: 
18752: She looked playful reproach at Stephen, who was sauntering up and down,
18753: and was just singing in pianissimo falsetto,—
18754: 
18755:      “The thirst that from the soul doth rise
18756:      Doth ask a drink divine.”
18757: 
18758: 
18759: He took no notice, but still kept aloof; he had done so frequently
18760: during Philip’s recent visits.
18761: 
18762: “You don’t seem inclined for boating,” said Lucy, when he came to sit
18763: down by her on the bench. “Doesn’t rowing suit you now?”
18764: 
18765: “Oh, I hate a large party in a boat,” he said, almost irritably. “I’ll
18766: come when you have no one else.”
18767: 
18768: Lucy coloured, fearing that Philip would be hurt; it was quite a new
18769: thing for Stephen to speak in that way; but he had certainly not been
18770: well of late. Philip coloured too, but less from a feeling of personal
18771: offence than from a vague suspicion that Stephen’s moodiness had some
18772: relation to Maggie, who had started up from her chair as he spoke, and
18773: had walked toward the hedge of laurels to look at the descending
18774: sunlight on the river.
18775: 
18776: “As Miss Deane didn’t know she was excluding others by inviting me,”
18777: said Philip, “I am bound to resign.”
18778: 
18779: “No, indeed, you shall not,” said Lucy, much vexed. “I particularly
18780: wish for your company to-morrow. The tide will suit at half-past ten;
18781: it will be a delicious time for a couple of hours to row to Luckreth
18782: and walk back, before the sun gets too hot. And how can you object to
18783: four people in a boat?” she added, looking at Stephen.
18784: 
18785: “I don’t object to the people, but the number,” said Stephen, who had
18786: recovered himself, and was rather ashamed of his rudeness. “If I voted
18787: for a fourth at all, of course it would be you, Phil. But we won’t
18788: divide the pleasure of escorting the ladies; we’ll take it alternately.
18789: I’ll go the next day.”
18790: 
18791: This incident had the effect of drawing Philip’s attention with
18792: freshened solicitude toward Stephen and Maggie; but when they
18793: re-entered the house, music was proposed, and Mrs Tulliver and Mr Deane
18794: being occupied with cribbage, Maggie sat apart near the table where the
18795: books and work were placed, doing nothing, however, but listening
18796: abstractedly to the music. Stephen presently turned to a duet which he
18797: insisted that Lucy and Philip should sing; he had often done the same
18798: thing before; but this evening Philip thought he divined some double
18799: intention in every word and look of Stephen’s, and watched him keenly,
18800: angry with himself all the while for this clinging suspicion. For had
18801: not Maggie virtually denied any ground for his doubts on her side? And
18802: she was truth itself; it was impossible not to believe her word and
18803: glance when they had last spoken together in the garden. Stephen might
18804: be strongly fascinated by her (what was more natural?), but Philip felt
18805: himself rather base for intruding on what must be his friend’s painful
18806: secret. Still he watched. Stephen, moving away from the piano,
18807: sauntered slowly toward the table near which Maggie sat, and turned
18808: over the newspapers, apparently in mere idleness. Then he seated
18809: himself with his back to the piano, dragging a newspaper under his
18810: elbow, and thrusting his hand through his hair, as if he had been
18811: attracted by some bit of local news in the “Laceham Courier.” He was in
18812: reality looking at Maggie who had not taken the slightest notice of his
18813: approach. She had always additional strength of resistance when Philip
18814: was present, just as we can restrain our speech better in a spot that
18815: we feel to be hallowed. But at last she heard the word “dearest”
18816: uttered in the softest tone of pained entreaty, like that of a patient
18817: who asks for something that ought to have been given without asking.
18818: She had never heard that word since the moments in the lane at Basset,
18819: when it had come from Stephen again and again, almost as involuntarily
18820: as if it had been an inarticulate cry. Philip could hear no word, but
18821: he had moved to the opposite side of the piano, and could see Maggie
18822: start and blush, raise her eyes an instant toward Stephen’s face, but
18823: immediately look apprehensively toward himself. It was not evident to
18824: her that Philip had observed her; but a pang of shame, under the sense
18825: of this concealment, made her move from her chair and walk to her
18826: mother’s side to watch the game at cribbage.
18827: 
18828: Philip went home soon after in a state of hideous doubt mingled with
18829: wretched certainty. It was impossible for him now to resist the
18830: conviction that there was some mutual consciousness between Stephen and
18831: Maggie; and for half the night his irritable, susceptible nerves were
18832: pressed upon almost to frenzy by that one wretched fact; he could
18833: attempt no explanation that would reconcile it with her words and
18834: actions. When, at last, the need for belief in Maggie rose to its
18835: habitual predominance, he was not long in imagining the truth,—she was
18836: struggling, she was banishing herself; this was the clue to all he had
18837: seen since his return. But athwart that belief there came other
18838: possibilities that would not be driven out of sight. His imagination
18839: wrought out the whole story; Stephen was madly in love with her; he
18840: must have told her so; she had rejected him, and was hurrying away. But
18841: would he give her up, knowing—Philip felt the fact with heart-crushing
18842: despair—that she was made half helpless by her feeling toward him?
18843: 
18844: When the morning came, Philip was too ill to think of keeping his
18845: engagement to go in the boat. In his present agitation he could decide
18846: on nothing; he could only alternate between contradictory intentions.
18847: First, he thought he must have an interview with Maggie, and entreat
18848: her to confide in him; then, again, he distrusted his own interference.
18849: Had he not been thrusting himself on Maggie all along? She had uttered
18850: words long ago in her young ignorance; it was enough to make her hate
18851: him that these should be continually present with her as a bond. And
18852: had he any right to ask her for a revelation of feelings which she had
18853: evidently intended to withhold from him? He would not trust himself to
18854: see her, till he had assured himself that he could act from pure
18855: anxiety for her, and not from egoistic irritation. He wrote a brief
18856: note to Stephen, and sent it early by the servant, saying that he was
18857: not well enough to fulfil his engagement to Miss Deane. Would Stephen
18858: take his excuse, and fill his place?
18859: 
18860: Lucy had arranged a charming plan, which had made her quite content
18861: with Stephen’s refusal to go in the boat. She discovered that her
18862: father was to drive to Lindum this morning at ten; Lindum was the very
18863: place she wanted to go to, to make purchases,—important purchases,
18864: which must by no means be put off to another opportunity; and aunt
18865: Tulliver must go too, because she was concerned in some of the
18866: purchases.
18867: 
18868: “You will have your row in the boat just the same, you know,” she said
18869: to Maggie when they went out of the breakfast-room and upstairs
18870: together; “Philip will be here at half-past ten, and it is a delicious
18871: morning. Now don’t say a word against it, you dear dolorous thing. What
18872: is the use of my being a fairy godmother, if you set your face against
18873: all the wonders I work for you? Don’t think of awful cousin Tom; you
18874: may disobey him a little.”
18875: 
18876: Maggie did not persist in objecting. She was almost glad of the plan,
18877: for perhaps it would bring her some strength and calmness to be alone
18878: with Philip again; it was like revisiting the scene of a quieter life,
18879: in which the very struggles were repose, compared with the daily tumult
18880: of the present. She prepared herself for the boat and at half-past ten
18881: sat waiting in the drawing-room.
18882: 
18883: The ring of the door-bell was punctual, and she was thinking with
18884: half-sad, affectionate pleasure of the surprise Philip would have in
18885: finding that he was to be with her alone, when she distinguished a
18886: firm, rapid step across the hall, that was certainly not Philip’s; the
18887: door opened, and Stephen Guest entered.
18888: 
18889: In the first moment they were both too much agitated to speak; for
18890: Stephen had learned from the servant that the others were gone out.
18891: Maggie had started up and sat down again, with her heart beating
18892: violently; and Stephen, throwing down his cap and gloves, came and sat
18893: by her in silence. She thought Philip would be coming soon; and with
18894: great effort—for she trembled visibly—she rose to go to a distant
18895: chair.
18896: 
18897: “He is not coming,” said Stephen, in a low tone. “I am going in the
18898: boat.”
18899: 
18900: “Oh, we can’t go,” said Maggie, sinking into her chair again. “Lucy did
18901: not expect—she would be hurt. Why is not Philip come?”
18902: 
18903: “He is not well; he asked me to come instead.”
18904: 
18905: “Lucy is gone to Lindum,” said Maggie, taking off her bonnet with
18906: hurried, trembling fingers. “We must not go.”
18907: 
18908: “Very well,” said Stephen, dreamily, looking at her, as he rested his
18909: arm on the back of his chair. “Then we’ll stay here.”
18910: 
18911: He was looking into her deep, deep eyes, far off and mysterious at the
18912: starlit blackness, and yet very near, and timidly loving. Maggie sat
18913: perfectly still—perhaps for moments, perhaps for minutes—until the
18914: helpless trembling had ceased, and there was a warm glow on her check.
18915: 
18916: “The man is waiting; he has taken the cushions,” she said. “Will you go
18917: and tell him?”
18918: 
18919: “What shall I tell him?” said Stephen, almost in a whisper. He was
18920: looking at the lips now.
18921: 
18922: Maggie made no answer.
18923: 
18924: “Let us go,” Stephen murmured entreatingly, rising, and taking her hand
18925: to raise her too. “We shall not be long together.”
18926: 
18927: And they went. Maggie felt that she was being led down the garden among
18928: the roses, being helped with firm, tender care into the boat, having
18929: the cushion and cloak arranged for her feet, and her parasol opened for
18930: her (which she had forgotten), all by this stronger presence that
18931: seemed to bear her along without any act of her own will, like the
18932: added self which comes with the sudden exalting influence of a strong
18933: tonic, and she felt nothing else. Memory was excluded.
18934: 
18935: They glided rapidly along, Stephen rowing, helped by the
18936: backward-flowing tide, past the Tofton trees and houses; on between the
18937: silent sunny fields and pastures, which seemed filled with a natural
18938: joy that had no reproach for theirs. The breath of the young, unwearied
18939: day, the delicious rhythmic dip of the oars, the fragmentary song of a
18940: passing bird heard now and then, as if it were only the overflowing of
18941: brimful gladness, the sweet solitude of a twofold consciousness that
18942: was mingled into one by that grave, untiring gaze which need not be
18943: averted,—what else could there be in their minds for the first hour?
18944: Some low, subdued, languid exclamation of love came from Stephen from
18945: time to time, as he went on rowing idly, half automatically; otherwise
18946: they spoke no word; for what could words have been but an inlet to
18947: thought? and thought did not belong to that enchanted haze in which
18948: they were enveloped,—it belonged to the past and the future that lay
18949: outside the haze. Maggie was only dimly conscious of the banks, as they
18950: passed them, and dwelt with no recognition on the villages; she knew
18951: there were several to be passed before they reached Luckreth, where
18952: they always stopped and left the boat. At all times she was so liable
18953: to fits of absence, that she was likely enough to let her waymarks pass
18954: unnoticed.
18955: 
18956: But at last Stephen, who had been rowing more and more idly, ceased to
18957: row, laid down the oars, folded his arms, and looked down on the water
18958: as if watching the pace at which the boat glided without his help. This
18959: sudden change roused Maggie. She looked at the far-stretching fields,
18960: at the banks close by, and felt that they were entirely strange to her.
18961: A terrible alarm took possession of her.
18962: 
18963: “Oh, have we passed Luckreth, where we were to stop?” she exclaimed,
18964: looking back to see if the place were out of sight. No village was to
18965: be seen. She turned around again, with a look of distressed questioning
18966: at Stephen.
18967: 
18968: He went on watching the water, and said, in a strange, dreamy, absent
18969: tone, “Yes, a long way.”
18970: 
18971: “Oh, what shall I do?” cried Maggie, in an agony. “We shall not get
18972: home for hours, and Lucy? O God, help me!”
18973: 
18974: She clasped her hands and broke into a sob, like a frightened child;
18975: she thought of nothing but of meeting Lucy, and seeing her look of
18976: pained surprise and doubt, perhaps of just upbraiding.
18977: 
18978: Stephen moved and sat near her, and gently drew down the clasped hands.
18979: 
18980: “Maggie,” he said, in a deep tone of slow decision, “let us never go
18981: home again, till no one can part us,—till we are married.”
18982: 
18983: The unusual tone, the startling words, arrested Maggie’s sob, and she
18984: sat quite still, wondering; as if Stephen might have seen some
18985: possibilities that would alter everything, and annul the wretched
18986: facts.
18987: 
18988: “See, Maggie, how everything has come without our seeking,—in spite of
18989: all our efforts. We never thought of being alone together again; it has
18990: all been done by others. See how the tide is carrying us out, away from
18991: all those unnatural bonds that we have been trying to make faster round
18992: us, and trying in vain. It will carry us on to Torby, and we can land
18993: there, and get some carriage, and hurry on to York and then to
18994: Scotland,—and never pause a moment till we are bound to each other, so
18995: that only death can part us. It is the only right thing, dearest; it is
18996: the only way of escaping from this wretched entanglement. Everything
18997: has concurred to point it out to us. We have contrived nothing, we have
18998: thought of nothing ourselves.”
18999: 
19000: Stephen spoke with deep, earnest pleading. Maggie listened, passing
19001: from her startled wonderment to the yearning after that belief that the
19002: tide was doing it all, that she might glide along with the swift,
19003: silent stream, and not struggle any more. But across that stealing
19004: influence came the terrible shadow of past thoughts; and the sudden
19005: horror lest now, at last, the moment of fatal intoxication was close
19006: upon her, called up feelings of angry resistance toward Stephen.
19007: 
19008: “Let me go!” she said, in an agitated tone, flashing an indignant look
19009: at him, and trying to get her hands free. “You have wanted to deprive
19010: me of any choice. You knew we were come too far; you have dared to take
19011: advantage of my thoughtlessness. It is unmanly to bring me into such a
19012: position.”
19013: 
19014: Stung by this reproach, he released her hands, moved back to his former
19015: place, and folded his arms, in a sort of desperation at the difficulty
19016: Maggie’s words had made present to him. If she would not consent to go
19017: on, he must curse himself for the embarrassment he had led her into.
19018: But the reproach was the unendurable thing; the one thing worse than
19019: parting with her was, that she should feel he had acted unworthily
19020: toward her. At last he said, in a tone of suppressed rage,—
19021: 
19022: “I didn’t notice that we had passed Luckreth till we had got to the
19023: next village; and then it came into my mind that we would go on. I
19024: can’t justify it; I ought to have told you. It is enough to make you
19025: hate me, since you don’t love me well enough to make everything else
19026: indifferent to you, as I do you. Shall I stop the boat and try to get
19027: you out here? I’ll tell Lucy that I was mad, and that you hate me; and
19028: you shall be clear of me forever. No one can blame you, because I have
19029: behaved unpardonably to you.”
19030: 
19031: Maggie was paralyzed; it was easier to resist Stephen’s pleading than
19032: this picture he had called up of himself suffering while she was
19033: vindicated; easier even to turn away from his look of tenderness than
19034: from this look of angry misery, that seemed to place her in selfish
19035: isolation from him. He had called up a state of feeling in which the
19036: reasons which had acted on her conscience seemed to be transmitted into
19037: mere self-regard. The indignant fire in her eyes was quenched, and she
19038: began to look at him with timid distress. She had reproached him for
19039: being hurried into irrevocable trespass,—she, who had been so weak
19040: herself.
19041: 
19042: “As if I shouldn’t feel what happened to you—just the same,” she said,
19043: with reproach of another kind,—the reproach of love, asking for more
19044: trust. This yielding to the idea of Stephen’s suffering was more fatal
19045: than the other yielding, because it was less distinguishable from that
19046: sense of others’ claims which was the moral basis of her resistance.
19047: 
19048: He felt all the relenting in her look and tone; it was heaven opening
19049: again. He moved to her side, and took her hand, leaning his elbow on
19050: the back of the boat, and saying nothing. He dreaded to utter another
19051: word, he dreaded to make another movement, that might provoke another
19052: reproach or denial from her. Life hung on her consent; everything else
19053: was hopeless, confused, sickening misery. They glided along in this
19054: way, both resting in that silence as in a haven, both dreading lest
19055: their feelings should be divided again,—till they became aware that the
19056: clouds had gathered, and that the slightest perceptible freshening of
19057: the breeze was growing and growing, so that the whole character of the
19058: day was altered.
19059: 
19060: “You will be chill, Maggie, in this thin dress. Let me raise the cloak
19061: over your shoulders. Get up an instant, dearest.”
19062: 
19063: Maggie obeyed; there was an unspeakable charm in being told what to do,
19064: and having everything decided for her. She sat down again covered with
19065: the cloak, and Stephen took to his oars again, making haste; for they
19066: must try to get to Torby as fast as they could. Maggie was hardly
19067: conscious of having said or done anything decisive. All yielding is
19068: attended with a less vivid consciousness than resistance; it is the
19069: partial sleep of thought; it is the submergence of our own personality
19070: by another. Every influence tended to lull her into acquiescence. That
19071: dreamy gliding in the boat which had lasted for four hours, and had
19072: brought some weariness and exhaustion; the recoil of her fatigued
19073: sensations from the impracticable difficulty of getting out of the boat
19074: at this unknown distance from home, and walking for long miles,—all
19075: helped to bring her into more complete subjection to that strong,
19076: mysterious charm which made a last parting from Stephen seem the death
19077: of all joy, and made the thought of wounding him like the first touch
19078: of the torturing iron before which resolution shrank. And then there
19079: was the present happiness of being with him, which was enough to absorb
19080: all her languid energy.
19081: 
19082: Presently Stephen observed a vessel coming after them. Several vessels,
19083: among them the steamer to Mudport, had passed them with the early tide,
19084: but for the last hour they had seen none. He looked more and more
19085: eagerly at this vessel, as if a new thought had come into his mind
19086: along with it, and then he looked at Maggie hesitatingly.
19087: 
19088: “Maggie, dearest,” he said at last, “if this vessel should be going to
19089: Mudport, or to any convenient place on the coast northward, it would be
19090: our best plan to get them to take us on board. You are fatigued, and it
19091: may soon rain; it may be a wretched business, getting to Torby in this
19092: boat. It’s only a trading vessel, but I dare say you can be made
19093: tolerably comfortable. We’ll take the cushions out of the boat. It is
19094: really our best plan. They’ll be glad enough to take us. I’ve got
19095: plenty of money about me. I can pay them well.”
19096: 
19097: Maggie’s heart began to beat with reawakened alarm at this new
19098: proposition; but she was silent,—one course seemed as difficult as
19099: another.
19100: 
19101: Stephen hailed the vessel. It was a Dutch vessel going to Mudport, the
19102: English mate informed him, and, if this wind held, would be there in
19103: less than two days.
19104: 
19105: “We had got out too far with our boat,” said Stephen. “I was trying to
19106: make for Torby. But I’m afraid of the weather; and this lady—my
19107: wife—will be exhausted with fatigue and hunger. Take us on board—will
19108: you?—and haul up the boat. I’ll pay you well.”
19109: 
19110: Maggie, now really faint and trembling with fear, was taken on board,
19111: making an interesting object of contemplation to admiring Dutchmen. The
19112: mate feared the lady would have a poor time of it on board, for they
19113: had no accommodation for such entirely unlooked-for passengers,—no
19114: private cabin larger than an old-fashioned church-pew. But at least
19115: they had Dutch cleanliness, which makes all other inconveniences
19116: tolerable; and the boat cushions were spread into a couch for Maggie on
19117: the poop with all alacrity. But to pace up and down the deck leaning on
19118: Stephen—being upheld by his strength—was the first change that she
19119: needed; then came food, and then quiet reclining on the cushions, with
19120: the sense that no new resolution _could_ be taken that day. Everything
19121: must wait till to-morrow. Stephen sat beside her with her hand in his;
19122: they could only speak to each other in low tones; only look at each
19123: other now and then, for it would take a long while to dull the
19124: curiosity of the five men on board, and reduce these handsome young
19125: strangers to that minor degree of interest which belongs, in a sailor’s
19126: regard, to all objects nearer than the horizon. But Stephen was
19127: triumphantly happy. Every other thought or care was thrown into
19128: unmarked perspective by the certainty that Maggie must be his. The leap
19129: had been taken now; he had been tortured by scruples, he had fought
19130: fiercely with overmastering inclination, he had hesitated; but
19131: repentance was impossible. He murmured forth in fragmentary sentences
19132: his happiness, his adoration, his tenderness, his belief that their
19133: life together must be heaven, that her presence with him would give
19134: rapture to every common day; that to satisfy her lightest wish was
19135: dearer to him than all other bliss; that everything was easy for her
19136: sake, except to part with her; and now they never _would_ part; he
19137: would belong to her forever, and all that was his was hers,—had no
19138: value for him except as it was hers. Such things, uttered in low,
19139: broken tones by the one voice that has first stirred the fibre of young
19140: passion, have only a feeble effect—on experienced minds at a distance
19141: from them. To poor Maggie they were very near; they were like nectar
19142: held close to thirsty lips; there was, there _must_ be, then, a life
19143: for mortals here below which was not hard and chill,—in which affection
19144: would no longer be self-sacrifice. Stephen’s passionate words made the
19145: vision of such a life more fully present to her than it had ever been
19146: before; and the vision for the time excluded all realities,—all except
19147: the returning sun-gleams which broke out on the waters as the evening
19148: approached, and mingled with the visionary sunlight of promised
19149: happiness; all except the hand that pressed hers, and the voice that
19150: spoke to her, and the eyes that looked at her with grave, unspeakable
19151: love.
19152: 
19153: There was to be no rain, after all; the clouds rolled off to the
19154: horizon again, making the great purple rampart and long purple isles of
19155: that wondrous land which reveals itself to us when the sun goes
19156: down,—the land that the evening star watches over. Maggie was to sleep
19157: all night on the poop; it was better than going below; and she was
19158: covered with the warmest wrappings the ship could furnish. It was still
19159: early, when the fatigues of the day brought on a drowsy longing for
19160: perfect rest, and she laid down her head, looking at the faint, dying
19161: flush in the west, where the one golden lamp was getting brighter and
19162: brighter. Then she looked up at Stephen, who was still seated by her,
19163: hanging over her as he leaned his arm against the vessel’s side. Behind
19164: all the delicious visions of these last hours, which had flowed over
19165: her like a soft stream, and made her entirely passive, there was the
19166: dim consciousness that the condition was a transient one, and that the
19167: morrow must bring back the old life of struggle; that there were
19168: thoughts which would presently avenge themselves for this oblivion. But
19169: now nothing was distinct to her; she was being lulled to sleep with
19170: that soft stream still flowing over her, with those delicious visions
19171: melting and fading like the wondrous aerial land of the west.
19172: 
19173: 
19174: Chapter XIV.
19175: 
19176: Waking
19177: 
19178: When Maggie was gone to sleep, Stephen, weary too with his unaccustomed
19179: amount of rowing, and with the intense inward life of the last twelve
19180: hours, but too restless to sleep, walked and lounged about the deck
19181: with his cigar far on into midnight, not seeing the dark water, hardly
19182: conscious there were stars, living only in the near and distant future.
19183: At last fatigue conquered restlessness, and he rolled himself up in a
19184: piece of tarpaulin on the deck near Maggie’s feet.
19185: 
19186: She had fallen asleep before nine, and had been sleeping for six hours
19187: before the faintest hint of a midsummer daybreak was discernible. She
19188: awoke from that vivid dreaming which makes the margin of our deeper
19189: rest. She was in a boat on the wide water with Stephen, and in the
19190: gathering darkness something like a star appeared, that grew and grew
19191: till they saw it was the Virgin seated in St Ogg’s boat, and it came
19192: nearer and nearer, till they saw the Virgin was Lucy and the boatman
19193: was Philip,—no, not Philip, but her brother, who rowed past without
19194: looking at her; and she rose to stretch out her arms and call to him,
19195: and their own boat turned over with the movement, and they began to
19196: sink, till with one spasm of dread she seemed to awake, and find she
19197: was a child again in the parlour at evening twilight, and Tom was not
19198: really angry. From the soothed sense of that false waking she passed to
19199: the real waking,—to the plash of water against the vessel, and the
19200: sound of a footstep on the deck, and the awful starlit sky. There was a
19201: moment of utter bewilderment before her mind could get disentangled
19202: from the confused web of dreams; but soon the whole terrible truth
19203: urged itself upon her. Stephen was not by her now; she was alone with
19204: her own memory and her own dread. The irrevocable wrong that must blot
19205: her life had been committed; she had brought sorrow into the lives of
19206: others,—into the lives that were knit up with hers by trust and love.
19207: The feeling of a few short weeks had hurried her into the sins her
19208: nature had most recoiled from,—breach of faith and cruel selfishness;
19209: she had rent the ties that had given meaning to duty, and had made
19210: herself an outlawed soul, with no guide but the wayward choice of her
19211: own passion. And where would that lead her? Where had it led her now?
19212: She had said she would rather die than fall into that temptation. She
19213: felt it now,—now that the consequences of such a fall had come before
19214: the outward act was completed. There was at least this fruit from all
19215: her years of striving after the highest and best,—that her soul though
19216: betrayed, beguiled, ensnared, could never deliberately consent to a
19217: choice of the lower. And a choice of what? O God! not a choice of joy,
19218: but of conscious cruelty and hardness; for could she ever cease to see
19219: before her Lucy and Philip, with their murdered trust and hopes? Her
19220: life with Stephen could have no sacredness; she must forever sink and
19221: wander vaguely, driven by uncertain impulse; for she had let go the
19222: clue of life,—that clue which once in the far-off years her young need
19223: had clutched so strongly. She had renounced all delights then, before
19224: she knew them, before they had come within her reach. Philip had been
19225: right when he told her that she knew nothing of renunciation; she had
19226: thought it was quiet ecstasy; she saw it face to face now,—that sad,
19227: patient, loving strength which holds the clue of life,—and saw that the
19228: thorns were forever pressing on its brow. The yesterday, which could
19229: never be revoked,—if she could have changed it now for any length of
19230: inward silent endurance, she would have bowed beneath that cross with a
19231: sense of rest.
19232: 
19233: Day break came and the reddening eastern light, while her past life was
19234: grasping her in this way, with that tightening clutch which comes in
19235: the last moments of possible rescue. She could see Stephen now lying on
19236: the deck still fast asleep, and with the sight of him there came a wave
19237: of anguish that found its way in a long-suppressed sob. The worst
19238: bitterness of parting—the thought that urged the sharpest inward cry
19239: for help—was the pain it must give to _him_. But surmounting everything
19240: was the horror at her own possible failure, the dread lest her
19241: conscience should be benumbed again, and not rise to energy till it was
19242: too late. Too late! it was too late already not to have caused misery;
19243: too late for everything, perhaps, but to rush away from the last act of
19244: baseness,—the tasting of joys that were wrung from crushed hearts.
19245: 
19246: The sun was rising now, and Maggie started up with the sense that a day
19247: of resistance was beginning for her. Her eyelashes were still wet with
19248: tears, as, with her shawl over her head, she sat looking at the slowly
19249: rounding sun. Something roused Stephen too, and getting up from his
19250: hard bed, he came to sit beside her. The sharp instinct of anxious love
19251: saw something to give him alarm in the very first glance. He had a
19252: hovering dread of some resistance in Maggie’s nature that he would be
19253: unable to overcome. He had the uneasy consciousness that he had robbed
19254: her of perfect freedom yesterday; there was too much native honour in
19255: him, for him not to feel that, if her will should recoil, his conduct
19256: would have been odious, and she would have a right to reproach him.
19257: 
19258: But Maggie did not feel that right; she was too conscious of fatal
19259: weakness in herself, too full of the tenderness that comes with the
19260: foreseen need for inflicting a wound. She let him take her hand when he
19261: came to sit down beside her, and smiled at him, only with rather a sad
19262: glance; she could say nothing to pain him till the moment of possible
19263: parting was nearer. And so they drank their cup of coffee together, and
19264: walked about the deck, and heard the captain’s assurance that they
19265: should be in at Mudport by five o’clock, each with an inward burthen;
19266: but in him it was an undefined fear, which he trusted to the coming
19267: hours to dissipate; in her it was a definite resolve on which she was
19268: trying silently to tighten her hold. Stephen was continually, through
19269: the morning, expressing his anxiety at the fatigue and discomfort she
19270: was suffering, and alluded to landing and to the change of motion and
19271: repose she would have in a carriage, wanting to assure himself more
19272: completely by presupposing that everything would be as he had arranged
19273: it. For a long while Maggie contented herself with assuring him that
19274: she had had a good night’s rest, and that she didn’t mind about being
19275: on the vessel,—it was not like being on the open sea, it was only a
19276: little less pleasant than being in a boat on the Floss. But a
19277: suppressed resolve will betray itself in the eyes, and Stephen became
19278: more and more uneasy as the day advanced, under the sense that Maggie
19279: had entirely lost her passiveness. He longed, but did not dare, to
19280: speak of their marriage, of where they would go after it, and the steps
19281: he would take to inform his father, and the rest, of what had happened.
19282: He longed to assure himself of a tacit assent from her. But each time
19283: he looked at her, he gathered a stronger dread of the new, quiet
19284: sadness with which she met his eyes. And they were more and more
19285: silent.
19286: 
19287: “Here we are in sight of Mudport,” he said at last. “Now, dearest,” he
19288: added, turning toward her with a look that was half beseeching, “the
19289: worst part of your fatigue is over. On the land we can command
19290: swiftness. In another hour and a half we shall be in a chaise together,
19291: and that will seem rest to you after this.”
19292: 
19293: Maggie felt it was time to speak; it would only be unkind now to assent
19294: by silence. She spoke in the lowest tone, as he had done, but with
19295: distinct decision.
19296: 
19297: “We shall not be together; we shall have parted.”
19298: 
19299: The blood rushed to Stephen’s face.
19300: 
19301: “We shall not,” he said. “I’ll die first.”
19302: 
19303: It was as he had dreaded—there was a struggle coming. But neither of
19304: them dared to say another word till the boat was let down, and they
19305: were taken to the landing-place. Here there was a cluster of gazers and
19306: passengers awaiting the departure of the steamboat to St Ogg’s. Maggie
19307: had a dim sense, when she had landed, and Stephen was hurrying her
19308: along on his arm, that some one had advanced toward her from that
19309: cluster as if he were coming to speak to her. But she was hurried
19310: along, and was indifferent to everything but the coming trial.
19311: 
19312: A porter guided them to the nearest inn and posting-house, and Stephen
19313: gave the order for the chaise as they passed through the yard. Maggie
19314: took no notice of this, and only said, “Ask them to show us into a room
19315: where we can sit down.”
19316: 
19317: When they entered, Maggie did not sit down, and Stephen, whose face had
19318: a desperate determination in it, was about to ring the bell, when she
19319: said, in a firm voice,—
19320: 
19321: “I’m not going; we must part here.”
19322: 
19323: “Maggie,” he said, turning round toward her, and speaking in the tones
19324: of a man who feels a process of torture beginning, “do you mean to kill
19325: me? What is the use of it now? The whole thing is done.”
19326: 
19327: “No, it is not done,” said Maggie. “Too much is done,—more than we can
19328: ever remove the trace of. But I will go no farther. Don’t try to
19329: prevail with me again. I couldn’t choose yesterday.”
19330: 
19331: What was he to do? He dared not go near her; her anger might leap out,
19332: and make a new barrier. He walked backward and forward in maddening
19333: perplexity.
19334: 
19335: “Maggie,” he said at last, pausing before her, and speaking in a tone
19336: of imploring wretchedness, “have some pity—hear me—forgive me for what
19337: I did yesterday. I will obey you now; I will do nothing without your
19338: full consent. But don’t blight our lives forever by a rash perversity
19339: that can answer no good purpose to any one, that can only create new
19340: evils. Sit down, dearest; wait—think what you are going to do. Don’t
19341: treat me as if you couldn’t trust me.”
19342: 
19343: He had chosen the most effective appeal; but Maggie’s will was fixed
19344: unswervingly on the coming wrench. She had made up her mind to suffer.
19345: 
19346: “We must not wait,” she said, in a low but distinct voice; “we must
19347: part at once.”
19348: 
19349: “We _can’t_ part, Maggie,” said Stephen, more impetuously. “I can’t
19350: bear it. What is the use of inflicting that misery on me? The
19351: blow—whatever it may have been—has been struck now. Will it help any
19352: one else that you should drive me mad?”
19353: 
19354: “I will not begin any future, even for you,” said Maggie, tremulously,
19355: “with a deliberate consent to what ought not to have been. What I told
19356: you at Basset I feel now; I would rather have died than fall into this
19357: temptation. It would have been better if we had parted forever then.
19358: But we must part now.”
19359: 
19360: “We will _not_ part,” Stephen burst out, instinctively placing his back
19361: against the door, forgetting everything he had said a few moments
19362: before; “I will not endure it. You’ll make me desperate; I sha’n’t know
19363: what I do.”
19364: 
19365: Maggie trembled. She felt that the parting could not be effected
19366: suddenly. She must rely on a slower appeal to Stephen’s better self;
19367: she must be prepared for a harder task than that of rushing away while
19368: resolution was fresh. She sat down. Stephen, watching her with that
19369: look of desperation which had come over him like a lurid light,
19370: approached slowly from the door, seated himself close beside her, and
19371: grasped her hand. Her heart beat like the heart of a frightened bird;
19372: but this direct opposition helped her. She felt her determination
19373: growing stronger.
19374: 
19375: “Remember what you felt weeks ago,” she began, with beseeching
19376: earnestness; “remember what we both felt,—that we owed ourselves to
19377: others, and must conquer every inclination which could make us false to
19378: that debt. We have failed to keep our resolutions; but the wrong
19379: remains the same.”
19380: 
19381: “No, it does _not_ remain the same,” said Stephen. “We have proved that
19382: it was impossible to keep our resolutions. We have proved that the
19383: feeling which draws us toward each other is too strong to be overcome.
19384: That natural law surmounts every other; we can’t help what it clashes
19385: with.”
19386: 
19387: “It is not so, Stephen; I’m quite sure that is wrong. I have tried to
19388: think it again and again; but I see, if we judged in that way, there
19389: would be a warrant for all treachery and cruelty; we should justify
19390: breaking the most sacred ties that can ever be formed on earth. If the
19391: past is not to bind us, where can duty lie? We should have no law but
19392: the inclination of the moment.”
19393: 
19394: “But there are ties that can’t be kept by mere resolution,” said
19395: Stephen, starting up and walking about again. “What is outward
19396: faithfulness? Would they have thanked us for anything so hollow as
19397: constancy without love?”
19398: 
19399: Maggie did not answer immediately. She was undergoing an inward as well
19400: as an outward contest. At last she said, with a passionate assertion of
19401: her conviction, as much against herself as against him,—
19402: 
19403: “That seems right—at first; but when I look further, I’m sure it is
19404: _not_ right. Faithfulness and constancy mean something else besides
19405: doing what is easiest and pleasantest to ourselves. They mean
19406: renouncing whatever is opposed to the reliance others have in
19407: us,—whatever would cause misery to those whom the course of our lives
19408: has made dependent on us. If we—if I had been better, nobler, those
19409: claims would have been so strongly present with me,—I should have felt
19410: them pressing on my heart so continually, just as they do now in the
19411: moments when my conscience is awake,—that the opposite feeling would
19412: never have grown in me, as it has done; it would have been quenched at
19413: once, I should have prayed for help so earnestly, I should have rushed
19414: away as we rush from hideous danger. I feel no excuse for myself, none.
19415: I should never have failed toward Lucy and Philip as I have done, if I
19416: had not been weak, selfish, and hard,—able to think of their pain
19417: without a pain to myself that would have destroyed all temptation. Oh,
19418: what is Lucy feeling now? She believed in me—she loved me—she was so
19419: good to me. Think of her——”
19420: 
19421: Maggie’s voice was getting choked as she uttered these last words.
19422: 
19423: “I _can’t_ think of her,” said Stephen, stamping as if with pain. “I
19424: can think of nothing but you, Maggie. You demand of a man what is
19425: impossible. I felt that once; but I can’t go back to it now. And where
19426: is the use of _your_ thinking of it, except to torture me? You can’t
19427: save them from pain now; you can only tear yourself from me, and make
19428: my life worthless to me. And even if we could go back, and both fulfil
19429: our engagements,—if that were possible now,—it would be hateful,
19430: horrible, to think of your ever being Philip’s wife,—of your ever being
19431: the wife of a man you didn’t love. We have both been rescued from a
19432: mistake.”
19433: 
19434: A deep flush came over Maggie’s face, and she couldn’t speak. Stephen
19435: saw this. He sat down again, taking her hand in his, and looking at her
19436: with passionate entreaty.
19437: 
19438: “Maggie! Dearest! If you love me, you are mine. Who can have so great a
19439: claim on you as I have? My life is bound up in your love. There is
19440: nothing in the past that can annul our right to each other; it is the
19441: first time we have either of us loved with our whole heart and soul.”
19442: 
19443: Maggie was still silent for a little while, looking down. Stephen was
19444: in a flutter of new hope; he was going to triumph. But she raised her
19445: eyes and met his with a glance that was filled with the anguish of
19446: regret, not with yielding.
19447: 
19448: “No, not with my whole heart and soul, Stephen,” she said with timid
19449: resolution. “I have never consented to it with my whole mind. There are
19450: memories, and affections, and longings after perfect goodness, that
19451: have such a strong hold on me; they would never quit me for long; they
19452: would come back and be pain to me—repentance. I couldn’t live in peace
19453: if I put the shadow of a wilful sin between myself and God. I have
19454: caused sorrow already—I know—I feel it; but I have never deliberately
19455: consented to it; I have never said, ‘They shall suffer, that I may have
19456: joy.’ It has never been my will to marry you; if you were to win
19457: consent from the momentary triumph of my feeling for you, you would not
19458: have my whole soul. If I could wake back again into the time before
19459: yesterday, I would choose to be true to my calmer affections, and live
19460: without the joy of love.”
19461: 
19462: Stephen loosed her hand, and rising impatiently, walked up and down the
19463: room in suppressed rage.
19464: 
19465: “Good God!” he burst out at last, “what a miserable thing a woman’s
19466: love is to a man’s! I could commit crimes for you,—and you can balance
19467: and choose in that way. But you _don’t_ love me; if you had a tithe of
19468: the feeling for me that I have for you, it would be impossible to you
19469: to think for a moment of sacrificing me. But it weighs nothing with you
19470: that you are robbing me of _my_ life’s happiness.”
19471: 
19472: Maggie pressed her fingers together almost convulsively as she held
19473: them clasped on her lap. A great terror was upon her, as if she were
19474: ever and anon seeing where she stood by great flashes of lightning, and
19475: then again stretched forth her hands in the darkness.
19476: 
19477: “No, I don’t sacrifice you—I couldn’t sacrifice you,” she said, as soon
19478: as she could speak again; “but I can’t believe in a good for you, that
19479: I feel, that we both feel, is a wrong toward others. We can’t choose
19480: happiness either for ourselves or for another; we can’t tell where that
19481: will lie. We can only choose whether we will indulge ourselves in the
19482: present moment, or whether we will renounce that, for the sake of
19483: obeying the divine voice within us,—for the sake of being true to all
19484: the motives that sanctify our lives. I know this belief is hard; it has
19485: slipped away from me again and again; but I have felt that if I let it
19486: go forever, I should have no light through the darkness of this life.”
19487: 
19488: “But, Maggie,” said Stephen, seating himself by her again, “is it
19489: possible you don’t see that what happened yesterday has altered the
19490: whole position of things? What infatuation is it, what obstinate
19491: prepossession, that blinds you to that? It is too late to say what we
19492: might have done or what we ought to have done. Admitting the very worst
19493: view of what has been done, it is a fact we must act on now; our
19494: position is altered; the right course is no longer what it was before.
19495: We must accept our own actions and start afresh from them. Suppose we
19496: had been married yesterday? It is nearly the same thing. The effect on
19497: others would not have been different. It would only have made this
19498: difference to ourselves,” Stephen added bitterly, “that you might have
19499: acknowledged then that your tie to me was stronger than to others.”
19500: 
19501: Again a deep flush came over Maggie’s face, and she was silent. Stephen
19502: thought again that he was beginning to prevail,—he had never yet
19503: believed that he should _not_ prevail; there are possibilities which
19504: our minds shrink from too completely for us to fear them.
19505: 
19506: “Dearest,” he said, in his deepest, tenderest tone, leaning toward her,
19507: and putting his arm round her, “you _are_ mine now,—the world believes
19508: it; duty must spring out of that now.
19509: 
19510: “In a few hours you will be legally mine, and those who had claims on
19511: us will submit,—they will see that there was a force which declared
19512: against their claims.”
19513: 
19514: Maggie’s eyes opened wide in one terrified look at the face that was
19515: close to hers, and she started up, pale again.
19516: 
19517: “Oh, I can’t do it,” she said, in a voice almost of agony; “Stephen,
19518: don’t ask me—don’t urge me. I can’t argue any longer,—I don’t know what
19519: is wise; but my heart will not let me do it. I see,—I feel their
19520: trouble now; it is as if it were branded on my mind. _I_ have suffered,
19521: and had no one to pity me; and now I have made others suffer. It would
19522: never leave me; it would embitter your love to me. I _do_ care for
19523: Philip—in a different way; I remember all we said to each other; I know
19524: how he thought of me as the one promise of his life. He was given to me
19525: that I might make his lot less hard; and I have forsaken him. And
19526: Lucy—she has been deceived; she who trusted me more than any one. I
19527: cannot marry you; I cannot take a good for myself that has been wrung
19528: out of their misery. It is not the force that ought to rule us,—this
19529: that we feel for each other; it would rend me away from all that my
19530: past life has made dear and holy to me. I can’t set out on a fresh
19531: life, and forget that; I must go back to it, and cling to it, else I
19532: shall feel as if there were nothing firm beneath my feet.”
19533: 
19534: “Good God, Maggie!” said Stephen, rising too and grasping her arm, “you
19535: rave. How can you go back without marrying me? You don’t know what will
19536: be said, dearest. You see nothing as it really is.”
19537: 
19538: “Yes, I do. But they will believe me. I will confess everything. Lucy
19539: will believe me—she will forgive you, and—and—oh, _some_ good will come
19540: by clinging to the right. Dear, dear Stephen, let me go!—don’t drag me
19541: into deeper remorse. My whole soul has never consented; it does not
19542: consent now.”
19543: 
19544: Stephen let go her arm, and sank back on his chair, half-stunned by
19545: despairing rage. He was silent a few moments, not looking at her; while
19546: her eyes were turned toward him yearningly, in alarm at this sudden
19547: change. At last he said, still without looking at her,—
19548: 
19549: “Go, then,—leave me; don’t torture me any longer,—I can’t bear it.”
19550: 
19551: Involuntarily she leaned toward him and put out her hand to touch his.
19552: But he shrank from it as if it had been burning iron, and said again,—
19553: 
19554: “Leave me.”
19555: 
19556: Maggie was not conscious of a decision as she turned away from that
19557: gloomy averted face, and walked out of the room; it was like an
19558: automatic action that fulfils a forgotten intention. What came after? A
19559: sense of stairs descended as if in a dream, of flagstones, of a chaise
19560: and horses standing, then a street, and a turning into another street
19561: where a stage-coach was standing, taking in passengers, and the darting
19562: thought that that coach would take her away, perhaps toward home. But
19563: she could ask nothing yet; she only got into the coach.
19564: 
19565: Home—where her mother and brother were, Philip, Lucy, the scene of her
19566: very cares and trials—was the haven toward which her mind tended; the
19567: sanctuary where sacred relics lay, where she would be rescued from more
19568: falling. The thought of Stephen was like a horrible throbbing pain,
19569: which yet, as such pains do, seemed to urge all other thoughts into
19570: activity. But among her thoughts, what others would say and think of
19571: her conduct was hardly present. Love and deep pity and remorseful
19572: anguish left no room for that.
19573: 
19574: The coach was taking her to York, farther away from home; but she did
19575: not learn that until she was set down in the old city at midnight. It
19576: was no matter; she could sleep there, and start home the next day. She
19577: had her purse in her pocket, with all her money in it,—a bank-note and
19578: a sovereign; she had kept it in her pocket from forgetfulness, after
19579: going out to make purchases the day before yesterday.
19580: 
19581: Did she lie down in the gloomy bedroom of the old inn that night with
19582: her will bent unwaveringly on the path of penitent sacrifice? The great
19583: struggles of life are not so easy as that; the great problems of life
19584: are not so clear. In the darkness of that night she saw Stephen’s face
19585: turned toward her in passionate, reproachful misery; she lived through
19586: again all the tremulous delights of his presence with her that made
19587: existence an easy floating in a stream of joy, instead of a quiet
19588: resolved endurance and effort. The love she had renounced came back
19589: upon her with a cruel charm; she felt herself opening her arms to
19590: receive it once more; and then it seemed to slip away and fade and
19591: vanish, leaving only the dying sound of a deep, thrilling voice that
19592: said, “Gone, forever gone.”

19595: BOOK SEVENTH
19596: 
19597: THE FINAL RESCUE.
19598: 
19599: 
19600: Chapter I.
19601: 
19602: The Return to the Mill
19603: 
19604: Between four and five o’clock on the afternoon of the fifth day from
19605: that on which Stephen and Maggie had left St Ogg’s, Tom Tulliver was
19606: standing on the gravel walk outside the old house at Dorlcote Mill. He
19607: was master there now; he had half fulfilled his father’s dying wish,
19608: and by years of steady self-government and energetic work he had
19609: brought himself near to the attainment of more than the old
19610: respectability which had been the proud inheritance of the Dodsons and
19611: Tullivers.
19612: 
19613: But Tom’s face, as he stood in the hot, still sunshine of that summer
19614: afternoon, had no gladness, no triumph in it. His mouth wore its
19615: bitterest expression, his severe brow its hardest and deepest fold, as
19616: he drew down his hat farther over his eyes to shelter them from the
19617: sun, and thrusting his hands deep into his pockets, began to walk up
19618: and down the gravel. No news of his sister had been heard since Bob
19619: Jakin had come back in the steamer from Mudport, and put an end to all
19620: improbable suppositions of an accident on the water by stating that he
19621: had seen her land from a vessel with Mr Stephen Guest. Would the next
19622: news be that she was married,—or what? Probably that she was not
19623: married; Tom’s mind was set to the expectation of the worst that could
19624: happen,—not death, but disgrace.
19625: 
19626: As he was walking with his back toward the entrance gate, and his face
19627: toward the rushing mill-stream, a tall, dark-eyed figure, that we know
19628: well, approached the gate, and paused to look at him with a
19629: fast-beating heart. Her brother was the human being of whom she had
19630: been most afraid from her childhood upward; afraid with that fear which
19631: springs in us when we love one who is inexorable, unbending,
19632: unmodifiable, with a mind that we can never mould ourselves upon, and
19633: yet that we cannot endure to alienate from us.
19634: 
19635: That deep-rooted fear was shaking Maggie now; but her mind was
19636: unswervingly bent on returning to her brother, as the natural refuge
19637: that had been given her. In her deep humiliation under the retrospect
19638: of her own weakness,—in her anguish at the injury she had
19639: inflicted,—she almost desired to endure the severity of Tom’s reproof,
19640: to submit in patient silence to that harsh, disapproving judgment
19641: against which she had so often rebelled; it seemed no more than just to
19642: her now,—who was weaker than she was? She craved that outward help to
19643: her better purpose which would come from complete, submissive
19644: confession; from being in the presence of those whose looks and words
19645: would be a reflection of her own conscience.
19646: 
19647: Maggie had been kept on her bed at York for a day with that prostrating
19648: headache which was likely to follow on the terrible strain of the
19649: previous day and night. There was an expression of physical pain still
19650: about her brow and eyes, and her whole appearance, with her dress so
19651: long unchanged, was worn and distressed. She lifted the latch of the
19652: gate and walked in slowly. Tom did not hear the gate; he was just then
19653: close upon the roaring dam; but he presently turned, and lifting up his
19654: eyes, saw the figure whose worn look and loneliness seemed to him a
19655: confirmation of his worst conjectures. He paused, trembling and white
19656: with disgust and indignation.
19657: 
19658: Maggie paused too, three yards before him. She felt the hatred in his
19659: face, felt it rushing through her fibres; but she must speak.
19660: 
19661: “Tom,” she began faintly, “I am come back to you,—I am come back
19662: home—for refuge—to tell you everything.”
19663: 
19664: “You will find no home with me,” he answered, with tremulous rage. “You
19665: have disgraced us all. You have disgraced my father’s name. You have
19666: been a curse to your best friends. You have been base, deceitful; no
19667: motives are strong enough to restrain you. I wash my hands of you
19668: forever. You don’t belong to me.”
19669: 
19670: Their mother had come to the door now. She stood paralyzed by the
19671: double shock of seeing Maggie and hearing Tom’s words.
19672: 
19673: “Tom,” said Maggie, with more courage, “I am perhaps not so guilty as
19674: you believe me to be. I never meant to give way to my feelings. I
19675: struggled against them. I was carried too far in the boat to come back
19676: on Tuesday. I came back as soon as I could.”
19677: 
19678: “I can’t believe in you any more,” said Tom, gradually passing from the
19679: tremulous excitement of the first moment to cold inflexibility. “You
19680: have been carrying on a clandestine relation with Stephen Guest,—as you
19681: did before with another. He went to see you at my aunt Moss’s; you
19682: walked alone with him in the lanes; you must have behaved as no modest
19683: girl would have done to her cousin’s lover, else that could never have
19684: happened. The people at Luckreth saw you pass; you passed all the other
19685: places; you knew what you were doing. You have been using Philip Wakem
19686: as a screen to deceive Lucy,—the kindest friend you ever had. Go and
19687: see the return you have made her. She’s ill; unable to speak. My mother
19688: can’t go near her, lest she should remind her of you.”
19689: 
19690: Maggie was half stunned,—too heavily pressed upon by her anguish even
19691: to discern any difference between her actual guilt and her brother’s
19692: accusations, still less to vindicate herself.
19693: 
19694: “Tom,” she said, crushing her hands together under her cloak, in the
19695: effort to speak again, “whatever I have done, I repent it bitterly. I
19696: want to make amends. I will endure anything. I want to be kept from
19697: doing wrong again.”
19698: 
19699: “What _will_ keep you?” said Tom, with cruel bitterness. “Not religion;
19700: not your natural feelings of gratitude and honour. And he—he would
19701: deserve to be shot, if it were not——But you are ten times worse than he
19702: is. I loathe your character and your conduct. You struggled with your
19703: feelings, you say. Yes! _I_ have had feelings to struggle with; but I
19704: conquered them. I have had a harder life than you have had; but I have
19705: found _my_ comfort in doing my duty. But I will sanction no such
19706: character as yours; the world shall know that _I_ feel the difference
19707: between right and wrong. If you are in want, I will provide for you;
19708: let my mother know. But you shall not come under my roof. It is enough
19709: that I have to bear the thought of your disgrace; the sight of you is
19710: hateful to me.”
19711: 
19712: Slowly Maggie was turning away with despair in her heart. But the poor
19713: frightened mother’s love leaped out now, stronger than all dread.
19714: 
19715: “My child! I’ll go with you. You’ve got a mother.”
19716: 
19717: Oh, the sweet rest of that embrace to the heart-stricken Maggie! More
19718: helpful than all wisdom is one draught of simple human pity that will
19719: not forsake us.
19720: 
19721: Tom turned and walked into the house.
19722: 
19723: “Come in, my child,” Mrs Tulliver whispered. “He’ll let you stay and
19724: sleep in my bed. He won’t deny that if I ask him.”
19725: 
19726: “No, mother,” said Maggie, in a low tone, like a moan. “I will never go
19727: in.”
19728: 
19729: “Then wait for me outside. I’ll get ready and come with you.”
19730: 
19731: When his mother appeared with her bonnet on, Tom came out to her in the
19732: passage, and put money into her hands.
19733: 
19734: “My house is yours, mother, always,” he said. “You will come and let me
19735: know everything you want; you will come back to me.”
19736: 
19737: Poor Mrs Tulliver took the money, too frightened to say anything. The
19738: only thing clear to her was the mother’s instinct that she would go
19739: with her unhappy child.
19740: 
19741: Maggie was waiting outside the gate; she took her mother’s hand and
19742: they walked a little way in silence.
19743: 
19744: “Mother,” said Maggie, at last, “we will go to Luke’s cottage. Luke
19745: will take me in. He was very good to me when I was a little girl.”
19746: 
19747: “He’s got no room for us, my dear, now; his wife’s got so many
19748: children. I don’t know where to go, if it isn’t to one o’ your aunts;
19749: and I hardly durst,” said poor Mrs Tulliver, quite destitute of mental
19750: resources in this extremity.
19751: 
19752: Maggie was silent a little while, and then said,—
19753: 
19754: “Let us go to Bob Jakin’s, mother; his wife will have room for us, if
19755: they have no other lodger.”
19756: 
19757: So they went on their way to St Ogg’s, to the old house by the
19758: river-side.
19759: 
19760: Bob himself was at home, with a heaviness at heart which resisted even
19761: the new joy and pride of possessing a two-months’-old baby, quite the
19762: liveliest of its age that had ever been born to prince or packman. He
19763: would perhaps not so thoroughly have understood all the dubiousness of
19764: Maggie’s appearance with Mr Stephen Guest on the quay at Mudport if he
19765: had not witnessed the effect it produced on Tom when he went to report
19766: it; and since then, the circumstances which in any case gave a
19767: disastrous character to her elopement had passed beyond the more polite
19768: circles of St Ogg’s, and had become matter of common talk, accessible
19769: to the grooms and errand-boys. So that when he opened the door and saw
19770: Maggie standing before him in her sorrow and weariness, he had no
19771: questions to ask except one which he dared only ask himself,—where was
19772: Mr Stephen Guest? Bob, for his part, hoped he might be in the warmest
19773: department of an asylum understood to exist in the other world for
19774: gentlemen who are likely to be in fallen circumstances there.
19775: 
19776: The lodgings were vacant, and both Mrs Jakin the larger and Mrs Jakin
19777: the less were commanded to make all things comfortable for “the old
19778: Missis and the young Miss”; alas that she was still “Miss!” The
19779: ingenious Bob was sorely perplexed as to how this result could have
19780: come about; how Mr Stephen Guest could have gone away from her, or
19781: could have let her go away from him, when he had the chance of keeping
19782: her with him. But he was silent, and would not allow his wife to ask
19783: him a question; would not present himself in the room, lest it should
19784: appear like intrusion and a wish to pry; having the same chivalry
19785: toward dark-eyed Maggie as in the days when he had bought her the
19786: memorable present of books.
19787: 
19788: But after a day or two Mrs Tulliver was gone to the Mill again for a
19789: few hours to see to Tom’s household matters. Maggie had wished this;
19790: after the first violent outburst of feeling which came as soon as she
19791: had no longer any active purpose to fulfil, she was less in need of her
19792: mother’s presence; she even desired to be alone with her grief. But she
19793: had been solitary only a little while in the old sitting-room that
19794: looked on the river, when there came a tap at the door, and turning
19795: round her sad face as she said “Come in,” she saw Bob enter, with the
19796: baby in his arms and Mumps at his heels.
19797: 
19798: “We’ll go back, if it disturbs you, Miss,” said Bob.
19799: 
19800: “No,” said Maggie, in a low voice, wishing she could smile.
19801: 
19802: Bob, closing the door behind him, came and stood before her.
19803: 
19804: “You see, we’ve got a little un, Miss, and I want’d you to look at it,
19805: and take it in your arms, if you’d be so good. For we made free to name
19806: it after you, and it ’ud be better for your takin’ a bit o’ notice on
19807: it.”
19808: 
19809: Maggie could not speak, but she put out her arms to receive the tiny
19810: baby, while Mumps snuffed at it anxiously, to ascertain that this
19811: transference was all right. Maggie’s heart had swelled at this action
19812: and speech of Bob’s; she knew well enough that it was a way he had
19813: chosen to show his sympathy and respect.
19814: 
19815: “Sit down, Bob,” she said presently, and he sat down in silence,
19816: finding his tongue unmanageable in quite a new fashion, refusing to say
19817: what he wanted it to say.
19818: 
19819: “Bob,” she said, after a few moments, looking down at the baby, and
19820: holding it anxiously, as if she feared it might slip from her mind and
19821: her fingers, “I have a favour to ask of you.”
19822: 
19823: “Don’t you speak so, Miss,” said Bob, grasping the skin of Mumps’s
19824: neck; “if there’s anything I can do for you, I should look upon it as a
19825: day’s earnings.”
19826: 
19827: “I want you to go to Dr Kenn’s, and ask to speak to him, and tell him
19828: that I am here, and should be very grateful if he would come to me
19829: while my mother is away. She will not come back till evening.”
19830: 
19831: “Eh, Miss, I’d do it in a minute,—it is but a step,—but Dr Kenn’s wife
19832: lies dead; she’s to be buried to-morrow; died the day I come from
19833: Mudport. It’s all the more pity she should ha’ died just now, if you
19834: want him. I hardly like to go a-nigh him yet.”
19835: 
19836: “Oh no, Bob,” said Maggie, “we must let it be,—till after a few days,
19837: perhaps, when you hear that he is going about again. But perhaps he may
19838: be going out of town—to a distance,” she added, with a new sense of
19839: despondency at this idea.
19840: 
19841: “Not he, Miss,” said Bob. “_He’ll_ none go away. He isn’t one o’ them
19842: gentlefolks as go to cry at waterin’-places when their wives die; he’s
19843: got summat else to do. He looks fine and sharp after the parish, he
19844: does. He christened the little un; an’ he was _at_ me to know what I
19845: did of a Sunday, as I didn’t come to church. But I told him I was upo’
19846: the travel three parts o’ the Sundays,—an’ then I’m so used to bein’ on
19847: my legs, I can’t sit so long on end,—‘an’ lors, sir,’ says I, ‘a
19848: packman can do wi’ a small ’lowance o’ church; it tastes strong,’ says
19849: I; ‘there’s no call to lay it on thick.’ Eh, Miss, how good the little
19850: un is wi’ you! It’s like as if it knowed you; it partly does, I’ll be
19851: bound,—like the birds know the mornin’.”
19852: 
19853: Bob’s tongue was now evidently loosed from its unwonted bondage, and
19854: might even be in danger of doing more work than was required of it. But
19855: the subjects on which he longed to be informed were so steep and
19856: difficult of approach, that his tongue was likely to run on along the
19857: level rather than to carry him on that unbeaten road. He felt this, and
19858: was silent again for a little while, ruminating much on the possible
19859: forms in which he might put a question. At last he said, in a more
19860: timid voice than usual,—
19861: 
19862: “Will you give me leave to ask you only one thing, Miss?”
19863: 
19864: Maggie was rather startled, but she answered, “Yes, Bob, if it is about
19865: myself—not about any one else.”
19866: 
19867: “Well, Miss, it’s this. _Do_ you owe anybody a grudge?”
19868: 
19869: “No, not any one,” said Maggie, looking up at him inquiringly. “Why?”
19870: 
19871: “Oh, lors, Miss,” said Bob, pinching Mumps’s neck harder than ever. “I
19872: wish you did, an’ tell me; I’d leather him till I couldn’t see—I
19873: would—an’ the Justice might do what he liked to me arter.”
19874: 
19875: “Oh, Bob,” said Maggie, smiling faintly, “you’re a very good friend to
19876: me. But I shouldn’t like to punish any one, even if they’d done me
19877: wrong; I’ve done wrong myself too often.”
19878: 
19879: This view of things was puzzling to Bob, and threw more obscurity than
19880: ever over what could possibly have happened between Stephen and Maggie.
19881: But further questions would have been too intrusive, even if he could
19882: have framed them suitably, and he was obliged to carry baby away again
19883: to an expectant mother.
19884: 
19885: “Happen you’d like Mumps for company, Miss,” he said when he had taken
19886: the baby again. “He’s rare company, Mumps is; he knows iverything, an’
19887: makes no bother about it. If I tell him, he’ll lie before you an’ watch
19888: you, as still,—just as he watches my pack. You’d better let me leave
19889: him a bit; he’ll get fond on you. Lors, it’s a fine thing to hev a dumb
19890: brute fond on you; it’ll stick to you, an’ make no jaw.”
19891: 
19892: “Yes, do leave him, please,” said Maggie. “I think I should like to
19893: have Mumps for a friend.”
19894: 
19895: “Mumps, lie down there,” said Bob, pointing to a place in front of
19896: Maggie, “and niver do you stir till you’re spoke to.”
19897: 
19898: Mumps lay down at once, and made no sign of restlessness when his
19899: master left the room.
19900: 
19901: 
19902: Chapter II.
19903: 
19904: St Ogg’s Passes Judgment
19905: 
19906: It was soon known throughout St Ogg’s that Miss Tulliver was come back;
19907: she had not, then, eloped in order to be married to Mr Stephen
19908: Guest,—at all events, Mr Stephen Guest had not married her; which came
19909: to the same thing, so far as her culpability was concerned. We judge
19910: others according to results; how else?—not knowing the process by which
19911: results are arrived at. If Miss Tulliver, after a few months of
19912: well-chosen travel, had returned as Mrs Stephen Guest, with a
19913: post-marital _trousseau_, and all the advantages possessed even by the
19914: most unwelcome wife of an only son, public opinion, which at St Ogg’s,
19915: as else where, always knew what to think, would have judged in strict
19916: consistency with those results. Public opinion, in these cases, is
19917: always of the feminine gender,—not the world, but the world’s wife; and
19918: she would have seen that two handsome young people—the gentleman of
19919: quite the first family in St Ogg’s—having found themselves in a false
19920: position, had been led into a course which, to say the least of it, was
19921: highly injudicious, and productive of sad pain and disappointment,
19922: especially to that sweet young thing, Miss Deane. Mr Stephen Guest had
19923: certainly not behaved well; but then, young men were liable to those
19924: sudden infatuated attachments; and bad as it might seem in Mrs Stephen
19925: Guest to admit the faintest advances from her cousin’s lover (indeed it
19926: _had_ been said that she was actually engaged to young Wakem,—old Wakem
19927: himself had mentioned it), still, she was very young,—“and a deformed
19928: young man, you know!—and young Guest so very fascinating; and, they
19929: say, he positively worships her (to be sure, that can’t last!), and he
19930: ran away with her in the boat quite against her will, and what could
19931: she do? She couldn’t come back then; no one would have spoken to her;
19932: and how very well that maize-coloured satinette becomes her complexion!
19933: It seems as if the folds in front were quite come in; several of her
19934: dresses are made so,—they say he thinks nothing too handsome to buy for
19935: her. Poor Miss Deane! She is very pitiable; but then there was no
19936: positive engagement; and the air at the coast will do her good. After
19937: all, if young Guest felt no more for her than _that_ it was better for
19938: her not to marry him. What a wonderful marriage for a girl like Miss
19939: Tulliver,—quite romantic? Why, young Guest will put up for the borough
19940: at the next election. Nothing like commerce nowadays! That young Wakem
19941: nearly went out of his mind; he always _was_ rather queer; but he’s
19942: gone abroad again to be out of the way,—quite the best thing for a
19943: deformed young man. Miss Unit declares she will never visit Mr and Mrs
19944: Stephen Guest,—such nonsense! pretending to be better than other
19945: people. Society couldn’t be carried on if we inquired into private
19946: conduct in that way,—and Christianity tells us to think no evil,—and my
19947: belief is, that Miss Unit had no cards sent her.”
19948: 
19949: But the results, we know, were not of a kind to warrant this
19950: extenuation of the past. Maggie had returned without a _trousseau_,
19951: without a husband,—in that degraded and outcast condition to which
19952: error is well known to lead; and the world’s wife, with that fine
19953: instinct which is given her for the preservation of Society, saw at
19954: once that Miss Tulliver’s conduct had been of the most aggravated kind.
19955: Could anything be more detestable? A girl so much indebted to her
19956: friends—whose mother as well as herself had received so much kindness
19957: from the Deanes—to lay the design of winning a young man’s affections
19958: away from her own cousin, who had behaved like a sister to her! Winning
19959: his affections? That was not the phrase for such a girl as Miss
19960: Tulliver; it would have been more correct to say that she had been
19961: actuated by mere unwomanly boldness and unbridled passion. There was
19962: always something questionable about her. That connection with young
19963: Wakem, which, they said, had been carried on for years, looked very
19964: ill,—disgusting, in fact! But with a girl of that disposition! To the
19965: world’s wife there had always been something in Miss Tulliver’s very
19966: _physique_ that a refined instinct felt to be prophetic of harm. As for
19967: poor Mr Stephen Guest, he was rather pitiable than otherwise; a young
19968: man of five-and-twenty is not to be too severely judged in these
19969: cases,—he is really very much at the mercy of a designing, bold girl.
19970: And it was clear that he had given way in spite of himself: he had
19971: shaken her off as soon as he could; indeed, their having parted so soon
19972: looked very black indeed—_for her_. To be sure, he had written a
19973: letter, laying all the blame on himself, and telling the story in a
19974: romantic fashion so as to try and make her appear quite innocent; of
19975: course he would do that! But the refined instinct of the world’s wife
19976: was not to be deceived; providentially!—else what would become of
19977: Society? Why, her own brother had turned her from his door; he had seen
19978: enough, you might be sure, before he would do that. A truly respectable
19979: young man, Mr Tom Tulliver; quite likely to rise in the world! His
19980: sister’s disgrace was naturally a heavy blow to him. It was to be hoped
19981: that she would go out of the neighbourhood,—to America, or anywhere,—so
19982: as to purify the air of St Ogg’s from the stain of her presence,
19983: extremely dangerous to daughters there! No good could happen to her; it
19984: was only to be hoped she would repent, and that God would have mercy on
19985: her: He had not the care of society on His hands, as the world’s wife
19986: had.
19987: 
19988: It required nearly a fortnight for fine instinct to assure itself of
19989: these inspirations; indeed, it was a whole week before Stephen’s letter
19990: came, telling his father the facts, and adding that he was gone across
19991: to Holland,—had drawn upon the agent at Mudport for money,—was
19992: incapable of any resolution at present.
19993: 
19994: Maggie, all this while, was too entirely filled with a more agonizing
19995: anxiety to spend any thought on the view that was being taken of her
19996: conduct by the world of St Ogg’s; anxiety about Stephen, Lucy, Philip,
19997: beat on her poor heart in a hard, driving, ceaseless storm of mingled
19998: love, remorse, and pity. If she had thought of rejection and injustice
19999: at all, it would have seemed to her that they had done their worst;
20000: that she could hardly feel any stroke from them intolerable since the
20001: words she had heard from her brother’s lips. Across all her anxiety for
20002: the loved and the injured, those words shot again and again, like a
20003: horrible pang that would have brought misery and dread even into a
20004: heaven of delights. The idea of ever recovering happiness never
20005: glimmered in her mind for a moment; it seemed as if every sensitive
20006: fibre in her were too entirely preoccupied by pain ever to vibrate
20007: again to another influence. Life stretched before her as one act of
20008: penitence; and all she craved, as she dwelt on her future lot, was
20009: something to guarantee her from more falling; her own weakness haunted
20010: her like a vision of hideous possibilities, that made no peace
20011: conceivable except such as lay in the sense of a sure refuge.
20012: 
20013: But she was not without practical intentions; the love of independence
20014: was too strong an inheritance and a habit for her not to remember that
20015: she must get her bread; and when other projects looked vague, she fell
20016: back on that of returning to her plain sewing, and so getting enough to
20017: pay for her lodging at Bob’s. She meant to persuade her mother to
20018: return to the Mill by and by, and live with Tom again; and somehow or
20019: other she would maintain herself at St Ogg’s. Dr Kenn would perhaps
20020: help her and advise her. She remembered his parting words at the
20021: bazaar. She remembered the momentary feeling of reliance that had
20022: sprung in her when he was talking with her, and she waited with
20023: yearning expectation for the opportunity of confiding everything to
20024: him. Her mother called every day at Mr Deane’s to learn how Lucy was;
20025: the report was always sad,—nothing had yet roused her from the feeble
20026: passivity which had come on with the first shock. But of Philip, Mrs
20027: Tulliver had learned nothing; naturally, no one whom she met would
20028: speak to her about what related to her daughter. But at last she
20029: summoned courage to go and see sister Glegg, who of course would know
20030: everything, and had been even to see Tom at the Mill in Mrs Tulliver’s
20031: absence, though he had said nothing of what had passed on the occasion.
20032: 
20033: As soon as her mother was gone, Maggie put on her bonnet. She had
20034: resolved on walking to the Rectory and asking to see Dr Kenn; he was in
20035: deep grief, but the grief of another does not jar upon us in such
20036: circumstances. It was the first time she had been beyond the door since
20037: her return; nevertheless her mind was so bent on the purpose of her
20038: walk, that the unpleasantness of meeting people on the way, and being
20039: stared at, did not occur to her. But she had no sooner passed beyond
20040: the narrower streets which she had to thread from Bob’s dwelling, than
20041: she became aware of unusual glances cast at her; and this consciousness
20042: made her hurry along nervously, afraid to look to right or left.
20043: Presently, however, she came full on Mrs and Miss Turnbull, old
20044: acquaintances of her family; they both looked at her strangely, and
20045: turned a little aside without speaking. All hard looks were pain to
20046: Maggie, but her self-reproach was too strong for resentment. No wonder
20047: they will not speak to me, she thought; they are very fond of Lucy. But
20048: now she knew that she was about to pass a group of gentlemen, who were
20049: standing at the door of the billiard-rooms, and she could not help
20050: seeing young Torry step out a little with his glass at his eye, and bow
20051: to her with that air of _nonchalance_ which he might have bestowed on a
20052: friendly barmaid.
20053: 
20054: Maggie’s pride was too intense for her not to feel that sting, even in
20055: the midst of her sorrow; and for the first time the thought took strong
20056: hold of her that she would have other obloquy cast on her besides that
20057: which was felt to be due to her breach of faith toward Lucy. But she
20058: was at the Rectory now; there, perhaps, she would find something else
20059: than retribution. Retribution may come from any voice; the hardest,
20060: cruelest, most imbruted urchin at the street-corner can inflict it;
20061: surely help and pity are rarer things, more needful for the righteous
20062: to bestow.
20063: 
20064: She was shown up at once, after being announced, into Dr Kenn’s study,
20065: where he sat amongst piled-up books, for which he had little appetite,
20066: leaning his cheek against the head of his youngest child, a girl of
20067: three. The child was sent away with the servant, and when the door was
20068: closed, Dr Kenn said, placing a chair for Maggie,—
20069: 
20070: “I was coming to see you, Miss Tulliver; you have anticipated me; I am
20071: glad you did.”
20072: 
20073: Maggie looked at him with her childlike directness as she had done at
20074: the bazaar, and said, “I want to tell you everything.” But her eyes
20075: filled fast with tears as she said it, and all the pent-up excitement
20076: of her humiliating walk would have its vent before she could say more.
20077: 
20078: “Do tell me everything,” Dr Kenn said, with quiet kindness in his
20079: grave, firm voice. “Think of me as one to whom a long experience has
20080: been granted, which may enable him to help you.”
20081: 
20082: In rather broken sentences, and with some effort at first, but soon
20083: with the greater ease that came from a sense of relief in the
20084: confidence, Maggie told the brief story of a struggle that must be the
20085: beginning of a long sorrow. Only the day before, Dr Kenn had been made
20086: acquainted with the contents of Stephen’s letter, and he had believed
20087: them at once, without the confirmation of Maggie’s statement. That
20088: involuntary plaint of hers, “_Oh, I must go_,” had remained with him as
20089: the sign that she was undergoing some inward conflict.
20090: 
20091: Maggie dwelt the longest on the feeling which had made her come back to
20092: her mother and brother, which made her cling to all the memories of the
20093: past. When she had ended, Dr Kenn was silent for some minutes; there
20094: was a difficulty on his mind. He rose, and walked up and down the
20095: hearth with his hands behind him. At last he seated himself again, and
20096: said, looking at Maggie,—
20097: 
20098: “Your prompting to go to your nearest friends,—to remain where all the
20099: ties of your life have been formed,—is a true prompting, to which the
20100: Church in its original constitution and discipline responds, opening
20101: its arms to the penitent, watching over its children to the last; never
20102: abandoning them until they are hopelessly reprobate. And the Church
20103: ought to represent the feeling of the community, so that every parish
20104: should be a family knit together by Christian brotherhood under a
20105: spiritual father. But the ideas of discipline and Christian fraternity
20106: are entirely relaxed,—they can hardly be said to exist in the public
20107: mind; they hardly survive except in the partial, contradictory form
20108: they have taken in the narrow communities of schismatics; and if I were
20109: not supported by the firm faith that the Church must ultimately recover
20110: the full force of that constitution which is alone fitted to human
20111: needs, I should often lose heart at observing the want of fellowship
20112: and sense of mutual responsibility among my own flock. At present
20113: everything seems tending toward the relaxation of ties,—toward the
20114: substitution of wayward choice for the adherence to obligation, which
20115: has its roots in the past. Your conscience and your heart have given
20116: you true light on this point, Miss Tulliver; and I have said all this
20117: that you may know what my wish about you—what my advice to you—would
20118: be, if they sprang from my own feeling and opinion unmodified by
20119: counteracting circumstances.”
20120: 
20121: Dr Kenn paused a little while. There was an entire absence of effusive
20122: benevolence in his manner; there was something almost cold in the
20123: gravity of his look and voice. If Maggie had not known that his
20124: benevolence was persevering in proportion to its reserve, she might
20125: have been chilled and frightened. As it was, she listened expectantly,
20126: quite sure that there would be some effective help in his words. He
20127: went on.
20128: 
20129: “Your inexperience of the world, Miss Tulliver, prevents you from
20130: anticipating fully the very unjust conceptions that will probably be
20131: formed concerning your conduct,—conceptions which will have a baneful
20132: effect, even in spite of known evidence to disprove them.”
20133: 
20134: “Oh, I do,—I begin to see,” said Maggie, unable to repress this
20135: utterance of her recent pain. “I know I shall be insulted. I shall be
20136: thought worse than I am.”
20137: 
20138: “You perhaps do not yet know,” said Dr Kenn, with a touch of more
20139: personal pity, “that a letter is come which ought to satisfy every one
20140: who has known anything of you, that you chose the steep and difficult
20141: path of a return to the right, at the moment when that return was most
20142: of all difficult.”
20143: 
20144: “Oh, where is he?” said poor Maggie, with a flush and tremor that no
20145: presence could have hindered.
20146: 
20147: “He is gone abroad; he has written of all that passed to his father. He
20148: has vindicated you to the utmost; and I hope the communication of that
20149: letter to your cousin will have a beneficial effect on her.”
20150: 
20151: Dr Kenn waited for her to get calm again before he went on.
20152: 
20153: “That letter, as I said, ought to suffice to prevent false impressions
20154: concerning you. But I am bound to tell you, Miss Tulliver, that not
20155: only the experience of my whole life, but my observation within the
20156: last three days, makes me fear that there is hardly any evidence which
20157: will save you from the painful effect of false imputations. The persons
20158: who are the most incapable of a conscientious struggle such as yours
20159: are precisely those who will be likely to shrink from you, because they
20160: will not believe in your struggle. I fear your life here will be
20161: attended not only with much pain, but with many obstructions. For this
20162: reason—and for this only—I ask you to consider whether it will not
20163: perhaps be better for you to take a situation at a distance, according
20164: to your former intention. I will exert myself at once to obtain one for
20165: you.”
20166: 
20167: “Oh, if I could but stop here!” said Maggie. “I have no heart to begin
20168: a strange life again. I should have no stay. I should feel like a
20169: lonely wanderer, cut off from the past. I have written to the lady who
20170: offered me a situation to excuse myself. If I remained here, I could
20171: perhaps atone in some way to Lucy—to others; I could convince them that
20172: I’m sorry. And,” she added, with some of the old proud fire flashing
20173: out, “I will not go away because people say false things of me. They
20174: shall learn to retract them. If I must go away at last, because—because
20175: others wish it, I will not go now.”
20176: 
20177: “Well,” said Dr Kenn, after some consideration, “if you determine on
20178: that, Miss Tulliver, you may rely on all the influence my position
20179: gives me. I am bound to aid and countenance you by the very duties of
20180: my office as a parish priest. I will add, that personally I have a deep
20181: interest in your peace of mind and welfare.”
20182: 
20183: “The only thing I want is some occupation that will enable me to get my
20184: bread and be independent,” said Maggie. “I shall not want much. I can
20185: go on lodging where I am.”
20186: 
20187: “I must think over the subject maturely,” said Dr Kenn, “and in a few
20188: days I shall be better able to ascertain the general feeling. I shall
20189: come to see you; I shall bear you constantly in mind.”
20190: 
20191: When Maggie had left him, Dr Kenn stood ruminating with his hands
20192: behind him, and his eyes fixed on the carpet, under a painful sense of
20193: doubt and difficulty. The tone of Stephen’s letter, which he had read,
20194: and the actual relations of all the persons concerned, forced upon him
20195: powerfully the idea of an ultimate marriage between Stephen and Maggie
20196: as the least evil; and the impossibility of their proximity in St Ogg’s
20197: on any other supposition, until after years of separation, threw an
20198: insurmountable prospective difficulty over Maggie’s stay there. On the
20199: other hand, he entered with all the comprehension of a man who had
20200: known spiritual conflict, and lived through years of devoted service to
20201: his fellow-men, into that state of Maggie’s heart and conscience which
20202: made the consent to the marriage a desecration to her; her conscience
20203: must not be tampered with; the principle on which she had acted was a
20204: safer guide than any balancing of consequences. His experience told him
20205: that intervention was too dubious a responsibility to be lightly
20206: incurred; the possible issue either of an endeavor to restore the
20207: former relations with Lucy and Philip, or of counselling submission to
20208: this irruption of a new feeling, was hidden in a darkness all the more
20209: impenetrable because each immediate step was clogged with evil.
20210: 
20211: The great problem of the shifting relation between passion and duty is
20212: clear to no man who is capable of apprehending it; the question whether
20213: the moment has come in which a man has fallen below the possibility of
20214: a renunciation that will carry any efficacy, and must accept the sway
20215: of a passion against which he had struggled as a trespass, is one for
20216: which we have no master-key that will fit all cases. The casuists have
20217: become a byword of reproach; but their perverted spirit of minute
20218: discrimination was the shadow of a truth to which eyes and hearts are
20219: too often fatally sealed,—the truth, that moral judgments must remain
20220: false and hollow, unless they are checked and enlightened by a
20221: perpetual reference to the special circumstances that mark the
20222: individual lot.
20223: 
20224: All people of broad, strong sense have an instinctive repugnance to the
20225: men of maxims; because such people early discern that the mysterious
20226: complexity of our life is not to be embraced by maxims, and that to
20227: lace ourselves up in formulas of that sort is to repress all the divine
20228: promptings and inspirations that spring from growing insight and
20229: sympathy. And the man of maxims is the popular representative of the
20230: minds that are guided in their moral judgment solely by general rules,
20231: thinking that these will lead them to justice by a ready-made patent
20232: method, without the trouble of exerting patience, discrimination,
20233: impartiality,—without any care to assure themselves whether they have
20234: the insight that comes from a hardly earned estimate of temptation, or
20235: from a life vivid and intense enough to have created a wide
20236: fellow-feeling with all that is human.
20237: 
20238: 
20239: Chapter III.
20240: 
20241: Showing That Old Acquaintances Are Capable of Surprising Us
20242: 
20243: When Maggie was at home again, her mother brought her news of an
20244: unexpected line of conduct in aunt Glegg. As long as Maggie had not
20245: been heard of, Mrs Glegg had half closed her shutters and drawn down
20246: her blinds. She felt assured that Maggie was drowned; that was far more
20247: probable than that her niece and legatee should have done anything to
20248: wound the family honour in the tenderest point. When at last she
20249: learned from Tom that Maggie had come home, and gathered from him what
20250: was her explanation of her absence, she burst forth in severe reproof
20251: of Tom for admitting the worst of his sister until he was compelled. If
20252: you were not to stand by your “kin” as long as there was a shred of
20253: honour attributable to them, pray what were you to stand by? Lightly to
20254: admit conduct in one of your own family that would force you to alter
20255: your will, had never been the way of the Dodsons; and though Mrs Glegg
20256: had always augured ill of Maggie’s future at a time when other people
20257: were perhaps less clear-sighted, yet fair play was a jewel, and it was
20258: not for her own friends to help to rob the girl of her fair fame, and
20259: to cast her out from family shelter to the scorn of the outer world,
20260: until she had become unequivocally a family disgrace. The circumstances
20261: were unprecedented in Mrs Glegg’s experience; nothing of that kind had
20262: happened among the Dodsons before; but it was a case in which her
20263: hereditary rectitude and personal strength of character found a common
20264: channel along with her fundamental ideas of clanship, as they did in
20265: her lifelong regard to equity in money matters. She quarrelled with Mr
20266: Glegg, whose kindness, flowing entirely into compassion for Lucy, made
20267: him as hard in his judgment of Maggie as Mr Deane himself was; and
20268: fuming against her sister Tulliver because she did not at once come to
20269: her for advice and help, shut herself up in her own room with Baxter’s
20270: “Saints’ Rest” from morning till night, denying herself to all
20271: visitors, till Mr Glegg brought from Mr Deane the news of Stephen’s
20272: letter. Then Mrs Glegg felt that she had adequate fighting-ground; then
20273: she laid aside Baxter, and was ready to meet all comers. While Mrs
20274: Pullet could do nothing but shake her head and cry, and wish that
20275: cousin Abbot had died, or any number of funerals had happened rather
20276: than this, which had never happened before, so that there was no
20277: knowing how to act, and Mrs Pullet could never enter St Ogg’s again,
20278: because “acquaintances” knew of it all, Mrs Glegg only hoped that Mrs
20279: Wooll, or any one else, would come to her with their false tales about
20280: her own niece, and she would know what to say to that ill-advised
20281: person!
20282: 
20283: Again she had a scene of remonstrance with Tom, all the more severe in
20284: proportion to the greater strength of her present position. But Tom,
20285: like other immovable things, seemed only the more rigidly fixed under
20286: that attempt to shake him. Poor Tom! he judged by what he had been able
20287: to see; and the judgment was painful enough to himself. He thought he
20288: had the demonstration of facts observed through years by his own eyes,
20289: which gave no warning of their imperfection, that Maggie’s nature was
20290: utterly untrustworthy, and too strongly marked with evil tendencies to
20291: be safely treated with leniency. He would act on that demonstration at
20292: any cost; but the thought of it made his days bitter to him. Tom, like
20293: every one of us, was imprisoned within the limits of his own nature,
20294: and his education had simply glided over him, leaving a slight deposit
20295: of polish; if you are inclined to be severe on his severity, remember
20296: that the responsibility of tolerance lies with those who have the wider
20297: vision. There had arisen in Tom a repulsion toward Maggie that derived
20298: its very intensity from their early childish love in the time when they
20299: had clasped tiny fingers together, and their later sense of nearness in
20300: a common duty and a common sorrow; the sight of her, as he had told
20301: her, was hateful to him. In this branch of the Dodson family aunt Glegg
20302: found a stronger nature than her own; a nature in which family feeling
20303: had lost the character of clanship by taking on a doubly deep dye of
20304: personal pride.
20305: 
20306: Mrs Glegg allowed that Maggie ought to be punished,—she was not a woman
20307: to deny that; she knew what conduct was,—but punished in proportion to
20308: the misdeeds proved against her, not to those which were cast upon her
20309: by people outside her own family who might wish to show that their own
20310: kin were better.
20311: 
20312: “Your aunt Glegg scolded me so as niver was, my dear,” said poor Mrs
20313: Tulliver, when she came back to Maggie, “as I didn’t go to her before;
20314: she said it wasn’t for her to come to me first. But she spoke like a
20315: sister, too; _having_ she allays was, and hard to please,—oh dear!—but
20316: she’s said the kindest word as has ever been spoke by you yet, my
20317: child. For she says, for all she’s been so set again’ having one extry
20318: in the house, and making extry spoons and things, and putting her about
20319: in her ways, you shall have a shelter in her house, if you’ll go to her
20320: dutiful, and she’ll uphold you against folks as say harm of you when
20321: they’ve no call. And I told her I thought you couldn’t bear to see
20322: anybody but me, you were so beat down with trouble; but she said, ‘_I_
20323: won’t throw ill words at her; there’s them out o’ th’ family ’ull be
20324: ready enough to do that. But I’ll give her good advice; an’ she must be
20325: humble.’ It’s wonderful o’ Jane; for I’m sure she used to throw
20326: everything I did wrong at me,—if it was the raisin-wine as turned out
20327: bad, or the pies too hot, or whativer it was.”
20328: 
20329: “Oh, mother,” said poor Maggie, shrinking from the thought of all the
20330: contact her bruised mind would have to bear, “tell her I’m very
20331: grateful; I’ll go to see her as soon as I can; but I can’t see any one
20332: just yet, except Dr Kenn. I’ve been to him,—he will advise me, and help
20333: me to get some occupation. I can’t live with any one, or be dependent
20334: on them, tell aunt Glegg; I must get my own bread. But did you hear
20335: nothing of Philip—Philip Wakem? Have you never seen any one that has
20336: mentioned him?”
20337: 
20338: “No, my dear; but I’ve been to Lucy’s, and I saw your uncle, and he
20339: says they got her to listen to the letter, and she took notice o’ Miss
20340: Guest, and asked questions, and the doctor thinks she’s on the turn to
20341: be better. What a world this is,—what trouble, oh dear! The law was the
20342: first beginning, and it’s gone from bad to worse, all of a sudden, just
20343: when the luck seemed on the turn.” This was the first lamentation that
20344: Mrs Tulliver had let slip to Maggie, but old habit had been revived by
20345: the interview with sister Glegg.
20346: 
20347: “My poor, poor mother!” Maggie burst out, cut to the heart with pity
20348: and compunction, and throwing her arms round her mother’s neck; “I was
20349: always naughty and troublesome to you. And now you might have been
20350: happy if it hadn’t been for me.”
20351: 
20352: “Eh, my dear,” said Mrs Tulliver, leaning toward the warm young cheek;
20353: “I must put up wi’ my children,—I shall never have no more; and if they
20354: bring me bad luck, I must be fond on it. There’s nothing else much to
20355: be fond on, for my furnitur’ went long ago. And you’d got to be very
20356: good once; I can’t think how it’s turned out the wrong way so!”
20357: 
20358: Still two or three more days passed, and Maggie heard nothing of
20359: Philip; anxiety about him was becoming her predominant trouble, and she
20360: summoned courage at last to inquire about him of Dr Kenn, on his next
20361: visit to her. He did not even know if Philip was at home. The elder
20362: Wakem was made moody by an accumulation of annoyance; the
20363: disappointment in this young Jetsome, to whom, apparently, he was a
20364: good deal attached, had been followed close by the catastrophe to his
20365: son’s hopes after he had done violence to his own strong feeling by
20366: conceding to them, and had incautiously mentioned this concession in St
20367: Ogg’s; and he was almost fierce in his brusqueness when any one asked
20368: him a question about his son.
20369: 
20370: But Philip could hardly have been ill, or it would have been known
20371: through the calling in of the medical man; it was probable that he was
20372: gone out of the town for a little while. Maggie sickened under this
20373: suspense, and her imagination began to live more and more persistently
20374: in what Philip was enduring. What did he believe about her?
20375: 
20376: At last Bob brought her a letter, without a postmark, directed in a
20377: hand which she knew familiarly in the letters of her own name,—a hand
20378: in which her name had been written long ago, in a pocket Shakespeare
20379: which she possessed. Her mother was in the room, and Maggie, in violent
20380: agitation, hurried upstairs that she might read the letter in solitude.
20381: She read it with a throbbing brow.
20382: 
20383: “Maggie,—I believe in you; I know you never meant to deceive me; I know
20384: you tried to keep faith to me and to all. I believed this before I had
20385: any other evidence of it than your own nature. The night after I last
20386: parted from you I suffered torments. I had seen what convinced me that
20387: you were not free; that there was another whose presence had a power
20388: over you which mine never possessed; but through all the
20389: suggestions—almost murderous suggestions—of rage and jealousy, my mind
20390: made its way to believe in your truthfulness. I was sure that you meant
20391: to cleave to me, as you had said; that you had rejected him; that you
20392: struggled to renounce him, for Lucy’s sake and for mine. But I could
20393: see no issue that was not fatal for _you;_ and that dread shut out the
20394: very thought of resignation. I foresaw that he would not relinquish
20395: you, and I believed then, as I believe now, that the strong attraction
20396: which drew you together proceeded only from one side of your
20397: characters, and belonged to that partial, divided action of our nature
20398: which makes half the tragedy of the human lot. I have felt the
20399: vibration of chords in your nature that I have continually felt the
20400: want of in his. But perhaps I am wrong; perhaps I feel about you as the
20401: artist does about the scene over which his soul has brooded with love;
20402: he would tremble to see it confided to other hands; he would never
20403: believe that it could bear for another all the meaning and the beauty
20404: it bears for him.
20405: 
20406:     “I dared not trust myself to see you that morning; I was filled
20407:     with selfish passion; I was shattered by a night of conscious
20408:     delirium. I told you long ago that I had never been resigned even
20409:     to the mediocrity of my powers; how could I be resigned to the loss
20410:     of the one thing which had ever come to me on earth with the
20411:     promise of such deep joy as would give a new and blessed meaning to
20412:     the foregoing pain,—the promise of another self that would lift my
20413:     aching affection into the divine rapture of an ever-springing,
20414:     ever-satisfied want?
20415: 
20416:     “But the miseries of that night had prepared me for what came
20417:     before the next. It was no surprise to me. I was certain that he
20418:     had prevailed on you to sacrifice everything to him, and I waited
20419:     with equal certainty to hear of your marriage. I measured your love
20420:     and his by my own. But I was wrong, Maggie. There is something
20421:     stronger in you than your love for him.
20422: 
20423:     “I will not tell you what I went through in that interval. But even
20424:     in its utmost agony—even in those terrible throes that love must
20425:     suffer before it can be disembodied of selfish desire—my love for
20426:     you sufficed to withhold me from suicide, without the aid of any
20427:     other motive. In the midst of my egoism, I yet could not bear to
20428:     come like a death-shadow across the feast of your joy. I could not
20429:     bear to forsake the world in which you still lived and might need
20430:     me; it was part of the faith I had vowed to you,—to wait and
20431:     endure. Maggie, that is a proof of what I write now to assure you
20432:     of,—that no anguish I have had to bear on your account has been too
20433:     heavy a price to pay for the new life into which I have entered in
20434:     loving you. I want you to put aside all grief because of the grief
20435:     you have caused me. I was nurtured in the sense of privation; I
20436:     never expected happiness; and in knowing you, in loving you, I have
20437:     had, and still have, what reconciles me to life. You have been to
20438:     my affections what light, what colour is to my eyes, what music is
20439:     to the inward ear, you have raised a dim unrest into a vivid
20440:     consciousness. The new life I have found in caring for your joy and
20441:     sorrow more than for what is directly my own, has transformed the
20442:     spirit of rebellious murmuring into that willing endurance which is
20443:     the birth of strong sympathy. I think nothing but such complete and
20444:     intense love could have initiated me into that enlarged life which
20445:     grows and grows by appropriating the life of others; for before, I
20446:     was always dragged back from it by ever-present painful
20447:     self-consciousness. I even think sometimes that this gift of
20448:     transferred life which has come to me in loving you, may be a new
20449:     power to me.
20450: 
20451:     “Then, dear one, in spite of all, you have been the blessing of my
20452:     life. Let no self-reproach weigh on you because of me. It is I who
20453:     should rather reproach myself for having urged my feelings upon
20454:     you, and hurried you into words that you have felt as fetters. You
20455:     meant to be true to those words; you _have_ been true. I can
20456:     measure your sacrifice by what I have known in only one half-hour
20457:     of your presence with me, when I dreamed that you might love me
20458:     best. But, Maggie, I have no just claim on you for more than
20459:     affectionate remembrance.
20460: 
20461:     “For some time I have shrunk from writing to you, because I have
20462:     shrunk even from the appearance of wishing to thrust myself before
20463:     you, and so repeating my original error. But you will not
20464:     misconstrue me. I know that we must keep apart for a long while;
20465:     cruel tongues would force us apart, if nothing else did. But I
20466:     shall not go away. The place where you are is the one where my mind
20467:     must live, wherever I might travel. And remember that I am
20468:     unchangeably yours,—yours not with selfish wishes, but with a
20469:     devotion that excludes such wishes.
20470: 
20471:     “God comfort you, my loving, large-souled Maggie. If every one else
20472:     has misconceived you, remember that you have never been doubted by
20473:     him whose heart recognised you ten years ago.
20474: 
20475:     “Do not believe any one who says I am ill, because I am not seen
20476:     out of doors. I have only had nervous headaches,—no worse than I
20477:     have sometimes had them before. But the overpowering heat inclines
20478:     me to be perfectly quiescent in the daytime. I am strong enough to
20479:     obey any word which shall tell me that I can serve you by word or
20480:     deed.
20481: 
20482: 
20483: 
20484: “Yours to the last,
20485: 
20486: “_Philip Wakem_.”
20487: 
20488: 
20489: As Maggie knelt by the bed sobbing, with that letter pressed under her,
20490: her feelings again and again gathered themselves in a whispered cry,
20491: always in the same words,—
20492: 
20493: “O God, is there any happiness in love that could make me forget
20494: _their_ pain?”
20495: 
20496: 
20497: Chapter IV.
20498: 
20499: Maggie and Lucy
20500: 
20501: By the end of the week Dr Kenn had made up his mind that there was only
20502: one way in which he could secure to Maggie a suitable living at St
20503: Ogg’s. Even with his twenty years’ experience as a parish priest, he
20504: was aghast at the obstinate continuance of imputations against her in
20505: the face of evidence. Hitherto he had been rather more adored and
20506: appealed to than was quite agreeable to him; but now, in attempting to
20507: open the ears of women to reason, and their consciences to justice, on
20508: behalf of Maggie Tulliver, he suddenly found himself as powerless as he
20509: was aware he would have been if he had attempted to influence the shape
20510: of bonnets. Dr Kenn could not be contradicted; he was listened to in
20511: silence; but when he left the room, a comparison of opinions among his
20512: hearers yielded much the same result as before. Miss Tulliver had
20513: undeniably acted in a blamable manner, even Dr Kenn did not deny that;
20514: how, then, could he think so lightly of her as to put that favourable
20515: interpretation on everything she had done? Even on the supposition that
20516: required the utmost stretch of belief,—namely, that none of the things
20517: said about Miss Tulliver were true,—still, since they _had_ been said
20518: about her, they had cast an odor round her which must cause her to be
20519: shrunk from by every woman who had to take care of her own
20520: reputation—and of Society. To have taken Maggie by the hand and said,
20521: “I will not believe unproved evil of you; my lips shall not utter it;
20522: my ears shall be closed against it; I, too, am an erring mortal, liable
20523: to stumble, apt to come short of my most earnest efforts; your lot has
20524: been harder than mine, your temptation greater; let us help each other
20525: to stand and walk without more falling,”—to have done this would have
20526: demanded courage, deep pity, self-knowledge, generous trust; would have
20527: demanded a mind that tasted no piquancy in evil-speaking, that felt no
20528: self-exaltation in condemning, that cheated itself with no large words
20529: into the belief that life can have any moral end, any high religion,
20530: which excludes the striving after perfect truth, justice, and love
20531: toward the individual men and women who come across our own path. The
20532: ladies of St Ogg’s were not beguiled by any wide speculative
20533: conceptions; but they had their favourite abstraction, called Society,
20534: which served to make their consciences perfectly easy in doing what
20535: satisfied their own egoism,—thinking and speaking the worst of Maggie
20536: Tulliver, and turning their backs upon her. It was naturally
20537: disappointing to Dr Kenn, after two years of superfluous incense from
20538: his feminine parishioners, to find them suddenly maintaining their
20539: views in opposition to his; but then they maintained them in opposition
20540: to a higher Authority, which they had venerated longer. That Authority
20541: had furnished a very explicit answer to persons who might inquire where
20542: their social duties began, and might be inclined to take wide views as
20543: to the starting-point. The answer had not turned on the ultimate good
20544: of Society, but on “a certain man” who was found in trouble by the
20545: wayside.
20546: 
20547: Not that St Ogg’s was empty of women with some tenderness of heart and
20548: conscience; probably it had as fair a proportion of human goodness in
20549: it as any other small trading town of that day. But until every good
20550: man is brave, we must expect to find many good women timid,—too timid
20551: even to believe in the correctness of their own best promptings, when
20552: these would place them in a minority. And the men at St Ogg’s were not
20553: all brave, by any means; some of them were even fond of scandal, and to
20554: an extent that might have given their conversation an effeminate
20555: character, if it had not been distinguished by masculine jokes, and by
20556: an occasional shrug of the shoulders at the mutual hatred of women. It
20557: was the general feeling of the masculine mind at St Ogg’s that women
20558: were not to be interfered with in their treatment of each other.
20559: 
20560: And thus every direction in which Dr Kenn had turned, in the hope of
20561: procuring some kind recognition and some employment for Maggie, proved
20562: a disappointment to him. Mrs James Torry could not think of taking
20563: Maggie as a nursery governess, even temporarily,—a young woman about
20564: whom “such things had been said,” and about whom “gentlemen joked”; and
20565: Miss Kirke, who had a spinal complaint, and wanted a reader and
20566: companion, felt quite sure that Maggie’s mind must be of a quality with
20567: which she, for her part, could not risk _any_ contact. Why did not Miss
20568: Tulliver accept the shelter offered her by her aunt Glegg? It did not
20569: become a girl like her to refuse it. Or else, why did she not go out of
20570: the neighbourhood, and get a situation where she was not known? (It was
20571: not, apparently, of so much importance that she should carry her
20572: dangerous tendencies into strange families unknown at St Ogg’s.) She
20573: must be very bold and hardened to wish to stay in a parish where she
20574: was so much stared at and whispered about.
20575: 
20576: Dr Kenn, having great natural firmness, began, in the presence of this
20577: opposition, as every firm man would have done, to contract a certain
20578: strength of determination over and above what would have been called
20579: forth by the end in view. He himself wanted a daily governess for his
20580: younger children; and though he had hesitated in the first instance to
20581: offer this position to Maggie, the resolution to protest with the
20582: utmost force of his personal and priestly character against her being
20583: crushed and driven away by slander, was now decisive. Maggie gratefully
20584: accepted an employment that gave her duties as well as a support; her
20585: days would be filled now, and solitary evenings would be a welcome
20586: rest. She no longer needed the sacrifice her mother made in staying
20587: with her, and Mrs Tulliver was persuaded to go back to the Mill.
20588: 
20589: But now it began to be discovered that Dr Kenn, exemplary as he had
20590: hitherto appeared, had his crotchets, possibly his weaknesses. The
20591: masculine mind of St Ogg’s smiled pleasantly, and did not wonder that
20592: Kenn liked to see a fine pair of eyes daily, or that he was inclined to
20593: take so lenient a view of the past; the feminine mind, regarded at that
20594: period as less powerful, took a more melancholy view of the case. If Dr
20595: Kenn should be beguiled into marrying that Miss Tulliver! It was not
20596: safe to be too confident, even about the best of men; an apostle had
20597: fallen, and wept bitterly afterwards; and though Peter’s denial was not
20598: a close precedent, his repentance was likely to be.
20599: 
20600: Maggie had not taken her daily walks to the Rectory for many weeks,
20601: before the dreadful possibility of her some time or other becoming the
20602: Rector’s wife had been talked of so often in confidence, that ladies
20603: were beginning to discuss how they should behave to her in that
20604: position. For Dr Kenn, it had been understood, had sat in the
20605: schoolroom half an hour one morning, when Miss Tulliver was giving her
20606: lessons,—nay, he had sat there every morning; he had once walked home
20607: with her,—he almost _always_ walked home with her,—and if not, he went
20608: to see her in the evening. What an artful creature she was! What a
20609: _mother_ for those children! It was enough to make poor Mrs Kenn turn
20610: in her grave, that they should be put under the care of this girl only
20611: a few weeks after her death. Would he be so lost to propriety as to
20612: marry her before the year was out? The masculine mind was sarcastic,
20613: and thought _not_.
20614: 
20615: The Miss Guests saw an alleviation to the sorrow of witnessing a folly
20616: in their Rector; at least their brother would be safe; and their
20617: knowledge of Stephen’s tenacity was a constant ground of alarm to them,
20618: lest he should come back and marry Maggie. They were not among those
20619: who disbelieved their brother’s letter; but they had no confidence in
20620: Maggie’s adherence to her renunciation of him; they suspected that she
20621: had shrunk rather from the elopement than from the marriage, and that
20622: she lingered in St Ogg’s, relying on his return to her. They had always
20623: thought her disagreeable; they now thought her artful and proud; having
20624: quite as good grounds for that judgment as you and I probably have for
20625: many strong opinions of the same kind. Formerly they had not altogether
20626: delighted in the contemplated match with Lucy, but now their dread of a
20627: marriage between Stephen and Maggie added its momentum to their genuine
20628: pity and indignation on behalf of the gentle forsaken girl, in making
20629: them desire that he should return to her. As soon as Lucy was able to
20630: leave home, she was to seek relief from the oppressive heat of this
20631: August by going to the coast with the Miss Guests; and it was in their
20632: plans that Stephen should be induced to join them. On the very first
20633: hint of gossip concerning Maggie and Dr Kenn, the report was conveyed
20634: in Miss Guest’s letter to her brother.
20635: 
20636: Maggie had frequent tidings through her mother, or aunt Glegg, or Dr
20637: Kenn, of Lucy’s gradual progress toward recovery, and her thoughts
20638: tended continually toward her uncle Deane’s house; she hungered for an
20639: interview with Lucy, if it were only for five minutes, to utter a word
20640: of penitence, to be assured by Lucy’s own eyes and lips that she did
20641: not believe in the willing treachery of those whom she had loved and
20642: trusted. But she knew that even if her uncle’s indignation had not
20643: closed his house against her, the agitation of such an interview would
20644: have been forbidden to Lucy. Only to have seen her without speaking
20645: would have been some relief; for Maggie was haunted by a face cruel in
20646: its very gentleness; a face that had been turned on hers with glad,
20647: sweet looks of trust and love from the twilight time of memory; changed
20648: now to a sad and weary face by a first heart-stroke. And as the days
20649: passed on, that pale image became more and more distinct; the picture
20650: grew and grew into more speaking definiteness under the avenging hand
20651: of remorse; the soft hazel eyes, in their look of pain, were bent
20652: forever on Maggie, and pierced her the more because she could see no
20653: anger in them. But Lucy was not yet able to go to church, or any place
20654: where Maggie could see her; and even the hope of that departed, when
20655: the news was told her by aunt Glegg, that Lucy was really going away in
20656: a few days to Scarborough with the Miss Guests, who had been heard to
20657: say that they expected their brother to meet them there.
20658: 
20659: Only those who have known what hardest inward conflict is, can know
20660: what Maggie felt as she sat in her loneliness the evening after hearing
20661: that news from Mrs Glegg,—only those who have known what it is to dread
20662: their own selfish desires as the watching mother would dread the
20663: sleeping-potion that was to still her own pain.
20664: 
20665: She sat without candle in the twilight, with the window wide open
20666: toward the river; the sense of oppressive heat adding itself
20667: undistinguishably to the burthen of her lot. Seated on a chair against
20668: the window, with her arm on the windowsill she was looking blankly at
20669: the flowing river, swift with the backward-rushing tide, struggling to
20670: see still the sweet face in its unreproaching sadness, that seemed now
20671: from moment to moment to sink away and be hidden behind a form that
20672: thrust itself between, and made darkness. Hearing the door open, she
20673: thought Mrs Jakin was coming in with her supper, as usual; and with
20674: that repugnance to trivial speech which comes with languor and
20675: wretchedness, she shrank from turning round and saying she wanted
20676: nothing; good little Mrs Jakin would be sure to make some well-meant
20677: remarks. But the next moment, without her having discerned the sound of
20678: a footstep, she felt a light hand on her shoulder, and heard a voice
20679: close to her saying, “Maggie!”
20680: 
20681: The face was there,—changed, but all the sweeter; the hazel eyes were
20682: there, with their heart-piercing tenderness.
20683: 
20684: “Maggie!” the soft voice said. “Lucy!” answered a voice with a sharp
20685: ring of anguish in it; and Lucy threw her arms round Maggie’s neck, and
20686: leaned her pale cheek against the burning brow.
20687: 
20688: “I stole out,” said Lucy, almost in a whisper, while she sat down close
20689: to Maggie and held her hand, “when papa and the rest were away. Alice
20690: is come with me. I asked her to help me. But I must only stay a little
20691: while, because it is so late.”
20692: 
20693: It was easier to say that at first than to say anything else. They sat
20694: looking at each other. It seemed as if the interview must end without
20695: more speech, for speech was very difficult. Each felt that there would
20696: be something scorching in the words that would recall the irretrievable
20697: wrong. But soon, as Maggie looked, every distinct thought began to be
20698: overflowed by a wave of loving penitence, and words burst forth with a
20699: sob.
20700: 
20701: “God bless you for coming, Lucy.”
20702: 
20703: The sobs came thick on each other after that.
20704: 
20705: “Maggie, dear, be comforted,” said Lucy now, putting her cheek against
20706: Maggie’s again. “Don’t grieve.” And she sat still, hoping to soothe
20707: Maggie with that gentle caress.
20708: 
20709: “I didn’t mean to deceive you, Lucy,” said Maggie, as soon as she could
20710: speak. “It always made me wretched that I felt what I didn’t like you
20711: to know. It was because I thought it would all be conquered, and you
20712: might never see anything to wound you.”
20713: 
20714: “I know, dear,” said Lucy. “I know you never meant to make me unhappy.
20715: It is a trouble that has come on us all; you have more to bear than I
20716: have—and you gave him up, when—you did what it must have been very hard
20717: to do.”
20718: 
20719: They were silent again a little while, sitting with clasped hands, and
20720: cheeks leaned together.
20721: 
20722: “Lucy,” Maggie began again, “_he_ struggled too. He wanted to be true
20723: to you. He will come back to you. Forgive him—he will be happy then——”
20724: 
20725: These words were wrung forth from Maggie’s deepest soul, with an effort
20726: like the convulsed clutch of a drowning man. Lucy trembled and was
20727: silent.
20728: 
20729: A gentle knock came at the door. It was Alice, the maid, who entered
20730: and said,—
20731: 
20732: “I daren’t stay any longer, Miss Deane. They’ll find it out, and
20733: there’ll be such anger at your coming out so late.”
20734: 
20735: Lucy rose and said, “Very well, Alice,—in a minute.”
20736: 
20737: “I’m to go away on Friday, Maggie,” she added, when Alice had closed
20738: the door again. “When I come back, and am strong, they will let me do
20739: as I like. I shall come to you when I please then.”
20740: 
20741: “Lucy,” said Maggie, with another great effort, “I pray to God
20742: continually that I may never be the cause of sorrow to you any more.”
20743: 
20744: She pressed the little hand that she held between hers, and looked up
20745: into the face that was bent over hers. Lucy never forgot that look.
20746: 
20747: “Maggie,” she said, in a low voice, that had the solemnity of
20748: confession in it, “you are better than I am. I can’t——”
20749: 
20750: She broke off there, and said no more. But they clasped each other
20751: again in a last embrace.
20752: 
20753: 
20754: Chapter V.
20755: 
20756: The Last Conflict
20757: 
20758: In the second week of September, Maggie was again sitting in her lonely
20759: room, battling with the old shadowy enemies that were forever slain and
20760: rising again. It was past midnight, and the rain was beating heavily
20761: against the window, driven with fitful force by the rushing,
20762: loud-moaning wind. For the day after Lucy’s visit there had been a
20763: sudden change in the weather; the heat and drought had given way to
20764: cold variable winds, and heavy falls of rain at intervals; and she had
20765: been forbidden to risk the contemplated journey until the weather
20766: should become more settled. In the counties higher up the Floss the
20767: rains had been continuous, and the completion of the harvest had been
20768: arrested. And now, for the last two days, the rains on this lower
20769: course of the river had been incessant, so that the old men had shaken
20770: their heads and talked of sixty years ago, when the same sort of
20771: weather, happening about the equinox, brought on the great floods,
20772: which swept the bridge away, and reduced the town to great misery. But
20773: the younger generation, who had seen several small floods, thought
20774: lightly of these sombre recollections and forebodings; and Bob Jakin,
20775: naturally prone to take a hopeful view of his own luck, laughed at his
20776: mother when she regretted their having taken a house by the riverside,
20777: observing that but for that they would have had no boats, which were
20778: the most lucky of possessions in case of a flood that obliged them to
20779: go to a distance for food.
20780: 
20781: But the careless and the fearful were alike sleeping in their beds now.
20782: There was hope that the rain would abate by the morrow; threatenings of
20783: a worse kind, from sudden thaws after falls of snow, had often passed
20784: off, in the experience of the younger ones; and at the very worst, the
20785: banks would be sure to break lower down the river when the tide came in
20786: with violence, and so the waters would be carried off, without causing
20787: more than temporary inconvenience, and losses that would be felt only
20788: by the poorer sort, whom charity would relieve.
20789: 
20790: All were in their beds now, for it was past midnight; all except some
20791: solitary watchers such as Maggie. She was seated in her little parlour
20792: toward the river, with one candle, that left everything dim in the room
20793: except a letter which lay before her on the table. That letter, which
20794: had come to her to-day, was one of the causes that had kept her up far
20795: on into the night, unconscious how the hours were going, careless of
20796: seeking rest, with no image of rest coming across her mind, except of
20797: that far, far off rest from which there would be no more waking for her
20798: into this struggling earthly life.
20799: 
20800: Two days before Maggie received that letter, she had been to the
20801: Rectory for the last time. The heavy rain would have prevented her from
20802: going since; but there was another reason. Dr Kenn, at first
20803: enlightened only by a few hints as to the new turn which gossip and
20804: slander had taken in relation to Maggie, had recently been made more
20805: fully aware of it by an earnest remonstrance from one of his male
20806: parishioners against the indiscretion of persisting in the attempt to
20807: overcome the prevalent feeling in the parish by a course of resistance.
20808: Dr Kenn, having a conscience void of offence in the matter, was still
20809: inclined to persevere,—was still averse to give way before a public
20810: sentiment that was odious and contemptible; but he was finally wrought
20811: upon by the consideration of the peculiar responsibility attached to
20812: his office, of avoiding the appearance of evil,—an “appearance” that is
20813: always dependent on the average quality of surrounding minds. Where
20814: these minds are low and gross, the area of that “appearance” is
20815: proportionately widened. Perhaps he was in danger of acting from
20816: obstinacy; perhaps it was his duty to succumb. Conscientious people are
20817: apt to see their duty in that which is the most painful course; and to
20818: recede was always painful to Dr Kenn. He made up his mind that he must
20819: advise Maggie to go away from St Ogg’s for a time; and he performed
20820: that difficult task with as much delicacy as he could, only stating in
20821: vague terms that he found his attempt to countenance her stay was a
20822: source of discord between himself and his parishioners, that was likely
20823: to obstruct his usefulness as a clergyman. He begged her to allow him
20824: to write to a clerical friend of his, who might possibly take her into
20825: his own family as governess; and, if not, would probably know of some
20826: other available position for a young woman in whose welfare Dr Kenn
20827: felt a strong interest.
20828: 
20829: Poor Maggie listened with a trembling lip; she could say nothing but a
20830: faint “Thank you, I shall be grateful”; and she walked back to her
20831: lodgings, through the driving rain, with a new sense of desolation. She
20832: must be a lonely wanderer; she must go out among fresh faces, that
20833: would look at her wonderingly, because the days did not seem joyful to
20834: her; she must begin a new life, in which she would have to rouse
20835: herself to receive new impressions; and she was so unspeakably,
20836: sickeningly weary! There was no home, no help for the erring; even
20837: those who pitied were constrained to hardness. But ought she to
20838: complain? Ought she to shrink in this way from the long penance of
20839: life, which was all the possibility she had of lightening the load to
20840: some other sufferers, and so changing that passionate error into a new
20841: force of unselfish human love? All the next day she sat in her lonely
20842: room, with a window darkened by the cloud and the driving rain,
20843: thinking of that future, and wrestling for patience; for what repose
20844: could poor Maggie ever win except by wrestling?
20845: 
20846: And on the third day—this day of which she had just sat out the
20847: close—the letter had come which was lying on the table before her.
20848: 
20849: The letter was from Stephen. He was come back from Holland; he was at
20850: Mudport again, unknown to any of his friends, and had written to her
20851: from that place, enclosing the letter to a person whom he trusted in St
20852: Ogg’s. From beginning to end it was a passionate cry of reproach; an
20853: appeal against her useless sacrifice of him, of herself, against that
20854: perverted notion of right which led her to crush all his hopes, for the
20855: sake of a mere idea, and not any substantial good,—_his_ hopes, whom
20856: she loved, and who loved her with that single overpowering passion,
20857: that worship, which a man never gives to a woman more than once in his
20858: life.
20859: 
20860: “They have written to me that you are to marry Kenn. As if I should
20861: believe that! Perhaps they have told you some such fables about me.
20862: Perhaps they tell you I’ve been ‘travelling.’ My body has been dragged
20863: about somewhere; but _I_ have never travelled from the hideous place
20864: where you left me; where I started up from the stupor of helpless rage
20865: to find you gone.
20866: 
20867: “Maggie! whose pain can have been like mine? Whose injury is like mine?
20868: Who besides me has met that long look of love that has burnt itself
20869: into my soul, so that no other image can come there? Maggie, call me
20870: back to you! Call me back to life and goodness! I am banished from both
20871: now. I have no motives; I am indifferent to everything. Two months have
20872: only deepened the certainty that I can never care for life without you.
20873: Write me one word; say ‘Come!’ In two days I should be with you.
20874: Maggie, have you forgotten what it was to be together,—to be within
20875: reach of a look, to be within hearing of each other’s voice?”
20876: 
20877: When Maggie first read this letter she felt as if her real temptation
20878: had only just begun. At the entrance of the chill dark cavern, we turn
20879: with unworn courage from the warm light; but how, when we have trodden
20880: far in the damp darkness, and have begun to be faint and weary; how, if
20881: there is a sudden opening above us, and we are invited back again to
20882: the life-nourishing day? The leap of natural longing from under the
20883: pressure of pain is so strong, that all less immediate motives are
20884: likely to be forgotten—till the pain has been escaped from.
20885: 
20886: For hours Maggie felt as if her struggle had been in vain. For hours
20887: every other thought that she strove to summon was thrust aside by the
20888: image of Stephen waiting for the single word that would bring him to
20889: her. She did not _read_ the letter: she heard him uttering it, and the
20890: voice shook her with its old strange power. All the day before she had
20891: been filled with the vision of a lonely future through which she must
20892: carry the burthen of regret, upheld only by clinging faith. And here,
20893: close within her reach, urging itself upon her even as a claim, was
20894: another future, in which hard endurance and effort were to be exchanged
20895: for easy, delicious leaning on another’s loving strength! And yet that
20896: promise of joy in the place of sadness did not make the dire force of
20897: the temptation to Maggie.
20898: 
20899: It was Stephen’s tone of misery, it was the doubt in the justice of her
20900: own resolve, that made the balance tremble, and made her once start
20901: from her seat to reach the pen and paper, and write “Come!”
20902: 
20903: But close upon that decisive act, her mind recoiled; and the sense of
20904: contradiction with her past self in her moments of strength and
20905: clearness came upon her like a pang of conscious degradation. No, she
20906: must wait; she must pray; the light that had forsaken her would come
20907: again; she should feel again what she had felt when she had fled away,
20908: under an inspiration strong enough to conquer agony,—to conquer love;
20909: she should feel again what she had felt when Lucy stood by her, when
20910: Philip’s letter had stirred all the fibres that bound her to the calmer
20911: past.
20912: 
20913: She sat quite still, far on into the night, with no impulse to change
20914: her attitude, without active force enough even for the mental act of
20915: prayer; only waiting for the light that would surely come again. It
20916: came with the memories that no passion could long quench; the long past
20917: came back to her, and with it the fountains of self-renouncing pity and
20918: affection, of faithfulness and resolve. The words that were marked by
20919: the quiet hand in the little old book that she had long ago learned by
20920: heart, rushed even to her lips, and found a vent for themselves in a
20921: low murmur that was quite lost in the loud driving of the rain against
20922: the window and the loud moan and roar of the wind. “I have received the
20923: Cross, I have received it from Thy hand; I will bear it, and bear it
20924: till death, as Thou hast laid it upon me.”
20925: 
20926: But soon other words rose that could find no utterance but in a
20927: sob,—“Forgive me, Stephen! It will pass away. You will come back to
20928: her.”
20929: 
20930: She took up the letter, held it to the candle, and let it burn slowly
20931: on the hearth. To-morrow she would write to him the last word of
20932: parting.
20933: 
20934: “I will bear it, and bear it till death. But how long it will be before
20935: death comes! I am so young, so healthy. How shall I have patience and
20936: strength? Am I to struggle and fall and repent again? Has life other
20937: trials as hard for me still?”
20938: 
20939: With that cry of self-despair, Maggie fell on her knees against the
20940: table, and buried her sorrow-stricken face. Her soul went out to the
20941: Unseen Pity that would be with her to the end. Surely there was
20942: something being taught her by this experience of great need; and she
20943: must be learning a secret of human tenderness and long-suffering, that
20944: the less erring could hardly know? “O God, if my life is to be long,
20945: let me live to bless and comfort——”
20946: 
20947: At that moment Maggie felt a startling sensation of sudden cold about
20948: her knees and feet; it was water flowing under her. She started up; the
20949: stream was flowing under the door that led into the passage. She was
20950: not bewildered for an instant; she knew it was the flood!
20951: 
20952: The tumult of emotion she had been enduring for the last twelve hours
20953: seemed to have left a great calm in her; without screaming, she hurried
20954: with the candle upstairs to Bob Jakin’s bedroom. The door was ajar; she
20955: went in and shook him by the shoulder.
20956: 
20957: “Bob, the flood is come! it is in the house; let us see if we can make
20958: the boats safe.”
20959: 
20960: She lighted his candle, while the poor wife, snatching up her baby,
20961: burst into screams; and then she hurried down again to see if the
20962: waters were rising fast. There was a step down into the room at the
20963: door leading from the staircase; she saw that the water was already on
20964: a level with the step. While she was looking, something came with a
20965: tremendous crash against the window, and sent the leaded panes and the
20966: old wooden framework inward in shivers, the water pouring in after it.
20967: 
20968: “It is the boat!” cried Maggie. “Bob, come down to get the boats!”
20969: 
20970: And without a moment’s shudder of fear, she plunged through the water,
20971: which was rising fast to her knees, and by the glimmering light of the
20972: candle she had left on the stairs, she mounted on to the window-sill,
20973: and crept into the boat, which was left with the prow lodging and
20974: protruding through the window. Bob was not long after her, hurrying
20975: without shoes or stockings, but with the lanthorn in his hand.
20976: 
20977: “Why, they’re both here,—both the boats,” said Bob, as he got into the
20978: one where Maggie was. “It’s wonderful this fastening isn’t broke too,
20979: as well as the mooring.”
20980: 
20981: In the excitement of getting into the other boat, unfastening it, and
20982: mastering an oar, Bob was not struck with the danger Maggie incurred.
20983: We are not apt to fear for the fearless, when we are companions in
20984: their danger, and Bob’s mind was absorbed in possible expedients for
20985: the safety of the helpless indoors. The fact that Maggie had been up,
20986: had waked him, and had taken the lead in activity, gave Bob a vague
20987: impression of her as one who would help to protect, not need to be
20988: protected. She too had got possession of an oar, and had pushed off, so
20989: as to release the boat from the overhanging window-frame.
20990: 
20991: “The water’s rising so fast,” said Bob, “I doubt it’ll be in at the
20992: chambers before long,—th’ house is so low. I’ve more mind to get Prissy
20993: and the child and the mother into the boat, if I could, and trusten to
20994: the water,—for th’ old house is none so safe. And if I let go the
20995: boat—but _you_,” he exclaimed, suddenly lifting the light of his
20996: lanthorn on Maggie, as she stood in the rain with the oar in her hand
20997: and her black hair streaming.
20998: 
20999: Maggie had no time to answer, for a new tidal current swept along the
21000: line of the houses, and drove both the boats out on to the wide water,
21001: with a force that carried them far past the meeting current of the
21002: river.
21003: 
21004: In the first moments Maggie felt nothing, thought of nothing, but that
21005: she had suddenly passed away from that life which she had been
21006: dreading; it was the transition of death, without its agony,—and she
21007: was alone in the darkness with God.
21008: 
21009: The whole thing had been so rapid, so dreamlike, that the threads of
21010: ordinary association were broken; she sank down on the seat clutching
21011: the oar mechanically, and for a long while had no distinct conception
21012: of her position. The first thing that waked her to fuller consciousness
21013: was the cessation of the rain, and a perception that the darkness was
21014: divided by the faintest light, which parted the overhanging gloom from
21015: the immeasurable watery level below. She was driven out upon the
21016: flood,—that awful visitation of God which her father used to talk of;
21017: which had made the nightmare of her childish dreams. And with that
21018: thought there rushed in the vision of the old home, and Tom, and her
21019: mother,—they had all listened together.
21020: 
21021: “O God, where am I? Which is the way home?” she cried out, in the dim
21022: loneliness.
21023: 
21024: What was happening to them at the Mill? The flood had once nearly
21025: destroyed it. They might be in danger, in distress,—her mother and her
21026: brother, alone there, beyond reach of help! Her whole soul was strained
21027: now on that thought; and she saw the long-loved faces looking for help
21028: into the darkness, and finding none.
21029: 
21030: She was floating in smooth water now,—perhaps far on the overflooded
21031: fields. There was no sense of present danger to check the outgoing of
21032: her mind to the old home; and she strained her eyes against the curtain
21033: of gloom that she might seize the first sight of her whereabout,—that
21034: she might catch some faint suggestion of the spot toward which all her
21035: anxieties tended.
21036: 
21037: Oh, how welcome, the widening of that dismal watery level, the gradual
21038: uplifting of the cloudy firmament, the slowly defining blackness of
21039: objects above the glassy dark! Yes, she must be out on the fields;
21040: those were the tops of hedgerow trees. Which way did the river lie?
21041: Looking behind her, she saw the lines of black trees; looking before
21042: her, there were none; then the river lay before her. She seized an oar
21043: and began to paddle the boat forward with the energy of wakening hope;
21044: the dawning seemed to advance more swiftly, now she was in action; and
21045: she could soon see the poor dumb beasts crowding piteously on a mound
21046: where they had taken refuge. Onward she paddled and rowed by turns in
21047: the growing twilight; her wet clothes clung round her, and her
21048: streaming hair was dashed about by the wind, but she was hardly
21049: conscious of any bodily sensations,—except a sensation of strength,
21050: inspired by mighty emotion. Along with the sense of danger and possible
21051: rescue for those long-remembered beings at the old home, there was an
21052: undefined sense of reconcilement with her brother; what quarrel, what
21053: harshness, what unbelief in each other can subsist in the presence of a
21054: great calamity, when all the artificial vesture of our life is gone,
21055: and we are all one with each other in primitive mortal needs? Vaguely
21056: Maggie felt this, in the strong resurgent love toward her brother that
21057: swept away all the later impressions of hard, cruel offence and
21058: misunderstanding, and left only the deep, underlying, unshakable
21059: memories of early union.
21060: 
21061: But now there was a large dark mass in the distance, and near to her
21062: Maggie could discern the current of the river. The dark mass must
21063: be—yes, it was—St Ogg’s. Ah, now she knew which way to look for the
21064: first glimpse of the well-known trees—the gray willows, the now
21065: yellowing chestnuts—and above them the old roof! But there was no
21066: colour, no shape yet; all was faint and dim. More and more strongly the
21067: energies seemed to come and put themselves forth, as if her life were a
21068: stored-up force that was being spent in this hour, unneeded for any
21069: future.
21070: 
21071: She must get her boat into the current of the Floss, else she would
21072: never be able to pass the Ripple and approach the house; this was the
21073: thought that occurred to her, as she imagined with more and more
21074: vividness the state of things round the old home. But then she might be
21075: carried very far down, and be unable to guide her boat out of the
21076: current again. For the first time distinct ideas of danger began to
21077: press upon her; but there was no choice of courses, no room for
21078: hesitation, and she floated into the current. Swiftly she went now
21079: without effort; more and more clearly in the lessening distance and the
21080: growing light she began to discern the objects that she knew must be
21081: the well-known trees and roofs; nay, she was not far off a rushing,
21082: muddy current that must be the strangely altered Ripple.
21083: 
21084: Great God! there were floating masses in it, that might dash against
21085: her boat as she passed, and cause her to perish too soon. What were
21086: those masses?
21087: 
21088: For the first time Maggie’s heart began to beat in an agony of dread.
21089: She sat helpless, dimly conscious that she was being floated along,
21090: more intensely conscious of the anticipated clash. But the horror was
21091: transient; it passed away before the oncoming warehouses of St Ogg’s.
21092: She had passed the mouth of the Ripple, then; _now_, she must use all
21093: her skill and power to manage the boat and get it if possible out of
21094: the current. She could see now that the bridge was broken down; she
21095: could see the masts of a stranded vessel far out over the watery field.
21096: But no boats were to be seen moving on the river,—such as had been laid
21097: hands on were employed in the flooded streets.
21098: 
21099: With new resolution, Maggie seized her oar, and stood up again to
21100: paddle; but the now ebbing tide added to the swiftness of the river,
21101: and she was carried along beyond the bridge. She could hear shouts from
21102: the windows overlooking the river, as if the people there were calling
21103: to her. It was not till she had passed on nearly to Tofton that she
21104: could get the boat clear of the current. Then with one yearning look
21105: toward her uncle Deane’s house that lay farther down the river, she
21106: took to both her oars and rowed with all her might across the watery
21107: fields, back toward the Mill. Colour was beginning to awake now, and as
21108: she approached the Dorlcote fields, she could discern the tints of the
21109: trees, could see the old Scotch firs far to the right, and the home
21110: chestnuts,—oh, how deep they lay in the water,—deeper than the trees on
21111: this side the hill! And the roof of the Mill—where was it? Those heavy
21112: fragments hurrying down the Ripple,—what had they meant? But it was not
21113: the house,—the house stood firm; drowned up to the first story, but
21114: still firm,—or was it broken in at the end toward the Mill?
21115: 
21116: With panting joy that she was there at last,—joy that overcame all
21117: distress,—Maggie neared the front of the house. At first she heard no
21118: sound; she saw no object moving. Her boat was on a level with the
21119: upstairs window. She called out in a loud, piercing voice,—
21120: 
21121: “Tom, where are you? Mother, where are you? Here is Maggie!”
21122: 
21123: Soon, from the window of the attic in the central gable, she heard
21124: Tom’s voice,—
21125: 
21126: “Who is it? Have you brought a boat?”
21127: 
21128: “It is I, Tom,—Maggie. Where is mother?”
21129: 
21130: “She is not here; she went to Garum the day before yesterday. I’ll come
21131: down to the lower window.”
21132: 
21133: “Alone, Maggie?” said Tom, in a voice of deep astonishment, as he
21134: opened the middle window, on a level with the boat.
21135: 
21136: “Yes, Tom; God has taken care of me, to bring me to you. Get in
21137: quickly. Is there no one else?”
21138: 
21139: “No,” said Tom, stepping into the boat; “I fear the man is drowned; he
21140: was carried down the Ripple, I think, when part of the Mill fell with
21141: the crash of trees and stones against it; I’ve shouted again and again,
21142: and there has been no answer. Give me the oars, Maggie.”
21143: 
21144: It was not till Tom had pushed off and they were on the wide water,—he
21145: face to face with Maggie,—that the full meaning of what had happened
21146: rushed upon his mind. It came with so overpowering a force,—it was such
21147: a new revelation to his spirit, of the depths in life that had lain
21148: beyond his vision, which he had fancied so keen and clear,—that he was
21149: unable to ask a question. They sat mutely gazing at each other,—Maggie
21150: with eyes of intense life looking out from a weary, beaten face; Tom
21151: pale, with a certain awe and humiliation. Thought was busy though the
21152: lips were silent; and though he could ask no question, he guessed a
21153: story of almost miraculous, divinely protected effort. But at last a
21154: mist gathered over the blue-gray eyes, and the lips found a word they
21155: could utter,—the old childish “Magsie!”
21156: 
21157: Maggie could make no answer but a long, deep sob of that mysterious,
21158: wondrous happiness that is one with pain.
21159: 
21160: As soon as she could speak, she said, “We will go to Lucy, Tom; we’ll
21161: go and see if she is safe, and then we can help the rest.”
21162: 
21163: Tom rowed with untired vigor, and with a different speed from poor
21164: Maggie’s. The boat was soon in the current of the river again, and soon
21165: they would be at Tofton.
21166: 
21167: “Park House stands high up out of the flood,” said Maggie. “Perhaps
21168: they have got Lucy there.”
21169: 
21170: Nothing else was said; a new danger was being carried toward them by
21171: the river. Some wooden machinery had just given way on one of the
21172: wharves, and huge fragments were being floated along. The sun was
21173: rising now, and the wide area of watery desolation was spread out in
21174: dreadful clearness around them; in dreadful clearness floated onward
21175: the hurrying, threatening masses. A large company in a boat that was
21176: working its way along under the Tofton houses observed their danger,
21177: and shouted, “Get out of the current!”
21178: 
21179: But that could not be done at once; and Tom, looking before him, saw
21180: death rushing on them. Huge fragments, clinging together in fatal
21181: fellowship, made one wide mass across the stream.
21182: 
21183: “It is coming, Maggie!” Tom said, in a deep, hoarse voice, loosing the
21184: oars, and clasping her.
21185: 
21186: The next instant the boat was no longer seen upon the water, and the
21187: huge mass was hurrying on in hideous triumph.
21188: 
21189: But soon the keel of the boat reappeared, a black speck on the golden
21190: water.
21191: 
21192: The boat reappeared, but brother and sister had gone down in an embrace
21193: never to be parted; living through again in one supreme moment the days
21194: when they had clasped their little hands in love, and roamed the
21195: daisied fields together.
21196: 
21197: 
21198: Conclusion
21199: 
21200: Nature repairs her ravages,—repairs them with her sunshine, and with
21201: human labour. The desolation wrought by that flood had left little
21202: visible trace on the face of the earth, five years after. The fifth
21203: autumn was rich in golden cornstacks, rising in thick clusters among
21204: the distant hedgerows; the wharves and warehouses on the Floss were
21205: busy again, with echoes of eager voices, with hopeful lading and
21206: unlading.
21207: 
21208: And every man and woman mentioned in this history was still living,
21209: except those whose end we know.
21210: 
21211: Nature repairs her ravages, but not all. The uptorn trees are not
21212: rooted again; the parted hills are left scarred; if there is a new
21213: growth, the trees are not the same as the old, and the hills underneath
21214: their green vesture bear the marks of the past rending. To the eyes
21215: that have dwelt on the past, there is no thorough repair.
21216: 
21217: Dorlcote Mill was rebuilt. And Dorlcote churchyard—where the brick
21218: grave that held a father whom we know, was found with the stone laid
21219: prostrate upon it after the flood—had recovered all its grassy order
21220: and decent quiet.
21221: 
21222: Near that brick grave there was a tomb erected, very soon after the
21223: flood, for two bodies that were found in close embrace; and it was
21224: visited at different moments by two men who both felt that their
21225: keenest joy and keenest sorrow were forever buried there.
21226: 
21227: One of them visited the tomb again with a sweet face beside him; but
21228: that was years after.
21229: 
21230: The other was always solitary. His great companionship was among the
21231: trees of the Red Deeps, where the buried joy seemed still to hover,
21232: like a revisiting spirit.
21233: 
21234: The tomb bore the names of Tom and Maggie Tulliver, and below the names
21235: it was written,—
21236: 
21237: “In their death they were not divided.”
