86: PROEM.
87: 
88: 
89: More than three centuries and a half ago, in the mid spring-time of
90: 1492, we are sure that the angel of the dawn, as he travelled with
91: broad slow wing from the Levant to the Pillars of Hercules, and from
92: the summits of the Caucasus across all the snowy Alpine ridges to the
93: dark nakedness of the Western isles, saw nearly the same outline of
94: firm land and unstable sea—saw the same great mountain shadows on the
95: same valleys as he has seen to-day—saw olive mounts, and pine forests,
96: and the broad plains green with young corn or rain-freshened grass—saw
97: the domes and spires of cities rising by the river-sides or mingled
98: with the sedge-like masts on the many-curved sea-coast, in the same
99: spots where they rise to-day. And as the faint light of his course
100: pierced into the dwellings of men, it fell, as now, on the rosy warmth
101: of nestling children; on the haggard waking of sorrow and sickness; on
102: the hasty uprising of the hard-handed labourer; and on the late sleep
103: of the night-student, who had been questioning the stars or the sages,
104: or his own soul, for that hidden knowledge which would break through
105: the barrier of man’s brief life, and show its dark path, that seemed to
106: bend no whither, to be an arc in an immeasurable circle of light and
107: glory. The great river-courses which have shaped the lives of men have
108: hardly changed; and those other streams, the life-currents that ebb and
109: flow in human hearts, pulsate to the same great needs, the same great
110: loves and terrors. As our thought follows close in the slow wake of the
111: dawn, we are impressed with the broad sameness of the human lot, which
112: never alters in the main headings of its history—hunger and labour,
113: seed-time and harvest, love and death.
114: 
115: Even if, instead of following the dim daybreak, our imagination pauses
116: on a certain historical spot and awaits the fuller morning, we may see
117: a world-famous city, which has hardly changed its outline since the
118: days of Columbus, seeming to stand as an almost unviolated symbol,
119: amidst the flux of human things, to remind us that we still resemble
120: the men of the past more than we differ from them, as the great
121: mechanical principles on which those domes and towers were raised must
122: make a likeness in human building that will be broader and deeper than
123: all possible change. And doubtless, if the spirit of a Florentine
124: citizen, whose eyes were closed for the last time while Columbus was
125: still waiting and arguing for the three poor vessels with which he was
126: to set sail from the port of Palos, could return from the shades and
127: pause where our thought is pausing, he would believe that there must
128: still be fellowship and understanding for him among the inheritors of
129: his birthplace.
130: 
131: Let us suppose that such a Shade has been permitted to revisit the
132: glimpses of the golden morning, and is standing once more on the famous
133: hill of San Miniato, which overlooks Florence from the south.
134: 
135: The Spirit is clothed in his habit as he lived: the folds of his
136: well-lined black silk garment or _lucco_ hang in grave unbroken lines
137: from neck to ankle; his plain cloth cap, with its _becchetto_, or long
138: hanging strip of drapery, to serve as a scarf in case of need,
139: surmounts a penetrating face, not, perhaps, very handsome, but with a
140: firm, well-cut mouth, kept distinctly human by a close-shaven lip and
141: chin. It is a face charged with memories of a keen and various life
142: passed below there on the banks of the gleaming river; and as he looks
143: at the scene before him, the sense of familiarity is so much stronger
144: than the perception of change, that he thinks it might be possible to
145: descend once more amongst the streets, and take up that busy life where
146: he left it. For it is not only the mountains and the westward-bending
147: river that he recognises; not only the dark sides of Mount Morello
148: opposite to him, and the long valley of the Arno that seems to stretch
149: its grey low-tufted luxuriance to the far-off ridges of Carrara; and
150: the steep height of Fiesole, with its crown of monastic walls and
151: cypresses; and all the green and grey slopes sprinkled with villas
152: which he can name as he looks at them. He sees other familiar objects
153: much closer to his daily walks. For though he misses the seventy or
154: more towers that once surmounted the walls, and encircled the city as
155: with a regal diadem, his eyes will not dwell on that blank; they are
156: drawn irresistibly to the unique tower springing, like a tall
157: flower-stem drawn towards the sun, from the square turreted mass of the
158: Old Palace in the very heart of the city—the tower that looks none the
159: worse for the four centuries that have passed since he used to walk
160: under it. The great dome, too, greatest in the world, which, in his
161: early boyhood, had been only a daring thought in the mind of a small,
162: quick-eyed man—there it raises its large curves still, eclipsing the
163: hills. And the well-known bell-towers—Giotto’s, with its distant hint
164: of rich colour, and the graceful-spired Badia, and the rest—he looked
165: at them all from the shoulder of his nurse.
166: 
167: “Surely,” he thinks, “Florence can still ring her bells with the solemn
168: hammer-sound that used to beat on the hearts of her citizens and strike
169: out the fire there. And here, on the right, stands the long dark mass
170: of Santa Croce, where we buried our famous dead, laying the laurel on
171: their cold brows and fanning them with the breath of praise and of
172: banners. But Santa Croce had no spire then: we Florentines were too
173: full of great building projects to carry them all out in stone and
174: marble; we had our frescoes and our shrines to pay for, not to speak of
175: rapacious condottieri, bribed royalty, and purchased territories, and
176: our façades and spires must needs wait. But what architect can the
177: Frati Minori (the Franciscans) have employed to build that spire for
178: them? If it had been built in my day, Filippo Brunelleschi or
179: Michelozzo would have devised something of another fashion than
180: that—something worthy to crown the church of Arnolfo.”
181: 
182: At this the Spirit, with a sigh, lets his eyes travel on to the city
183: walls, and now he dwells on the change there with wonder at these
184: modern times. Why have five out of the eleven convenient gates been
185: closed? And why, above all, should the towers have been levelled that
186: were once a glory and defence? Is the world become so peaceful, then,
187: and do Florentines dwell in such harmony, that there are no longer
188: conspiracies to bring ambitious exiles home again with armed bands at
189: their back? These are difficult questions: it is easier and pleasanter
190: to recognise the old than to account for the new. And there flows Arno,
191: with its bridges just where they used to be—the Ponte Vecchio, least
192: like other bridges in the world, laden with the same quaint shops where
193: our Spirit remembers lingering a little on his way perhaps to look at
194: the progress of that great palace which Messer Luca Pitti had set
195: a-building with huge stones got from the Hill of Bogoli (now Boboli)
196: close behind, or perhaps to transact a little business with the
197: cloth-dressers in Oltrarno. The exorbitant line of the Pitti roof is
198: hidden from San Miniato; but the yearning of the old Florentine is not
199: to see Messer Luca’s too ambitious palace which he built unto himself;
200: it is to be down among those narrow streets and busy humming Piazze
201: where he inherited the eager life of his fathers. Is not the anxious
202: voting with black and white beans still going on down there? Who are
203: the Priori in these months, eating soberly-regulated official dinners
204: in the Palazzo Vecchio, with removes of tripe and boiled partridges,
205: seasoned by practical jokes against the ill-fated butt among those
206: potent signors? Are not the significant banners still hung from the
207: windows—still distributed with decent pomp under Orcagna’s Loggia every
208: two months?
209: 
210: Life had its zest for the old Florentine when he, too, trod the marble
211: steps and shared in those dignities. His politics had an area as wide
212: as his trade, which stretched from Syria to Britain, but they had also
213: the passionate intensity, and the detailed practical interest, which
214: could belong only to a narrow scene of corporate action; only to the
215: members of a community shut in close by the hills and by walls of six
216: miles’ circuit, where men knew each other as they passed in the street,
217: set their eyes every day on the memorials of their commonwealth, and
218: were conscious of having not simply the right to vote, but the chance
219: of being voted for. He loved his honours and his gains, the business of
220: his counting-house, of his guild, of the public council-chamber; he
221: loved his enmities too, and fingered the white bean which was to keep a
222: hated name out of the _borsa_ with more complacency than if it had been
223: a golden florin. He loved to strengthen his family by a good alliance,
224: and went home with a triumphant light in his eyes after concluding a
225: satisfactory marriage for his son or daughter under his favourite
226: loggia in the evening cool; he loved his game at chess under that same
227: loggia, and his biting jest, and even his coarse joke, as not beneath
228: the dignity of a man eligible for the highest magistracy. He had gained
229: an insight into all sorts of affairs at home and abroad: he had been of
230: the “Ten” who managed the war department, of the “Eight” who attended
231: to home discipline, of the Priori or Signori who were the heads of the
232: executive government; he had even risen to the supreme office of
233: Gonfaloniere; he had made one in embassies to the Pope and to the
234: Venetians; and he had been commissary to the hired army of the
235: Republic, directing the inglorious bloodless battles in which no man
236: died of brave breast wounds—_virtuosi colpi_—but only of casual falls
237: and tramplings. And in this way he had learned to distrust men without
238: bitterness; looking on life mainly as a game of skill, but not dead to
239: traditions of heroism and clean-handed honour. For the human soul is
240: hospitable, and will entertain conflicting sentiments and contradictory
241: opinions with much impartiality. It was his pride besides, that he was
242: duly tinctured with the learning of his age, and judged not altogether
243: with the vulgar, but in harmony with the ancients: he, too, in his
244: prime, had been eager for the most correct manuscripts, and had paid
245: many florins for antique vases and for disinterred busts of the ancient
246: immortals—some, perhaps, _truncis naribus_, wanting as to the nose, but
247: not the less authentic; and in his old age he had made haste to look at
248: the first sheets of that fine Homer which was among the early glories
249: of the Florentine press. But he had not, for all that, neglected to
250: hang up a waxen image or double of himself under the protection of the
251: Madonna Annunziata, or to do penance for his sins in large gifts to the
252: shrines of saints whose lives had not been modelled on the study of the
253: classics; he had not even neglected making liberal bequests towards
254: buildings for the Frati, against whom he had levelled many a jest.
255: 
256: For the Unseen Powers were mighty. Who knew—who was sure—that there was
257: _any_ name given to them behind which there was no angry force to be
258: appeased, no intercessory pity to be won? Were not gems medicinal,
259: though they only pressed the finger? Were not all things charged with
260: occult virtues? Lucretius might be right—he was an ancient, and a great
261: poet; Luigi Pulci, too, who was suspected of not believing anything
262: from the roof upward (_dal tetto in su_), had very much the air of
263: being right over the supper-table, when the wine and jests were
264: circulating fast, though he was only a poet in the vulgar tongue. There
265: were even learned personages who maintained that Aristotle, wisest of
266: men (unless, indeed, Plato were wiser?) was a thoroughly irreligious
267: philosopher; and a liberal scholar must entertain all speculations. But
268: the negatives might, after all, prove false; nay, seemed manifestly
269: false, as the circling hours swept past him, and turned round with
270: graver faces. For had not the world become Christian? Had he not been
271: baptised in San Giovanni, where the dome is awful with symbols of
272: coming judgment, and where the altar bears a crucified Image disturbing
273: to perfect complacency in one’s self and the world? Our resuscitated
274: Spirit was not a pagan philosopher, nor a philosophising pagan poet,
275: but a man of the fifteenth century, inheriting its strange web of
276: belief and unbelief; of Epicurean levity and fetichistic dread; of
277: pedantic impossible ethics uttered by rote, and crude passions acted
278: out with childish impulsiveness; of inclination towards a
279: self-indulgent paganism, and inevitable subjection to that human
280: conscience which, in the unrest of a new growth, was rilling the air
281: with strange prophecies and presentiments.
282: 
283: He had smiled, perhaps, and shaken his head dubiously, as he heard
284: simple folk talk of a Pope Angelico, who was to come by-and-by and
285: bring in a new order of things, to purify the Church from simony, and
286: the lives of the clergy from scandal—a state of affairs too different
287: from what existed under Innocent the Eighth for a shrewd merchant and
288: politician to regard the prospect as worthy of entering into his
289: calculations. But he felt the evils of the time, nevertheless; for he
290: was a man of public spirit, and public spirit can never be wholly
291: immoral, since its essence is care for a common good. That very
292: Quaresima or Lent of 1492 in which he died, still in his erect old age,
293: he had listened in San Lorenzo, not without a mixture of satisfaction,
294: to the preaching of a Dominican Friar, named Girolamo Savonarola, who
295: denounced with a rare boldness the worldliness and vicious habits of
296: the clergy, and insisted on the duty of Christian men not to live for
297: their own ease when wrong was triumphing in high places, and not to
298: spend their wealth in outward pomp even in the churches, when their
299: fellow-citizens were suffering from want and sickness. The Frate
300: carried his doctrine rather too far for elderly ears; yet it was a
301: memorable thing to see a preacher move his audience to such a pitch
302: that the women even took off their ornaments, and delivered them up to
303: be sold for the benefit of the needy.
304: 
305: “He was a noteworthy man, that Prior of San Marco,” thinks our Spirit;
306: “somewhat arrogant and extreme, perhaps, especially in his
307: denunciations of speedy vengeance. Ah, _Iddio non paga il Sabatol_
308: (‘God does not pay on a Saturday’)—the wages of men’s sins often linger
309: in their payment, and I myself saw much established wickedness of
310: long-standing prosperity. But a Frate Predicatore who wanted to move
311: the people—how could he be moderate? He might have been a little less
312: defiant and curt, though, to Lorenzo de’ Medici, whose family had been
313: the very makers of San Marco: was that quarrel ever made up? And our
314: Lorenzo himself, with the dim outward eyes and the subtle inward
315: vision, did he get over that illness at Careggi? It was but a sad,
316: uneasy-looking face that he would carry out of the world which had
317: given him so much, and there were strong suspicions that his handsome
318: son would play the part of Rehoboam. How has it all turned out? Which
319: party is likely to be banished and have its houses sacked just now? Is
320: there any successor of the incomparable Lorenzo, to whom the great Turk
321: is so gracious as to send over presents of rare animals, rare relics,
322: rare manuscripts, or fugitive enemies, suited to the tastes of a
323: Christian Magnifico who is at once lettered and devout—and also
324: slightly vindictive? And what famous scholar is dictating the Latin
325: letters of the Republic—what fiery philosopher is lecturing on Dante in
326: the Duomo, and going home to write bitter invectives against the father
327: and mother of the bad critic who may have found fault with his
328: classical spelling? Are our wiser heads leaning towards alliance with
329: the Pope and the Regno (The name given to Naples by way of distinction
330: among the Italian States), or are they rather inclining their ears to
331: the orators of France and of Milan?
332: 
333: “There is knowledge of these things to be had in the streets below, on
334: the beloved _marmi_ in front of the churches, and under the sheltering
335: Loggie, where surely our citizens have still their gossip and debates,
336: their bitter and merry jests as of old. For are not the well-remembered
337: buildings all there? The changes have not been so great in those
338: uncounted years. I will go down and hear—I will tread the familiar
339: pavement, and hear once again the speech of Florentines.”
340: 
341: Go not down, good Spirit! for the changes are great and the speech of
342: Florentines would sound as a riddle in your ears. Or, if you go, mingle
343: with no politicians on the _marmi_, or elsewhere; ask no questions
344: about trade in the Calimara; confuse yourself with no inquiries into
345: scholarship, official or monastic. Only look at the sunlight and
346: shadows on the grand walls that were built solidly, and have endured in
347: their grandeur; look at the faces of the little children, making
348: another sunlight amid the shadows of age; look, if you will, into the
349: churches, and hear the same chants, see the same images as of old—the
350: images of willing anguish for a great end, of beneficent love and
351: ascending glory; see upturned living faces, and lips moving to the old
352: prayers for help. These things have not changed. The sunlight and
353: shadows bring their old beauty and waken the old heart-strains at
354: morning, noon, and eventide; the little children are still the symbol
355: of the eternal marriage between love and duty; and men still yearn for
356: the reign of peace and righteousness—still own _that_ life to be the
357: highest which is a conscious voluntary sacrifice. For the Pope Angelico
358: is not come yet.
359: 
360: 
361: 
362: 
363: CHAPTER I.
364: The Shipwrecked Stranger.
365: 
366: 
367: The Loggia de’ Cerchi stood in the heart of old Florence, within a
368: labyrinth of narrow streets behind the Badia, now rarely threaded by
369: the stranger, unless in a dubious search for a certain severely simple
370: doorplace, bearing this inscription:
371: 
372: 
373: Qui Nacque Il Divino Poeta.
374: 
375: 
376: To the ear of Dante, the same streets rang with the shout and clash of
377: fierce battle between rival families; but in the fifteenth century,
378: they were only noisy with the unhistorical quarrels and broad jests of
379: woolcarders in the cloth-producing quarters of San Martino and Garbo.
380: 
381: Under this loggia, in the early morning of the 9th of April 1492, two
382: men had their eyes fixed on each other: one was stooping slightly, and
383: looking downward with the scrutiny of curiosity; the other, lying on
384: the pavement, was looking upward with the startled gaze of a
385: suddenly-awakened dreamer.
386: 
387: The standing figure was the first to speak. He was a grey-haired,
388: broad-shouldered man, of the type which, in Tuscan phrase, is moulded
389: with the fist and polished with the pickaxe; but the self-important
390: gravity which had written itself out in the deep lines about his brow
391: and mouth seemed intended to correct any contemptuous inferences from
392: the hasty workmanship which Nature had bestowed on his exterior. He had
393: deposited a large well-filled bag, made of skins, on the pavement, and
394: before him hung a pedlar’s basket, garnished partly with small
395: woman’s-ware, such as thread and pins, and partly with fragments of
396: glass, which had probably been taken in exchange for those commodities.
397: 
398: “Young man,” he said, pointing to a ring on the finger of the reclining
399: figure, “when your chin has got a stiffer crop on it, you’ll know
400: better than to take your nap in street-corners with a ring like that on
401: your forefinger. By the holy ’vangels! if it had been anybody but me
402: standing over you two minutes ago—but Bratti Ferravecchi is not the man
403: to steal. The cat couldn’t eat her mouse if she didn’t catch it alive,
404: and Bratti couldn’t relish gain if it had no taste of a bargain. Why,
405: young man, one San Giovanni, three years ago, the Saint sent a dead
406: body in my way—a blind beggar, with his cap well-lined with pieces—but,
407: if you’ll believe me, my stomach turned against the money I’d never
408: bargained for, till it came into my head that San Giovanni owed me the
409: pieces for what I spend yearly at the Festa; besides, I buried the body
410: and paid for a mass—and so I saw it was a fair bargain. But how comes a
411: young man like you, with the face of Messer San Michele, to be sleeping
412: on a stone bed with the wind for a curtain?”
413: 
414: The deep guttural sounds of the speaker were scarcely intelligible to
415: the newly-waked, bewildered listener, but he understood the action of
416: pointing to his ring: he looked down at it, and, with a half-automatic
417: obedience to the warning, took it off and thrust it within his doublet,
418: rising at the same time and stretching himself.
419: 
420: “Your tunic and hose match ill with that jewel, young man,” said
421: Bratti, deliberately. “Anybody might say the saints had sent _you_ a
422: dead body; but if you took the jewels, I hope you buried him—and you
423: can afford a mass or two for him into the bargain.”
424: 
425: Something like a painful thrill appeared to dart through the frame of
426: the listener, and arrest the careless stretching of his arms and chest.
427: For an instant he turned on Bratti with a sharp frown; but he
428: immediately recovered an air of indifference, took off the red
429: Levantine cap which hung like a great purse over his left ear, pushed
430: back his long dark-brown curls, and glancing at his dress, said,
431: smilingly—
432: 
433: “You speak truth, friend: my garments are as weather-stained as an old
434: sail, and they are not old either, only, like an old sail, they have
435: had a sprinkling of the sea as well as the rain. The fact is, I’m a
436: stranger in Florence, and when I came in footsore last night I
437: preferred flinging myself in a corner of this hospitable porch to
438: hunting any longer for a chance hostelry, which might turn out to be a
439: nest of blood-suckers of more sorts than one.”
440: 
441: “A stranger, in good sooth,” said Bratti, “for the words come all
442: melting out of your throat, so that a Christian and a Florentine can’t
443: tell a hook from a hanger. But you’re not from Genoa? More likely from
444: Venice, by the cut of your clothes?”
445: 
446: “At this present moment,” said the stranger, smiling, “it is of less
447: importance where I come from than where I can go to for a mouthful of
448: breakfast. This city of yours turns a grim look on me just here: can
449: you show me the way to a more lively quarter, where I can get a meal
450: and a lodging?”
451: 
452: “That I can,” said Bratti, “and it is your good fortune, young man,
453: that I have happened to be walking in from Rovezzano this morning, and
454: turned out of my way to Mercato Vecchio to say an Ave at the Badia.
455: That, I say, is your good fortune. But it remains to be seen what is my
456: profit in the matter. Nothing for nothing, young man. If I show you the
457: way to Mercato Vecchio, you’ll swear by your patron saint to let me
458: have the bidding for that stained suit of yours, when you set up a
459: better—as doubtless you will.”
460: 
461: “Agreed, by San Niccolò,” said the other, laughing. “But now let us set
462: off to this said Mercato, for I feel the want of a better lining to
463: this doublet of mine which you are coveting.”
464: 
465: “Coveting? Nay,” said Bratti, heaving his bag on his back and setting
466: out. But he broke off in his reply, and burst out in loud, harsh tones,
467: not unlike the creaking and grating of a cart-wheel: “_Chi
468: abbaratta_—_baratta_—_b’ratta_—_chi abbaratta cenci e vetri_—_b’ratta
469: ferri vecchi_?” (“Who wants to exchange rags, broken glass, or old
470: iron?”)
471: 
472: “It’s worth but little,” he said presently, relapsing into his
473: conversational tone. “Hose and altogether, your clothes are worth but
474: little. Still, if you’ve a mind to set yourself up with a lute worth
475: more than any new one, or with a sword that’s been worn by a Ridolfi,
476: or with a paternoster of the best mode, I could let you have a great
477: bargain, by making an allowance for the clothes; for, simple as I stand
478: here, I’ve got the best-furnished shop in the Ferravecchi, and it’s
479: close by the Mercato. The Virgin be praised! it’s not a pumpkin I carry
480: on my shoulders. But I don’t stay caged in my shop all day: I’ve got a
481: wife and a raven to stay at home and mind the stock. _Chi
482: abbaratta_—_baratta_—_b’ratta_? ... And now, young man, where do you
483: come from, and what’s your business in Florence?”
484: 
485: “I thought you liked nothing that came to you without a bargain,” said
486: the stranger. “You’ve offered me nothing yet in exchange for that
487: information.”
488: 
489: “Well, well; a Florentine doesn’t mind bidding a fair price for news:
490: it stays the stomach a little though he may win no hose by it. If I
491: take you to the prettiest damsel in the Mercato to get a cup of
492: milk—that will be a fair bargain.”
493: 
494: “Nay; I can find her myself, if she be really in the Mercato; for
495: pretty heads are apt to look forth of doors and windows. No, no.
496: Besides, a sharp trader, like you, ought to know that he who bids for
497: nuts and news, may chance to find them hollow.”
498: 
499: “Ah! young man,” said Bratti, with a sideway glance of some admiration,
500: “you were not born of a Sunday—the salt-shops were open when you came
501: into the world. You’re not a Hebrew, eh?—come from Spain or Naples, eh?
502: Let me tell you the Frati Minori are trying to make Florence as hot as
503: Spain for those dogs of hell that want to get all the profit of usury
504: to themselves and leave none for Christians; and when you walk the
505: Calimara with a piece of yellow cloth in your cap, it will spoil your
506: beauty more than a sword-cut across that smooth olive cheek of
507: yours.—_Abbaratta, baratta_—_chi abbaratta_?—I tell you, young man,
508: grey cloth is against yellow cloth; and there’s as much grey cloth in
509: Florence as would make a gown and cowl for the Duomo, and there’s not
510: so much yellow cloth as would make hose for Saint Christopher—blessed
511: be his name, and send me a sight of him this day!—_Abbaratta, baratta,
512: b’ratta_—_chi abbaratta_?”
513: 
514: “All that is very amusing information you are parting with for
515: nothing,” said the stranger, rather scornfully; “but it happens not to
516: concern me. I am no Hebrew.”
517: 
518: “See, now!” said Bratti, triumphantly; “I’ve made a good bargain with
519: mere words. I’ve made you tell me something, young man, though you’re
520: as hard to hold as a lamprey. San Giovanni be praised! a blind
521: Florentine is a match for two one-eyed men. But here we are in the
522: Mercato.”
523: 
524: They had now emerged from the narrow streets into a broad piazza, known
525: to the elder Florentine writers as the Mercato Vecchio, or the Old
526: Market. This piazza, though it had been the scene of a provision-market
527: from time immemorial, and may, perhaps, says fond imagination, be the
528: very spot to which the Fesulean ancestors of the Florentines descended
529: from their high fastness to traffic with the rustic population of the
530: valley, had not been shunned as a place of residence by Florentine
531: wealth. In the early decades of the fifteenth century, which was now
532: near its end, the Medici and other powerful families of the _popolani
533: grassi_, or commercial nobility, had their houses there, not perhaps
534: finding their ears much offended by the loud roar of mingled dialects,
535: or their eyes much shocked by the butchers’ stalls, which the old poet
536: Antonio Pucci accounts a chief glory, or _dignita_, of a market that,
537: in his esteem, eclipsed the markets of all the earth beside. But the
538: glory of mutton and veal (well attested to be the flesh of the right
539: animals; for were not the skins, with the heads attached, duly
540: displayed, according to the decree of the Signoria?) was just now
541: wanting to the Mercato, the time of Lent not being yet over. The proud
542: corporation, or “Art,” of butchers was in abeyance, and it was the
543: great harvest-time of the market-gardeners, the cheesemongers, the
544: vendors of macaroni, corn, eggs, milk, and dried fruits: a change which
545: was apt to make the women’s voices predominant in the chorus. But in
546: all seasons there was the experimental ringing of pots and pans, the
547: chinking of the money-changers, the tempting offers of cheapness at the
548: old-clothes stalls, the challenges of the dicers, the vaunting of new
549: linens and woollens, of excellent wooden-ware, kettles, and
550: frying-pans; there was the choking of the narrow inlets with mules and
551: carts, together with much uncomplimentary remonstrance in terms
552: remarkably identical with the insults in use by the gentler sex of the
553: present day, under the same imbrowning and heating circumstances.
554: Ladies and gentlemen, who came to market, looked on at a larger amount
555: of amateur fighting than could easily be seen in these later times, and
556: beheld more revolting rags, beggary, and rascaldom, than modern
557: householders could well picture to themselves. As the day wore on, the
558: hideous drama of the gaming-house might be seen here by any chance
559: open-air spectator—the quivering eagerness, the blank despair, the
560: sobs, the blasphemy, and the blows:—
561: 
562: 
563: “E vedesi chi perde con gran soffi,
564: E bestemmiar colla mano alia mascella,
565: E ricever e dar di molti ingoffi.”
566: 
567: 
568: But still there was the relief of prettier sights: there were
569: brood-rabbits, not less innocent and astonished than those of our own
570: period; there were doves and singing-birds to be bought as presents for
571: the children; there were even kittens for sale, and here and there a
572: handsome _gattuccio_, or “Tom,” with the highest character for mousing;
573: and, better than all, there were young, softly-rounded cheeks and
574: bright eyes, freshened by the start from the far-off castello (walled
575: village) at daybreak, not to speak of older faces with the unfading
576: charm of honest goodwill in them, such as are never quite wanting in
577: scenes of human industry. And high on a pillar in the centre of the
578: place—a venerable pillar, fetched from the church of San Giovanni—stood
579: Donatello’s stone statue of Plenty, with a fountain near it, where,
580: says old Pucci, the good wives of the market freshened their utensils,
581: and their throats also; not because they were unable to buy wine, but
582: because they wished to save the money for their husbands.
583: 
584: But on this particular morning a sudden change seemed to have come over
585: the face of the market. The _deschi_, or stalls, were indeed partly
586: dressed with their various commodities, and already there were
587: purchasers assembled, on the alert to secure the finest, freshest
588: vegetables and the most unexceptionable butter. But when Bratti and his
589: companion entered the piazza, it appeared that some common
590: preoccupation had for the moment distracted the attention both of
591: buyers and sellers from their proper business. Most of the traders had
592: turned their backs on their goods, and had joined the knots of talkers
593: who were concentrating themselves at different points in the piazza. A
594: vendor of old-clothes, in the act of hanging out a pair of long hose,
595: had distractedly hung them round his neck in his eagerness to join the
596: nearest group; an oratorical cheesemonger, with a piece of cheese in
597: one hand and a knife in the other, was incautiously making notes of his
598: emphatic pauses on that excellent specimen of _marzolino_; and elderly
599: market-women, with their egg-baskets in a dangerously oblique position,
600: contributed a wailing fugue of invocation.
601: 
602: In this general distraction, the Florentine boys, who were never
603: wanting in any street scene, and were of an especially mischievous
604: sort—as who should say, very sour crabs indeed—saw a great opportunity.
605: Some made a rush at the nuts and dried figs, others preferred the
606: farinaceous delicacies at the cooked provision stalls—delicacies to
607: which certain four-footed dogs also, who had learned to take kindly to
608: Lenten fare, applied a discriminating nostril, and then disappeared
609: with much rapidity under the nearest shelter; while the mules, not
610: without some kicking and plunging among impeding baskets, were
611: stretching their muzzles towards the aromatic green-meat.
612: 
613: “Diavolo!” said Bratti, as he and his companion came, quite unnoticed,
614: upon the noisy scene; “the Mercato is gone as mad as if the most Holy
615: Father had excommunicated us again. I must know what this is. But never
616: fear: it seems a thousand years to you till you see the pretty Tessa,
617: and get your cup of milk; but keep hold of me, and I’ll hold to my
618: bargain. Remember, I’m to have the first bid for your suit, specially
619: for the hose, which, with all their stains, are the best _panno di
620: garbo_—as good as ruined, though, with mud and weather stains.”
621: 
622: “Ola, Monna Trecca,” Bratti proceeded, turning towards an old woman on
623: the outside of the nearest group, who for the moment had suspended her
624: wail to listen, and shouting close in her ear: “Here are the mules
625: upsetting all your bunches of parsley: is the world coming to an end,
626: then?”
627: 
628: “Monna Trecca” (equivalent to “Dame Greengrocer”) turned round at this
629: unexpected trumpeting in her right ear, with a half-fierce,
630: half-bewildered look, first at the speaker, then at her disarranged
631: commodities, and then at the speaker again.
632: 
633: “A bad Easter and a bad year to you, and may you die by the sword!” she
634: burst out, rushing towards her stall, but directing this first volley
635: of her wrath against Bratti, who, without heeding the malediction,
636: quietly slipped into her place, within hearing of the narrative which
637: had been absorbing her attention; making a sign at the same time to the
638: younger stranger to keep near him.
639: 
640: “I tell you I saw it myself,” said a fat man, with a bunch of
641: newly-purchased leeks in his hand. “I was in Santa Maria Novella, and
642: saw it myself. The woman started up and threw out her arms, and cried
643: out and said she saw a big bull with fiery horns coming down on the
644: church to crush it. I saw it myself.”
645: 
646: “Saw what, Goro?” said a man of slim figure, whose eye twinkled rather
647: roguishly. He wore a close jerkin, a skull-cap lodged carelessly over
648: his left ear as if it had fallen there by chance, a delicate linen
649: apron tucked up on one side, and a razor stuck in his belt. “Saw the
650: bull, or only the woman?”
651: 
652: “Why, the woman, to be sure; but it’s all one, _mi pare_: it doesn’t
653: alter the meaning—_va_!” answered the fat man, with some contempt.
654: 
655: “Meaning? no, no; that’s clear enough,” said several voices at once,
656: and then followed a confusion of tongues, in which “Lights shooting
657: over San Lorenzo for three nights together”—“Thunder in the clear
658: starlight”—“Lantern of the Duomo struck with the sword of Saint
659: Michael”—“_Palle_” (Arms of the Medici)—“All smashed”—“Lions tearing
660: each other to pieces”—“Ah! and they might well”—“_Boto_[1] _caduto in
661: Santissima Nunziata_!”—“Died like the best of Christians”—“God will
662: have pardoned him”—were often-repeated phrases, which shot across each
663: other like storm-driven hailstones, each speaker feeling rather the
664: necessity of utterance than of finding a listener. Perhaps the only
665: silent members of the group were Bratti, who, as a new-comer, was busy
666: in mentally piecing together the flying fragments of information; the
667: man of the razor; and a thin-lipped, eager-looking personage in
668: spectacles, wearing a pen-and-ink case at his belt.
669: 
670:  [1] A votive image of Lorenzo, in wax, hung up in the Church of the
671:  Annunziata, supposed to have fallen at the time of his death. _Boto_
672:  is popular Tuscan for _Voto_.
673: 
674: 
675: “_Ebbene_, Nello,” said Bratti, skirting the group till he was within
676: hearing of the barber. “It appears the Magnifico is dead—rest his
677: soul!—and the price of wax will rise?”
678: 
679: “Even as you say,” answered Nello; and then added, with an air of extra
680: gravity, but with marvellous rapidity, “and his waxen image in the
681: Nunziata fell at the same moment, they say; or at some other time,
682: whenever it pleases the Frati Serviti, who know best. And several cows
683: and women have had still-born calves this Quaresima; and for the bad
684: eggs that have been broken since the Carnival, nobody has counted them.
685: Ah! a great man—a great politician—a greater poet than Dante. And yet
686: the cupola didn’t fall, only the lantern. _Che miracolo_!”
687: 
688: A sharp and lengthened “Pst!” was suddenly heard darting across the
689: pelting storm of gutturals. It came from the pale man in spectacles,
690: and had the effect he intended; for the noise ceased, and all eyes in
691: the group were fixed on him with a look of expectation.
692: 
693: “’Tis well said you Florentines are blind,” he began, in an incisive
694: high voice. “It appears to me, you need nothing but a diet of hay to
695: make cattle of you. What! do you think the death of Lorenzo is the
696: scourge God has prepared for Florence? Go! you are sparrows chattering
697: praise over the dead hawk. What! a man who was trying to slip a noose
698: over every neck in the Republic that he might tighten it at his
699: pleasure! You like that; you like to have the election of your
700: magistrates turned into closet-work, and no man to use the rights of a
701: citizen unless he is a Medicean. That is what is meant by qualification
702: now: _netto di specchio_[2] no longer means that a man pays his dues to
703: the Republic: it means that he’ll wink at robbery of the people’s
704: money—at robbery of their daughters’ dowries; that he’ll play the
705: chamberer and the philosopher by turns—listen to bawdy songs at the
706: Carnival and cry ‘Bellissimi!’—and listen to sacred lauds and cry again
707: ‘Bellissimi!’ But this is what you love: you grumble and raise a riot
708: over your _quattrini bianchi_” (white farthings); “but you take no
709: notice when the public treasury has got a hole in the bottom for the
710: gold to run into Lorenzo’s drains. You like to pay for footmen to walk
711: before and behind one of your citizens, that he may be affable and
712: condescending to you. ‘See, what a tall Pisan we keep,’ say you, ‘to
713: march before him with the drawn sword flashing in our eyes!—and yet
714: Lorenzo smiles at us. What goodness!’ And you think the death of a man,
715: who would soon have saddled and bridled you as the Sforza has saddled
716: and bridled Milan—you think his death is the scourge God is warning you
717: of by portents. I tell you there is another sort of scourge in the
718: air.”
719: 
720:  [2] The phrase used to express the absence of disqualification—i.e.,
721:  the not being entered as a debtor in the public book—_specchio_.
722: 
723: 
724: “Nay, nay, Ser Cioni, keep astride your politics, and never mount your
725: prophecy; politics is the better horse,” said Nello. “But if you talk
726: of portents, what portent can be greater than a pious notary? Balaam’s
727: ass was nothing to it.”
728: 
729: “Ay, but a notary out of work, with his inkbottle dry,” said another
730: bystander, very much out at elbows. “Better don a cowl at once, Ser
731: Cioni: everybody will believe in your fasting.”
732: 
733: The notary turned and left the group with a look of indignant contempt,
734: disclosing, as he did so, the sallow but mild face of a short man who
735: had been standing behind him, and whose bent shoulders told of some
736: sedentary occupation.
737: 
738: “By San Giovanni, though,” said the fat purchaser of leeks, with the
739: air of a person rather shaken in his theories, “I am not sure there
740: isn’t some truth in what Ser Cioni says. For I know I have good reason
741: to find fault with the _quattrini bianchi_ myself. Grumble, did he say?
742: Suffocation! I should think we do grumble; and, let anybody say the
743: word, I’ll turn out into the piazza with the readiest, sooner than have
744: our money altered in our hands as if the magistracy were so many
745: necromancers. And it’s true Lorenzo might have hindered such work if he
746: would—and for the bull with the flaming horns, why, as Ser Cioni says,
747: there may be many meanings to it, for the matter of that; it may have
748: more to do with the taxes than we think. For when God above sends a
749: sign, it’s not to be supposed he’d have only one meaning.”
750: 
751: “Spoken like an oracle, Goro!” said the barber. “Why, when we poor
752: mortals can pack two or three meanings into one sentence, it were mere
753: blasphemy not to believe that your miraculous bull means everything
754: that any man in Florence likes it to mean.”
755: 
756: “Thou art pleased to scoff, Nello,” said the sallow, round-shouldered
757: man, no longer eclipsed by the notary, “but it is not the less true
758: that every revelation, whether by visions, dreams, portents, or the
759: written word, has many meanings, which it is given to the illuminated
760: only to unfold.”
761: 
762: “Assuredly,” answered Nello. “Haven’t I been to hear the Frate in San
763: Lorenzo? But then, I’ve been to hear Fra Menico in the Duomo too; and
764: according to him, your Fra Girolamo, with his visions and
765: interpretations, is running after the wind of Mongibello, and those who
766: follow him are like to have the fate of certain swine that ran headlong
767: into the sea—or some hotter place. With San Domenico roaring _è vero_
768: in one ear, and San Francisco screaming _è falso_ in the other, what is
769: a poor barber to do—unless he were illuminated? But it’s plain our Goro
770: here is beginning to be illuminated for he already sees that the bull
771: with the flaming horns means first himself, and secondly all the other
772: aggrieved taxpayers of Florence, who are determined to gore the
773: magistracy on the first opportunity.”
774: 
775: “Goro is a fool!” said a bass voice, with a note that dropped like the
776: sound of a great bell in the midst of much tinkling. “Let him carry
777: home his leeks and shake his flanks over his wool-beating. He’ll mend
778: matters more that way than by showing his tun-shaped body in the
779: piazza, as if everybody might measure his grievances by the size of his
780: paunch. The burdens that harm him most are his heavy carcass and his
781: idleness.”
782: 
783: The speaker had joined the group only in time to hear the conclusion of
784: Nello’s speech, but he was one of those figures for whom all the world
785: instinctively makes way, as it would for a battering-ram. He was not
786: much above the middle height, but the impression of enormous force
787: which was conveyed by his capacious chest and brawny arms bared to the
788: shoulder, was deepened by the keen sense and quiet resolution expressed
789: in his glance and in every furrow of his cheek and brow. He had often
790: been an unconscious model to Domenico Ghirlandajo, when that great
791: painter was making the walls of the churches reflect the life of
792: Florence, and translating pale aerial traditions into the deep colour
793: and strong lines of the faces he knew. The naturally dark tint of his
794: skin was additionally bronzed by the same powdery deposit that gave a
795: polished black surface to his leathern apron: a deposit which habit had
796: probably made a necessary condition of perfect ease, for it was not
797: washed off with punctilious regularity.
798: 
799: Goro turned his fat cheek and glassy eye on the frank speaker with a
800: look of deprecation rather than of resentment.
801: 
802: “Why, Niccolò,” he said, in an injured tone, “I’ve heard you sing to
803: another tune than that, often enough, when you’ve been laying down the
804: law at San Gallo on a festa. I’ve heard you say yourself, that a man
805: wasn’t a mill-wheel, to be on the grind, grind, as long as he was
806: driven, and then stick in his place without stirring when the water was
807: low. And you’re as fond of your vote as any man in Florence—ay, and
808: I’ve heard you say, if Lorenzo—”
809: 
810: “Yes, yes,” said Niccolò. “Don’t you be bringing up my speeches again
811: after you’ve swallowed them, and handing them about as if they were
812: none the worse. I vote and I speak when there’s any use in it: if
813: there’s hot metal on the anvil, I lose no time before I strike; but I
814: don’t spend good hours in tinkling on cold iron, or in standing on the
815: pavement as thou dost, Goro, with snout upward, like a pig under an
816: oak-tree. And as for Lorenzo—dead and gone before his time—he was a man
817: who had an eye for curious iron-work; and if anybody says he wanted to
818: make himself a tyrant, I say, ‘_Sia_; I’ll not deny which way the wind
819: blows when every man can see the weathercock.’ But that only means that
820: Lorenzo was a crested hawk, and there are plenty of hawks without
821: crests whose claws and beaks are as good for tearing. Though if there
822: was any chance of a real reform, so that Marzocco (the stone Lion,
823: emblem of the Republic) might shake his mane and roar again, instead of
824: dipping his head to lick the feet of anybody that will mount and ride
825: him, I’d strike a good blow for it.”
826: 
827: “And that reform is not far off, Niccolò,” said the sallow, mild-faced
828: man, seizing his opportunity like a missionary among the too
829: light-minded heathens; “for a time of tribulation is coming, and the
830: scourge is at hand. And when the Church is purged of cardinals and
831: prelates who traffic in her inheritance that their hands may be full to
832: pay the price of blood and to satisfy their own lusts, the State will
833: be purged too—and Florence will be purged of men who love to see
834: avarice and lechery under the red hat and the mitre because it gives
835: them the screen of a more hellish vice than their own.”
836: 
837: “Ay, as Goro’s broad body would be a screen for my narrow person in
838: case of missiles,” said Nello; “but if that excellent screen happened
839: to fall, I were stifled under it, surely enough. That is no bad image
840: of thine, Nanni—or, rather, of the Frate’s; for I fancy there is no
841: room in the small cup of thy understanding for any other liquor than
842: what he pours into it.”
843: 
844: “And it were well for thee, Nello,” replied Nanni, “if thou couldst
845: empty thyself of thy scoffs and thy jests, and take in that liquor too.
846: The warning is ringing in the ears of all men: and it’s no new story;
847: for the Abbot Joachim prophesied of the coming time three hundred years
848: ago, and now Fra Girolamo has got the message afresh. He has seen it in
849: a vision, even as the prophets of old: he has seen the sword hanging
850: from the sky.”
851: 
852: “Ay, and thou wilt see it thyself, Nanni, if thou wilt stare upward
853: long enough,” said Niccolò; “for that pitiable tailor’s work of thine
854: makes thy noddle so overhang thy legs, that thy eyeballs can see nought
855: above the stitching-board but the roof of thy own skull.”
856: 
857: The honest tailor bore the jest without bitterness, bent on convincing
858: his hearers of his doctrine rather than of his dignity. But Niccolò
859: gave him no opportunity for replying; for he turned away to the pursuit
860: of his market business, probably considering further dialogue as a
861: tinkling on cold iron.
862: 
863: “_Ebbene_” said the man with the hose round his neck, who had lately
864: migrated from another knot of talkers, “they are safest who cross
865: themselves and jest at nobody. Do you know that the Magnifico sent for
866: the Frate at the last, and couldn’t die without his blessing?”
867: 
868: “Was it so—in truth?” said several voices. “Yes, yes—God will have
869: pardoned him.”
870: 
871: “He died like the best of Christians.”
872: 
873: “Never took his eyes from the holy crucifix.”
874: 
875: “And the Frate will have given him his blessing?”
876: 
877: “Well, I know no more,” said he of the hosen, “only Guccio there met a
878: footman going back to Careggi, and he told him the Frate had been sent
879: for yesternight, after the Magnifico had confessed and had the holy
880: sacraments.”
881: 
882: “It’s likely enough the Frate will tell the people something about it
883: in his sermon this morning; is it not true, Nanni?” said Goro. “What do
884: you think?”
885: 
886: But Nanni had already turned his back on Goro, and the group was
887: rapidly thinning; some being stirred by the impulse to go and hear “new
888: things” from the Frate (“new things” were the nectar of Florentines);
889: others by the sense that it was time to attend to their private
890: business. In this general movement, Bratti got close to the barber, and
891: said—
892: 
893: “Nello, you’ve a ready tongue of your own, and are used to worming
894: secrets out of people when you’ve once got them well lathered. I picked
895: up a stranger this morning as I was coming in from Rovezzano, and I can
896: spell him out no better than I can the letters on that scarf I bought
897: from the French cavalier. It isn’t my wits are at fault,—I want no man
898: to help me tell peas from paternosters,—but when you come to foreign
899: fashions, a fool may happen to know more than a wise man.”
900: 
901: “Ay, thou hast the wisdom of Midas, who could turn rags and rusty nails
902: into gold, even as thou dost,” said Nello, “and he had also something
903: of the ass about him. But where is thy bird of strange plumage?”
904: 
905: Bratti was looking round, with an air of disappointment.
906: 
907: “Diavolo!” he said, with some vexation. “The bird’s flown. It’s true he
908: was hungry, and I forgot him. But we shall find him in the Mercato,
909: within scent of bread and savours, I’ll answer for him.”
910: 
911: “Let us make the round of the Mercato, then,” said Nello.
912: 
913: “It isn’t his feathers that puzzle me,” continued Bratti, as they
914: pushed their way together. “There isn’t much in the way of cut and
915: cloth on this side the Holy Sepulchre that can puzzle a Florentine.”
916: 
917: “Or frighten him either,” said Nello, “after he has seen an Englander
918: or a German.”
919: 
920: “No, no,” said Bratti, cordially; “one may never lose sight of the
921: Cupola and yet know the world, I hope. Besides, this stranger’s clothes
922: are good Italian merchandise, and the hose he wears were dyed in
923: Ognissanti before ever they were dyed with salt water, as he says. But
924: the riddle about him is—”
925: 
926: Here Bratti’s explanation was interrupted by some jostling as they
927: reached one of the entrances of the piazza, and before he could resume
928: it they had caught sight of the enigmatical object they were in search
929: of.
930: 
931: 
932: 
933: 
934: CHAPTER II.
935: Breakfast for Love.
936: 
937: 
938: After Bratti had joined the knot of talkers, the young stranger,
939: hopeless of learning what was the cause of the general agitation, and
940: not much caring to know what was probably of little interest to any but
941: born Florentines, soon became tired of waiting for Bratti’s escort; and
942: chose to stroll round the piazza, looking out for some vendor of
943: eatables who might happen to have less than the average curiosity about
944: public news. But as if at the suggestion of a sudden thought, he thrust
945: his hand into a purse or wallet that hung at his waist, and explored it
946: again and again with a look of frustration.
947: 
948: “Not an obolus, by Jupiter!” he murmured, in a language which was not
949: Tuscan or even Italian. “I thought I had one poor piece left. I must
950: get my breakfast for love, then!”
951: 
952: He had not gone many steps farther before it seemed likely that he had
953: found a quarter of the market where that medium of exchange might not
954: be rejected.
955: 
956: In a corner, away from any group of talkers, two mules were standing,
957: well adorned with red tassels and collars. One of them carried wooden
958: milk-vessels, the other a pair of panniers filled with herbs and
959: salads. Resting her elbow on the neck of the mule that carried the
960: milk, there leaned a young girl, apparently not more than sixteen, with
961: a red hood surrounding her face, which was all the more baby-like in
962: its prettiness from the entire concealment of her hair. The poor child,
963: perhaps, was weary after her labour in the morning twilight in
964: preparation for her walk to market from some castello three or four
965: miles off, for she seemed to have gone to sleep in that half-standing,
966: half-leaning posture. Nevertheless, our stranger had no compunction in
967: awaking her; but the means he chose were so gentle, that it seemed to
968: the damsel in her dream as if a little sprig of thyme had touched her
969: lips while she was stooping to gather the herbs. The dream was broken,
970: however, for she opened her blue baby-eyes, and started up with
971: astonishment and confusion to see the young stranger standing close
972: before her. She heard him speaking to her in a voice which seemed so
973: strange and soft, that even if she had been more collected she would
974: have taken it for granted that he said something hopelessly
975: unintelligible to her, and her first movement was to turn her head a
976: little away, and lift up a corner of her green serge mantle as a
977: screen. He repeated his words—
978: 
979: “Forgive me, pretty one, for awaking you. I’m dying with hunger, and
980: the scent of milk makes breakfast seem more desirable than ever.”
981: 
982: He had chosen the words “_muoio di fame_” because he knew they would be
983: familiar to her ears; and he had uttered them playfully, with the
984: intonation of a mendicant. This time he was understood; the corner of
985: the mantle was dropped, and in a few moments a large cup of fragrant
986: milk was held out to him. He paid no further compliments before raising
987: it to his lips, and while he was drinking, the little maiden found
988: courage to look up at the long dark curls of this singular-voiced
989: stranger, who had asked for food in the tones of a beggar, but who,
990: though his clothes were much damaged, was unlike any beggar she had
991: ever seen.
992: 
993: While this process of survey was going on, there was another current of
994: feeling that carried her hand into a bag which hung by the side of the
995: mule, and when the stranger set down his cup, he saw a large piece of
996: bread held out towards him, and caught a glance of the blue eyes that
997: seemed intended as an encouragement to him to take this additional
998: gift.
999: 
1000: “But perhaps that is your own breakfast,” he said. “No, I have had
1001: enough without payment. A thousand thanks, my gentle one.”
1002: 
1003: There was no rejoinder in words; but the piece of bread was pushed a
1004: little nearer to him, as if in impatience at his refusal; and as the
1005: long dark eyes of the stranger rested on the baby-face, it seemed to be
1006: gathering more and more courage to look up and meet them.
1007: 
1008: “Ah, then, if I must take the bread,” he said, laying his hand on it,
1009: “I shall get bolder still, and beg for another kiss to make the bread
1010: sweeter.”
1011: 
1012: His speech was getting wonderfully intelligible in spite of the strange
1013: voice, which had at first almost seemed a thing to make her cross
1014: herself. She blushed deeply, and lifted up a corner of her mantle to
1015: her mouth again. But just as the too presumptuous stranger was leaning
1016: forward, and had his fingers on the arm that held up the screening
1017: mantle, he was startled by a harsh voice close upon his ear.
1018: 
1019: “Who are _you_—with a murrain to you? No honest buyer, I’ll warrant,
1020: but a hanger-on of the dicers—or something worse. Go! dance off, and
1021: find fitter company, or I’ll give you a tune to a little quicker time
1022: than you’ll like.”
1023: 
1024: The young stranger drew back and looked at the speaker with a glance
1025: provokingly free from alarm and deprecation, and his slight expression
1026: of saucy amusement broke into a broad beaming smile as he surveyed the
1027: figure of his threatenor. She was a stout but brawny woman, with a
1028: man’s jerkin slipped over her green serge gamurra or gown, and the
1029: peaked hood of some departed mantle fastened round her sunburnt face,
1030: which, under all its coarseness and premature wrinkles, showed a
1031: half-sad, half-ludicrous maternal resemblance to the tender baby-face
1032: of the little maiden—the sort of resemblance which often seems a more
1033: croaking, shudder-creating prophecy than that of the death’s-head.
1034: 
1035: There was something irresistibly propitiating in that bright young
1036: smile, but Monna Ghita was not a woman to betray any weakness, and she
1037: went on speaking, apparently with heightened exasperation.
1038: 
1039: “Yes, yes, you can grin as well as other monkeys in cap and jerkin.
1040: You’re a minstrel or a mountebank, I’ll be sworn; you look for all the
1041: world as silly as a tumbler when he’s been upside down and has got on
1042: his heels again. And what fool’s tricks hast thou been after, Tessa?”
1043: she added, turning to her daughter, whose frightened face was more
1044: inviting to abuse. “Giving away the milk and victuals, it seems; ay,
1045: ay, thou’dst carry water in thy ears for any idle vagabond that didn’t
1046: like to stoop for it, thou silly staring rabbit! Turn thy back, and
1047: lift the herbs out of the panniers, else I’ll make thee say a few Aves
1048: without counting.”
1049: 
1050: “Nay, Madonna,” said the stranger, with a pleading smile, “don’t be
1051: angry with your pretty Tessa for taking pity on a hungry traveller, who
1052: found himself unexpectedly without a quattrino. Your handsome face
1053: looks so well when it frowns, that I long to see it illuminated by a
1054: smile.”
1055: 
1056: “_Va via_! I know what paste you are made of. You may tickle me with
1057: that straw a good long while before I shall laugh, I can tell you. Get
1058: along, with a bad Easter! else I’ll make a beauty-spot or two on that
1059: face of yours that shall spoil your kissing on this side Advent.”
1060: 
1061: As Monna Ghita lifted her formidable talons by way of complying with
1062: the first and last requisite of eloquence, Bratti, who had come up a
1063: minute or two before, had been saying to his companion, “What think you
1064: of this pretty parrot, Nello? Doesn’t his tongue smack of Venice?”
1065: 
1066: “Nay, Bratti,” said the barber in an undertone, “thy wisdom has much of
1067: the ass in it, as I told thee just now; especially about the ears. This
1068: stranger is a Greek, else I’m not the barber who has had the sole and
1069: exclusive shaving of the excellent Demetrio, and drawn more than one
1070: sorry tooth from his learned jaw. And this youth might be taken to have
1071: come straight from Olympus—at least when he has had a touch of my
1072: razor.”
1073: 
1074: “_Orsù_! Monna Ghita!” continued Nello, not sorry to see some sport;
1075: “what has happened to cause such a thunderstorm? Has this young
1076: stranger been misbehaving himself?”
1077: 
1078: “By San Giovanni!” said the cautious Bratti, who had not shaken off his
1079: original suspicions concerning the shabbily-clad possessor of jewels,
1080: “he did right to run away from _me_, if he meant to get into mischief.
1081: I can swear that I found him under the Loggia de’ Cerchi, with a ring
1082: on his finger such as I’ve seen worn by Bernardo Rucellai himself. Not
1083: another rusty nail’s worth do I know about him.”
1084: 
1085: “The fact is,” said Nello, eyeing the stranger good-humouredly, “this
1086: _bello giovane_ has been a little too presumptuous in admiring the
1087: charms of Monna Ghita, and has attempted to kiss her while her
1088: daughter’s back is turned; for I observe that the pretty Tessa is too
1089: busy to look this way at present. Was it not so, Messer?” Nello
1090: concluded, in a tone of courtesy.
1091: 
1092: “You have divined the offence like a soothsayer,” said the stranger,
1093: laughingly. “Only that I had not the good fortune to find Monna Ghita
1094: here at first. I begged a cup of milk from her daughter, and had
1095: accepted this gift of bread, for which I was making a humble offering
1096: of gratitude, before I had the higher pleasure of being face to face
1097: with these riper charms which I was perhaps too bold in admiring.”
1098: 
1099: “_Va, va_! be off, every one of you, and stay in purgatory till I pay
1100: to get you out, will you?” said Monna Ghita, fiercely, elbowing Nello,
1101: and leading forward her mule so as to compel the stranger to jump
1102: aside. “Tessa, thou simpleton, bring forward thy mule a bit: the cart
1103: will be upon us.”
1104: 
1105: As Tessa turned to take the mule’s bridle, she cast one timid glance at
1106: the stranger, who was now moving with Nello out of the way of an
1107: approaching market-cart; and the glance was just long enough to seize
1108: the beckoning movement of his hand, which indicated that he had been
1109: watching for this opportunity of an adieu.
1110: 
1111: “_Ebbene_,” said Bratti, raising his voice to speak across the cart; “I
1112: leave you with Nello, young man, for there’s no pushing my bag and
1113: basket any farther, and I have business at home. But you’ll remember
1114: our bargain, because if you found Tessa without me, it was not my
1115: fault. Nello will show you my shop in the Ferravecchi, and I’ll not
1116: turn my back on you.”
1117: 
1118: “A thousand thanks, friend!” said the stranger, laughing, and then
1119: turned away with Nello up the narrow street which led most directly to
1120: the Piazza del Duomo.
1121: 
1122: 
1123: 
1124: 
1125: CHAPTER III.
1126: The Barber’s Shop.
1127: 
1128: 
1129: “To tell you the truth,” said the young stranger to Nello, as they got
1130: a little clearer of the entangled vehicles and mules, “I am not sorry
1131: to be handed over by that patron of mine to one who has a less
1132: barbarous accent, and a less enigmatical business. Is it a common thing
1133: among you Florentines for an itinerant trafficker in broken glass and
1134: rags to talk of a shop where he sells lutes and swords?”
1135: 
1136: “Common? No: our Bratti is not a common man. He has a theory, and lives
1137: up to it, which is more than I can say for any philosopher I have the
1138: honour of shaving,” answered Nello, whose loquacity, like an over-full
1139: bottle, could never pour forth a small dose. “Bratti means to extract
1140: the utmost possible amount of pleasure, that is to say, of hard
1141: bargaining, out of this life; winding it up with a bargain for the
1142: easiest possible passage through purgatory, by giving Holy Church his
1143: winnings when the game is over. He has had his will made to that effect
1144: on the cheapest terms a notary could be got for. But I have often said
1145: to him, ‘Bratti, thy bargain is a limping one, and thou art on the lame
1146: side of it. Does it not make thee a little sad to look at the pictures
1147: of the Paradiso? Thou wilt never be able there to chaffer for rags and
1148: rusty nails: the saints and angels want neither pins nor tinder; and
1149: except with San Bartolommeo, who carries his skin about in an
1150: inconvenient manner, I see no chance of thy making a bargain for
1151: second-hand clothing.’ But God pardon me,” added Nello, changing his
1152: tone, and crossing himself, “this light talk ill beseems a morning when
1153: Lorenzo lies dead, and the Muses are tearing their hair—always a
1154: painful thought to a barber; and you yourself, Messere, are probably
1155: under a cloud, for when a man of your speech and presence takes up with
1156: so sorry a night’s lodging, it argues some misfortune to have befallen
1157: him.”
1158: 
1159: “What Lorenzo is that whose death you speak of?” said the stranger,
1160: appearing to have dwelt with too anxious an interest on this point to
1161: have noticed the indirect inquiry that followed it.
1162: 
1163: “What Lorenzo? There is but one Lorenzo, I imagine, whose death could
1164: throw the Mercato into an uproar, set the lantern of the Duomo leaping
1165: in desperation, and cause the lions of the Republic to feel under an
1166: immediate necessity to devour one another. I mean Lorenzo de’ Medici,
1167: the Pericles of our Athens—if I may make such a comparison in the ear
1168: of a Greek.”
1169: 
1170: “Why not?” said the other, laughingly; “for I doubt whether Athens,
1171: even in the days of Pericles, could have produced so learned a barber.”
1172: 
1173: “Yes, yes; I thought I could not be mistaken,” said the rapid Nello,
1174: “else I have shaved the venerable Demetrio Calcondila to little
1175: purpose; but pardon me, I am lost in wonder: your Italian is better
1176: than his, though he has been in Italy forty years—better even than that
1177: of the accomplished Marullo, who may be said to have married the Italic
1178: Muse in more senses than one, since he has married our learned and
1179: lovely Alessandra Scala.”
1180: 
1181: “It will lighten your wonder to know that I come of a Greek stock
1182: planted in Italian soil much longer than the mulberry-trees which have
1183: taken so kindly to it. I was born at Bari, and my—I mean, I was brought
1184: up by an Italian—and, in fact, I am a Greek, very much as your peaches
1185: are Persian. The Greek dye was subdued in me, I suppose, till I had
1186: been dipped over again by long abode and much travel in the land of
1187: gods and heroes. And, to confess something of my private affairs to
1188: you, this same Greek dye, with a few ancient gems I have about me, is
1189: the only fortune shipwreck has left me. But—when the towers fall, you
1190: know it is an ill business for the small nest-builders—the death of
1191: your Pericles makes me wish I had rather turned my steps towards Rome,
1192: as I should have done but for a fallacious Minerva in the shape of an
1193: Augustinian monk. ‘At Rome,’ he said, ‘you will be lost in a crowd of
1194: hungry scholars; but at Florence, every corner is penetrated by the
1195: sunshine of Lorenzo’s patronage: Florence is the best market in Italy
1196: for such commodities as yours.’”
1197: 
1198: “_Gnaffè_, and so it will remain, I hope,” said Nello, “Lorenzo was not
1199: the only patron and judge of learning in our city—heaven forbid!
1200: Because he was a large melon, every other Florentine is not a pumpkin,
1201: I suppose. Have we not Bernardo Rucellai, and Alamanno Rinuccini, and
1202: plenty more? And if you want to be informed on such matters, I, Nello,
1203: am your man. It seems to me a thousand years till I can be of service
1204: to a _bel erudito_ like yourself. And, first of all, in the matter of
1205: your hair. That beard, my fine young man, must be parted with, were it
1206: as dear to you as the nymph of your dreams. Here at Florence, we love
1207: not to see a man with his nose projecting over a cascade of hair. But,
1208: remember, you will have passed the Rubicon, when once you have been
1209: shaven: if you repent, and let your beard grow after it has acquired
1210: stoutness by a struggle with the razor, your mouth will by-and-by show
1211: no longer what Messer Angelo calls the divine prerogative of lips, but
1212: will appear like a dark cavern fringed with horrent brambles.”
1213: 
1214: “That is a terrible prophecy,” said the Greek, “especially if your
1215: Florentine maidens are many of them as pretty as the little Tessa I
1216: stole a kiss from this morning.”
1217: 
1218: “Tessa? she is a rough-handed contadina: you will rise into the favour
1219: of dames who bring no scent of the mule-stables with them. But to that
1220: end, you must not have the air of a _sgherro_, or a man of evil repute:
1221: you must look like a courtier, and a scholar of the more polished sort,
1222: such as our Pietro Crinito—like one who sins among well-bred, well-fed
1223: people, and not one who sucks down vile _vino di sotto_ in a chance
1224: tavern.”
1225: 
1226: “With all my heart,” said the stranger. “If the Florentine Graces
1227: demand it, I am willing to give up this small matter of my beard, but—”
1228: 
1229: “Yes, yes,” interrupted Nello. “I know what you would say. It is the
1230: _bella zazzera_—the hyacinthine locks, you do not choose to part with;
1231: and there is no need. Just a little pruning—ecco!—and you will look not
1232: unlike the illustrious prince Pico di Mirandola in his prime. And here
1233: we are in good time in the Piazza San Giovanni, and at the door of my
1234: shop. But you are pausing, I see: naturally, you want to look at our
1235: wonder of the world, our Duomo, our Santa Maria del Fiore. Well, well,
1236: a mere glance; but I beseech you to leave a closer survey till you have
1237: been shaved: I am quivering with the inspiration of my art even to the
1238: very edge of my razor. Ah, then, come round this way.”
1239: 
1240: The mercurial barber seized the arm of the stranger, and led him to a
1241: point, on the south side of the piazza, from which he could see at once
1242: the huge dark shell of the cupola, the slender soaring grace of
1243: Giotto’s campanile, and the quaint octagon of San Giovanni in front of
1244: them, showing its unique gates of storied bronze, which still bore the
1245: somewhat dimmed glory of their original gilding. The inlaid marbles
1246: were then fresher in their pink, and white, and purple, than they are
1247: now, when the winters of four centuries have turned their white to the
1248: rich ochre of well-mellowed meerschaum; the façade of the cathedral did
1249: not stand ignominious in faded stucco, but had upon it the magnificent
1250: promise of the half-completed marble inlaying and statued niches, which
1251: Giotto had devised a hundred and fifty years before; and as the
1252: campanile in all its harmonious variety of colour and form led the eyes
1253: upward, high into the clear air of this April morning, it seemed a
1254: prophetic symbol, telling that human life must somehow and some time
1255: shape itself into accord with that pure aspiring beauty.
1256: 
1257: But this was not the impression it appeared to produce on the Greek.
1258: His eyes were irresistibly led upward, but as he stood with his arms
1259: folded and his curls falling backward, there was a slight touch of
1260: scorn on his lip, and when his eyes fell again they glanced round with
1261: a scanning coolness which was rather piquing to Nello’s Florentine
1262: spirit.
1263: 
1264: “Well, my fine young man,” he said, with some impatience, “you seem to
1265: make as little of our Cathedral as if you were the Angel Gabriel come
1266: straight from Paradise. I should like to know if you have ever seen
1267: finer work than our Giotto’s tower, or any cupola that would not look a
1268: mere mushroom by the side of Brunelleschi’s there, or any marbles finer
1269: or more cunningly wrought than these that our Signoria got from far-off
1270: quarries, at a price that would buy a dukedom. Come, now, have you ever
1271: seen anything to equal them?”
1272: 
1273: “If you asked me that question with a scimitar at my throat, after the
1274: Turkish fashion, or even your own razor,” said the young Greek, smiling
1275: gaily, and moving on towards the gates of the Baptistery, “I daresay
1276: you might get a confession of the true faith from me. But with my
1277: throat free from peril, I venture to tell you that your buildings smack
1278: too much of Christian barbarism for my taste. I have a shuddering sense
1279: of what there is inside—hideous smoked Madonnas; fleshless saints in
1280: mosaic, staring down idiotic astonishment and rebuke from the apse;
1281: skin-clad skeletons hanging on crosses, or stuck all over with arrows,
1282: or stretched on gridirons; women and monks with heads aside in
1283: perpetual lamentation. I have seen enough of those wry-necked
1284: favourites of heaven at Constantinople. But what is this bronze door
1285: rough with imagery? These women’s figures seem moulded in a different
1286: spirit from those starved and staring saints I spoke of: these heads in
1287: high relief speak of a human mind within them, instead of looking like
1288: an index to perpetual spasms and colic.”
1289: 
1290: “Yes, yes,” said Nello, with some triumph. “I think we shall show you
1291: by-and-by that our Florentine art is not in a state of barbarism. These
1292: gates, my fine young man, were moulded half a century ago, by our
1293: Lorenzo Ghiberti, when he counted hardly so many years as you do.”
1294: 
1295: “Ah, I remember,” said the stranger, turning away, like one whose
1296: appetite for contemplation was soon satisfied. “I have heard that your
1297: Tuscan sculptors and painters have been studying the antique a little.
1298: But with monks for models, and the legends of mad hermits and martyrs
1299: for subjects, the vision of Olympus itself would be of small use to
1300: them.”
1301: 
1302: “I understand,” said Nello, with a significant shrug, as they walked
1303: along. “You are of the same mind as Michele Marullo, ay, and as Angelo
1304: Poliziano himself, in spite of his canonicate, when he relaxes himself
1305: a little in my shop after his lectures, and talks of the gods awaking
1306: from their long sleep and making the woods and streams vital once more.
1307: But he rails against the Roman scholars who want to make us all talk
1308: Latin again: ‘My ears,’ he says, ‘are sufficiently flayed by the
1309: barbarisms of the learned, and if the vulgar are to talk Latin I would
1310: as soon have been in Florence the day they took to beating all the
1311: kettles in the city because the bells were not enough to stay the wrath
1312: of the saints.’ Ah, Messer Greco, if you want to know the flavour of
1313: our scholarship, you must frequent my shop: it is the focus of
1314: Florentine intellect, and in that sense the navel of the earth—as my
1315: great predecessor, Burchiello, said of _his_ shop, on the more
1316: frivolous pretension that his street of the Calimara was the centre of
1317: our city. And here we are at the sign of ‘Apollo and the Razor.’
1318: Apollo, you see, is bestowing the razor on the Triptolemus of our
1319: craft, the first reaper of beards, the sublime _Anonimo_, whose
1320: mysterious identity is indicated by a shadowy hand.”
1321: 
1322: “I see thou hast had custom already, Sandro,” continued Nello,
1323: addressing a solemn-looking dark-eyed youth, who made way for them on
1324: the threshold. “And now make all clear for this signor to sit down. And
1325: prepare the finest-scented lather, for he has a learned and a handsome
1326: chin.”
1327: 
1328: “You have a pleasant little adytum there, I see,” said the stranger,
1329: looking through a latticed screen which divided the shop from a room of
1330: about equal size, opening into a still smaller walled enclosure, where
1331: a few bays and laurels surrounded a stone Hermes. “I suppose your
1332: conclave of _eruditi_ meets there?”
1333: 
1334: “There, and not less in my shop,” said Nello, leading the way into the
1335: inner room, in which were some benches, a table, with one book in
1336: manuscript and one printed in capitals lying open upon it, a lute, a
1337: few oil-sketches, and a model or two of hands and ancient masks. “For
1338: my shop is a no less fitting haunt of the Muses, as you will
1339: acknowledge when you feel the sudden illumination of understanding and
1340: the serene vigour of inspiration that will come to you with a clear
1341: chin. Ah! you can make that lute discourse, I perceive. I, too, have
1342: some skill that way, though the serenata is useless when daylight
1343: discloses a visage like mine, looking no fresher than an apple that has
1344: stood the winter. But look at that sketch: it is a fancy of Piero di
1345: Cosimo’s, a strange freakish painter, who says he saw it by long
1346: looking at a mouldy wall.”
1347: 
1348: The sketch Nello pointed to represented three masks—one a drunken
1349: laughing Satyr, another a sorrowing Magdalen, and the third, which lay
1350: between them, the rigid, cold face of a Stoic: the masks rested
1351: obliquely on the lap of a little child, whose cherub features rose
1352: above them with something of the supernal promise in the gaze which
1353: painters had by that time learned to give to the Divine Infant.
1354: 
1355: “A symbolical picture, I see,” said the young Greek, touching the lute
1356: while he spoke, so as to bring out a slight musical murmur. “The child,
1357: perhaps, is the Golden Age, wanting neither worship nor philosophy. And
1358: the Golden Age can always come back as long as men are born in the form
1359: of babies, and don’t come into the world in cassock or furred mantle.
1360: Or, the child may mean the wise philosophy of Epicurus, removed alike
1361: from the gross, the sad, and the severe.”
1362: 
1363: “Ah! everybody has his own interpretation for that picture,” said
1364: Nello; “and if you ask Piero himself what he meant by it, he says his
1365: pictures are an appendix which Messer Domeneddio has been pleased to
1366: make to the universe, and if any man is in doubt what they mean, he had
1367: better inquire of Holy Church. He has been asked to paint a picture
1368: after the sketch, but he puts his fingers to his ears and shakes his
1369: head at that; the fancy is past, he says—a strange animal, our Piero.
1370: But now all is ready for your initiation into the mysteries of the
1371: razor.”
1372: 
1373: “Mysteries they may well be called,” continued the barber, with rising
1374: spirits at the prospect of a long monologue, as he imprisoned the young
1375: Greek in the shroud-like shaving-cloth; “mysteries of Minerva and the
1376: Graces. I get the flower of men’s thoughts, because I seize them in the
1377: first moment after shaving. (Ah! you wince a little at the lather: it
1378: tickles the outlying limits of the nose, I admit.) And that is what
1379: makes the peculiar fitness of a barber’s shop to become a resort of wit
1380: and learning. For, look now at a druggist’s shop: there is a dull
1381: conclave at the sign of ‘The Moor,’ that pretends to rival mine; but
1382: what sort of inspiration, I beseech you, can be got from the scent of
1383: nauseous vegetable decoctions?—to say nothing of the fact that you no
1384: sooner pass the threshold than you see a doctor of physic, like a
1385: gigantic spider disguised in fur and scarlet, waiting for his prey; or
1386: even see him blocking up the doorway seated on a bony hack, inspecting
1387: saliva. (Your chin a little elevated, if it please you: contemplate
1388: that angel who is blowing the trumpet at you from the ceiling. I had it
1389: painted expressly for the regulation of my clients’ chins.) Besides,
1390: your druggist, who herborises and decocts, is a man of prejudices: he
1391: has poisoned people according to a system, and is obliged to stand up
1392: for his system to justify the consequences. Now a barber can be
1393: dispassionate; the only thing he necessarily stands by is the razor,
1394: always providing he is not an author. That was the flaw in my great
1395: predecessor Burchiello: he was a poet, and had consequently a prejudice
1396: about his own poetry. I have escaped that; I saw very early that
1397: authorship is a narrowing business, in conflict with the liberal art of
1398: the razor, which demands an impartial affection for all men’s chins.
1399: Ecco, Messer! the outline of your chin and lip is as clear as a
1400: maiden’s; and now fix your mind on a knotty question—ask yourself
1401: whether you are bound to spell Virgil with an _i_ or an _e_, and say if
1402: you do not feel an unwonted clearness on the point. Only, if you decide
1403: for the _i_, keep it to yourself till your fortune is made, for the _e_
1404: hath the stronger following in Florence. Ah! I think I see a gleam of
1405: still quicker wit in your eye. I have it on the authority of our young
1406: Niccolò Macchiavelli, himself keen enough to discern _il pelo nell’
1407: uovo_, as we say, and a great lover of delicate shaving, though his
1408: beard is hardly of two years’ date, that no sooner do the hairs begin
1409: to push themselves, than he perceives a certain grossness of
1410: apprehension creeping over him.”
1411: 
1412: “Suppose you let me look at myself,” said the stranger, laughing. “The
1413: happy effect on my intellect is perhaps obstructed by a little doubt as
1414: to the effect on my appearance.”
1415: 
1416: “Behold yourself in this mirror, then; it is a Venetian mirror from
1417: Murano, the true _nosce teipsum_, as I have named it, compared with
1418: which the finest mirror of steel or silver is mere darkness. See now,
1419: how by diligent shaving, the nether region of your face may preserve
1420: its human outline, instead of presenting no distinction from the
1421: physiognomy of a bearded owl or a Barbary ape. I have seen men whose
1422: beards have so invaded their cheeks, that one might have pitied them as
1423: the victims of a sad, brutalising chastisement befitting our Dante’s
1424: Inferno, if they had not seemed to strut with a strange triumph in
1425: their extravagant hairiness.”
1426: 
1427: “It seems to me,” said the Greek, still looking into the mirror, “that
1428: you have taken away some of my capital with your razor—I mean a year or
1429: two of age, which might have won me more ready credit for my learning.
1430: Under the inspection of a patron whose vision has grown somewhat dim, I
1431: shall have a perilous resemblance to a maiden of eighteen in the
1432: disguise of hose and jerkin.”
1433: 
1434: “Not at all,” said Nello, proceeding to clip the too extravagant curls;
1435: “your proportions are not those of a maiden. And for your age, I myself
1436: remember seeing Angelo Poliziano begin his lectures on the Latin
1437: language when he had a younger beard than yours; and between ourselves,
1438: his juvenile ugliness was not less signal than his precocious
1439: scholarship. Whereas you—no, no, your age is not against you; but
1440: between ourselves, let me hint to you that your being a Greek, though
1441: it be only an Apulian Greek, is not in your favour. Certain of our
1442: scholars hold that your Greek learning is but a wayside degenerate
1443: plant until it has been transplanted into Italian brains, and that now
1444: there is such a plentiful crop of the superior quality, your native
1445: teachers are mere propagators of degeneracy. Ecco! your curls are now
1446: of the right proportion to neck and shoulders; rise, Messer, and I will
1447: free you from the encumbrance of this cloth. _Gnaffè_! I almost advise
1448: you to retain the faded jerkin and hose a little longer; they give you
1449: the air of a fallen prince.”
1450: 
1451: “But the question is,” said the young Greek, leaning against the high
1452: back of a chair, and returning Nello’s contemplative admiration with a
1453: look of inquiring anxiety; “the question is, in what quarter I am to
1454: carry my princely air, so as to rise from the said fallen condition. If
1455: your Florentine patrons of learning share this scholarly hostility to
1456: the Greeks, I see not how your city can be a hospitable refuge for me,
1457: as you seemed to say just now.”
1458: 
1459: “_Pian piano_—not so fast,” said Nello, sticking his thumbs into his
1460: belt and nodding to Sandro to restore order. “I will not conceal from
1461: you that there is a prejudice against Greeks among us; and though, as a
1462: barber unsnared by authorship, I share no prejudices, I must admit that
1463: the Greeks are not always such pretty youngsters as yourself: their
1464: erudition is often of an uncombed, unmannerly aspect, and encrusted
1465: with a barbarous utterance of Italian, that makes their converse hardly
1466: more euphonious than that of a Tedesco in a state of vinous loquacity.
1467: And then, again, excuse me—we Florentines have liberal ideas about
1468: speech, and consider that an instrument which can flatter and promise
1469: so cleverly as the tongue, must have been partly made for those
1470: purposes; and that truth is a riddle for eyes and wit to discover,
1471: which it were a mere spoiling of sport for the tongue to betray. Still
1472: we have our limits beyond which we call dissimulation treachery. But it
1473: is said of the Greeks that their honesty begins at what is the hanging
1474: point with us, and that since the old Furies went to sleep, your
1475: Christian Greek is of so easy a conscience that he would make a
1476: stepping-stone of his father’s corpse.”
1477: 
1478: The flush on the stranger’s face indicated what seemed so natural a
1479: movement of resentment, that the good-natured Nello hastened to atone
1480: for his want of reticence.
1481: 
1482: “Be not offended, _bel giovane_; I am but repeating what I hear in my
1483: shop; as you may perceive, my eloquence is simply the cream which I
1484: skim off my clients’ talk. Heaven forbid I should fetter my
1485: impartiality by entertaining an opinion. And for that same scholarly
1486: objection to the Greeks,” added Nello, in a more mocking tone, and with
1487: a significant grimace, “the fact is, you are heretics, Messer; jealousy
1488: has nothing to do with it: if you would just change your opinion about
1489: leaven, and alter your Doxology a little, our Italian scholars would
1490: think it a thousand years till they could give up their chairs to you.
1491: Yes, yes; it is chiefly religious scruple, and partly also the
1492: authority of a great classic,—Juvenal, is it not? He, I gather, had his
1493: bile as much stirred by the swarm of Greeks as our Messer Angelo, who
1494: is fond of quoting some passage about their incorrigible
1495: impudence—_audacia perdita_.”
1496: 
1497: “Pooh! the passage is a compliment,” said the Greek, who had recovered
1498: himself, and seemed wise enough to take the matter gaily—
1499: 
1500: 
1501: “‘Ingenium velox, audacia perdita, sermo
1502: Promptus, et Isaeo torrentior.’
1503: 
1504: 
1505: “A rapid intellect and ready eloquence may carry off a little
1506: impudence.”
1507: 
1508: “Assuredly,” said Nello. “And since, as I see, you know Latin
1509: literature as well as Greek, you will not fall into the mistake of
1510: Giovanni Argiropulo, who ran full tilt against Cicero, and pronounced
1511: him all but a pumpkin-head. For, let me give you one bit of advice,
1512: young man—trust a barber who has shaved the best chins, and kept his
1513: eyes and ears open for twenty years—oil your tongue well when you talk
1514: of the ancient Latin writers, and give it an extra dip when you talk of
1515: the modern. A wise Greek may win favour among us; witness our excellent
1516: Demetrio, who is loved by many, and not hated immoderately even by the
1517: most renowned scholars.”
1518: 
1519: “I discern the wisdom of your advice so clearly,” said the Greek, with
1520: the bright smile which was continually lighting up the fine form and
1521: colour of his young face, “that I will ask you for a little more. Who
1522: now, for example, would be the most likely patron for me? Is there a
1523: son of Lorenzo who inherits his tastes? Or is there any other wealthy
1524: Florentine specially addicted to purchasing antique gems? I have a fine
1525: Cleopatra cut in sardonyx, and one or two other intaglios and cameos,
1526: both curious and beautiful, worthy of being added to the cabinet of a
1527: prince. Happily, I had taken the precaution of fastening them within
1528: the lining of my doublet before I set out on my voyage. Moreover, I
1529: should like to raise a small sum for my present need on this ring of
1530: mine,” (here he took out the ring and replaced it on his finger), “if
1531: you could recommend me to any honest trafficker.”
1532: 
1533: “Let us see, let us see,” said Nello, perusing the floor, and walking
1534: up and down the length of his shop. “This is no time to apply to Piero
1535: de’ Medici, though he has the will to make such purchases if he could
1536: always spare the money; but I think it is another sort of Cleopatra
1537: that he covets most... Yes, yes, I have it. What you want is a man of
1538: wealth, and influence, and scholarly tastes—not one of your learned
1539: porcupines, bristling all over with critical tests, but one whose Greek
1540: and Latin are of a comfortable laxity. And that man is Bartolommeo
1541: Scala, the secretary of our Republic. He came to Florence as a poor
1542: adventurer himself—a miller’s son—a ‘branny monster,’ as he has been
1543: nicknamed by our honey-lipped Poliziano, who agrees with him as well as
1544: my teeth agree with lemon-juice. And, by the by, that may be a reason
1545: why the secretary may be the more ready to do a good turn to a strange
1546: scholar. For, between you and me, _bel giovane_—trust a barber who has
1547: shaved the best scholars—friendliness is much such a steed as Ser
1548: Benghi’s: it will hardly show much alacrity unless it has got the
1549: thistle of hatred under its tail. However, the secretary is a man
1550: who’ll keep his word to you, even to the halving of a fennel-seed; and
1551: he is not unlikely to buy some of your gems.”
1552: 
1553: “But how am I to get at this great man?” said the Greek, rather
1554: impatiently.
1555: 
1556: “I was coming to that,” said Nello. “Just now everybody of any public
1557: importance will be full of Lorenzo’s death, and a stranger may find it
1558: difficult to get any notice. But in the meantime, I could take you to a
1559: man who, if he has a mind, can help you to a chance of a favourable
1560: interview with Scala sooner than anybody else in Florence—worth seeing
1561: for his own sake too, to say nothing of his collections, or of his
1562: daughter Romola, who is as fair as the Florentine lily before it got
1563: quarrelsome and turned red.”
1564: 
1565: “But if this father of the beautiful Romola makes collections, why
1566: should he not like to buy some of my gems himself?”
1567: 
1568: Nello shrugged his shoulders. “For two good reasons—want of sight to
1569: look at the gems, and want of money to pay for them. Our old Bardo de’
1570: Bardi is so blind that he can see no more of his daughter than, as he
1571: says, a glimmering of something bright when she comes very near him:
1572: doubtless her golden hair, which, as Messer Luigi Pulci says of his
1573: Meridiana’s, ‘_raggia come stella per sereno_.’ Ah! here come some
1574: clients of mine, and I shouldn’t wonder if one of them could serve your
1575: turn about that ring.”
1576: 
1577: 
1578: 
1579: 
1580: CHAPTER IV.
1581: First Impressions.
1582: 
1583: 
1584: “Good-day, Messer Domenico,” said Nello to the foremost of the two
1585: visitors who entered the shop, while he nodded silently to the other.
1586: “You come as opportunely as cheese on macaroni. Ah! you are in
1587: haste—wish to be shaved without delay—ecco! And this is a morning when
1588: every one has grave matter on his mind. Florence orphaned—the very
1589: pivot of Italy snatched away—heaven itself at a loss what to do next.
1590: _Oimè_! Well, well; the sun is nevertheless travelling on towards
1591: dinner-time again; and, as I was saying, you come like cheese ready
1592: grated. For this young stranger was wishing for an honourable trader
1593: who would advance him a sum on a certain ring of value, and if I had
1594: counted every goldsmith and money-lender in Florence on my fingers, I
1595: couldn’t have found a better name than Menico Cennini. Besides, he hath
1596: other ware in which you deal—Greek learning, and young eyes—a double
1597: implement which you printers are always in need of.”
1598: 
1599: The grave elderly man, son of that Bernardo Cennini, who, twenty years
1600: before, having heard of the new process of printing carried on by
1601: Germans, had cast his own types in Florence, remained necessarily in
1602: lathered silence and passivity while Nello showered this talk in his
1603: ears, but turned a slow sideway gaze on the stranger.
1604: 
1605: “This fine young man has unlimited Greek, Latin, or Italian at your
1606: service,” continued Nello, fond of interpreting by very ample
1607: paraphrase. “He is as great a wonder of juvenile learning as Francesco
1608: Filelfo or our own incomparable Poliziano. A second Guarino, too, for
1609: he has had the misfortune to be shipwrecked, and has doubtless lost a
1610: store of precious manuscripts that might have contributed some
1611: correctness even to your correct editions, Domenico. Fortunately, he
1612: has rescued a few gems of rare value. His name is—you said your name,
1613: Messer, was—?”
1614: 
1615: “Tito Melema,” said the stranger, slipping the ring from his finger,
1616: and presenting it to Cennini, whom Nello, not less rapid with his razor
1617: than with his tongue, had now released from the shaving-cloth.
1618: 
1619: Meanwhile the man who had entered the shop in company with the
1620: goldsmith—a tall figure, about fifty, with a short trimmed beard,
1621: wearing an old felt hat and a threadbare mantle—had kept his eye fixed
1622: on the Greek, and now said abruptly—
1623: 
1624: “Young man, I am painting a picture of Sinon deceiving old Priam, and I
1625: should be glad of your face for my Sinon, if you’d give me a sitting.”
1626: 
1627: Tito Melema started and looked round with a pale astonishment in his
1628: face as if at a sudden accusation; but Nello left him no time to feel
1629: at a loss for an answer: “Piero,” said the barber, “thou art the most
1630: extraordinary compound of humours and fancies ever packed into a human
1631: skin. What trick wilt thou play with the fine visage of this young
1632: scholar to make it suit thy traitor? Ask him rather to turn his eyes
1633: upward, and thou mayst make a Saint Sebastian of him that will draw
1634: troops of devout women; or, if thou art in a classical vein, put myrtle
1635: about his curls and make him a young Bacchus, or say rather a Phoebus
1636: Apollo, for his face is as warm and bright as a summer morning; it made
1637: me his friend in the space of a ‘credo.’”
1638: 
1639: “Ay, Nello,” said the painter, speaking with abrupt pauses; “and if thy
1640: tongue can leave off its everlasting chirping long enough for thy
1641: understanding to consider the matter, thou mayst see that thou hast
1642: just shown the reason why the face of Messere will suit my traitor. A
1643: perfect traitor should have a face which vice can write no marks
1644: on—lips that will lie with a dimpled smile—eyes of such agate-like
1645: brightness and depth that no infamy can dull them—cheeks that will rise
1646: from a murder and not look haggard. I say not this young man is a
1647: traitor: I mean, he has a face that would make him the more perfect
1648: traitor if he had the heart of one, which is saying neither more nor
1649: less than that he has a beautiful face, informed with rich young blood,
1650: that will be nourished enough by food, and keep its colour without much
1651: help of virtue. He may have the heart of a hero along with it; I aver
1652: nothing to the contrary. Ask Domenico there if the lapidaries can
1653: always tell a gem by the sight alone. And now I’m going to put the tow
1654: in my ears, for thy chatter and the bells together are more than I can
1655: endure: so say no more to me, but trim my beard.”
1656: 
1657: With these last words Piero (called “di Cosimo,” from his master,
1658: Cosimo Rosselli) drew out two bits of tow, stuffed them in his ears,
1659: and placed himself in the chair before Nello, who shrugged his
1660: shoulders and cast a grimacing look of intelligence at the Greek, as
1661: much as to say, “A whimsical fellow, you perceive! Everybody holds his
1662: speeches as mere jokes.”
1663: 
1664: Tito, who had stood transfixed, with his long dark eyes resting on the
1665: unknown man who had addressed him so equivocally, seemed recalled to
1666: his self-command by Piero’s change of position, and apparently
1667: satisfied with his explanation, was again giving his attention to
1668: Cennini, who presently said—
1669: 
1670: “This is a curious and valuable ring, young man. This intaglio of the
1671: fish with the crested serpent above it, in the black stratum of the
1672: onyx, or rather nicolo, is well shown by the surrounding blue of the
1673: upper stratum. The ring has, doubtless, a history?” added Cennini,
1674: looking up keenly at the young stranger.
1675: 
1676: “Yes, indeed,” said Tito, meeting the scrutiny very frankly. “The ring
1677: was found in Sicily, and I have understood from those who busy
1678: themselves with gems and sigils, that both the stone and intaglio are
1679: of virtue to make the wearer fortunate, especially at sea, and also to
1680: restore to him whatever he may have lost. But,” he continued, smiling,
1681: “though I have worn it constantly since I quitted Greece, it has not
1682: made me altogether fortunate at sea, you perceive, unless I am to count
1683: escape from drowning as a sufficient proof of its virtue. It remains to
1684: be seen whether my lost chests will come to light; but to lose no
1685: chance of such a result, Messer, I will pray you only to hold the ring
1686: for a short space as pledge for a small sum far beneath its value, and
1687: I will redeem it as soon as I can dispose of certain other gems which
1688: are secured within my doublet, or indeed as soon as I can earn
1689: something by any scholarly employment, if I may be so fortunate as to
1690: meet with such.”
1691: 
1692: “That may be seen, young man, if you will come with me,” said Cennini.
1693: “My brother Pietro, who is a better judge of scholarship than I, will
1694: perhaps be able to supply you with a task that may test your
1695: capabilities. Meanwhile, take back your ring until I can hand you the
1696: necessary florins, and, if it please you, come along with me.”
1697: 
1698: “Yes, yes,” said Nello, “go with Messer Domenico, you cannot go in
1699: better company; he was born under the constellation that gives a man
1700: skill, riches, and integrity, whatever that constellation may be, which
1701: is of the less consequence because babies can’t choose their own
1702: horoscopes, and, indeed, if they could, there might be an inconvenient
1703: rush of babies at particular epochs. Besides, our Phoenix, the
1704: incomparable Pico, has shown that your horoscopes are all a nonsensical
1705: dream—which is the less troublesome opinion. _Addio! bel giovane_!
1706: don’t forget to come back to me.”
1707: 
1708: “No fear of that,” said Tito, beckoning a farewell, as he turned round
1709: his bright face at the door. “You are to do me a great service:—that is
1710: the most positive security for your seeing me again.”
1711: 
1712: “Say what thou wilt, Piero,” said Nello, as the young stranger
1713: disappeared, “I shall never look at such an outside as that without
1714: taking it as a sign of a lovable nature. Why, thou wilt say next that
1715: Leonardo, whom thou art always raving about, ought to have made his
1716: Judas as beautiful as Saint John! But thou art as deaf as the top of
1717: Mount Morello with that accursed tow in thy ears. Well, well: I’ll get
1718: a little more of this young man’s history from him before I take him to
1719: Bardo Bardi.”
1720: 
1721: 
1722: 
1723: 
1724: CHAPTER V.
1725: The Blind Scholar and his Daughter.
1726: 
1727: 
1728: The Via de’ Bardi, a street noted in the history of Florence, lies in
1729: Oltrarno, or that portion of the city which clothes the southern bank
1730: of the river. It extends from the Ponte Vecchio to the Piazza de’ Mozzi
1731: at the head of the Ponte alle Grazie; its right-hand line of houses and
1732: walls being backed by the rather steep ascent which in the fifteenth
1733: century was known as the hill of Bogoli, the famous stone-quarry whence
1734: the city got its pavement—of dangerously unstable consistence when
1735: penetrated by rains; its left-hand buildings flanking the river and
1736: making on their northern side a length of quaint, irregularly-pierced
1737: façade, of which the waters give a softened loving reflection as the
1738: sun begins to decline towards the western heights. But quaint as these
1739: buildings are, some of them seem to the historical memory a too modern
1740: substitute for the famous houses of the Bardi family, destroyed by
1741: popular rage in the middle of the fourteenth century.
1742: 
1743: They were a proud and energetic stock, these Bardi; conspicuous among
1744: those who clutched the sword in the earliest world-famous quarrels of
1745: Florentines with Florentines, when the narrow streets were darkened
1746: with the high towers of the nobles, and when the old tutelar god Mars,
1747: as he saw the gutters reddened with neighbours’ blood, might well have
1748: smiled at the centuries of lip-service paid to his rival, the Baptist.
1749: But the Bardi hands were of the sort that not only clutch the
1750: sword-hilt with vigour, but love the more delicate pleasure of
1751: fingering minted metal: they were matched, too, with true Florentine
1752: eyes, capable of discerning that power was to be won by other means
1753: than by rending and riving, and by the middle of the fourteenth century
1754: we find them risen from their original condition of _popolani_ to be
1755: possessors, by purchase, of lands and strongholds, and the feudal
1756: dignity of Counts of Vernio, disturbing to the jealousy of their
1757: republican fellow-citizens. These lordly purchases are explained by our
1758: seeing the Bardi disastrously signalised only a few years later as
1759: standing in the very front of European commerce—the Christian
1760: Rothschilds of that time—undertaking to furnish specie for the wars of
1761: our Edward the Third, and having revenues “in kind” made over to them;
1762: especially in wool, most precious of freights for Florentine galleys.
1763: Their august debtor left them with an august deficit, and alarmed
1764: Sicilian creditors made a too sudden demand for the payment of
1765: deposits, causing a ruinous shock to the credit of the Bardi and of
1766: associated houses, which was felt as a commercial calamity along all
1767: the coasts of the Mediterranean. But, like more modern bankrupts, they
1768: did not, for all that, hide their heads in humiliation; on the
1769: contrary, they seemed to have held them higher than ever, and to have
1770: been among the most arrogant of those grandees, who under certain
1771: noteworthy circumstances, open to all who will read the honest pages of
1772: Giovanni Villani, drew upon themselves the exasperation of the armed
1773: people in 1343. The Bardi, who had made themselves fast in their street
1774: between the two bridges, kept these narrow inlets, like panthers at
1775: bay, against the oncoming gonfalons of the people, and were only made
1776: to give way by an assault from the hill behind them. Their houses by
1777: the river, to the number of twenty-two (_palagi e case grandi_), were
1778: sacked and burnt, and many among the chief of those who bore the Bardi
1779: name were driven from the city. But an old Florentine family was
1780: many-rooted, and we find the Bardi maintaining importance and rising
1781: again and again to the surface of Florentine affairs in a more or less
1782: creditable manner, implying an untold family history that would have
1783: included even more vicissitudes and contrasts of dignity and disgrace,
1784: of wealth and poverty, than are usually seen on the background of wide
1785: kinship.[1] But the Bardi never resumed their proprietorship in the old
1786: street on the banks of the river, which in 1492 had long been
1787: associated with other names of mark, and especially with the Neri, who
1788: possessed a considerable range of houses on the side towards the hill.
1789: 
1790:  [1] A sign that such contrasts were peculiarly frequent in Florence,
1791:  is the fact that Saint Antonine, Prior of San Marco, and afterwards
1792:  archbishop, in the first half of this fifteenth century, founded the
1793:  society of Buonuomini di San Martino (Good Men of Saint Martin) with
1794:  the main object of succouring the _poveri vergognosi_—in other words,
1795:  paupers of good family. In the records of the famous Panciatichi
1796:  family we find a certain Girolamo in this century who was reduced to
1797:  such a state of poverty that he was obliged to seek charity for the
1798:  mere means of sustaining life, though other members of his family were
1799:  enormously wealthy.
1800: 
1801: 
1802: In one of these Neri houses there lived, however, a descendant of the
1803: Bardi, and of that very branch which a century and a half before had
1804: become Counts of Vernio: a descendant who had inherited the old family
1805: pride and energy, the old love of pre-eminence, the old desire to leave
1806: a lasting track of his footsteps on the fast-whirling earth. But the
1807: family passions lived on in him under altered conditions: this
1808: descendant of the Bardi was not a man swift in street warfare, or one
1809: who loved to play the signor, fortifying strongholds and asserting the
1810: right to hang vassals, or a merchant and usurer of keen daring, who
1811: delighted in the generalship of wide commercial schemes: he was a man
1812: with a deep-veined hand cramped by much copying of manuscripts, who ate
1813: sparing dinners, and wore threadbare clothes, at first from choice and
1814: at last from necessity; who sat among his books and his marble
1815: fragments of the past, and saw them only by the light of those far-off
1816: younger days which still shone in his memory: he was a moneyless, blind
1817: old scholar—the Bardo de’ Bardi to whom Nello, the barber, had promised
1818: to introduce the young Greek, Tito Melema.
1819: 
1820: The house in which Bardo lived was situated on the side of the street
1821: nearest the hill, and was one of those large sombre masses of stone
1822: building pierced by comparatively small windows, and surmounted by what
1823: may be called a roofed terrace or loggia, of which there are many
1824: examples still to be seen in the venerable city. Grim doors, with
1825: conspicuous scrolled hinges, having high up on each side of them a
1826: small window defended by iron bars, opened on a groined entrance-court,
1827: empty of everything but a massive lamp-iron suspended from the centre
1828: of the groin. A smaller grim door on the left-hand admitted to the
1829: stone staircase, and the rooms on the ground-floor. These last were
1830: used as a warehouse by the proprietor; so was the first floor; and both
1831: were filled with precious stores, destined to be carried, some perhaps
1832: to the banks of the Scheldt, some to the shores of Africa, some to the
1833: isles of the Aegean, or to the banks of the Euxine. Maso, the old
1834: serving-man, when he returned from the Mercato with the stock of cheap
1835: vegetables, had to make his slow way up to the second storey before he
1836: reached the door of his master, Bardo, through which we are about to
1837: enter only a few mornings after Nello’s conversation with the Greek.
1838: 
1839: We follow Maso across the ante-chamber to the door on the left-hand,
1840: through which we pass as he opens it. He merely looks in and nods,
1841: while a clear young voice says, “Ah, you are come back, Maso. It is
1842: well. We have wanted nothing.”
1843: 
1844: The voice came from the farther end of a long, spacious room,
1845: surrounded with shelves, on which books and antiquities were arranged
1846: in scrupulous order. Here and there, on separate stands in front of the
1847: shelves, were placed a beautiful feminine torso; a headless statue,
1848: with an uplifted muscular arm wielding a bladeless sword; rounded,
1849: dimpled, infantine limbs severed from the trunk, inviting the lips to
1850: kiss the cold marble; some well-preserved Roman busts; and two or three
1851: vases from Magna Grecia. A large table in the centre was covered with
1852: antique bronze lamps and small vessels in dark pottery. The colour of
1853: these objects was chiefly pale or sombre: the vellum bindings, with
1854: their deep-ridged backs, gave little relief to the marble, livid with
1855: long burial; the once splendid patch of carpet at the farther end of
1856: the room had long been worn to dimness; the dark bronzes wanted
1857: sunlight upon them to bring out their tinge of green, and the sun was
1858: not yet high enough to send gleams of brightness through the narrow
1859: windows that looked on the Via de’ Bardi.
1860: 
1861: The only spot of bright colour in the room was made by the hair of a
1862: tall maiden of seventeen or eighteen, who was standing before a carved
1863: _leggio_, or reading-desk, such as is often seen in the choirs of
1864: Italian churches. The hair was of a reddish gold colour, enriched by an
1865: unbroken small ripple, such as may be seen in the sunset clouds on
1866: grandest autumnal evenings. It was confined by a black fillet above her
1867: small ears, from which it rippled forward again, and made a natural
1868: veil for her neck above her square-cut gown of black _rascia_, or
1869: serge. Her eyes were bent on a large volume placed before her: one long
1870: white hand rested on the reading-desk, and the other clasped the back
1871: of her father’s chair.
1872: 
1873: The blind father sat with head uplifted and turned a little aside
1874: towards his daughter, as if he were looking at her. His delicate
1875: paleness, set off by the black velvet cap which surmounted his drooping
1876: white hair, made all the more perceptible the likeness between his aged
1877: features and those of the young maiden, whose cheeks were also without
1878: any tinge of the rose. There was the same refinement of brow and
1879: nostril in both, counterbalanced by a full though firm mouth and
1880: powerful chin, which gave an expression of proud tenacity and latent
1881: impetuousness: an expression carried out in the backward poise of the
1882: girl’s head, and the grand line of her neck and shoulders. It was a
1883: type of face of which one could not venture to say whether it would
1884: inspire love or only that unwilling admiration which is mixed with
1885: dread: the question must be decided by the eyes, which often seem
1886: charged with a more direct message from the soul. But the eyes of the
1887: father had long been silent, and the eyes of the daughter were bent on
1888: the Latin pages of Politian’s ‘Miscellanea,’ from which she was reading
1889: aloud at the eightieth chapter, to the following effect:—
1890: 
1891: “There was a certain nymph of Thebes named Chariclo, especially dear to
1892: Pallas; and this nymph was the mother of Teiresias. But once when in
1893: the heat of summer, Pallas, in company with Chariclo, was bathing her
1894: disrobed limbs in the Heliconian Hippocrene, it happened that Teiresias
1895: coming as a hunter to quench his thirst at the same fountain,
1896: inadvertently beheld Minerva unveiled, and immediately became blind.
1897: For it is declared in the Saturnian laws, that he who beholds the gods
1898: against their will, shall atone for it by a heavy penalty... When
1899: Teiresias had fallen into this calamity, Pallas, moved by the tears of
1900: Chariclo, endowed him with prophecy and length of days, and even caused
1901: his prudence and wisdom to continue after he had entered among the
1902: shades, so that an oracle spake from his tomb: and she gave him a
1903: staff, wherewith, as by a guide, he might walk without stumbling... And
1904: hence, Nonnus, in the fifth book of the ‘Dionysiaca,’ introduces
1905: Actreon exclaiming that he calls Teiresias happy, since, without dying,
1906: and with the loss of his eyesight merely, he had beheld Minerva
1907: unveiled, and thus, though blind, could for evermore carry her image in
1908: his soul.”
1909: 
1910: At this point in the reading, the daughter’s hand slipped from the back
1911: of the chair and met her father’s, which he had that moment uplifted;
1912: but she had not looked round, and was going on, though with a voice a
1913: little altered by some suppressed feeling, to read the Greek quotation
1914: from Nonnus, when the old man said—
1915: 
1916: “Stay, Romola; reach me my own copy of Nonnus. It is a more correct
1917: copy than any in Poliziano’s hands, for I made emendations in it which
1918: have not yet been communicated to any man. I finished it in 1477, when
1919: my sight was fast failing me.”
1920: 
1921: Romola walked to the farther end of the room, with the queenly step
1922: which was the simple action of her tall, finely-wrought frame, without
1923: the slightest conscious adjustment of herself.
1924: 
1925: “Is it in the right place, Romola?” asked Bardo, who was perpetually
1926: seeking the assurance that the outward fact continued to correspond
1927: with the image which lived to the minutest detail in his mind.
1928: 
1929: “Yes, father; at the west end of the room, on the third shelf from the
1930: bottom, behind the bust of Hadrian, above Apollonius Rhodius and
1931: Callimachus, and below Lucan and Silius Italicus.”
1932: 
1933: As Romola said this, a fine ear would have detected in her clear voice
1934: and distinct utterance, a faint suggestion of weariness struggling with
1935: habitual patience. But as she approached her father and saw his arms
1936: stretched out a little with nervous excitement to seize the volume, her
1937: hazel eyes filled with pity; she hastened to lay the book on his lap,
1938: and kneeled down by him, looking up at him as if she believed that the
1939: love in her face must surely make its way through the dark obstruction
1940: that shut out everything else. At that moment the doubtful
1941: attractiveness of Romola’s face, in which pride and passion seemed to
1942: be quivering in the balance with native refinement and intelligence,
1943: was transfigured to the most lovable womanliness by mingled pity and
1944: affection: it was evident that the deepest fount of feeling within her
1945: had not yet wrought its way to the less changeful features, and only
1946: found its outlet through her eyes.
1947: 
1948: But the father, unconscious of that soft radiance, looked flushed and
1949: agitated as his hand explored the edges and back of the large book.
1950: 
1951: “The vellum is yellowed in these thirteen years, Romola.”
1952: 
1953: “Yes, father,” said Romola, gently; “but your letters at the back are
1954: dark and plain still—fine Roman letters; and the Greek character,” she
1955: continued, laying the book open on her father’s knee, “is more
1956: beautiful than that of any of your bought manuscripts.”
1957: 
1958: “Assuredly, child,” said Bardo, passing his finger across the page, as
1959: if he hoped to discriminate line and margin. “What hired amanuensis can
1960: be equal to the scribe who loves the words that grow under his hand,
1961: and to whom an error or indistinctness in the text is more painful than
1962: a sudden darkness or obstacle across his path? And even these
1963: mechanical printers who threaten to make learning a base and vulgar
1964: thing—even they must depend on the manuscript over which we scholars
1965: have bent with that insight into the poet’s meaning which is closely
1966: akin to the _mens divinior_ of the poet himself; unless they would
1967: flood the world with grammatical falsities and inexplicable anomalies
1968: that would turn the very fountain of Parnassus into a deluge of
1969: poisonous mud. But find the passage in the fifth book, to which
1970: Poliziano refers—I know it very well.”
1971: 
1972: Seating herself on a low stool, close to her father’s knee, Romola took
1973: the book on her lap and read the four verses containing the exclamation
1974: of Actreon.
1975: 
1976: “It is true, Romola,” said Bardo, when she had finished; “it is a true
1977: conception of the poet; for what is that grosser, narrower light by
1978: which men behold merely the petty scene around them, compared with that
1979: far-stretching, lasting light which spreads over centuries of thought,
1980: and over the life of nations, and makes clear to us the minds of the
1981: immortals who have reaped the great harvest and left us to glean in
1982: their furrows? For me, Romola, even when I could see, it was with the
1983: great dead that I lived; while the living often seemed to me mere
1984: spectres—shadows dispossessed of true feeling and intelligence; and
1985: unlike those Lamiae, to whom Poliziano, with that superficial ingenuity
1986: which I do not deny to him, compares our inquisitive Florentines,
1987: because they put on their eyes when they went abroad, and took them off
1988: when they got home again, I have returned from the converse of the
1989: streets as from a forgotten dream, and have sat down among my books,
1990: saying with Petrarca, the modern who is least unworthy to be named
1991: after the ancients, ‘Libri medullitus delectant, colloquuntur,
1992: consulunt, et viva quadam nobis atque arguta familiaritate junguntur.’”
1993: 
1994: “And in one thing you are happier than your favourite Petrarca,
1995: father,” said Romola, affectionately humouring the old man’s
1996: disposition to dilate in this way; “for he used to look at his copy of
1997: Homer and think sadly that the Greek was a dead letter to him: so far,
1998: he had the inward blindness that you feel is worse than your outward
1999: blindness.”
2000: 
2001: “True, child; for I carry within me the fruits of that fervid study
2002: which I gave to the Greek tongue under the teaching of the younger
2003: Crisolora, and Filelfo, and Argiropulo; though that great work in which
2004: I had desired to gather, as into a firm web, all the threads that my
2005: research had laboriously disentangled, and which would have been the
2006: vintage of my life, was cut off by the failure of my sight and my want
2007: of a fitting coadjutor. For the sustained zeal and unconquerable
2008: patience demanded from those who would tread the unbeaten paths of
2009: knowledge are still less reconcilable with the wandering, vagrant
2010: propensity of the feminine mind than with the feeble powers of the
2011: feminine body.”
2012: 
2013: “Father,” said Romola, with a sudden flush and in an injured tone, “I
2014: read anything you wish me to read; and I will look out any passages for
2015: you, and make whatever notes you want.”
2016: 
2017: Bardo shook his head, and smiled with a bitter sort of pity. “As well
2018: try to be a pentathlos and perform all the five feats of the palaestra
2019: with the limbs of a nymph. Have I forgotten thy fainting in the mere
2020: search for the references I needed to explain a single passage of
2021: Callimachus?”
2022: 
2023: “But, father, it was the weight of the books, and Maso can help me; it
2024: was not want of attention and patience.”
2025: 
2026: Bardo shook his head again. “It is not mere bodily organs that I want:
2027: it is the sharp edge of a young mind to pierce the way for my somewhat
2028: blunted faculties. For blindness acts like a dam, sending the streams
2029: of thought backward along the already-travelled channels and hindering
2030: the course onward. If my son had not forsaken me, deluded by debasing
2031: fanatical dreams, worthy only of an energumen whose dwelling is among
2032: tombs, I might have gone on and seen my path broadening to the end of
2033: my life; for he was a youth of great promise. But it has closed in
2034: now,” the old man continued, after a short pause; “it has closed in
2035: now;—all but the narrow track he has left me to tread—alone in my
2036: blindness.”
2037: 
2038: Romola started from her seat, and carried away the large volume to its
2039: place again, stung too acutely by her father’s last words to remain
2040: motionless as well as silent; and when she turned away from the shelf
2041: again, she remained standing at some distance from him, stretching her
2042: arms downwards and clasping her fingers tightly as she looked with a
2043: sad dreariness in her young face at the lifeless objects around her—the
2044: parchment backs, the unchanging mutilated marble, the bits of obsolete
2045: bronze and clay.
2046: 
2047: Bardo, though usually susceptible to Romola’s movements and eager to
2048: trace them, was now too entirely preoccupied by the pain of rankling
2049: memories to notice her departure from his side.
2050: 
2051: “Yes,” he went on, “with my son to aid me, I might have had my due
2052: share in the triumphs of this century: the names of the Bardi, father
2053: and son, might have been held reverently on the lips of scholars in the
2054: ages to come; not on account of frivolous verses or philosophical
2055: treatises, which are superfluous and presumptuous attempts to imitate
2056: the inimitable, such as allure vain men like Panhormita, and from which
2057: even the admirable Poggio did not keep himself sufficiently free; but
2058: because we should have given a lamp whereby men might have studied the
2059: supreme productions of the past. For why is a young man like Poliziano
2060: (who was not yet born when I was already held worthy to maintain a
2061: discussion with Thomas of Sarzana) to have a glorious memory as a
2062: commentator on the Pandects—why is Ficino, whose Latin is an offence to
2063: me, and who wanders purblind among the superstitious fancies that
2064: marked the decline at once of art, literature, and philosophy, to
2065: descend to posterity as the very high priest of Platonism, while I, who
2066: am more than their equal, have not effected anything but scattered
2067: work, which will be appropriated by other men? Why? but because my son,
2068: whom I had brought up to replenish my ripe learning with young
2069: enterprise, left me and all liberal pursuits that he might lash himself
2070: and howl at midnight with besotted friars—that he might go wandering on
2071: pilgrimages befitting men who know of no past older than the missal and
2072: the crucifix?—left me when the night was already beginning to fall on
2073: me.”
2074: 
2075: In these last words the old man’s voice, which had risen high in
2076: indignant protest, fell into a tone of reproach so tremulous and
2077: plaintive that Romola, turning her eyes again towards the blind aged
2078: face, felt her heart swell with forgiving pity. She seated herself by
2079: her father again, and placed her hand on his knee—too proud to obtrude
2080: consolation in words that might seem like a vindication of her own
2081: value, yet wishing to comfort him by some sign of her presence.
2082: 
2083: “Yes, Romola,” said Bardo, automatically letting his left-hand, with
2084: its massive prophylactic rings, fall a little too heavily on the
2085: delicate blue-veined back of the girl’s right, so that she bit her lip
2086: to prevent herself from starting. “If even Florence only is to remember
2087: me, it can but be on the same ground that it will remember Niccolò
2088: Niccoli—because I forsook the vulgar pursuit of wealth in commerce that
2089: I might devote myself to collecting the precious remains of ancient art
2090: and wisdom, and leave them, after the example of the munificent Romans,
2091: for an everlasting possession to my fellow-citizens. But why do I say
2092: Florence only? If Florence remembers me, will not the world remember
2093: me? ... Yet,” added Bardo, after a short pause, his voice falling again
2094: into a saddened key, “Lorenzo’s untimely death has raised a new
2095: difficulty. I had his promise—I should have had his bond—that my
2096: collection should always bear my name and should never be sold, though
2097: the harpies might clutch everything else; but there is enough for
2098: them—there is more than enough—and for thee, too, Romola, there will be
2099: enough. Besides, thou wilt marry; Bernardo reproaches me that I do not
2100: seek a fitting _parentado_ for thee, and we will delay no longer, we
2101: will think about it.”
2102: 
2103: “No, no, father; what could you do? besides, it is useless: wait till
2104: some one seeks me,” said Romola, hastily.
2105: 
2106: “Nay, my child, that is not the paternal duty. It was not so held by
2107: the ancients, and in this respect Florentines have not degenerated from
2108: their ancestral customs.”
2109: 
2110: “But I will study diligently,” said Romola, her eyes dilating with
2111: anxiety. “I will become as learned as Cassandra Fedele: I will try and
2112: be as useful to you as if I had been a boy, and then perhaps some great
2113: scholar will want to marry me, and will not mind about a dowry; and he
2114: will like to come and live with you, and he will be to you in place of
2115: my brother... and you will not be sorry that I was a daughter.”
2116: 
2117: There was a rising sob in Romola’s voice as she said the last words,
2118: which touched the fatherly fibre in Bardo. He stretched his hand upward
2119: a little in search of her golden hair, and as she placed her head under
2120: his hand, he gently stroked it, leaning towards her as if his eyes
2121: discerned some glimmer there.
2122: 
2123: “Nay, Romola mia, I said not so; if I have pronounced an anathema on a
2124: degenerate and ungrateful son, I said not that I could wish thee other
2125: than the sweet daughter thou hast been to me. For what son could have
2126: tended me so gently in the frequent sickness I have had of late? And
2127: even in learning thou art not, according to thy measure, contemptible.
2128: Something perhaps were to be wished in thy capacity of attention and
2129: memory, not incompatible even with the feminine mind. But as Calcondila
2130: bore testimony, when he aided me to teach thee, thou hast a ready
2131: apprehension, and even a wide-glancing intelligence. And thou hast a
2132: man’s nobility of soul: thou hast never fretted me with thy petty
2133: desires as thy mother did. It is true, I have been careful to keep thee
2134: aloof from the debasing influence of thy own sex, with their
2135: sparrow-like frivolity and their enslaving superstition, except,
2136: indeed, from that of our cousin Brigida, who may well serve as a
2137: scarecrow and a warning. And though—since I agree with the divine
2138: Petrarca, when he declares, quoting the ‘Aulularia’ of Plautus, who
2139: again was indebted for the truth to the supreme Greek intellect,
2140: ‘Optimam foeminam nullam esse, alia licet alia pejor sit’—I cannot
2141: boast that thou art entirely lifted out of that lower category to which
2142: Nature assigned thee, nor even that in erudition thou art on a par with
2143: the more learned women of this age; thou art, nevertheless—yes, Romola
2144: mia,” said the old man, his pedantry again melting into tenderness,
2145: “thou art my sweet daughter, and thy voice is as the lower notes of the
2146: flute, ‘dulcis, durabilis, clara, pura, secans aëra et auribus sedens,’
2147: according to the choice words of Quintilian; and Bernardo tells me thou
2148: art fair, and thy hair is like the brightness of the morning, and
2149: indeed it seems to me that I discern some radiance from thee. Ah! I
2150: know how all else looks in this room, but thy form I only guess at.
2151: Thou art no longer the little woman six years old, that faded for me
2152: into darkness; thou art tall, and thy arm is but little below mine. Let
2153: us walk together.”
2154: 
2155: The old man rose, and Romola, soothed by these beams of tenderness,
2156: looked happy again as she drew his arm within hers, and placed in his
2157: right-hand the stick which rested at the side of his chair. While Bardo
2158: had been sitting, he had seemed hardly more than sixty: his face,
2159: though pale, had that refined texture in which wrinkles and lines are
2160: never deep; but now that he began to walk he looked as old as he really
2161: was—rather more than seventy; for his tall spare frame had the
2162: student’s stoop of the shoulders, and he stepped with the undecided
2163: gait of the blind.
2164: 
2165: “No, Romola,” he said, pausing against the bust of Hadrian, and passing
2166: his stick from the right to the left that he might explore the familiar
2167: outline with a “seeing hand.” “There will be nothing else to preserve
2168: my memory and carry down my name as a member of the great republic of
2169: letters—nothing but my library and my collection of antiquities. And
2170: they are choice,” continued Bardo, pressing the bust and speaking in a
2171: tone of insistence. “The collections of Niccolò I know were larger; but
2172: take any collection which is the work of a single man—that of the great
2173: Boccaccio even—mine will surpass it. That of Poggio was contemptible
2174: compared with mine. It will be a great gift to unborn scholars. And
2175: there is nothing else. For even if I were to yield to the wish of Aldo
2176: Manuzio when he sets up his press at Venice, and give him the aid of my
2177: annotated manuscripts, I know well what would be the result: some other
2178: scholar’s name would stand on the title-page of the edition—some
2179: scholar who would have fed on my honey, and then declared in his
2180: preface that he had gathered it all himself fresh from Hymettus. Else,
2181: why have I refused the loan of many an annotated codex? why have I
2182: refused to make public any of my translations? why? but because
2183: scholarship is a system of licenced robbery, and your man in scarlet
2184: and furred robe who sits in judgment on thieves, is himself a thief of
2185: the thoughts and the fame that belong to his fellows. But against that
2186: robbery Bardo de’ Bardi shall struggle—though blind and forsaken, he
2187: shall struggle. I too have a right to be remembered—as great a right as
2188: Pontanus or Merula, whose names will be foremost on the lips of
2189: posterity, because they sought patronage and found it; because they had
2190: tongues that could flatter, and blood that was used to be nourished
2191: from the client’s basket. I have a right to be remembered.”
2192: 
2193: The old man’s voice had become at once loud and tremulous, and a pink
2194: flush overspread his proud, delicately-cut features, while the
2195: habitually raised attitude of his head gave the idea that behind the
2196: curtain of his blindness he saw some imaginary high tribunal to which
2197: he was appealing against the injustice of Fame.
2198: 
2199: Romola was moved with sympathetic indignation, for in her nature too
2200: there lay the same large claims, and the same spirit of struggle
2201: against their denial. She tried to calm her father by a still prouder
2202: word than his.
2203: 
2204: “Nevertheless, father, it is a great gift of the gods to be born with a
2205: hatred and contempt of all injustice and meanness. Yours is a higher
2206: lot, never to have lied and truckled, than to have shared honours won
2207: by dishonour. There is strength in scorn, as there was in the martial
2208: fury by which men became insensible to wounds.”
2209: 
2210: “It is well said, Romola. It is a Promethean word thou hast uttered,”
2211: answered Bardo, after a little interval in which he had begun to lean
2212: on his stick again, and to walk on. “And I indeed am not to be pierced
2213: by the shafts of Fortune. My armour is the _aes triplex_ of a clear
2214: conscience, and a mind nourished by the precepts of philosophy. ‘For
2215: men,’ says Epictetus, ‘are disturbed not by things themselves, but by
2216: their opinions or thoughts concerning those things.’ And again,
2217: ‘whosoever will be free, let him not desire or dread that which it is
2218: in the power of others either to deny or inflict: otherwise, he is a
2219: slave.’ And of all such gifts as are dependent on the caprice of
2220: fortune or of men, I have long ago learned to say, with Horace—who,
2221: however, is too wavering in his philosophy, vacillating between the
2222: precepts of Zeno and the less worthy maxims of Epicurus, and
2223: attempting, as we say, ‘duabus sellis sedere’—concerning such
2224: accidents, I say, with the pregnant brevity of the poet—
2225: 
2226:     ‘Sunt qui non habeant, est qui non curat habere.’
2227: 
2228: “He is referring to gems, and purple, and other insignia of wealth; but
2229: I may apply his words not less justly to the tributes men pay us with
2230: their lips and their pens, which are also matters of purchase, and
2231: often with base coin. Yes, ‘_inanis_’—hollow, empty—is the epithet
2232: justly bestowed on Fame.”
2233: 
2234: They made the tour of the room in silence after this; but Bardo’s
2235: lip-born maxims were as powerless over the passion which had been
2236: moving him, as if they had been written on parchment and hung round his
2237: neck in a sealed bag; and he presently broke forth again in a new tone
2238: of insistence.
2239: 
2240: “_Inanis_? yes, if it is a lying fame; but not if it is the just meed
2241: of labour and a great purpose. I claim my right: it is not fair that
2242: the work of my brain and my hands should not be a monument to me—it is
2243: not just that my labour should bear the name of another man. It is but
2244: little to ask,” the old man went on, bitterly, “that my name should be
2245: over the door—that men should own themselves debtors to the Bardi
2246: Library in Florence. They will speak coldly of me, perhaps: ‘a diligent
2247: collector and transcriber,’ they will say, ‘and also of some critical
2248: ingenuity, but one who could hardly be conspicuous in an age so
2249: fruitful in illustrious scholars. Yet he merits our pity, for in the
2250: latter years of his life he was blind, and his only son, to whose
2251: education he had devoted his best years—’ Nevertheless, my name will be
2252: remembered, and men will honour me: not with the breath of flattery,
2253: purchased by mean bribes, but because I have laboured, and because my
2254: labours will remain. Debts! I know there are debts; and there is thy
2255: dowry, Romola, to be paid. But there must be enough—or, at least, there
2256: can lack but a small sum, such as the Signoria might well provide. And
2257: if Lorenzo had not died, all would have been secured and settled. But
2258: now...”
2259: 
2260: At this moment Maso opened the door, and advancing to his master,
2261: announced that Nello, the barber, had desired him to say, that he was
2262: come with the Greek scholar whom he had asked leave to introduce.
2263: 
2264: “It is well,” said the old man. “Bring them in.”
2265: 
2266: Bardo, conscious that he looked more dependent when he was walking,
2267: liked always to be seated in the presence of strangers, and Romola,
2268: without needing to be told, conducted him to his chair. She was
2269: standing by him at her full height, in quiet majestic self-possession,
2270: when the visitors entered; and the most penetrating observer would
2271: hardly have divined that this proud pale face, at the slightest touch
2272: on the fibres of affection or pity, could become passionate with
2273: tenderness, or that this woman, who imposed a certain awe on those who
2274: approached her, was in a state of girlish simplicity and ignorance
2275: concerning the world outside her father’s books.
2276: 
2277: 
2278: 
2279: 
2280: CHAPTER VI.
2281: Dawning Hopes.
2282: 
2283: 
2284: When Maso opened the door again, and ushered in the two visitors,
2285: Nello, first making a deep reverence to Romola, gently pushed Tito
2286: before him, and advanced with him towards her father.
2287: 
2288: “Messer Bardo,” he said, in a more measured and respectful tone than
2289: was usual with him, “I have the honour of presenting to you the Greek
2290: scholar, who has been eager to have speech of you, not less from the
2291: report I have made to him of your learning and your priceless
2292: collections, than because of the furtherance your patronage may give
2293: him under the transient need to which he has been reduced by shipwreck.
2294: His name is Tito Melema, at your service.”
2295: 
2296: Romola’s astonishment could hardly have been greater if the stranger
2297: had worn a panther-skin and carried a thyrsus; for the cunning barber
2298: had said nothing of the Greek’s age or appearance; and among her
2299: father’s scholarly visitors, she had hardly ever seen any but
2300: middle-aged or grey-headed men. There was only one masculine face, at
2301: once youthful and beautiful, the image of which remained deeply
2302: impressed on her mind: it was that of her brother, who long years ago
2303: had taken her on his knee, kissed her, and never come back again: a
2304: fair face, with sunny hair, like her own. But the habitual attitude of
2305: her mind towards strangers—a proud self-dependence and determination to
2306: ask for nothing even by a smile—confirmed in her by her father’s
2307: complaints against the world’s injustice, was like a snowy embankment
2308: hemming in the rush of admiring surprise. Tito’s bright face showed its
2309: rich-tinted beauty without any rivalry of colour above his black _sajo_
2310: or tunic reaching to the knees. It seemed like a wreath of spring,
2311: dropped suddenly in Romola’s young but wintry life, which had inherited
2312: nothing but memories—memories of a dead mother, of a lost brother, of a
2313: blind father’s happier time—memories of far-off light, love, and
2314: beauty, that lay embedded in dark mines of books, and could hardly give
2315: out their brightness again until they were kindled for her by the torch
2316: of some known joy. Nevertheless, she returned Tito’s bow, made to her
2317: on entering, with the same pale proud face as ever; but, as he
2318: approached, the snow melted, and when he ventured to look towards her
2319: again, while Nello was speaking, a pink flush overspread her face, to
2320: vanish again almost immediately, as if her imperious will had recalled
2321: it. Tito’s glance, on the contrary, had that gentle, beseeching
2322: admiration in it which is the most propitiating of appeals to a proud,
2323: shy woman, and is perhaps the only atonement a man can make for being
2324: too handsome. The finished fascination of his air came chiefly from the
2325: absence of demand and assumption. It was that of a fleet, soft-coated,
2326: dark-eyed animal that delights you by not bounding away in indifference
2327: from you, and unexpectedly pillows its chin on your palm, and looks up
2328: at you desiring to be stroked—as if it loved you.
2329: 
2330: “Messere, I give you welcome,” said Bardo, with some condescension;
2331: “misfortune wedded to learning, and especially to Greek learning, is a
2332: letter of credit that should win the ear of every instructed
2333: Florentine; for, as you are doubtless aware, since the period when your
2334: countryman, Manuelo Crisolora, diffused the light of his teaching in
2335: the chief cities of Italy, now nearly a century ago, no man is held
2336: worthy of the name of scholar who has acquired merely the transplanted
2337: and derivative literature of the Latins; rather, such inert students
2338: are stigmatised as _opici_ or barbarians according to the phrase of the
2339: Romans themselves, who frankly replenished their urns at the
2340: fountain-head. I am, as you perceive, and as Nello has doubtless
2341: forewarned you, totally blind: a calamity to which we Florentines are
2342: held especially liable, whether owing to the cold winds which rush upon
2343: us in spring from the passes of the Apennines, or to that sudden
2344: transition from the cool gloom of our houses to the dazzling brightness
2345: of our summer sun, by which the _lippi_ are said to have been made so
2346: numerous among the ancient Romans; or, in fine, to some occult cause
2347: which eludes our superficial surmises. But I pray you be seated: Nello,
2348: my friend, be seated.”
2349: 
2350: Bardo paused until his fine ear had assured him that the visitors were
2351: seating themselves, and that Romola was taking her usual chair at his
2352: right-hand. Then he said—
2353: 
2354: “From what part of Greece do you come, Messere? I had thought that your
2355: unhappy country had been almost exhausted of those sons who could
2356: cherish in their minds any image of her original glory, though indeed
2357: the barbarous Sultans have of late shown themselves not indisposed to
2358: engraft on their wild stock the precious vine which their own fierce
2359: bands have hewn down and trampled under foot. From what part of Greece
2360: do you come?”
2361: 
2362: “I sailed last from Nauplia,” said Tito; “but I have resided both at
2363: Constantinople and Thessalonica, and have travelled in various parts
2364: little visited by Western Christians since the triumph of the Turkish
2365: arms. I should tell you, however, Messere, that I was not born in
2366: Greece, but at Bari. I spent the first sixteen years of my life in
2367: Southern Italy and Sicily.”
2368: 
2369: While Tito was speaking, some emotion passed, like a breath on the
2370: waters, across Bardo’s delicate features; he leaned forward, put out
2371: his right-hand towards Romola, and turned his head as if about to speak
2372: to her; but then, correcting himself, turned away again, and said, in a
2373: subdued voice—
2374: 
2375: “Excuse me; is it not true—you are young?”
2376: 
2377: “I am three-and-twenty,” said Tito.
2378: 
2379: “Ah,” said Bardo, still in a tone of subdued excitement, “and you had,
2380: doubtless, a father who cared for your early instruction—who, perhaps,
2381: was himself a scholar?”
2382: 
2383: There was a slight pause before Tito’s answer came to the ear of Bardo;
2384: but for Romola and Nello it began with a slight shock that seemed to
2385: pass through him, and cause a momentary quivering of the lip; doubtless
2386: at the revival of a supremely painful remembrance.
2387: 
2388: “Yes,” he replied, “at least a father by adoption. He was a Neapolitan,
2389: and of accomplished scholarship, both Latin and Greek. But,” added
2390: Tito, after another slight pause, “he is lost to me—was lost on a
2391: voyage he too rashly undertook to Delos.”
2392: 
2393: Bardo sank backward again, too delicate to ask another question that
2394: might probe a sorrow which he divined to be recent. Romola, who knew
2395: well what were the fibres that Tito’s voice had stirred in her father,
2396: felt that this new acquaintance had with wonderful suddenness got
2397: within the barrier that lay between them and the alien world. Nello,
2398: thinking that the evident check given to the conversation offered a
2399: graceful opportunity for relieving himself from silence, said—
2400: 
2401: “In truth, it is as clear as Venetian glass that this fine young man
2402: has had the best training; for the two Cennini have set him to work at
2403: their Greek sheets already, and it seems to me they are not men to
2404: begin cutting before they have felt the edge of their tools; they
2405: tested him well beforehand, we may be sure, and if there are two things
2406: not to be hidden—love and a cough—I say there is a third, and that is
2407: ignorance, when once a man is obliged to do something besides wagging
2408: his head. The _tonsor inequalis_ is inevitably betrayed when he takes
2409: the shears in his hand; is it not true, Messer Bardo? I speak after the
2410: fashion of a barber, but, as Luigi Pulci says—
2411: 
2412: 
2413: “‘Perdonimi s’io fallo: chi m’ascolta
2414: Intenda il mio volgar col suo latino.’”
2415: 
2416: 
2417: “Nay, my good Nello,” said Bardo, with an air of friendly severity,
2418: “you are not altogether illiterate, and might doubtless have made a
2419: more respectable progress in learning if you had abstained somewhat
2420: from the _cicalata_ and gossip of the street-corner, to which our
2421: Florentines are excessively addicted; but still more if you had not
2422: clogged your memory with those frivolous productions of which Luigi
2423: Pulci has furnished the most peccant exemplar—a compendium of
2424: extravagances and incongruities the farthest removed from the models of
2425: a pure age, and resembling rather the _grylli_ or conceits of a period
2426: when mystic meaning was held a warrant for monstrosity of form; with
2427: this difference, that while the monstrosity is retained, the mystic
2428: meaning is absent; in contemptible contrast with the great poem of
2429: Virgil, who, as I long held with Filelfo, before Landino had taken upon
2430: him to expound the same opinion, embodied the deepest lessons of
2431: philosophy in a graceful and well-knit fable. And I cannot but regard
2432: the multiplication of these babbling, lawless productions, albeit
2433: countenanced by the patronage, and in some degree the example of
2434: Lorenzo himself, otherwise a friend to true learning, as a sign that
2435: the glorious hopes of this century are to be quenched in gloom; nay,
2436: that they have been the delusive prologue to an age worse than that of
2437: iron—the age of tinsel and gossamer, in which no thought has substance
2438: enough to be moulded into consistent and lasting form.”
2439: 
2440: “Once more, pardon,” said Nello, opening his palms outwards, and
2441: shrugging his shoulders, “I find myself knowing so many things in good
2442: Tuscan before I have time to think of the Latin for them; and Messer
2443: Luigi’s rhymes are always slipping off the lips of my customers:—that
2444: is what corrupts me. And, indeed, talking of customers, I have left my
2445: shop and my reputation too long in the custody of my slow Sandro, who
2446: does not deserve even to be called a _tonsor inequalis_, but rather to
2447: be pronounced simply a bungler in the vulgar tongue. So with your
2448: permission, Messer Bardo, I will take my leave—well understood that I
2449: am at your service whenever Maso calls upon me. It seems a thousand
2450: years till I dress and perfume the damigella’s hair, which deserves to
2451: shine in the heavens as a constellation, though indeed it were a pity
2452: for it ever to go so far out of reach.”
2453: 
2454: Three voices made a fugue of friendly farewells to Nello, as he
2455: retreated with a bow to Romola and a beck to Tito. The acute barber saw
2456: that the pretty youngster, who had crept into his liking by some strong
2457: magic, was well launched in Bardo’s favourable regard; and satisfied
2458: that his introduction had not miscarried so far, he felt the propriety
2459: of retiring.
2460: 
2461: The little burst of wrath, called forth by Nello’s unlucky quotation,
2462: had diverted Bardo’s mind from the feelings which had just before been
2463: hemming in further speech, and he now addressed Tito again with his
2464: ordinary calmness.
2465: 
2466: “Ah! young man, you are happy in having been able to unite the
2467: advantages of travel with those of study, and you will be welcome among
2468: us as a bringer of fresh tidings from a land which has become sadly
2469: strange to us, except through the agents of a now restricted commerce
2470: and the reports of hasty pilgrims. For those days are in the far
2471: distance which I myself witnessed, when men like Aurispa and Guarino
2472: went out to Greece as to a storehouse, and came back laden with
2473: manuscripts which every scholar was eager to borrow—and, be it owned
2474: with shame, not always willing to restore; nay, even the days when
2475: erudite Greeks flocked to our shores for a refuge, seem far-off
2476: now—farther off than the on-coming of my blindness. But doubtless,
2477: young man, research after the treasures of antiquity was not alien to
2478: the purpose of your travels?”
2479: 
2480: “Assuredly not,” said Tito. “On the contrary, my companion—my
2481: father—was willing to risk his life in his zeal for the discovery of
2482: inscriptions and other traces of ancient civilisation.”
2483: 
2484: “And I trust there is a record of his researches and their results,”
2485: said Bardo, eagerly, “since they must be even more precious than those
2486: of Ciriaco, which I have diligently availed myself of, though they are
2487: not always illuminated by adequate learning.”
2488: 
2489: “There _was_ such a record,” said Tito, “but it was lost, like
2490: everything else, in the shipwreck I suffered below Ancona. The only
2491: record left is such as remains in our—in my memory.”
2492: 
2493: “You must lose no time in committing it to paper, young man,” said
2494: Bardo, with growing interest. “Doubtless you remember much, if you
2495: aided in transcription; for when I was your age, words wrought
2496: themselves into my mind as if they had been fixed by the tool of the
2497: graver; wherefore I constantly marvel at the capriciousness of my
2498: daughter’s memory, which grasps certain objects with tenacity, and lets
2499: fall all those minutiae whereon depends accuracy, the very soul of
2500: scholarship. But I apprehend no such danger with you, young man, if
2501: your will has seconded the advantages of your training.”
2502: 
2503: When Bardo made this reference to his daughter, Tito ventured to turn
2504: his eyes towards her, and at the accusation against her memory his face
2505: broke into its brightest smile, which was reflected as inevitably as
2506: sudden sunbeams in Romola’s. Conceive the soothing delight of that
2507: smile to her! Romola had never dreamed that there was a scholar in the
2508: world who would smile at a deficiency for which she was constantly made
2509: to feel herself a culprit. It was like the dawn of a new sense to
2510: her—the sense of comradeship. They did not look away from each other
2511: immediately, as if the smile had been a stolen one; they looked and
2512: smiled with frank enjoyment.
2513: 
2514: “She is not really so cold and proud,” thought Tito.
2515: 
2516: “Does _he_ forget too, I wonder?” thought Romola, “Yet I hope not, else
2517: he will vex my father.”
2518: 
2519: But Tito was obliged to turn away, and answer Bardo’s question.
2520: 
2521: “I have had much practice in transcription,” he said; “but in the case
2522: of inscriptions copied in memorable scenes, rendered doubly impressive
2523: by the sense of risk and adventure, it may have happened that my
2524: retention of written characters has been weakened. On the plain of the
2525: Eurotas, or among the gigantic stones of Mycenae and Tyrins—especially
2526: when the fear of the Turk hovers over one like a vulture—the mind
2527: wanders, even though the hand writes faithfully what the eye dictates.
2528: But something doubtless I have retained,” added Tito, with a modesty
2529: which was not false, though he was conscious that it was politic,
2530: “something that might be of service if illustrated and corrected by a
2531: wider learning than my own.”
2532: 
2533: “That is well spoken, young man,” said Bardo, delighted. “And I will
2534: not withhold from you such aid as I can give, if you like to
2535: communicate with me concerning your recollections. I foresee a work
2536: which will be a useful supplement to the ‘Isolario’ of Christoforo
2537: Buondelmonte, and which may take rank with the ‘Itineraria’ of Ciriaco
2538: and the admirable Ambrogio Traversari. But we must prepare ourselves
2539: for calumny, young man,” Bardo went on with energy, as if the work were
2540: already growing so fast that the time of trial was near; “if your book
2541: contains novelties you will be charged with forgery; if my elucidations
2542: should clash with any principles of interpretation adopted by another
2543: scholar, our personal characters will be attacked, we shall be
2544: impeached with foul actions; you must prepare yourself to be told that
2545: your mother was a fish-woman, and that your father was a renegade
2546: priest or a hanged malefactor. I myself, for having shown error in a
2547: single preposition, had an invective written against me wherein I was
2548: taxed with treachery, fraud, indecency, and even hideous crimes. Such,
2549: my young friend—such are the flowers with which the glorious path of
2550: scholarship is strewed! But tell me, then: I have learned much
2551: concerning Byzantium and Thessalonica long ago from Demetrio
2552: Calcondila, who has but lately departed from Florence; but you, it
2553: seems, have visited less familiar scenes?”
2554: 
2555: “Yes; we made what I may call a pilgrimage full of danger, for the sake
2556: of visiting places which have almost died out of the memory of the
2557: West, for they lie away from the track of pilgrims; and my father used
2558: to say that scholars themselves hardly imagine them to have any
2559: existence out of books. He was of opinion that a new and more glorious
2560: era would open for learning when men should begin to look for their
2561: commentaries on the ancient writers in the remains of cities and
2562: temples, nay, in the paths of the rivers, and on the face of the
2563: valleys and the mountains.”
2564: 
2565: “Ah!” said Bardo, fervidly, “your father, then, was not a common man.
2566: Was he fortunate, may I ask? Had he many friends?” These last words
2567: were uttered in a tone charged with meaning.
2568: 
2569: “No; he made enemies—chiefly, I believe, by a certain impetuous
2570: candour; and they hindered his advancement, so that he lived in
2571: obscurity. And he would never stoop to conciliate: he could never
2572: forget an injury.”
2573: 
2574: “Ah!” said Bardo again, with a long, deep intonation.
2575: 
2576: “Among our hazardous expeditions,” continued Tito, willing to prevent
2577: further questions on a point so personal, “I remember with particular
2578: vividness a hastily snatched visit to Athens. Our hurry, and the double
2579: danger of being seized as prisoners by the Turks, and of our galley
2580: raising anchor before we could return, made it seem like a fevered
2581: vision of the night—the wide plain, the girdling mountains, the ruined
2582: porticos and columns, either standing far aloof, as if receding from
2583: our hurried footsteps, or else jammed in confusedly among the dwellings
2584: of Christians degraded into servitude, or among the forts and turrets
2585: of their Moslem conquerors, who have their stronghold on the
2586: Acropolis.”
2587: 
2588: “You fill me with surprise,” said Bardo. “Athens, then, is not utterly
2589: destroyed and swept away, as I had imagined?”
2590: 
2591: “No wonder you should be under that mistake, for few even of the Greeks
2592: themselves, who live beyond the mountain boundary of Attica, know
2593: anything about the present condition of Athens, or _Setine_, as the
2594: sailors call it. I remember, as we were rounding the promontory of
2595: Sunium, the Greek pilot we had on board our Venetian galley pointed to
2596: the mighty columns that stand on the summit of the rock—the remains, as
2597: you know well, of the great temple erected to the goddess Athena, who
2598: looked down from that high shrine with triumph at her conquered rival
2599: Poseidon;—well, our Greek pilot, pointing to those columns, said, ‘That
2600: was the school of the great philosopher Aristotle.’ And at Athens
2601: itself, the monk who acted as our guide in the hasty view we snatched,
2602: insisted most on showing us the spot where Saint Philip baptised the
2603: Ethiopian eunuch, or some such legend.”
2604: 
2605: “Talk not of monks and their legends, young man!” said Bardo,
2606: interrupting Tito impetuously. “It is enough to overlay human hope and
2607: enterprise with an eternal frost to think that the ground which was
2608: trodden by philosophers and poets is crawled over by those
2609: insect-swarms of besotted fanatics or howling hypocrites.”
2610: 
2611: “_Perdio_, I have no affection for them,” said Tito, with a shrug;
2612: “servitude agrees well with a religion like theirs, which lies in the
2613: renunciation of all that makes life precious to other men. And they
2614: carry the yoke that befits them: their matin chant is drowned by the
2615: voice of the muezzin, who, from the gallery of the high tower on the
2616: Acropolis, calls every Mussulman to his prayers. That tower springs
2617: from the Parthenon itself; and every time we paused and directed our
2618: eyes towards it, our guide set up a wail, that a temple which had once
2619: been won from the diabolical uses of the pagans to become the temple of
2620: another virgin than Pallas—the Virgin Mother of God—was now again
2621: perverted to the accursed ends of the Moslem. It was the sight of those
2622: walls of the Acropolis, which disclosed themselves in the distance as
2623: we leaned over the side of our galley when it was forced by contrary
2624: winds to anchor in the Piraeus, that fired my father’s mind with the
2625: determination to see Athens at all risks, and in spite of the sailors’
2626: warnings that if we lingered till a change of wind, they would depart
2627: without us: but, after all, it was impossible for us to venture near
2628: the Acropolis, for the sight of men eager in examining ‘old stones’
2629: raised the suspicion that we were Venetian spies, and we had to hurry
2630: back to the harbour.”
2631: 
2632: “We will talk more of these things,” said Bardo, eagerly. “You must
2633: recall everything, to the minutest trace left in your memory. You will
2634: win the gratitude of after-times by leaving a record of the aspect
2635: Greece bore while yet the barbarians had not swept away every trace of
2636: the structures that Pausanias and Pliny described: you will take those
2637: great writers as your models; and such contribution of criticism and
2638: suggestion as my riper mind can supply shall not be wanting to you.
2639: There will be much to tell; for you have travelled, you said, in the
2640: Peloponnesus?”
2641: 
2642: “Yes; and in Boeotia also: I have rested in the groves of Helicon, and
2643: tasted of the fountain Hippocrene. But on every memorable spot in
2644: Greece conquest after conquest has set its seal, till there is a
2645: confusion of ownership even in ruins, that only close study and
2646: comparison could unravel. High over every fastness, from the plains of
2647: Lacedaemon to the straits of Thermopylae, there towers some huge
2648: Frankish fortress, once inhabited by a French or Italian marquis, now
2649: either abandoned or held by Turkish bands.”
2650: 
2651: “Stay!” cried Bardo, whose mind was now too thoroughly preoccupied by
2652: the idea of the future book to attend to Tito’s further narration. “Do
2653: you think of writing in Latin or Greek? Doubtless Greek is the more
2654: ready clothing for your thoughts, and it is the nobler language. But,
2655: on the other hand, Latin is the tongue in which we shall measure
2656: ourselves with the larger and more famous number of modern rivals. And
2657: if you are less at ease in it, I will aid you—yes, I will spend on you
2658: that long-accumulated study which was to have been thrown into the
2659: channel of another work—a work in which I myself was to have had a
2660: helpmate.”
2661: 
2662: Bardo paused a moment, and then added—
2663: 
2664: “But who knows whether that work may not be executed yet? For you, too,
2665: young man, have been brought up by a father who poured into your mind
2666: all the long-gathered stream of his knowledge and experience. Our aid
2667: might be mutual.”
2668: 
2669: Romola, who had watched her father’s growing excitement, and divined
2670: well the invisible currents of feeling that determined every question
2671: and remark, felt herself in a glow of strange anxiety: she turned her
2672: eyes on Tito continually, to watch the impression her father’s words
2673: made on him, afraid lest he should be inclined to dispel these visions
2674: of co-operation which were lighting up her father’s face with a new
2675: hope. But no! He looked so bright and gentle: he must feel, as she did,
2676: that in this eagerness of blind age there was piteousness enough to
2677: call forth inexhaustible patience. How much more strongly he would feel
2678: this if he knew about her brother! A girl of eighteen imagines the
2679: feelings behind the face that has moved her with its sympathetic youth,
2680: as easily as primitive people imagined the humours of the gods in fair
2681: weather: what is she to believe in, if not in this vision woven from
2682: within?
2683: 
2684: And Tito was really very far from feeling impatient. He delighted in
2685: sitting there with the sense that Romola’s attention was fixed on him,
2686: and that he could occasionally look at her. He was pleased that Bardo
2687: should take an interest in him; and he did not dwell with enough
2688: seriousness on the prospect of the work in which he was to be aided, to
2689: feel moved by it to anything else than that easy, good-humoured
2690: acquiescence which was natural to him.
2691: 
2692: “I shall be proud and happy,” he said, in answer to Bardo’s last words,
2693: “if my services can be held a meet offering to the matured scholarship
2694: of Messere. But doubtless,”—here he looked towards Romola—“the lovely
2695: damigella, your daughter, makes all other aid superfluous; for I have
2696: learned from Nello that she has been nourished on the highest studies
2697: from her earliest years.”
2698: 
2699: “You are mistaken,” said Romola; “I am by no means sufficient to my
2700: father: I have not the gifts that are necessary for scholarship.”
2701: 
2702: Romola did not make this self-depreciatory statement in a tone of
2703: anxious humility, but with a proud gravity.
2704: 
2705: “Nay, my Romola,” said her father, not willing that the stranger should
2706: have too low a conception of his daughter’s powers; “thou art not
2707: destitute of gifts; rather, thou art endowed beyond the measure of
2708: women; but thou hast withal the woman’s delicate frame, which ever
2709: craves repose and variety, and so begets a wandering imagination. My
2710: daughter,”—turning to Tito—“has been very precious to me, filling up to
2711: the best of her power the place of a son. For I had once a son...”
2712: 
2713: Bardo checked himself: he did not wish to assume an attitude of
2714: complaint in the presence of a stranger, and he remembered that this
2715: young man, in whom he had unexpectedly become so much interested, was
2716: still a stranger, towards whom it became him rather to keep the
2717: position of a patron. His pride was roused to double activity by the
2718: fear that he had forgotten his dignity.
2719: 
2720: “But,” he resumed, in his original tone of condescension, “we are
2721: departing from what I believe is to you the most important business.
2722: Nello informed me that you had certain gems which you would fain
2723: dispose of, and that you desired a passport to some man of wealth and
2724: taste who would be likely to become a purchaser.”
2725: 
2726: “It is true; for, though I have obtained employment, as a corrector
2727: with the Cennini, my payment leaves little margin beyond the provision
2728: of necessaries, and would leave less but that my good friend Nello
2729: insists on my hiring a lodging from him, and saying nothing about the
2730: rent till better days.”
2731: 
2732: “Nello is a good-hearted prodigal,” said Bardo; “and though, with that
2733: ready ear and ready tongue of his, he is too much like the ill-famed
2734: Margites—knowing many things and knowing them all badly, as I hinted to
2735: him but now—he is nevertheless ‘abnormis sapiens,’ after the manner of
2736: our born Florentines. But have you the gems with you? I would willingly
2737: know what they are—yet it is useless: no, it might only deepen regret.
2738: I cannot add to my store.”
2739: 
2740: “I have one or two intaglios of much beauty,” said Tito, proceeding to
2741: draw from his wallet a small case.
2742: 
2743: But Romola no sooner saw the movement than she looked at him with
2744: significant gravity, and placed her finger on her lips—
2745: 
2746: 
2747: “Con viso che tacendo dicea, Taci.”
2748: 
2749: 
2750: If Bardo were made aware that the gems were within reach, she knew well
2751: he would want a minute description of them, and it would become pain to
2752: him that they should go away from him, even if he did not insist on
2753: some device for purchasing them in spite of poverty. But she had no
2754: sooner made this sign than she felt rather guilty and ashamed at having
2755: virtually confessed a weakness of her father’s to a stranger. It seemed
2756: that she was destined to a sudden confidence and familiarity with this
2757: young Greek, strangely at variance with her deep-seated pride and
2758: reserve; and this consciousness again brought the unwonted colour to
2759: her cheeks.
2760: 
2761: Tito understood her look and sign, and immediately withdrew his hand
2762: from the case, saying, in a careless tone, so as to make it appear that
2763: he was merely following up his last words, “But they are usually in the
2764: keeping of Messer Domenico Cennini, who has strong and safe places for
2765: these things. He estimates them as worth at least five hundred ducats.”
2766: 
2767: “Ah, then, they are fine intagli,” said Bardo. “Five hundred ducats!
2768: Ah, more than a man’s ransom!”
2769: 
2770: Tito gave a slight, almost imperceptible start, and opened his long
2771: dark eyes with questioning surprise at Bardo’s blind face, as if his
2772: words—a mere phrase of common parlance, at a time when men were often
2773: being ransomed from slavery or imprisonment—had had some special
2774: meaning for him. But the next moment he looked towards Romola, as if
2775: her eyes must be her father’s interpreters. She, intensely preoccupied
2776: with what related to her father, imagined that Tito was looking to her
2777: again for some guidance, and immediately spoke.
2778: 
2779: “Alessandra Scala delights in gems, you know, father; she calls them
2780: her winter flowers; and the Segretario would be almost sure to buy any
2781: gems that she wished for. Besides, he himself sets great store by rings
2782: and sigils, which he wears as a defence against pains in the joints.”
2783: 
2784: “It is true,” said Bardo. “Bartolommeo has overmuch confidence in the
2785: efficacy of gems—a confidence wider than what is sanctioned by Pliny,
2786: who clearly shows that he regards many beliefs of that sort as idle
2787: superstitions; though not to the utter denial of medicinal virtues in
2788: gems. Wherefore, I myself, as you observe, young man, wear certain
2789: rings, which the discreet Camillo Leonardi prescribed to me by letter
2790: when two years ago I had a certain infirmity of sudden numbness. But
2791: thou hast spoken well, Romola. I will dictate a letter to Bartolommeo,
2792: which Maso shall carry. But it were well that Messere should notify to
2793: thee what the gems are, together with the intagli they bear, as a
2794: warrant to Bartolommeo that they will be worthy of his attention.”
2795: 
2796: “Nay, father,” said Romola, whose dread lest a paroxysm of the
2797: collector’s mania should seize her father, gave her the courage to
2798: resist his proposal. “Your word will be sufficient that Messere is a
2799: scholar and has travelled much. The Segretario will need no further
2800: inducement to receive him.”
2801: 
2802: “True, child,” said Bardo, touched on a chord that was sure to respond.
2803: “I have no need to add proofs and arguments in confirmation of my word
2804: to Bartolommeo. And I doubt not that this young man’s presence is in
2805: accord with the tones of his voice, so that, the door being once
2806: opened, he will be his own best advocate.”
2807: 
2808: Bardo paused a few moments, but his silence was evidently charged with
2809: some idea that he was hesitating to express, for he once leaned forward
2810: a little as if he were going to speak, then turned his head aside
2811: towards Romola and sank backward again. At last, as if he had made up
2812: his mind, he said in a tone which might have become a prince giving the
2813: courteous signal of dismissal—
2814: 
2815: “I am somewhat fatigued this morning, and shall prefer seeing you again
2816: to-morrow, when I shall be able to give you the secretary’s answer,
2817: authorising you to present yourself to him at some given time. But
2818: before you go,”—here the old man, in spite of himself, fell into a more
2819: faltering tone—“you will perhaps permit me to touch your hand? It is
2820: long since I touched the hand of a young man.”
2821: 
2822: Bardo had stretched out his aged white hand, and Tito immediately
2823: placed his dark but delicate and supple fingers within it. Bardo’s
2824: cramped fingers closed over them, and he held them for a few minutes in
2825: silence. Then he said—
2826: 
2827: “Romola, has this young man the same complexion as thy brother—fair and
2828: pale?”
2829: 
2830: “No, father,” Romola answered, with determined composure, though her
2831: heart began to beat violently with mingled emotions. “The hair of
2832: Messere is dark—his complexion is dark.” Inwardly she said, “Will he
2833: mind it? will it be disagreeable? No, he looks so gentle and
2834: good-natured.” Then aloud again—
2835: 
2836: “Would Messere permit my father to touch his hair and face?”
2837: 
2838: Her eyes inevitably made a timid entreating appeal while she asked
2839: this, and Tito’s met them with soft brightness as he said, “Assuredly,”
2840: and, leaning forward, raised Bardo’s hand to his curls, with a
2841: readiness of assent, which was the greater relief to her, because it
2842: was unaccompanied by any sign of embarrassment.
2843: 
2844: Bardo passed his hand again and again over the long curls and grasped
2845: them a little, as if their spiral resistance made his inward vision
2846: clearer; then he passed his hand over the brow and cheek, tracing the
2847: profile with the edge of his palm and fourth finger, and letting the
2848: breadth of his hand repose on the rich oval of the cheek.
2849: 
2850: “Ah,” he said, as his hand glided from the face and rested on the young
2851: man’s shoulder. “He must be very unlike thy brother, Romola: and it is
2852: the better. You see no visions, I trust, my young friend?”
2853: 
2854: At this moment the door opened, and there entered, unannounced, a tall
2855: elderly man in a handsome black silk lucco, who, unwinding his
2856: becchetto from his neck and taking off his cap, disclosed a head as
2857: white as Bardo’s. He cast a keen glance of surprise at the group before
2858: him—the young stranger leaning in that filial attitude, while Bardo’s
2859: hand rested on his shoulder, and Romola sitting near with eyes dilated
2860: by anxiety and agitation. But there was an instantaneous change: Bardo
2861: let fall his hand, Tito raised himself from his stooping posture, and
2862: Romola rose to meet the visitor with an alacrity which implied all the
2863: greater intimacy, because it was unaccompanied by any smile.
2864: 
2865: “Well, god-daughter,” said the stately man, as he touched Romola’s
2866: shoulder; “Maso said you had a visitor, but I came in nevertheless.”
2867: 
2868: “It is thou, Bernardo,” said Bardo. “Thou art come at a fortunate
2869: moment. This, young man,” he continued, while Tito rose and bowed, “is
2870: one of the chief citizens of Florence, Messer Bernardo del Nero, my
2871: oldest, I had almost said my only friend—whose good opinion, if you can
2872: win it, may carry you far. He is but three-and-twenty, Bernardo, yet he
2873: can doubtless tell thee much which thou wilt care to hear; for though a
2874: scholar, he has already travelled far, and looked on other things
2875: besides the manuscripts for which thou hast too light an esteem.”
2876: 
2877: “Ah, a Greek, as I augur,” said Bernardo, returning Tito’s reverence
2878: but slightly, and surveying him with that sort of glance which seems
2879: almost to cut like fine steel. “Newly arrived in Florence, it appears.
2880: The name of Messere—or part of it, for it is doubtless a long one?”
2881: 
2882: “On the contrary,” said Tito, with perfect good-humour, “it is most
2883: modestly free from polysyllabic pomp. My name is Tito Melema.”
2884: 
2885: “Truly?” said Bernardo, rather scornfully, as he took a seat; “I had
2886: expected it to be at least as long as the names of a city, a river, a
2887: province, and an empire all put together. We Florentines mostly use
2888: names as we do prawns, and strip them of all flourishes before we trust
2889: them to our throats.”
2890: 
2891: “Well, Bardo,” he continued, as if the stranger were not worth further
2892: notice, and changing his tone of sarcastic suspicion for one of
2893: sadness, “we have buried him.”
2894: 
2895: “Ah!” replied Bardo, with corresponding sadness, “and a new epoch has
2896: come for Florence—a dark one, I fear. Lorenzo has left behind him an
2897: inheritance that is but like the alchemist’s laboratory when the wisdom
2898: of the alchemist is gone.”
2899: 
2900: “Not altogether so,” said Bernardo. “Piero de’ Medici has abundant
2901: intelligence; his faults are only the faults of hot blood. I love the
2902: lad—lad he will always be to me, as I have always been ‘little father’
2903: to him.”
2904: 
2905: “Yet all who want a new order of things are likely to conceive new
2906: hopes,” said Bardo. “We shall have the old strife of parties, I fear.”
2907: 
2908: “If we could have a new order of things that was something else than
2909: knocking down one coat of arms to put up another,” said Bernardo, “I
2910: should be ready to say, ‘I belong to no party: I am a Florentine.’ But
2911: as long as parties are in question, I am a Medicean, and will be a
2912: Medicean till I die. I am of the same mind as Farinata degli Uberti: if
2913: any man asks me what is meant by siding with a party, I say, as he did,
2914: ‘To wish ill or well, for the sake of past wrongs or kindnesses.’”
2915: 
2916: During this short dialogue, Tito had been standing, and now took his
2917: leave.
2918: 
2919: “But come again at the same hour to-morrow,” said Bardo, graciously,
2920: before Tito left the room, “that I may give you Bartolommeo’s answer.”
2921: 
2922: “From what quarter of the sky has this pretty Greek youngster alighted
2923: so close to thy chair, Bardo?” said Bernardo del Nero, as the door
2924: closed. He spoke with dry emphasis, evidently intended to convey
2925: something more to Bardo than was implied by the mere words.
2926: 
2927: “He is a scholar who has been shipwrecked and has saved a few gems, for
2928: which he wants to find a purchaser. I am going to send him to
2929: Bartolommeo Scala, for thou knowest it were more prudent in me to
2930: abstain from further purchases.”
2931: 
2932: Bernardo shrugged his shoulders and said, “Romola, wilt thou see if my
2933: servant is without? I ordered him to wait for me here.” Then, when
2934: Romola was at a sufficient distance, he leaned forward and said to
2935: Bardo in a low, emphatic tone—
2936: 
2937: “Remember, Bardo, thou hast a rare gem of thy own; take care no one
2938: gets it who is not likely to pay a worthy price. That pretty Greek has
2939: a lithe sleekness about him, that seems marvellously fitted for
2940: slipping easily into any nest he fixes his mind on.”
2941: 
2942: Bardo was startled: the association of Tito with the image of his lost
2943: son had excluded instead of suggesting the thought of Romola. But
2944: almost immediately there seemed to be a reaction which made him grasp
2945: the warning as if it had been a hope.
2946: 
2947: “But why not, Bernardo? If the young man approved himself worthy—he is
2948: a scholar—and—and there would be no difficulty about the dowry, which
2949: always makes thee gloomy.”
2950: 
2951: 
2952: 
2953: 
2954: CHAPTER VII.
2955: A Learned Squabble.
2956: 
2957: 
2958: Bartolommeo Scala, secretary of the Florentine Republic, on whom Tito
2959: Melema had been thus led to anchor his hopes, lived in a handsome
2960: palace close to the Porta Pinti, now known as the Casa Gherardesca. His
2961: arms—an azure ladder transverse on a golden field, with the motto
2962: _Gradatim_ placed over the entrance—told all comers that the miller’s
2963: son held his ascent to honours by his own efforts a fact to be
2964: proclaimed without wincing. The secretary was a vain and pompous man,
2965: but he was also an honest one: he was sincerely convinced of his own
2966: merit, and could see no reason for feigning. The topmost round of his
2967: azure ladder had been reached by this time: he had held his
2968: secretaryship these twenty years—had long since made his orations on
2969: the _ringhiera_, or platform of the Old Palace, as the custom was, in
2970: the presence of princely visitors, while Marzocco, the republican lion,
2971: wore his gold crown on the occasion, and all the people cried, “Viva
2972: Messer Bartolommeo!”—had been on an embassy to Rome, and had there been
2973: made titular Senator, Apostolical Secretary, Knight of the Golden Spur;
2974: and had, eight years ago, been Gonfaloniere—last goal of the Florentine
2975: citizen’s ambition. Meantime he had got richer and richer, and more and
2976: more gouty, after the manner of successful mortality; and the Knight of
2977: the Golden Spur had often to sit with helpless cushioned heel under the
2978: handsome loggia he had built for himself, overlooking the spacious
2979: gardens and lawn at the back of his palace.
2980: 
2981: He was in this position on the day when he had granted the desired
2982: interview to Tito Melema. The May afternoon sun was on the flowers and
2983: the grass beyond the pleasant shade of the loggia; the too stately silk
2984: lucco was cast aside, and the light loose mantle was thrown over his
2985: tunic; his beautiful daughter Alessandra and her husband, the Greek
2986: soldier-poet Marullo, were seated on one side of him: on the other, two
2987: friends not oppressively illustrious, and therefore the better
2988: listeners. Yet, to say nothing of the gout, Messer Bartolommeo’s
2989: felicity was far from perfect: it was embittered by the contents of
2990: certain papers that lay before him, consisting chiefly of a
2991: correspondence between himself and Politian. It was a human foible at
2992: that period (incredible as it may seem) to recite quarrels, and favour
2993: scholarly visitors with the communication of an entire and lengthy
2994: correspondence; and this was neither the first nor the second time that
2995: Scala had asked the candid opinion of his friends as to the balance of
2996: right and wrong in some half-score Latin letters between himself and
2997: Politian, all springing out of certain epigrams written in the most
2998: playful tone in the world. It was the story of a very typical and
2999: pretty quarrel, in which we are interested, because it supplied
3000: precisely that thistle of hatred necessary, according to Nello, as a
3001: stimulus to the sluggish paces of the cautious steed, Friendship.
3002: Politian, having been a rejected pretender to the love and the hand of
3003: Scala’s daughter, kept a very sharp and learned tooth in readiness
3004: against the too prosperous and presumptuous secretary, who had declined
3005: the greatest scholar of the age for a son-in-law. Scala was a
3006: meritorious public servant, and, moreover, a lucky man—naturally
3007: exasperating to an offended scholar; but then—O beautiful balance of
3008: things!—he had an itch for authorship, and was a bad writer—one of
3009: those excellent people who, sitting in gouty slippers, “penned poetical
3010: trifles” entirely for their own amusement, without any view to an
3011: audience, and, consequently, sent them to their friends in letters,
3012: which were the literary periodicals of the fifteenth century. Now Scala
3013: had abundance of friends who were ready to praise his writings: friends
3014: like Ficino and Landino—amiable browsers in the Medicean park along
3015: with himself—who found his Latin prose style elegant and masculine; and
3016: the terrible Joseph Scaliger, who was to pronounce him totally ignorant
3017: of Latinity, was at a comfortable distance in the next century. But
3018: when was the fatal coquetry inherent in superfluous authorship ever
3019: quite contented with the ready praise of friends? That critical
3020: supercilious Politian—a fellow-browser, who was far from amiable—must
3021: be made aware that the solid secretary showed, in his leisure hours, a
3022: pleasant fertility in verses, which indicated pretty clearly how much
3023: he might do in that way if he were not a man of affairs.
3024: 
3025: Ineffable moment! when the man you secretly hate sends you a Latin
3026: epigram with a false gender—hendecasyllables with a questionable
3027: elision, at least a toe too much—attempts at poetic figures which are
3028: manifest solecisms. That moment had come to Politian: the secretary had
3029: put forth his soft head from the official shell, and the terrible
3030: lurking crab was down upon him. Politian had used the freedom of a
3031: friend, and pleasantly, in the form of a Latin epigram, corrected the
3032: mistake of Scala in making the _culex_ (an insect too well-known on the
3033: banks of the Arno) of the inferior or feminine gender. Scala replied by
3034: a bad joke, in suitable Latin verses, referring to Politian’s
3035: unsuccessful suit. Better and better. Politian found the verses very
3036: pretty and highly facetious: the more was the pity that they were
3037: seriously incorrect, and inasmuch as Scala had alleged that he had
3038: written them in imitation of a Greek epigram, Politian, being on such
3039: friendly terms, would enclose a Greek epigram of his own, on the same
3040: interesting insect—not, we may presume, out of any wish to humble
3041: Scala, but rather to instruct him; said epigram containing a lively
3042: conceit about Venus, Cupid, and the _culex_, of a kind much tasted at
3043: that period, founded partly on the zoological fact that the gnat, like
3044: Venus, was born from the waters. Scala, in reply, begged to say that
3045: his verses were never intended for a scholar with such delicate
3046: olfactories as Politian, nearest of all living men to the perfection of
3047: the ancients, and of a taste so fastidious that sturgeon itself must
3048: seem insipid to him; defended his own verses, nevertheless, though
3049: indeed they were written hastily, without correction, and intended as
3050: an agreeable distraction during the summer heat to himself and such
3051: friends as were satisfied with mediocrity, he, Scala, not being like
3052: some other people, who courted publicity through the booksellers. For
3053: the rest, he had barely enough Greek to make out the sense of the
3054: epigram so graciously sent him, to say nothing of tasting its
3055: elegances; but—the epigram was Politian’s: what more need be said?
3056: Still, by way of postscript, he feared that his incomparable friend’s
3057: comparison of the gnat to Venus, on account of its origin from the
3058: waters, was in many ways ticklish. On the one hand, Venus might be
3059: offended; and on the other, unless the poet intended an allusion to the
3060: doctrine of Thales, that cold and damp origin seemed doubtful to Scala
3061: in the case of a creature so fond of warmth; a fish were perhaps the
3062: better comparison, or, when the power of flying was in question, an
3063: eagle, or indeed, when the darkness was taken into consideration, a bat
3064: or an owl were a less obscure and more apposite parallel, etcetera,
3065: etcetera. Here was a great opportunity for Politian. He was not aware,
3066: he wrote, that when he had Scala’s verses placed before him, there was
3067: any question of sturgeon, but rather of frogs and gudgeons: made short
3068: work with Scala’s defence of his own Latin, and mangled him terribly on
3069: the score of the stupid criticisms he had ventured on the Greek epigram
3070: kindly forwarded to him as a model. Wretched cavils, indeed! for as to
3071: the damp origin of the gnat, there was the authority of Virgil himself,
3072: who had called it the “_alumnus_ of the waters;” and as to what his
3073: dear dull friend had to say about the fish, the eagle, and the rest, it
3074: was “nihil ad rem;” for because the eagle could fly higher, it by no
3075: means followed that the gnat could not fly at all, etcetera, etcetera.
3076: He was ashamed, however, to dwell on such trivialities, and thus to
3077: swell a gnat into an elephant; but, for his own part, would only add
3078: that he had nothing deceitful or double about him, neither was he to be
3079: caught when present by the false blandishments of those who slandered
3080: him in his absence, agreeing rather with a Homeric sentiment on that
3081: head—which furnished a Greek quotation to serve as powder to his
3082: bullet.
3083: 
3084: The quarrel could not end there. The logic could hardly get worse, but
3085: the secretary got more pompously self-asserting, and the scholarly
3086: poet’s temper more and more venomous. Politian had been generously
3087: willing to hold up a mirror, by which the too-inflated secretary,
3088: beholding his own likeness, might be induced to cease setting up his
3089: ignorant defences of bad Latin against ancient authorities whom the
3090: consent of centuries had placed beyond question,—unless, indeed, he had
3091: designed to sink in literature in proportion as he rose in honours,
3092: that by a sort of compensation men of letters might feel themselves his
3093: equals. In return, Politian was begged to examine Scala’s writings:
3094: nowhere would he find a more devout admiration of antiquity. The
3095: secretary was ashamed of the age in which he lived, and blushed for it.
3096: _Some_, indeed, there were who wanted to have their own works praised
3097: and exalted to a level with the divine monuments of antiquity; but he,
3098: Scala, could not oblige them. And as to the honours which were
3099: offensive to the envious, they had been well earned: witness his whole
3100: life since he came in penury to Florence. The elegant scholar, in
3101: reply, was not surprised that Scala found the Age distasteful to him,
3102: since he himself was so distasteful to the Age; nay, it was with
3103: perfect accuracy that he, the elegant scholar, had called Scala a
3104: branny monster, inasmuch as he was formed from the off-scourings of
3105: monsters, born amidst the refuse of a mill, and eminently worthy the
3106: long-eared office of turning the paternal millstones (_in pistrini
3107: sordibus natus et quidem pistrino dignissimus_)!
3108: 
3109: It was not without reference to Tito’s appointed visit that the papers
3110: containing this correspondence were brought out to-day. Here was a new
3111: Greek scholar whose accomplishments were to be tested, and on nothing
3112: did Scala more desire a dispassionate opinion from persons of superior
3113: knowledge than on that Greek epigram of Politian’s. After sufficient
3114: introductory talk concerning Tito’s travels, after a survey and
3115: discussion of the gems, and an easy passage from the mention of the
3116: lamented Lorenzo’s eagerness in collecting such specimens of ancient
3117: art to the subject of classical tastes and studies in general and their
3118: present condition in Florence, it was inevitable to mention Politian, a
3119: man of eminent ability indeed, but a little too arrogant—assuming to be
3120: a Hercules, whose office it was to destroy all the literary
3121: monstrosities of the age, and writing letters to his elders without
3122: signing them, as if they were miraculous revelations that could only
3123: have one source. And after all, were not his own criticisms often
3124: questionable and his tastes perverse? He was fond of saying pungent
3125: things about the men who thought they wrote like Cicero because they
3126: ended every sentence with “esse videtur:” but while he was boasting of
3127: his freedom from servile imitation, did he not fall into the other
3128: extreme, running after strange words and affected phrases? Even in his
3129: much-belauded ‘Miscellanea’ was every point tenable? And Tito, who had
3130: just been looking into the ‘Miscellanea,’ found so much to say that was
3131: agreeable to the secretary—he would have done so from the mere
3132: disposition to please, without further motive—that he showed himself
3133: quite worthy to be made a judge in the notable correspondence
3134: concerning the _culex_. Here was the Greek epigram which Politian had
3135: doubtless thought the finest in the world, though he had pretended to
3136: believe that the “transmarini,” the Greeks themselves, would make light
3137: of it: had he not been unintentionally speaking the truth in his false
3138: modesty?
3139: 
3140: Tito was ready, and scarified the epigram to Scala’s content. O wise
3141: young judge! He could doubtless appreciate satire even in the vulgar
3142: tongue, and Scala—who, excellent man, not seeking publicity through the
3143: booksellers, was never unprovided with “hasty uncorrected trifles,” as
3144: a sort of sherbet for a visitor on a hot day, or, if the weather were
3145: cold, why then as a cordial—had a few little matters in the shape of
3146: Sonnets, turning on well-known foibles of Politian’s, which he would
3147: not like to go any farther, but which would, perhaps, amuse the
3148: company.
3149: 
3150: Enough: Tito took his leave under an urgent invitation to come again.
3151: His gems were interesting; especially the agate, with the _lusus
3152: naturae_ in it—a most wonderful semblance of Cupid riding on the lion;
3153: and the “Jew’s stone,” with the lion-headed serpent enchased in it;
3154: both of which the secretary agreed to buy—the latter as a reinforcement
3155: of his preventives against the gout, which gave him such severe twinges
3156: that it was plain enough how intolerable it would be if he were not
3157: well supplied with rings of rare virtue, and with an amulet worn close
3158: under the right breast. But Tito was assured that he himself was more
3159: interesting than his gems. He had won his way to the Scala Palace by
3160: the recommendation of Bardo de’ Bardi, who, to be sure, was Scala’s old
3161: acquaintance and a worthy scholar, in spite of his overvaluing himself
3162: a little (a frequent foible in the secretary’s friends); but he must
3163: come again on the ground of his own manifest accomplishments.
3164: 
3165: The interview could hardly have ended more auspiciously for Tito, and
3166: as he walked out at the Porta Pinti that he might laugh a little at his
3167: ease over the affair of the _culex_, he felt that fortune could hardly
3168: mean to turn her back on him again at present, since she had taken him
3169: by the hand in this decided way.
3170: 
3171: 
3172: 
3173: 
3174: CHAPTER VIII.
3175: A Face in the Crowd.
3176: 
3177: 
3178: It is easy to northern people to rise early on Midsummer morning, to
3179: see the dew on the grassy edge of the dusty pathway, to notice the
3180: fresh shoots among the darker green of the oak and fir in the coppice,
3181: and to look over the gate at the shorn meadow, without recollecting
3182: that it is the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist.
3183: 
3184: Not so to the Florentine—still less to the Florentine of the fifteenth
3185: century: to him on that particular morning the brightness of the
3186: eastern sun on the Arno had something special in it; the ringing of the
3187: bells was articulate, and declared it to be the great summer festival
3188: of Florence, the day of San Giovanni.
3189: 
3190: San Giovanni had been the patron saint of Florence for at least eight
3191: hundred years—ever since the time when the Lombard Queen Theodolinda
3192: had commanded her subjects to do him peculiar honour; nay, says old
3193: Villani, to the best of his knowledge, ever since the days of
3194: Constantino the Great and Pope Sylvester, when the Florentines deposed
3195: their idol Mars, whom they were nevertheless careful not to treat with
3196: contumely; for while they consecrated their beautiful and noble temple
3197: to the honour of God and of the “Beato Messere Santo Giovanni,” they
3198: placed old Mars respectfully on a high tower near the River Arno,
3199: finding in certain ancient memorials that he had been elected as their
3200: tutelar deity under such astral influences that if he were broken, or
3201: otherwise treated with indignity, the city would suffer great damage
3202: and mutation. But in the fifteenth century that discreet regard to the
3203: feelings of the Man-destroyer had long vanished: the god of the spear
3204: and shield had ceased to frown by the side of the Arno, and the
3205: defences of the Republic were held to lie in its craft and its coffers.
3206: For spear and shield could be hired by gold florins, and on the gold
3207: florins there had always been the image of San Giovanni.
3208: 
3209: Much good had come to Florence since the dim time of struggle between
3210: the old patron and the new: some quarrelling and bloodshed, doubtless,
3211: between Guelf and Ghibelline, between Black and White, between orthodox
3212: sons of the Church and heretic Paterini; some floods, famine, and
3213: pestilence; but still much wealth and glory. Florence had achieved
3214: conquests over walled cities once mightier than itself, and especially
3215: over hated Pisa, whose marble buildings were too high and beautiful,
3216: whose masts were too much honoured on Greek and Italian coasts. The
3217: name of Florence had been growing prouder and prouder in all the courts
3218: of Europe, nay, in Africa itself, on the strength of purest gold
3219: coinage, finest dyes and textures, pre-eminent scholarship and poetic
3220: genius, and wits of the most serviceable sort for statesmanship and
3221: banking: it was a name so omnipresent that a Pope with a turn for
3222: epigram had called Florentines “the fifth element.” And for this high
3223: destiny, though it might partly depend on the stars and Madonna dell’
3224: Impruneta, and certainly depended on other higher Powers less often
3225: named, the praise was greatly due to San Giovanni, whose image was on
3226: the fair gold florins.
3227: 
3228: Therefore it was fitting that the day of San Giovanni—that ancient
3229: Church festival already venerable in the days of Saint Augustine—should
3230: be a day of peculiar rejoicing to Florence, and should be ushered in by
3231: a vigil duly kept in strict old Florentine fashion, with much dancing,
3232: with much street jesting, and perhaps with not a little stone-throwing
3233: and window-breaking, but emphatically with certain street sights such
3234: as could only be provided by a city which held in its service a clever
3235: Cecca, engineer and architect, valuable alike in sieges and in shows.
3236: By the help of Cecca, the very saints, surrounded with their
3237: almond-shaped glory, and floating on clouds with their joyous
3238: companionship of winged cherubs, even as they may be seen to this day
3239: in the pictures of Perugino, seemed, on the eve of San Giovanni, to
3240: have brought their piece of the heavens down into the narrow streets,
3241: and to pass slowly through them; and, more wonderful still, saints of
3242: gigantic size, with attendant angels, might be seen, not seated, but
3243: moving in a slow mysterious manner along the streets, like a procession
3244: of colossal figures come down from the high domes and tribunes of the
3245: churches. The clouds were made of good woven stuff, the saints and
3246: cherubs were unglorified mortals supported by firm bars, and those
3247: mysterious giants were really men of very steady brain, balancing
3248: themselves on stilts, and enlarged, like Greek tragedians, by huge
3249: masks and stuffed shoulders; but he was a miserably unimaginative
3250: Florentine who thought only of that—nay, somewhat impious, for in the
3251: images of sacred things was there not some of the virtue of sacred
3252: things themselves? And if, after that, there came a company of merry
3253: black demons well armed with claws and thongs, and other implements of
3254: sport, ready to perform impromptu farces of bastinadoing and
3255: clothes-tearing, why, that was the demons’ way of keeping a vigil, and
3256: they, too, might have descended from the domes and the tribunes. The
3257: Tuscan mind slipped from the devout to the burlesque, as readily as
3258: water round an angle; and the saints had already had their turn, had
3259: gone their way, and made their due pause before the gates of San
3260: Giovanni, to do him honour on the eve of his _festa_. And on the
3261: morrow, the great day thus ushered in, it was fitting that the
3262: tributary symbols paid to Florence by all its dependent cities,
3263: districts, and villages, whether conquered, protected, or of immemorial
3264: possession, should be offered at the shrine of San Giovanni in the old
3265: octagonal church, once the cathedral and now the baptistery, where
3266: every Florentine had had the sign of the Cross made with the anointing
3267: chrism on his brow; that all the city, from the white-haired man to the
3268: stripling, and from the matron to the lisping child, should be clothed
3269: in its best to do honour to the great day, and see the great sight; and
3270: that again, when the sun was sloping and the streets were cool, there
3271: should be the glorious race or Corso, when the unsaddled horses,
3272: clothed in rich trappings, should run right across the city, from the
3273: Porta al Prato on the north-west, through the Mercato Vecchio, to the
3274: Porta Santa Croce on the south-east, where the richest of _Palii_, or
3275: velvet and brocade banners with silk linings and fringe of gold, such
3276: as became a city that half-clothed the well-dressed world, were mounted
3277: on a triumphal car awaiting the winner or winner’s owner.
3278: 
3279: And thereafter followed more dancing; nay, through the whole day, says
3280: an old chronicler at the beginning of that century, there were weddings
3281: and the grandest gatherings, with so much piping, music and song, with
3282: balls and feasts and gladness and ornament, that this earth might have
3283: been mistaken for Paradise!
3284: 
3285: In this year of 1492, it was, perhaps, a little less easy to make that
3286: mistake. Lorenzo the magnificent and subtle was dead, and an arrogant,
3287: incautious Piero was come in his room, an evil change for Florence,
3288: unless, indeed, the wise horse prefers the bad rider, as more easily
3289: thrown from the saddle, and already the regrets for Lorenzo were
3290: getting less predominant over the murmured desire for government on a
3291: broader basis, in which corruption might be arrested, and there might
3292: be that free play for everybody’s jealousy and ambition, which made the
3293: ideal liberty of the good old quarrelsome, struggling times, when
3294: Florence raised her great buildings, reared her own soldiers, drove out
3295: would-be tyrants at the sword’s point, and was proud to keep faith at
3296: her own loss. Lorenzo was dead, Pope Innocent was dying, and a
3297: troublesome Neapolitan succession, with an intriguing, ambitious Milan,
3298: might set Italy by the ears before long: the times were likely to be
3299: difficult. Still, there was all the more reason that the Republic
3300: should keep its religious festivals.
3301: 
3302: And Midsummer morning, in this year 1492, was not less bright than
3303: usual. It was betimes in the morning that the symbolic offerings to be
3304: carried in grand procession were all assembled at their starting-point
3305: in the Piazza della Signoria—that famous piazza, where stood then, and
3306: stand now, the massive turreted Palace of the People, called the
3307: Palazzo Vecchio, and the spacious Loggia, built by Orcagna—the scene of
3308: all grand State ceremonial. The sky made the fairest blue tent, and
3309: under it the bells swung so vigorously that every evil spirit with
3310: sense enough to be formidable, must long since have taken his flight;
3311: windows and terraced roofs were alive with human faces; sombre stone
3312: houses were bright with hanging draperies; the boldly soaring palace
3313: tower, the yet older square tower of the Bargello, and the spire of the
3314: neighbouring Badia, seemed to keep watch above; and below, on the broad
3315: polygonal flags of the piazza, was the glorious show of banners, and
3316: horses with rich trappings, and gigantic _ceri_, or tapers, that were
3317: fitly called towers—strangely aggrandised descendants of those torches
3318: by whose faint light the Church worshipped in the Catacombs. Betimes in
3319: the morning all processions had need to move under the Midsummer sky of
3320: Florence, where the shelter of the narrow streets must every now and
3321: then be exchanged for the glare of wide spaces; and the sun would be
3322: high up in the heavens before the long pomp had ended its pilgrimage in
3323: the Piazza di San Giovanni.
3324: 
3325: But here, where the procession was to pause, the magnificent city, with
3326: its ingenious Cecca, had provided another tent than the sky; for the
3327: whole of the Piazza del Duomo, from the octagonal baptistery in the
3328: centre to the façade of the cathedral and the walls of the houses on
3329: the other sides of the quadrangle, was covered, at the height of forty
3330: feet or more, with blue drapery, adorned with well-stitched yellow
3331: lilies and the familiar coats of arms, while sheaves of many-coloured
3332: banners drooped at fit angles under this superincumbent blue—a gorgeous
3333: rainbow-lit shelter to the waiting spectators who leaned from the
3334: windows, and made a narrow border on the pavement, and wished for the
3335: coming of the show.
3336: 
3337: One of these spectators was Tito Melema. Bright, in the midst of
3338: brightness, he sat at the window of the room above Nello’s shop, his
3339: right elbow resting on the red drapery hanging from the window-sill,
3340: and his head supported in a backward position by the right-hand, which
3341: pressed the curls against his ear. His face wore that bland liveliness,
3342: as far removed from excitability as from heaviness or gloom, which
3343: marks the companion popular alike amongst men and women—the companion
3344: who is never obtrusive or noisy from uneasy vanity or excessive animal
3345: spirits, and whose brow is never contracted by resentment or
3346: indignation. He showed no other change from the two months and more
3347: that had passed since his first appearance in the weather-stained tunic
3348: and hose, than that added radiance of good fortune, which is like the
3349: just perceptible perfecting of a flower after it has drunk a morning’s
3350: sunbeams. Close behind him, ensconced in the narrow angle between his
3351: chair and the window-frame, stood the slim figure of Nello in holiday
3352: suit, and at his left the younger Cennini—Pietro, the erudite corrector
3353: of proof-sheets, not Domenico the practical. Tito was looking
3354: alternately down on the scene below, and upward at the varied knot of
3355: gazers and talkers immediately around him, some of whom had come in
3356: after witnessing the commencement of the procession in the Piazza della
3357: Signoria. Piero di Cosimo was raising a laugh among them by his
3358: grimaces and anathemas at the noise of the bells, against which no kind
3359: of ear-stuffing was a sufficient barricade, since the more he stuffed
3360: his ears the more he felt the vibration of his skull; and declaring
3361: that he would bury himself in the most solitary spot of the Valdarno on
3362: a _festa_, if he were not condemned, as a painter, to lie in wait for
3363: the secrets of colour that were sometimes to be caught from the
3364: floating of banners and the chance grouping of the multitude.
3365: 
3366: Tito had just turned his laughing face away from the whimsical painter
3367: to look down at the small drama going on among the checkered border of
3368: spectators, when at the angle of the marble steps in front of the
3369: Duomo, nearly opposite Nello’s shop, he saw a man’s face upturned
3370: towards him, and fixing on him a gaze that seemed to have more meaning
3371: in it than the ordinary passing observation of a stranger. It was a
3372: face with tonsured head, that rose above the black mantle and white
3373: tunic of a Dominican friar—a very common sight in Florence; but the
3374: glance had something peculiar in it for Tito. There was a faint
3375: suggestion in it, certainly not of an unpleasant kind. Yet what
3376: pleasant association had he ever had with monks? None. The glance and
3377: the suggestion hardly took longer than a flash of lightning.
3378: 
3379: “Nello!” said Tito, hastily, but immediately added, in a tone of
3380: disappointment, “Ah, he has turned round. It was that tall, thin friar
3381: who is going up the steps. I wanted you to tell me if you knew aught of
3382: him?”
3383: 
3384: “One of the Frati Predicatori,” said Nello, carelessly; “you don’t
3385: expect me to know the private history of the crows.”
3386: 
3387: “I seem to remember something about his face,” said Tito. “It is an
3388: uncommon face.”
3389: 
3390: “What? you thought it might be our Fra Girolamo? Too tall; and he never
3391: shows himself in that chance way.”
3392: 
3393: “Besides, that loud-barking ‘hound of the Lord’[1] is not in Florence
3394: just now,” said Francesco Cei, the popular poet; “he has taken Piero
3395: de’ Medici’s hint, to carry his railing prophecies on a journey for a
3396: while.”
3397: 
3398:  [1] A play on the name of the Dominicans (_Domini Canes_) which was
3399:  accepted by themselves, and which is pictorially represented in a
3400:  fresco painted for them by Simone Memmi.
3401: 
3402: 
3403: “The Frate neither rails nor prophesies against any man,” said a
3404: middle-aged personage seated at the other corner of the window; “he
3405: only prophesies against vice. If you think that an attack on your
3406: poems, Francesco, it is not the Frate’s fault.”
3407: 
3408: “Ah, he’s gone into the Duomo now,” said Tito, who had watched the
3409: figure eagerly. “No, I was not under that mistake, Nello. Your Fra
3410: Girolamo has a high nose and a large under-lip. I saw him once—he is
3411: not handsome; but this man...”
3412: 
3413: “Truce to your descriptions!” said Cennini. “Hark! see! Here come the
3414: horsemen and the banners. That standard,” he continued, laying his hand
3415: familiarly on Tito’s shoulder,—“that carried on the horse with white
3416: trappings—that with the red eagle holding the green dragon between his
3417: talons, and the red lily over the eagle—is the Gonfalon of the Guelf
3418: party, and those cavaliers close round it are the chief officers of the
3419: Guelf party. That is one of our proudest banners, grumble as we may; it
3420: means the triumph of the Guelfs, which means the triumph of Florentine
3421: will, which means triumph of the popolani.”
3422: 
3423: “Nay, go on, Cennini,” said the middle-aged man, seated at the window,
3424: “which means triumph of the fat popolani over the lean, which again
3425: means triumph of the fattest popolano over those who are less fat.”
3426: 
3427: “Cronaca, you are becoming sententious,” said the printer; “Fra
3428: Girolamo’s preaching will spoil you, and make you take life by the
3429: wrong handle. Trust me, your cornices will lose half their beauty if
3430: you begin to mingle bitterness with them; that is the _maniera Tedesca_
3431: which you used to declaim against when you came from Rome. The next
3432: palace you build we shall see you trying to put the Frate’s doctrine
3433: into stone.”
3434: 
3435: “That is a goodly show of cavaliers,” said Tito, who had learned by
3436: this time the best way to please Florentines; “but are there not
3437: strangers among them? I see foreign costumes.”
3438: 
3439: “Assuredly,” said Cennini; “you see there the Orators from France,
3440: Milan, and Venice, and behind them are English and German nobles; for
3441: it is customary that all foreign visitors of distinction pay their
3442: tribute to San Giovanni in the train of that gonfalon. For my part, I
3443: think our Florentine cavaliers sit their horses as well as any of those
3444: cut-and-thrust northerners, whose wits lie in their heels and saddles;
3445: and for yon Venetian, I fancy he would feel himself more at ease on the
3446: back of a dolphin. We ought to know something of horsemanship, for we
3447: excel all Italy in the sports of the Giostra, and the money we spend on
3448: them. But you will see a finer show of our chief men by-and-by, Melema;
3449: my brother himself will be among the officers of the Zecca.”
3450: 
3451: “The banners are the better sight,” said Piero di Cosimo, forgetting
3452: the noise in his delight at the winding stream of colour as the
3453: tributary standards advanced round the piazza. “The Florentine men are
3454: so-so; they make but a sorry show at this distance with their patch of
3455: sallow flesh-tint above the black garments; but those banners with
3456: their velvet, and satin, and minever, and brocade, and their endless
3457: play of delicate light and shadow!—_Va_! your human talk and doings are
3458: a tame jest; the only passionate life is in form and colour.”
3459: 
3460: “Ay, Piero, if Satanasso could paint, thou wouldst sell thy soul to
3461: learn his secrets,” said Nello. “But there is little likelihood of it,
3462: seeing the blessed angels themselves are such poor hands at
3463: chiaroscuro, if one may judge from their _capo-d’opera_, the Madonna
3464: Nunziata.”
3465: 
3466: “There go the banners of Pisa and Arezzo,” said Cennini. “Ay, Messer
3467: Pisano, it is no use for you to look sullen; you may as well carry your
3468: banner to our San Giovanni with a good grace. ‘Pisans false,
3469: Florentines blind’—the second half of that proverb will hold no longer.
3470: There come the ensigns of our subject towns and signories, Melema; they
3471: will all be suspended in San Giovanni until this day next year, when
3472: they will give place to new ones.”
3473: 
3474: “They are a fair sight,” said Tito; “and San Giovanni will surely be as
3475: well satisfied with that produce of Italian looms as Minerva with her
3476: peplos, especially as he contents himself with so little drapery. But
3477: my eyes are less delighted with those whirling towers, which would soon
3478: make me fall from the window in sympathetic vertigo.”
3479: 
3480: The “towers” of which Tito spoke were a part of the procession esteemed
3481: very glorious by the Florentine populace; and being perhaps chiefly a
3482: kind of hyperbole for the all-efficacious wax taper, were also called
3483: _ceri_. But inasmuch as hyperbole is impracticable in a real and
3484: literal fashion, these gigantic _ceri_, some of them so large as to be
3485: of necessity carried on wheels, were not solid but hollow, and had
3486: their surface made not solely of wax, but of wood and pasteboard,
3487: gilded, carved, and painted, as real sacred tapers often are, with
3488: successive circles of figures—warriors on horseback, foot-soldiers with
3489: lance and shield, dancing maidens, animals, trees and fruits, and in
3490: fine, says the old chronicler, “all things that could delight the eye
3491: and the heart;” the hollowness having the further advantage that men
3492: could stand inside these hyperbolic tapers and whirl them continually,
3493: so as to produce a phantasmagoric effect, which, considering the towers
3494: were numerous, must have been calculated to produce dizziness on a
3495: truly magnificent scale.
3496: 
3497: “_Pestilenza_!” said Piero di Cosimo, moving from the window, “those
3498: whirling circles one above the other are worse than the jangling of all
3499: the bells. Let me know when the last taper has passed.”
3500: 
3501: “Nay, you will surely like to be called when the contadini come
3502: carrying their torches,” said Nello; “you would not miss the
3503: country-folk of the Mugello and the Casentino, of whom your favourite
3504: Leonardo would make a hundred grotesque sketches.”
3505: 
3506: “No,” said Piero, resolutely, “I will see nothing till the car of the
3507: Zecca comes. I have seen clowns enough holding tapers aslant, both with
3508: and without cowls, to last me for my life.”
3509: 
3510: “Here it comes, then, Piero—the car of the Zecca,” called out Nello,
3511: after an interval during which towers and tapers in a descending scale
3512: of size had been making their slow transit.
3513: 
3514: “_Fediddio_!” exclaimed Francesco Cei, “that is a well-tanned San
3515: Giovanni! some sturdy Romagnole beggar-man, I’ll warrant. Our Signoria
3516: plays the host to all the Jewish and Christian scum that every other
3517: city shuts its gates against, and lets them fatten on us like Saint
3518: Anthony’s swine.”
3519: 
3520: The car of the Zecca or Mint, which had just rolled into sight, was
3521: originally an immense wooden tower or _cero_ adorned after the same
3522: fashion as the other tributary _ceri_, mounted on a splendid car, and
3523: drawn by two mouse-coloured oxen, whose mild heads looked out from rich
3524: trappings bearing the arms of the Zecca. But the latter half of the
3525: century was getting rather ashamed of the towers with their circular or
3526: spiral paintings, which had delighted the eyes and the hearts of the
3527: other half, so that they had become a contemptuous proverb, and any
3528: ill-painted figure looking, as will sometimes happen to figures in the
3529: best ages of art, as if it had been boned for a pie, was called a
3530: _fantoccio da cero_, a tower-puppet; consequently improved taste, with
3531: Cecca to help it, had devised for the magnificent Zecca a triumphal car
3532: like a pyramidal catafalque, with ingenious wheels warranted to turn
3533: all corners easily. Round the base were living figures of saints and
3534: angels arrayed in sculpturesque fashion; and on the summit, at the
3535: height of thirty feet, well bound to an iron rod and holding an iron
3536: cross also firmly infixed, stood a living representative of Saint John
3537: the Baptist, with arms and legs bare, a garment of tiger-skins about
3538: his body, and a golden nimbus fastened on his head—as the Precursor was
3539: wont to appear in the cloisters and churches, not having yet revealed
3540: himself to painters as the brown and sturdy boy who made one of the
3541: Holy Family. For where could the image of the patron saint be more
3542: fitly placed than on the symbol of the Zecca? Was not the royal
3543: prerogative of coining money the surest token that a city had won its
3544: independence? and by the blessing of San Giovanni this “beautiful
3545: sheepfold” of his had shown that token earliest among the Italian
3546: cities. Nevertheless, the annual function of representing the patron
3547: saint was not among the high prizes of public life; it was paid for
3548: with something like ten shillings, a cake weighing fourteen pounds, two
3549: bottles of wine, and a handsome supply of light eatables; the money
3550: being furnished by the magnificent Zecca, and the payment in kind being
3551: by peculiar “privilege” presented in a basket suspended on a pole from
3552: an upper window of a private house, whereupon the eidolon of the
3553: austere saint at once invigorated himself with a reasonable share of
3554: the sweets and wine, threw the remnants to the crowd, and embraced the
3555: mighty cake securely with his right arm through the remainder of his
3556: passage. This was the attitude in which the mimic San Giovanni
3557: presented himself as the tall car jerked and vibrated on its slow way
3558: round the piazza to the northern gate of the Baptistery.
3559: 
3560: “There go the Masters of the Zecca, and there is my brother—you see
3561: him, Melema?” cried Cennini, with an agreeable stirring of pride at
3562: showing a stranger what was too familiar to be remarkable to
3563: fellow-citizens. “Behind come the members of the Corporation of
3564: Calimara,[2] the dealers in foreign cloth, to which we have given our
3565: Florentine finish; men of ripe years, you see, who were matriculated
3566: before you were born; and then comes the famous Art of Money-changers.”
3567: 
3568:  [2] “Arte di Calimara,” “arte” being, in this use of it, equivalent to
3569:  corporation.
3570: 
3571: 
3572: “Many of them matriculated also to the noble art of usury before you
3573: were born,” interrupted Francesco Cei, “as you may discern by a certain
3574: fitful glare of the eye and sharp curve of the nose which manifest
3575: their descent from the ancient Harpies, whose portraits you saw
3576: supporting the arms of the Zecca. Shaking off old prejudices now, such
3577: a procession as that of some four hundred passably ugly men carrying
3578: their tapers in open daylight, Diogenes-fashion, as if they were
3579: looking for a lost quattrino, would make a merry spectacle for the
3580: Feast of Fools.”
3581: 
3582: “Blaspheme not against the usages of our city,” said Pietro Cennini,
3583: much offended. “There are new wits who think they see things more truly
3584: because they stand on their heads to look at them, like tumblers and
3585: mountebanks, instead of keeping the attitude of rational men. Doubtless
3586: it makes little difference to Maestro Vaiano’s monkeys whether they see
3587: our Donatello’s statue of Judith with their heads or their tails
3588: uppermost.”
3589: 
3590: “Your solemnity will allow some quarter to playful fancy, I hope,” said
3591: Cei, with a shrug, “else what becomes of the ancients, whose example
3592: you scholars are bound to revere, Messer Pietro? Life was never
3593: anything but a perpetual see-saw between gravity and jest.”
3594: 
3595: “Keep your jest then till your end of the pole is uppermost,” said
3596: Cennini, still angry, “and that is not when the great bond of our
3597: Republic is expressing itself in ancient symbols, without which the
3598: vulgar would be conscious of nothing beyond their own petty wants of
3599: back and stomach, and never rise to the sense of community in religion
3600: and law. There has been no great people without processions, and the
3601: man who thinks himself too wise to be moved by them to anything but
3602: contempt, is like the puddle that was proud of standing alone while the
3603: river rushed by.”
3604: 
3605: No one said anything after this indignant burst of Cennini’s till he
3606: himself spoke again.
3607: 
3608: “Hark! the trumpets of the Signoria: now comes the last stage of the
3609: show, Melema. That is our Gonfaloniere in the middle, in the starred
3610: mantle, with the sword carried before him. Twenty years ago we used to
3611: see our foreign Podesta, who was our judge in civil causes, walking on
3612: his right-hand; but our Republic has been over-doctored by clever
3613: _Medici_. That is the Proposto (Spokesman or Moderator) of the Priori
3614: on the left; then come the other seven Priori; then all the other
3615: magistracies and officials of our Republic. You see your patron the
3616: Segretario?”
3617: 
3618: “There is Messer Bernardo del Nero also,” said Tito; “his visage is a
3619: fine and venerable one, though it has worn rather a petrifying look
3620: towards me.”
3621: 
3622: “Ah,” said Nello, “he is the dragon that guards the remnant of old
3623: Bardo’s gold, which, I fancy, is chiefly that virgin gold that falls
3624: about the fair Romola’s head and shoulders; eh, my Apollino?” he added,
3625: patting Tito’s head.
3626: 
3627: Tito had the youthful grace of blushing, but he had also the adroit and
3628: ready speech that prevents a blush from looking like embarrassment. He
3629: replied at once—
3630: 
3631: “And a very Pactolus it is—a stream with golden ripples. If I were an
3632: alchemist—”
3633: 
3634: He was saved from the need for further speech by the sudden fortissimo
3635: of drums and trumpets and fifes, bursting into the breadth of the
3636: piazza in a grand storm of sound—a roar, a blast, and a whistling, well
3637: befitting a city famous for its musical instruments, and reducing the
3638: members of the closest group to a state of deaf isolation.
3639: 
3640: During this interval Nello observed Tito’s fingers moving in
3641: recognition of some one in the crowd below, but not seeing the
3642: direction of his glance he failed to detect the object of this
3643: greeting—the sweet round blue-eyed face under a white hood—immediately
3644: lost in the narrow border of heads, where there was a continual eclipse
3645: of round contadina cheeks by the harsh-lined features or bent shoulders
3646: of an old spadesman, and where profiles turned as sharply from north to
3647: south as weathercocks under a shifting wind.
3648: 
3649: But when it was felt that the show was ended—when the twelve prisoners
3650: released in honour of the day, and the very _barberi_ or race-horses,
3651: with the arms of their owners embroidered on their cloths, had followed
3652: up the Signoria, and been duly consecrated to San Giovanni, and every
3653: one was moving from the window—Nello, whose Florentine curiosity was of
3654: that lively canine sort which thinks no trifle too despicable for
3655: investigation, put his hand on Tito’s shoulder and said—
3656: 
3657: “What acquaintance was that you were making signals to, eh, _giovane
3658: mio_?”
3659: 
3660: “Some little contadina who probably mistook me for an acquaintance, for
3661: she had honoured me with a greeting.”
3662: 
3663: “Or who wished to begin an acquaintance,” said Nello. “But you are
3664: bound for the Via de’ Bardi and the feast of the Muses: there is no
3665: counting on you for a frolic, else we might have gone in search of
3666: adventures together in the crowd, and had some pleasant fooling in
3667: honour of San Giovanni. But your high fortune has come on you too soon:
3668: I don’t mean the professor’s mantle—_that_ is roomy enough to hide a
3669: few stolen chickens, but— Messer Endymion minded his manners after that
3670: singular good fortune of his; and what says our Luigi Pulci?
3671: 
3672: 
3673: “‘Da quel giorno in qua ch’amor m’accese
3674: Per lei son fatto e gentile e cortese.’”
3675: 
3676: 
3677: “Nello, _amico mio_, thou hast an intolerable trick of making life
3678: stale by forestalling it with thy talk,” said Tito, shrugging his
3679: shoulders, with a look of patient resignation, which was his nearest
3680: approach to anger: “not to mention that such ill-founded babbling would
3681: be held a great offence by that same goddess whose humble worshipper
3682: you are always professing yourself.”
3683: 
3684: “I will be mute,” said Nello, laying his finger on his lips, with a
3685: responding shrug. “But it is only under our four eyes that I talk any
3686: folly about her.”
3687: 
3688: “Pardon! you were on the verge of it just now in the hearing of others.
3689: If you want to ruin me in the minds of Bardo and his daughter—”
3690: 
3691: “Enough, enough!” said Nello. “I am an absurd old barber. It all comes
3692: from that abstinence of mine, in not making bad verses in my youth: for
3693: want of letting my folly run out that way when I was eighteen, it runs
3694: out at my tongue’s end now I am at the unseemly age of fifty. But Nello
3695: has not got his head muffled for all that; he can see a buffalo in the
3696: snow. _Addio, giovane mio_.”
3697: 
3698: 
3699: 
3700: 
3701: CHAPTER IX.
3702: A Man’s Ransom.
3703: 
3704: 
3705: Tito was soon down among the crowd, and, notwithstanding his
3706: indifferent reply to Nello’s question about his chance acquaintance, he
3707: was not without a passing wish, as he made his way round the piazza to
3708: the Corso degli Adimari, that he might encounter the pair of blue eyes
3709: which had looked up towards him from under the square bit of white
3710: linen drapery that formed the ordinary hood of the contadina at festa
3711: time. He was perfectly well aware that that face was Tessa’s; but he
3712: had not chosen to say so. What had Nello to do with the matter? Tito
3713: had an innate love of reticence—let us say a talent for it—which acted
3714: as other impulses do, without any conscious motive, and, like all
3715: people to whom concealment is easy, he would now and then conceal
3716: something which had as little the nature of a secret as the fact that
3717: he had seen a flight of crows.
3718: 
3719: But the passing wish about pretty Tessa was almost immediately eclipsed
3720: by the recurrent recollection of that friar whose face had some
3721: irrecoverable association for him. Why should a sickly fanatic, worn
3722: with fasting, have looked at _him_ in particular, and where in all his
3723: travels could he remember encountering that face before? Folly! such
3724: vague memories hang about the mind like cobwebs, with tickling
3725: importunity—best to sweep them away at a dash: and Tito had pleasanter
3726: occupation for his thoughts. By the time he was turning out of the
3727: Corso degli Adimari into a side-street he was caring only that the sun
3728: was high, and that the procession had kept him longer than he had
3729: intended from his visit to that room in the Via de’ Bardi, where his
3730: coming, he knew, was anxiously awaited. He felt the scene of his
3731: entrance beforehand: the joy beaming diffusedly in the blind face like
3732: the light in a semi-transparent lamp; the transient pink flush on
3733: Romola’s face and neck, which subtracted nothing from her majesty, but
3734: only gave it the exquisite charm of womanly sensitiveness, heightened
3735: still more by what seemed the paradoxical boy-like frankness of her
3736: look and smile. They were the best comrades in the world during the
3737: hours they passed together round the blind man’s chair: she was
3738: constantly appealing to Tito, and he was informing her, yet he felt
3739: himself strangely in subjection to Romola with that simplicity of hers:
3740: he felt for the first time, without defining it to himself, that loving
3741: awe in the presence of noble womanhood, which is perhaps something like
3742: the worship paid of old to a great nature-goddess, who was not
3743: all-knowing, but whose life and power were something deeper and more
3744: primordial than knowledge. They had never been alone together, and he
3745: could frame to himself no probable image of love-scenes between them:
3746: he could only fancy and wish wildly—what he knew was impossible—that
3747: Romola would some day tell him that she loved him. One day in Greece,
3748: as he was leaning over a wall in the sunshine, a little black-eyed
3749: peasant girl, who had rested her water-pot on the wall, crept gradually
3750: nearer and nearer to him, and at last shyly asked him to kiss her,
3751: putting up her round olive cheek very innocently. Tito was used to love
3752: that came in this unsought fashion. But Romola’s love would never come
3753: in that way: would it ever come at all?—and yet it was that topmost
3754: apple on which he had set his mind. He was in his fresh youth—not
3755: passionate, but impressible: it was as inevitable that he should feel
3756: lovingly towards Romola as that the white irises should be reflected in
3757: the clear sunlit stream; but he had no coxcombry, and he had an
3758: intimate sense that Romola was something very much above him. Many men
3759: have felt the same before a large-eyed, simple child.
3760: 
3761: Nevertheless, Tito had had the rapid success which would have made some
3762: men presuming, or would have warranted him in thinking that there would
3763: be no great presumption in entertaining an agreeable confidence that he
3764: might one day be the husband of Romola—nay, that her father himself was
3765: not without a vision of such a future for him. His first auspicious
3766: interview with Bartolommeo Scala had proved the commencement of a
3767: growing favour on the secretary’s part, and had led to an issue which
3768: would have been enough to make Tito decide on Florence as the place in
3769: which to establish himself, even if it had held no other magnet.
3770: Politian was professor of Greek as well as Latin at Florence,
3771: professorial chairs being maintained there, although the university had
3772: been removed to Pisa; but for a long time Demetrio Calcondila, one of
3773: the most eminent and respectable among the emigrant Greeks, had also
3774: held a Greek chair, simultaneously with the too predominant Italian.
3775: Calcondila was now gone to Milan, and there was no counterpoise or
3776: rival to Politian such as was desired for him by the friends who wished
3777: him to be taught a little propriety and humility. Scala was far from
3778: being the only friend of this class, and he found several who, if they
3779: were not among those thirsty admirers of mediocrity that were glad to
3780: be refreshed with his verses in hot weather, were yet quite willing to
3781: join him in doing that moral service to Politian. It was finally agreed
3782: that Tito should be supported in a Greek chair, as Demetrio Calcondila
3783: had been by Lorenzo himself, who, being at the same time the
3784: affectionate patron of Politian, had shown by precedent that there was
3785: nothing invidious in such a measure, but only a zeal for true learning
3786: and for the instruction of the Florentine youth.
3787: 
3788: Tito was thus sailing under the fairest breeze, and besides convincing
3789: fair judges that his talents squared with his good fortune, he wore
3790: that fortune so easily and unpretentiously that no one had yet been
3791: offended by it. He was not unlikely to get into the best Florentine
3792: society: society where there was much more plate than the circle of
3793: enamelled silver in the centre of the brass dishes, and where it was
3794: not forbidden by the Signory to wear the richest brocade. For where
3795: could a handsome young scholar not be welcome when he could touch the
3796: lute and troll a gay song? That bright face, that easy smile, that
3797: liquid voice, seemed to give life a holiday aspect; just as a strain of
3798: gay music and the hoisting of colours make the work-worn and the sad
3799: rather ashamed of showing themselves. Here was a professor likely to
3800: render the Greek classics amiable to the sons of great houses.
3801: 
3802: And that was not the whole of Tito’s good fortune; for he had sold all
3803: his jewels, except the ring he did not choose to part with, and he was
3804: master of full five hundred gold florins.
3805: 
3806: Yet the moment when he first had this sum in his possession was the
3807: crisis of the first serious struggle his facile, good-humoured nature
3808: had known. An importunate thought, of which he had till now refused to
3809: see more than the shadow as it dogged his footsteps, at last rushed
3810: upon him and grasped him: he was obliged to pause and decide whether he
3811: would surrender and obey, or whether he would give the refusal that
3812: must carry irrevocable consequences. It was in the room above Nello’s
3813: shop, which Tito had now hired as a lodging, that the elder Cennini
3814: handed him the last quota of the sum on behalf of Bernardo Rucellai,
3815: the purchaser of the two most valuable gems.
3816: 
3817: “_Ecco, giovane mio_!” said the respectable printer and goldsmith, “you
3818: have now a pretty little fortune; and if you will take my advice, you
3819: will let me place your florins in a safe quarter, where they may
3820: increase and multiply, instead of slipping through your fingers for
3821: banquets and other follies which are rife among our Florentine youth.
3822: And it has been too much the fashion of scholars, especially when, like
3823: our Pietro Crinito, they think their scholarship needs to be scented
3824: and broidered, to squander with one hand till they have been fain to
3825: beg with the other. I have brought you the money, and you are free to
3826: make a wise choice or an unwise: I shall see on which side the balance
3827: dips. We Florentines hold no man a member of an Art till he has shown
3828: his skill and been matriculated; and no man is matriculated to the art
3829: of life till he has been well tempted. If you make up your mind to put
3830: your florins out to usury, you can let me know to-morrow. A scholar may
3831: marry, and should have something in readiness for the _morgen-cap.
3832: Addio_.”[1]
3833: 
3834:  [1] A sum given by the bridegroom to the bride the day after the
3835:  marriage. _Morgengabe_.
3836: 
3837: 
3838: As Cennini closed the door behind him, Tito turned round with the smile
3839: dying out of his face, and fixed his eyes on the table where the
3840: florins lay. He made no other movement, but stood with his thumbs in
3841: his belt, looking down, in that transfixed state which accompanies the
3842: concentration of consciousness on some inward image.
3843: 
3844: “A man’s ransom!”—who was it that had said five hundred florins was
3845: more than a man’s ransom? If now, under this mid-day sun, on some hot
3846: coast far away, a man somewhat stricken in years—a man not without high
3847: thoughts and with the most passionate heart—a man who long years ago
3848: had rescued a little boy from a life of beggary, filth, and cruel
3849: wrong, had reared him tenderly, and been to him as a father—if that man
3850: _were_ now under this summer sun toiling as a slave, hewing wood and
3851: drawing water, perhaps being smitten and buffeted because he was not
3852: deft and active? If he were saying to himself, “Tito will find me: he
3853: had but to carry our manuscripts and gems to Venice; he will have
3854: raised money, and will never rest till he finds me out”? If that were
3855: certain, could he, Tito, see the price of the gems lying before him,
3856: and say, “I will stay at Florence, where I am fanned by soft airs of
3857: promised love and prosperity; I will not risk myself for his sake”? No,
3858: surely not, _if it were certain_. But nothing could be farther from
3859: certainty. The galley had been taken by a Turkish vessel on its way to
3860: Delos: _that_ was known by the report of the companion galley, which
3861: had escaped. But there had been resistance, and probable bloodshed; a
3862: man had been seen falling overboard: who were the survivors, and what
3863: had befallen them amongst all the multitude of possibilities? Had not
3864: he, Tito, suffered shipwreck, and narrowly escaped drowning? He had
3865: good cause for feeling the omnipresence of casualties that threatened
3866: all projects with futility. The rumour that there were pirates who had
3867: a settlement in Delos was not to be depended on, or might be nothing to
3868: the purpose. What, probably enough, would be the result if he were to
3869: quit Florence and go to Venice; get authoritative letters—yes, he knew
3870: that might be done—and set out for the Archipelago? Why, that he should
3871: be himself seized, and spend all his florins on preliminaries, and be
3872: again a destitute wanderer—with no more gems to sell.
3873: 
3874: Tito had a clearer vision of that result than of the possible moment
3875: when he might find his father again, and carry him deliverance. It
3876: would surely be an unfairness that he, in his full ripe youth, to whom
3877: life had hitherto had some of the stint and subjection of a school,
3878: should turn his back on promised love and distinction, and perhaps
3879: never be visited by that promise again. “And yet,” he said to himself,
3880: “if I were certain that Baldassarre Calvo was alive, and that I could
3881: free him, by whatever exertions or perils, I would go now—now I have
3882: the money: it was useless to debate the matter before. I would go now
3883: to Bardo and Bartolommeo Scala, and tell them the whole truth.” Tito
3884: did not say to himself so distinctly that if those two men had known
3885: the whole truth he was aware there would have been no alternative for
3886: him but to go in search of his benefactor, who, if alive, was the
3887: rightful owner of the gems, and whom he had always equivocally spoken
3888: of as “lost;” he did not say to himself—what he was not ignorant
3889: of—that Greeks of distinction had made sacrifices, taken voyages again
3890: and again, and sought help from crowned and mitred heads for the sake
3891: of freeing relatives from slavery to the Turks. Public opinion did not
3892: regard this as exceptional virtue.
3893: 
3894: This was his first real colloquy with himself: he had gone on following
3895: the impulses of the moment, and one of those impulses had been to
3896: conceal half the fact; he had never considered this part of his conduct
3897: long enough to face the consciousness of his motives for the
3898: concealment. What was the use of telling the whole? It was true, the
3899: thought had crossed his mind several times since he had quitted Nauplia
3900: that, after all, it was a great relief to be quit of Baldassarre, and
3901: he would have liked to know _who_ it was that had fallen overboard. But
3902: such thoughts spring inevitably out of a relation that is irksome.
3903: Baldassarre was exacting, and had got stranger as he got older: he was
3904: constantly scrutinising Tito’s mind to see whether it answered to his
3905: own exaggerated expectations; and age—the age of a thickset,
3906: heavy-browed, bald man beyond sixty, whose intensity and eagerness in
3907: the grasp of ideas have long taken the character of monotony and
3908: repetition, may be looked at from many points of view without being
3909: found attractive. Such a man, stranded among new acquaintances, unless
3910: he had the philosopher’s stone, would hardly find rank, youth, and
3911: beauty at his feet. The feelings that gather fervour from novelty will
3912: be of little help towards making the world a home for dimmed and faded
3913: human beings; and if there is any love of which they are not widowed,
3914: it must be the love that is rooted in memories and distils perpetually
3915: the sweet balms of fidelity and forbearing tenderness.
3916: 
3917: But surely such memories were not absent from Tito’s mind? Far in the
3918: backward vista of his remembered life, when he was only seven years
3919: old, Baldassarre had rescued him from blows, had taken him to a home
3920: that seemed like opened paradise, where there was sweet food and
3921: soothing caresses, all had on Baldassarre’s knee; and from that time
3922: till the hour they had parted, Tito had been the one centre of
3923: Baldassarre’s fatherly cares.
3924: 
3925: And he had been docile, pliable, quick of apprehension, ready to
3926: acquire: a very bright lovely boy, a youth of even splendid grace, who
3927: seemed quite without vices, as if that beautiful form represented a
3928: vitality so exquisitely poised and balanced that it could know no
3929: uneasy desires, no unrest—a radiant presence for a lonely man to have
3930: won for himself. If he were silent when his father expected some
3931: response, still he did not look moody; if he declined some labour—why,
3932: he flung himself down with such a charming, half-smiling, half-pleading
3933: air, that the pleasure of looking at him made amends to one who had
3934: watched his growth with a sense of claim and possession: the curves of
3935: Tito’s mouth had ineffable good-humour in them. And then, the quick
3936: talent to which everything came readily, from philosophical systems to
3937: the rhymes of a street ballad caught up at a hearing! Would any one
3938: have said that Tito had not made a rich return to his benefactor, or
3939: that his gratitude and affection would fail on any great demand?
3940: 
3941: He did not admit that his gratitude had failed; but _it was not
3942: certain_ that Baldassarre was in slavery, not certain that he was
3943: living.
3944: 
3945: “Do I not owe something to myself?” said Tito, inwardly, with a slight
3946: movement of his shoulders, the first he had made since he had turned to
3947: look down at the florins. “Before I quit everything, and incur again
3948: all the risks of which I am even now weary, I must at least have a
3949: reasonable hope. Am I to spend my life in a wandering search? _I
3950: believe he is dead_. Cennini was right about my florins: I will place
3951: them in his hands to-morrow.”
3952: 
3953: When, the next morning, Tito put this determination into act he had
3954: chosen his colour in the game, and had given an inevitable bent to his
3955: wishes. He had made it impossible that he should not from henceforth
3956: desire it to be the truth that his father was dead; impossible that he
3957: should not be tempted to baseness rather than that the precise facts of
3958: his conduct should not remain for ever concealed.
3959: 
3960: Under every guilty secret there is hidden a brood of guilty wishes,
3961: whose unwholesome infecting life is cherished by the darkness. The
3962: contaminating effect of deeds often lies less in the commission than in
3963: the consequent adjustment of our desires—the enlistment of our
3964: self-interest on the side of falsity; as, on the other hand, the
3965: purifying influence of public confession springs from the fact, that by
3966: it the hope in lies is for ever swept away, and the soul recovers the
3967: noble attitude of simplicity.
3968: 
3969: Besides, in this first distinct colloquy with himself the ideas which
3970: had previously been scattered and interrupted had now concentrated
3971: themselves; the little rills of selfishness had united and made a
3972: channel, so that they could never again meet with the same resistance.
3973: Hitherto Tito had left in vague indecision the question whether, with
3974: the means in his power, he would not return, and ascertain his father’s
3975: fate; he had now made a definite excuse to himself for not taking that
3976: course; he had avowed to himself a choice which he would have been
3977: ashamed to avow to others, and which would have made him ashamed in the
3978: resurgent presence of his father. But the inward shame, the reflex of
3979: that outward law which the great heart of mankind makes for every
3980: individual man, a reflex which will exist even in the absence of the
3981: sympathetic impulses that need no law, but rush to the deed of fidelity
3982: and pity as inevitably as the brute mother shields her young from the
3983: attack of the hereditary enemy—that inward shame was showing its
3984: blushes in Tito’s determined assertion to himself that his father was
3985: dead, or that at least search was hopeless.
3986:

3988: 
3989: 
3990: CHAPTER X.
3991: Under the Plane-Tree.
3992: 
3993: 
3994: On the day of San Giovanni it was already three weeks ago that Tito had
3995: handed his florins to Cennini, and we have seen that as he set out
3996: towards the Via de’ Bardi he showed all the outward signs of a mind at
3997: ease. How should it be otherwise? He never jarred with what was
3998: immediately around him, and his nature was too joyous, too
3999: unapprehensive, for the hidden and the distant to grasp him in the
4000: shape of a dread. As he turned out of the hot sunshine into the shelter
4001: of a narrow street, took off the black cloth berretta, or simple cap
4002: with upturned lappet, which just crowned his brown curls, pushing his
4003: hair and tossing his head backward to court the cooler air, there was
4004: no brand of duplicity on his brow; neither was there any stamp of
4005: candour: it was simply a finely-formed, square, smooth young brow. And
4006: the slow absent glance he cast around at the upper windows of the
4007: houses had neither more dissimulation in it, nor more ingenuousness,
4008: than belongs to a youthful well-opened eyelid with its unwearied
4009: breadth of gaze; to perfectly pellucid lenses; to the undimmed dark of
4010: a rich brown iris; and to a pure cerulean-tinted angle of whiteness
4011: streaked with the delicate shadows of long eyelashes. Was it that
4012: Tito’s face attracted or repelled according to the mental attitude of
4013: the observer? Was it a cypher with more than one key? The strong,
4014: unmistakable expression in his whole air and person was a negative one,
4015: and it was perfectly veracious; it declared the absence of any uneasy
4016: claim, any restless vanity, and it made the admiration that followed
4017: him as he passed among the troop of holiday-makers a thoroughly willing
4018: tribute.
4019: 
4020: For by this time the stir of the Festa was felt even in the narrowest
4021: side-streets; the throng which had at one time been concentrated in the
4022: lines through which the procession had to pass, was now streaming out
4023: in all directions in pursuit of a new object. Such intervals of a Festa
4024: are precisely the moments when the vaguely active animal spirits of a
4025: crowd are likely to be the most petulant and most ready to sacrifice a
4026: stray individual to the greater happiness of the greater number. As
4027: Tito entered the neighbourhood of San Martino, he found the throng
4028: rather denser; and near the hostelry of the _Bertucce_, or Baboons,
4029: there was evidently some object which was arresting the passengers and
4030: forming them into a knot. It needed nothing of great interest to draw
4031: aside passengers unfreighted with a purpose, and Tito was preparing to
4032: turn aside into an adjoining street, when, amidst the loud laughter,
4033: his ear discerned a distressed childish voice crying, “Loose me! Holy
4034: Virgin, help me!” which at once determined him to push his way into the
4035: knot of gazers. He had just had time to perceive that the distressed
4036: voice came from a young contadina, whose white hood had fallen off in
4037: the struggle to get her hands free from the grasp of a man in the
4038: parti-coloured dress of a _cerretano_, or conjuror, who was making
4039: laughing attempts to soothe and cajole her, evidently carrying with him
4040: the amused sympathy of the spectators. These, by a persuasive variety
4041: of words signifying simpleton, for which the Florentine dialect is rich
4042: in equivalents, seemed to be arguing with the contadina against her
4043: obstinacy. At the first moment the girl’s face was turned away, and he
4044: saw only her light-brown hair plaited and fastened with a long silver
4045: pin; but in the next, the struggle brought her face opposite Tito’s,
4046: and he saw the baby features of Tessa, her blue eyes filled with tears,
4047: and her under-lip quivering. Tessa, too, saw _him_, and through the
4048: mist of her swelling tears there beamed a sudden hope, like that in the
4049: face of a little child, when, held by a stranger against its will, it
4050: sees a familiar hand stretched out.
4051: 
4052: In an instant Tito had pushed his way through the barrier of
4053: bystanders, whose curiosity made them ready to turn aside at the sudden
4054: interference of this handsome young signor, had grasped Tessa’s waist,
4055: and had said, “Loose this child! What right have you to hold her
4056: against her will?”
4057: 
4058: The conjuror—a man with one of those faces in which the angles of the
4059: eyes and eyebrows, of the nostrils, mouth, and sharply-defined jaw, all
4060: tend upward—showed his small regular teeth in an impish but not
4061: ill-natured grin, as he let go Tessa’s hands, and stretched out his own
4062: backward, shrugging his shoulders, and bending them forward a little in
4063: a half-apologetic, half-protesting manner.
4064: 
4065: “I mean the ragazza no evil in the world, Messere: ask this respectable
4066: company. I was only going to show them a few samples of my skill, in
4067: which this little damsel might have helped me the better because of her
4068: kitten face, which would have assured them of open dealing; and I had
4069: promised her a lapful of confetti as a reward. But what then? Messer
4070: has doubtless better confetti at hand, and she knows it.”
4071: 
4072: A general laugh among the bystanders accompanied these last words of
4073: the conjuror, raised, probably, by the look of relief and confidence
4074: with which Tessa clung to Tito’s arm, as he drew it from her waist, and
4075: placed her hand within it. She only cared about the laugh as she might
4076: have cared about the roar of wild beasts from which she was escaping,
4077: not attaching any meaning to it; but Tito, who had no sooner got her on
4078: his arm than he foresaw some embarrassment in the situation, hastened
4079: to get clear of observers who, having been despoiled of an expected
4080: amusement, were sure to re-establish the balance by jests.
4081: 
4082: “See, see, little one! here is your hood,” said the conjuror, throwing
4083: the bit of white drapery over Tessa’s head. “_Orsù_, bear me no malice;
4084: come back to me when Messere can spare you.”
4085: 
4086: “Ah! Maestro Vaiano, she’ll come back presently, as the toad said to
4087: the harrow,” called out one of the spectators, seeing how Tessa started
4088: and shrank at the action of the conjuror.
4089: 
4090: Tito pushed his way vigorously towards the corner of a side-street, a
4091: little vexed at this delay in his progress to the Via de’ Bardi, and
4092: intending to get rid of the poor little contadina as soon as possible.
4093: The next street, too, had its passengers inclined to make holiday
4094: remarks on so unusual a pair; but they had no sooner entered it than he
4095: said, in a kind but hurried manner, “Now, little one, where were you
4096: going? Are you come by yourself to the Festa?”
4097: 
4098: “Ah, no!” said Tessa, looking frightened and distressed again; “I have
4099: lost my mother in the crowd—her and my father-in-law. They will be
4100: angry—he will beat me. It was in the crowd in San Pulinari—somebody
4101: pushed me along and I couldn’t stop myself, so I got away from them.
4102: Oh, I don’t know where they’re gone! Please, don’t leave me!”
4103: 
4104: Her eyes had been swelling with tears again, and she ended with a sob.
4105: 
4106: Tito hurried along again: the Church of the Badia was not far off. They
4107: could enter it by the cloister that opened at the back, and in the
4108: church he could talk to Tessa—perhaps leave her. No! it was an hour at
4109: which the church was not open; but they paused under the shelter of the
4110: cloister, and he said, “Have you no cousin or friend in Florence, my
4111: little Tessa, whose house you could find; or are you afraid of walking
4112: by yourself since you have been frightened by the conjuror? I am in a
4113: hurry to get to Oltrarno, but if I could take you anywhere near—”
4114: 
4115: “Oh, I _am_ frightened: he was the devil—I know he was. And I don’t
4116: know where to go. I have nobody: and my mother meant to have her dinner
4117: somewhere, and I don’t know where. Holy Madonna! I shall be beaten.”
4118: 
4119: The corners of the pouting mouth went down piteously, and the poor
4120: little bosom with the beads on it above the green serge gown heaved so,
4121: that there was no longer any help for it: a loud sob _would_ come, and
4122: the big tears fell as if they were making up for lost time. Here was a
4123: situation! It would have been brutal to leave her, and Tito’s nature
4124: was all gentleness. He wished at that moment that he had not been
4125: expected in the Via de’ Bardi. As he saw her lifting up her holiday
4126: apron to catch the hurrying tears, he laid his hand, too, on the apron,
4127: and rubbed one of the cheeks and kissed the baby-like roundness.
4128: 
4129: “My poor little Tessa! leave off crying. Let us see what can be done.
4130: Where is your home—where do you live?”
4131: 
4132: There was no answer, but the sobs began to subside a little and the
4133: drops to fall less quickly.
4134: 
4135: “Come! I’ll take you a little way, if you’ll tell me where you want to
4136: go.”
4137: 
4138: The apron fell, and Tessa’s face began to look as contented as a
4139: cherub’s budding from a cloud. The diabolical conjuror, the anger and
4140: the beating, seemed a long way off.
4141: 
4142: “I think I’ll go home, if you’ll take me,” she said, in a half whisper,
4143: looking up at Tito with wide blue eyes, and with something sweeter than
4144: a smile—with a childlike calm.
4145: 
4146: “Come, then, little one,” said Tito, in a caressing tone, putting her
4147: arm within his again. “Which way is it?”
4148: 
4149: “Beyond Peretola—where the large pear-tree is.”
4150: 
4151: “Peretola? Out at which gate, pazzarella? I am a stranger, you must
4152: remember.”
4153: 
4154: “Out at the Por del Prato,” said Tessa, moving along with a very fast
4155: hold on Tito’s arm.
4156: 
4157: He did not know all the turnings well enough to venture on an attempt
4158: at choosing the quietest streets; and besides, it occurred to him that
4159: where the passengers were most numerous there was, perhaps, the most
4160: chance of meeting with Monna Ghita and finding an end to his
4161: knight-errant-ship. So he made straight for Porta Rossa, and on to
4162: Ognissanti, showing his usual bright propitiatory face to the mixed
4163: observers who threw their jests at him and his little heavy-shod maiden
4164: with much liberality. Mingled with the more decent holiday-makers there
4165: were frolicsome apprentices, rather envious of his good fortune;
4166: bold-eyed women with the badge of the yellow veil; beggars who thrust
4167: forward their caps for alms, in derision at Tito’s evident haste;
4168: dicers, sharpers, and loungers of the worst sort; boys whose tongues
4169: were used to wag in concert at the most brutal street games: for the
4170: streets of Florence were not always a moral spectacle in those times,
4171: and Tessa’s terror at being lost in the crowd was not wholly
4172: unreasonable.
4173: 
4174: When they reached the Piazza d’Ognissanti, Tito slackened his pace:
4175: they were both heated with their hurried walk, and here was a wider
4176: space where they could take breath. They sat down on one of the stone
4177: benches which were frequent against the walls of old Florentine houses.
4178: 
4179: “Holy Virgin!” said Tessa; “I am glad we have got away from those women
4180: and boys; but I was not frightened, because you could take care of me.”
4181: 
4182: “Pretty little Tessa!” said Tito, smiling at her. “What makes you feel
4183: so safe with me?”
4184: 
4185: “Because you are so beautiful—like the people going into Paradise: they
4186: are all good.”
4187: 
4188: “It is a long while since you had your breakfast, Tessa,” said Tito,
4189: seeing some stalls near, with fruit and sweetmeats upon them. “Are you
4190: hungry?”
4191: 
4192: “Yes, I think I am—if you will have some too.”
4193: 
4194: Tito bought some apricots, and cakes, and comfits, and put them into
4195: her apron.
4196: 
4197: “Come,” he said, “let us walk on to the Prato, and then perhaps you
4198: will not be afraid to go the rest of the way alone.”
4199: 
4200: “But you will have some of the apricots and things,” said Tessa, rising
4201: obediently and gathering up her apron as a bag for her store.
4202: 
4203: “We will see,” said Tito aloud; and to himself he said, “Here is a
4204: little contadina who might inspire a better idyl than Lorenzo de’
4205: Medici’s ‘Nencia da Barberino,’ that Nello’s friends rave about; if I
4206: were only a Theocritus, or had time to cultivate the necessary
4207: experience by unseasonable walks of this sort! However, the mischief is
4208: done now: I am so late already that another half-hour will make no
4209: difference. Pretty little pigeon!”
4210: 
4211: “We have a garden and plenty of pears,” said Tessa, “and two cows,
4212: besides the mules; and I’m very fond of them. But my father-in-law is a
4213: cross man: I wish my mother had not married him. I think he is wicked;
4214: he is very ugly.”
4215: 
4216: “And does your mother let him beat you, poverina? You said you were
4217: afraid of being beaten.”
4218: 
4219: “Ah, my mother herself scolds me: she loves my young sister better, and
4220: thinks I don’t do work enough. Nobody speaks kindly to me, only the
4221: Pievano (parish priest) when I go to confession. And the men in the
4222: Mercato laugh at me and make fun of me. Nobody ever kissed me and spoke
4223: to me as you do; just as I talk to my little black-faced kid, because
4224: I’m very fond of it.”
4225: 
4226: It seemed not to have entered Tessa’s mind that there was any change in
4227: Tito’s appearance since the morning he begged the milk from her, and
4228: that he looked now like a personage for whom she must summon her little
4229: stock of reverent words and signs. He had impressed her too differently
4230: from any human being who had ever come near her before, for her to make
4231: any comparison of details; she took no note of his dress; he was simply
4232: a voice and a face to her, something come from Paradise into a world
4233: where most things seemed hard and angry; and she prattled with as
4234: little restraint as if he had been an imaginary companion born of her
4235: own lovingness and the sunshine.
4236: 
4237: They had now reached the Prato, which at that time was a large open
4238: space within the walls, where the Florentine youth played at their
4239: favourite _Calcio_—a peculiar kind of football—and otherwise exercised
4240: themselves. At this mid-day time it was forsaken and quiet to the very
4241: gates, where a tent had been erected in preparation for the race. On
4242: the border of this wide meadow, Tito paused and said—
4243: 
4244: “Now, Tessa, you will not be frightened if I leave you to walk the rest
4245: of the way by yourself. Addio! Shall I come and buy a cup of milk from
4246: you in the Mercato to-morrow morning, to see that you are quite safe?”
4247: 
4248: He added this question in a soothing tone, as he saw her eyes widening
4249: sorrowfully, and the corners of her mouth falling. She said nothing at
4250: first; she only opened her apron and looked down at her apricots and
4251: sweetmeats. Then she looked up at him again and said complainingly—
4252: 
4253: “I thought you would have some, and we could sit down under a tree
4254: outside the gate, and eat them together.”
4255: 
4256: “Tessa, Tessa, you little siren, you would ruin me,” said Tito,
4257: laughing, and kissing both her cheeks. “I ought to have been in the Via
4258: de’ Bardi long ago. No! I must go back now; you are in no danger.
4259: There—I’ll take an apricot. Addio!”
4260: 
4261: He had already stepped two yards from her when he said the last word.
4262: Tessa could not have spoken; she was pale, and a great sob was rising;
4263: but she turned round as if she felt there was no hope for her, and
4264: stepped on, holding her apron so forgetfully that the apricots began to
4265: roll out on the grass.
4266: 
4267: Tito could not help looking after her, and seeing her shoulders rise to
4268: the bursting sob, and the apricots fall—could not help going after her
4269: and picking them up. It was very hard upon him: he was a long way off
4270: the Via de’ Bardi, and very near to Tessa.
4271: 
4272: “See, my silly one,” he said, picking up the apricots. “Come, leave off
4273: crying, I will go with you, and we’ll sit down under the tree. Come, I
4274: don’t like to see you cry; but you know I must go back some time.”
4275: 
4276: So it came to pass that they found a great plane-tree not far outside
4277: the gates, and they sat down under it, and all the feast was spread out
4278: on Tessa’s lap, she leaning with her back against the trunk of the
4279: tree, and he stretched opposite to her, resting his elbows on the rough
4280: green growth cherished by the shade, while the sunlight stole through
4281: the boughs and played about them like a winged thing. Tessa’s face was
4282: all contentment again, and the taste of the apricots and sweetmeats
4283: seemed very good.
4284: 
4285: “You pretty bird!” said Tito, looking at her as she sat eyeing the
4286: remains of the feast with an evident mental debate about saving them,
4287: since he had said he would not have any more. “To think of any one
4288: scolding you! What sins do you tell of at confession, Tessa?”
4289: 
4290: “Oh, a great many. I am often naughty. I don’t like work, and I can’t
4291: help being idle, though I know I shall be beaten and scolded; and I
4292: give the mules the best fodder when nobody sees me, and then when the
4293: Madre is angry I say I didn’t do it, and that makes me frightened at
4294: the devil. I think the conjuror was the devil. I am not so frightened
4295: after I’ve been to confession. And see, I’ve got a _Breve_ here that a
4296: good father, who came to Prato preaching this Easter, blessed and gave
4297: us all.” Here Tessa drew from her bosom a tiny bag carefully fastened
4298: up. “And I think the holy Madonna will take care of me; she looks as if
4299: she would; and perhaps if I wasn’t idle, she wouldn’t let me be
4300: beaten.”
4301: 
4302: “If they are so cruel to you, Tessa, shouldn’t you like to leave them,
4303: and go and live with a beautiful lady who would be kind to you, if she
4304: would have you to wait upon her?”
4305: 
4306: Tessa seemed to hold her breath for a moment or two. Then she said
4307: doubtfully, “I don’t know.”
4308: 
4309: “Then should you like to be my little servant, and live with me?” said
4310: Tito, smiling. He meant no more than to see what sort of pretty look
4311: and answer she would give.
4312: 
4313: There was a flush of joy immediately. “Will you take me with you now?
4314: Ah! I shouldn’t go home and be beaten then.” She paused a little while,
4315: and then added more doubtfully, “But I should like to fetch my
4316: black-faced kid.”
4317: 
4318: “Yes, you must go back to your kid, my Tessa,” said Tito, rising, “and
4319: I must go the other way.”
4320: 
4321: “By Jupiter!” he added, as he went from under the shade of the tree,
4322: “it is not a pleasant time of day to walk from here to the Via de’
4323: Bardi; I am more inclined to lie down and sleep in this shade.”
4324: 
4325: It ended so. Tito had an unconquerable aversion to anything unpleasant,
4326: even when an object very much loved and desired was on the other side
4327: of it. He had risen early; had waited; had seen sights, and had been
4328: already walking in the sun: he was inclined for a siesta, and inclined
4329: all the more because little Tessa was there, and seemed to make the air
4330: softer. He lay down on the grass again, putting his cap under his head
4331: on a green tuft by the side of Tessa. That was not quite comfortable;
4332: so he moved again, and asked Tessa to let him rest his head against her
4333: lap; and in that way he soon fell asleep. Tessa sat quiet as a dove on
4334: its nest, just venturing, when he was fast asleep, to touch the
4335: wonderful dark curls that fell backward from his ear. She was too happy
4336: to go to sleep—too happy to think that Tito would wake up, and that
4337: then he would leave her, and she must go home. It takes very little
4338: water to make a perfect pool for a tiny fish, where it will find its
4339: world and paradise all in one, and never have a presentiment of the dry
4340: bank. The fretted summer shade, and stillness, and the gentle breathing
4341: of some loved life near—it would be paradise to us all, if eager
4342: thought, the strong angel with the implacable brow, had not long since
4343: closed the gates.
4344: 
4345: It really was a long while before the waking came—before the long dark
4346: eyes opened at Tessa, first with a little surprise, and then with a
4347: smile, which was soon quenched by some preoccupying thought. Tito’s
4348: deeper sleep had broken into a doze, in which he felt himself in the
4349: Via de’ Bardi, explaining his failure to appear at the appointed time.
4350: The clear images of that doze urged him to start up at once to a
4351: sitting posture, and as he stretched his arms and shook his cap, he
4352: said—
4353: 
4354: “Tessa, little one, you have let me sleep too long. My hunger and the
4355: shadows together tell me that the sun has done much travel since I fell
4356: asleep. I must lose no more time. Addio,” he ended, patting her cheek
4357: with one hand, and settling his cap with the other.
4358: 
4359: She said nothing, but there were signs in her face which made him speak
4360: again in as serious and as chiding a tone as he could command—
4361: 
4362: “Now, Tessa, you must not cry. I shall be angry; I shall not love you
4363: if you cry. You must go home to your black-faced kid, or if you like
4364: you may go back to the gate and see the horses start. But I can stay
4365: with you no longer, and if you cry, I shall think you are troublesome
4366: to me.”
4367: 
4368: The rising tears were checked by terror at this change in Tito’s voice.
4369: Tessa turned very pale, and sat in trembling silence, with her blue
4370: eyes widened by arrested tears.
4371: 
4372: “Look now,” Tito went on, soothingly, opening the wallet that hung at
4373: his belt, “here is a pretty charm that I have had a long while—ever
4374: since I was in Sicily, a country a long way off.”
4375: 
4376: His wallet had many little matters in it mingled with small coins, and
4377: he had the usual difficulty in laying his finger on the right thing. He
4378: unhooked his wallet, and turned out the contents on Tessa’s lap. Among
4379: them was his onyx ring.
4380: 
4381: “Ah, my ring!” he exclaimed, slipping it on the forefinger of his
4382: right-hand. “I forgot to put it on again this morning. Strange, I never
4383: missed it! See, Tessa,” he added, as he spread out the smaller
4384: articles, and selected the one he was in search of. “See this pretty
4385: little pointed bit of red coral—like your goat’s horn, is it not?—and
4386: here is a hole in it, so you can put it on the cord round your neck
4387: along with your _Breve_, and then the evil spirits can’t hurt you: if
4388: you ever see them coming in the shadow round the corner, point this
4389: little coral horn at them, and they will run away. It is a ‘buona
4390: fortuna,’ and will keep you from harm when I am not with you. Come,
4391: undo the cord.”
4392: 
4393: Tessa obeyed with a tranquillising sense that life was going to be
4394: something quite new, and that Tito would be with her often. All who
4395: remember their childhood remember the strange vague sense, when some
4396: new experience came, that everything else was going to be changed, and
4397: that there would be no lapse into the old monotony. So the bit of coral
4398: was hung beside the tiny bag with the scrap of scrawled parchment in
4399: it, and Tessa felt braver.
4400: 
4401: “And now you will give me a kiss,” said Tito, economising time by
4402: speaking while he swept in the contents of the wallet and hung it at
4403: his waist again, “and look happy, like a good girl, and then—”
4404: 
4405: But Tessa had obediently put forward her lips in a moment, and kissed
4406: his cheek as he hung down his head.
4407: 
4408: “Oh, you pretty pigeon!” cried Tito, laughing, pressing her round
4409: cheeks with his hands and crushing her features together so as to give
4410: them a general impartial kiss.
4411: 
4412: Then he started up and walked away, not looking round till he was ten
4413: yards from her, when he just turned and gave a parting beck. Tessa was
4414: looking after him, but he could see that she was making no signs of
4415: distress. It was enough for Tito if she did not cry while he was
4416: present. The softness of his nature required that all sorrow should be
4417: hidden away from him.
4418: 
4419: “I wonder when Romola will kiss my cheek in that way?” thought Tito, as
4420: he walked along. It seemed a tiresome distance now, and he almost
4421: wished he had not been so soft-hearted, or so tempted to linger in the
4422: shade. No other excuse was needed to Bardo and Romola than saying
4423: simply that he had been unexpectedly hindered; he felt confident their
4424: proud delicacy would inquire no farther. He lost no time in getting to
4425: Ognissanti, and hastily taking some food there, he crossed the Arno by
4426: the Ponte alia Carraja, and made his way as directly as possible
4427: towards the Via de’ Bardi.
4428: 
4429: But it was the hour when all the world who meant to be in particularly
4430: good time to see the Corso were returning from the Borghi, or villages
4431: just outside the gates, where they had dined and reposed themselves;
4432: and the thoroughfares leading to the bridges were of course the issues
4433: towards which the stream of sightseers tended. Just as Tito reached the
4434: Ponte Vecchio and the entrance of the Via de’ Bardi, he was suddenly
4435: urged back towards the angle of the intersecting streets. A company on
4436: horseback, coming from the Via Guicciardini, and turning up the Via de’
4437: Bardi, had compelled the foot-passengers to recede hurriedly. Tito had
4438: been walking, as his manner was, with the thumb of his right-hand
4439: resting in his belt; and as he was thus forced to pause, and was
4440: looking carelessly at the passing cavaliers, he felt a very thin cold
4441: hand laid on his. He started round, and saw the Dominican friar whose
4442: upturned face had so struck him in the morning. Seen closer, the face
4443: looked more evidently worn by sickness and not by age; and again it
4444: brought some strong but indefinite reminiscences to Tito.
4445: 
4446: “Pardon me, but—from your face and your ring,”—said the friar, in a
4447: faint voice, “is not your name Tito Melema?”
4448: 
4449: “Yes,” said Tito, also speaking faintly, doubly jarred by the cold
4450: touch and the mystery. He was not apprehensive or timid through his
4451: imagination, but through his sensations and perceptions he could easily
4452: be made to shrink and turn pale like a maiden.
4453: 
4454: “Then I shall fulfil my commission.”
4455: 
4456: The friar put his hand under his scapulary, and drawing out a small
4457: linen bag which hung round his neck, took from it a bit of parchment,
4458: doubled and stuck firmly together with some black adhesive substance,
4459: and placed it in Tito’s hand. On the outside was written in Italian, in
4460: a small but distinct character—
4461: 
4462: “_Tito Melema, aged twenty-three, with a dark, beautiful face, long
4463: dark curls, the brightest smile, and a large onyx ring on his right
4464: forefinger_.”
4465: 
4466: Tito did not look at the friar, but tremblingly broke open the bit of
4467: parchment. Inside, the words were—
4468: 
4469: “_I am sold for a slave: I think they are going to take me to Antioch.
4470: The gems alone will serve to ransom me_.”
4471: 
4472: Tito looked round at the friar, but could only ask a question with his
4473: eyes.
4474: 
4475: “I had it at Corinth,” the friar said, speaking with difficulty, like
4476: one whose small strength had been overtaxed—“I had it from a man who
4477: was dying.”
4478: 
4479: “He is dead, then?” said Tito, with a bounding of the heart.
4480: 
4481: “Not the writer. The man who gave it me was a pilgrim, like myself, to
4482: whom the writer had intrusted it, because he was journeying to Italy.”
4483: 
4484: “You know the contents?”
4485: 
4486: “I do not know them, but I conjecture them. Your friend is in slavery:
4487: you will go and release him. But I am unable to talk now.” The friar,
4488: whose voice had become feebler and feebler, sank down on the stone
4489: bench against the wall from which he had risen to touch Tito’s hand,
4490: adding—
4491: 
4492: “I am at San Marco; my name is Fra Luca.”
4493: 
4494: 
4495: 
4496: 
4497: CHAPTER XI.
4498: Tito’s Dilemma.
4499: 
4500: 
4501: When Fra Luca had ceased to speak, Tito still stood by him in
4502: irresolution, and it was not till, the pressure of the passengers being
4503: removed, the friar rose and walked slowly into the church of Santa
4504: Felicita, that Tito also went on his way along the Via de’ Bardi.
4505: 
4506: “If this monk is a Florentine,” he said to himself; “if he is going to
4507: remain at Florence, everything must be disclosed.” He felt that a new
4508: crisis had come, but he was not, for all that, too evidently agitated
4509: to pay his visit to Bardo, and apologise for his previous
4510: non-appearance. Tito’s talent for concealment was being fast developed
4511: into something less neutral. It was still possible—perhaps it might be
4512: inevitable—for him to accept frankly the altered conditions, and avow
4513: Baldassarre’s existence; but hardly without casting an unpleasant light
4514: backward on his original reticence as studied equivocation in order to
4515: avoid the fulfilment of a secretly recognised claim, to say nothing of
4516: his quiet settlement of himself and investment of his florins, when, it
4517: would be clear, his benefactor’s fate had not been certified. It was at
4518: least provisionally wise to act as if nothing had happened, and for the
4519: present he would suspend decisive thought; there was all the night for
4520: meditation, and no one would know the precise moment at which he had
4521: received the letter.
4522: 
4523: So he entered the room on the second storey—where Romola and her father
4524: sat among the parchment and the marble, aloof from the life of the
4525: streets on holidays as well as on common days—with a face only a little
4526: less bright than usual, from regret at appearing so late: a regret
4527: which wanted no testimony, since he had given up the sight of the Corso
4528: in order to express it; and then set himself to throw extra animation
4529: into the evening, though all the while his consciousness was at work
4530: like a machine with complex action, leaving deposits quite distinct
4531: from the line of talk; and by the time he descended the stone stairs
4532: and issued from the grim door in the starlight, his mind had really
4533: reached a new stage in its formation of a purpose.
4534: 
4535: And when, the next day, after he was free from his professorial work,
4536: he turned up the Via del Cocomero towards the convent of San Marco, his
4537: purpose was fully shaped. He was going to ascertain from Fra Luca
4538: precisely how much he conjectured of the truth, and on what grounds he
4539: conjectured it; and, further, how long he was to remain at San Marco.
4540: And on that fuller knowledge he hoped to mould a statement which would
4541: in any case save him from the necessity of quitting Florence. Tito had
4542: never had occasion to fabricate an ingenious lie before: the occasion
4543: was come now—the occasion which circumstance never fails to beget on
4544: tacit falsity; and his ingenuity was ready. For he had convinced
4545: himself that he was not bound to go in search of Baldassarre. He had
4546: once said that on a fair assurance of his father’s existence and
4547: whereabout, he would unhesitatingly go after him. But, after all, _why_
4548: was he bound to go? What, looked at closely, was the end of all life,
4549: but to extract the utmost sum of pleasure? And was not his own blooming
4550: life a promise of incomparably more pleasure, not for himself only, but
4551: for others, than the withered wintry life of a man who was past the
4552: time of keen enjoyment, and whose ideas had stiffened into barren
4553: rigidity? Those ideas had all been sown in the fresh soil of Tito’s
4554: mind, and were lively germs there: that was the proper order of
4555: things—the order of nature, which treats all maturity as a mere nidus
4556: for youth. Baldassarre had done his work, had had his draught of life:
4557: Tito said it was _his_ turn now.
4558: 
4559: And the prospect was so vague:—“I think they are going to take me to
4560: Antioch:” here was a vista! After a long voyage, to spend months,
4561: perhaps years, in a search for which even now there was no guarantee
4562: that it would not prove vain: and to leave behind at starting a life of
4563: distinction and love: and to find, if he found anything, the old
4564: exacting companionship which was known by rote beforehand. Certainly
4565: the gems and therefore the florins were, in a sense, Baldassarre’s: in
4566: the narrow sense by which the right of possession is determined in
4567: ordinary affairs; but in that large and more radically natural view by
4568: which the world belongs to youth and strength, they were rather his who
4569: could extract the most pleasure out of them. That, he was conscious,
4570: was not the sentiment which the complicated play of human feelings had
4571: engendered in society. The men around him would expect that he should
4572: immediately apply those florins to his benefactor’s rescue. But what
4573: was the sentiment of society?—a mere tangle of anomalous traditions and
4574: opinions, which no wise man would take as a guide, except so far as his
4575: own comfort was concerned. Not that he cared for the florins save
4576: perhaps for Romola’s sake: he would give up the florins readily enough.
4577: It was the joy that was due to him and was close to his lips, which he
4578: felt he was not bound to thrust away from him and so travel on,
4579: thirsting. Any maxims that required a man to fling away the good that
4580: was needed to make existence sweet, were only the lining of human
4581: selfishness turned outward: they were made by men who wanted others to
4582: sacrifice themselves for their sake. He would rather that Baldassarre
4583: should not suffer: he liked no one to suffer; but could any philosophy
4584: prove to him that he was bound to care for another’s suffering more
4585: than for his own? To do so he must have loved Baldassarre devotedly,
4586: and he did _not_ love him: was that his own fault? Gratitude! seen
4587: closely, it made no valid claim: his father’s life would have been
4588: dreary without him: are we convicted of a debt to men for the pleasures
4589: they give themselves?
4590: 
4591: Having once begun to explain away Baldassarre’s claim, Tito’s thought
4592: showed itself as active as a virulent acid, eating its rapid way
4593: through all the tissues of sentiment. His mind was destitute of that
4594: dread which has been erroneously decried as if it were nothing higher
4595: than a man’s animal care for his own skin: that awe of the Divine
4596: Nemesis which was felt by religious pagans, and, though it took a more
4597: positive form under Christianity, is still felt by the mass of mankind
4598: simply as a vague fear at anything which is called wrong-doing. Such
4599: terror of the unseen is so far above mere sensual cowardice that it
4600: will annihilate that cowardice: it is the initial recognition of a
4601: moral law restraining desire, and checks the hard bold scrutiny of
4602: imperfect thought into obligations which can never be proved to have
4603: any sanctity in the absence of feeling. “It is good,” sing the old
4604: Eumenides, in Aeschylus, “that fear should sit as the guardian of the
4605: soul, forcing it into wisdom—good that men should carry a threatening
4606: shadow in their hearts under the full sunshine; else, how should they
4607: learn to revere the right?” That guardianship may become needless; but
4608: only when all outward law has become needless—only when duty and love
4609: have united in one stream and made a common force.
4610: 
4611: As Tito entered the outer cloister of San Marco, and inquired for Fra
4612: Luca, there was no shadowy presentiment in his mind: he felt himself
4613: too cultured and sceptical for that: he had been nurtured in contempt
4614: for the tales of priests whose impudent lives were a proverb, and in
4615: erudite familiarity with disputes concerning the Chief Good, which had
4616: after all, he considered, left it a matter of taste. Yet fear was a
4617: strong element in Tito’s nature—the fear of what he believed or saw was
4618: likely to rob him of pleasure: and he had a definite fear that Fra Luca
4619: might be the means of driving him from Florence.
4620: 
4621: “Fra Luca? ah, he is gone to Fiesole—to the Dominican monastery there.
4622: He was taken on a litter in the cool of the morning. The poor Brother
4623: is very ill. Could you leave a message for him?”
4624: 
4625: This answer was given by a _fra converso_, or lay brother, whose accent
4626: told plainly that he was a raw contadino, and whose dull glance implied
4627: no curiosity.
4628: 
4629: “Thanks; my business can wait.”
4630: 
4631: Tito turned away with a sense of relief. “This friar is not likely to
4632: live,” he said to himself. “I saw he was worn to a shadow. And at
4633: Fiesole there will be nothing to recall me to his mind. Besides, if he
4634: should come back, my explanation will serve as well then as now. But I
4635: wish I knew what it was that his face recalled to me.”
4636: 
4637: 
4638: 
4639: 
4640: CHAPTER XII.
4641: The Prize is nearly Grasped.
4642: 
4643: 
4644: Tito walked along with a light step, for the immediate fear had
4645: vanished; the usual joyousness of his disposition reassumed its
4646: predominance, and he was going to see Romola. Yet Romola’s life seemed
4647: an image of that loving, pitying devotedness, that patient endurance of
4648: irksome tasks, from which he had shrunk and excused himself. But he was
4649: not out of love with goodness, or prepared to plunge into vice: he was
4650: in his fresh youth, with soft pulses for all charm and loveliness; he
4651: had still a healthy appetite for ordinary human joys, and the poison
4652: could only work by degrees. He had sold himself to evil, but at present
4653: life seemed so nearly the same to him that he was not conscious of the
4654: bond. He meant all things to go on as they had done before, both within
4655: and without him: he meant to win golden opinions by meritorious
4656: exertion, by ingenious learning, by amiable compliance: he was not
4657: going to do anything that would throw him out of harmony with the
4658: beings he cared for. And he cared supremely for Romola; he wished to
4659: have her for his beautiful and loving wife. There might be a wealthier
4660: alliance within the ultimate reach of successful accomplishments like
4661: his, but there was no woman in all Florence like Romola. When she was
4662: near him, and looked at him with her sincere hazel eyes, he was subdued
4663: by a delicious influence as strong and inevitable as those musical
4664: vibrations which take possession of us with a rhythmic empire that no
4665: sooner ceases than we desire it to begin again.
4666: 
4667: As he trod the stone stairs, when he was still outside the door, with
4668: no one but Maso near him, the influence seemed to have begun its work
4669: by the mere nearness of anticipation.
4670: 
4671: “Welcome, Tito mio,” said the old man’s voice, before Tito had spoken.
4672: There was a new vigour in the voice, a new cheerfulness in the blind
4673: face, since that first interview more than two months ago. “You have
4674: brought fresh manuscript, doubtless; but since we were talking last
4675: night I have had new ideas: we must take a wider scope—we must go back
4676: upon our footsteps.”
4677: 
4678: Tito, paying his homage to Romola as he advanced, went, as his custom
4679: was, straight to Bardo’s chair, and put his hand in the palm that was
4680: held to receive it, placing himself on the cross-legged leather seat
4681: with scrolled ends, close to Bardo’s elbow.
4682: 
4683: “Yes,” he said, in his gentle way; “I have brought the new manuscript,
4684: but that can wait your pleasure. I have young limbs, you know, and can
4685: walk back up the hill without any difficulty.”
4686: 
4687: He did not look at Romola as he said this, but he knew quite well that
4688: her eyes were fixed on him with delight.
4689: 
4690: “That is well said, my son.” Bardo had already addressed Tito in this
4691: way once or twice of late. “And I perceive with gladness that you do
4692: not shrink from labour, without which, the poet has wisely said, life
4693: has given nothing to mortals. It is too often the ‘palma sine pulvere,’
4694: the prize of glory without the dust of the race, that attracts young
4695: ambition. But what says the Greek? ‘In the morning of life, work; in
4696: the mid-day, give counsel; in the evening, pray.’ It is true, I might
4697: be thought to have reached that helpless evening; but not so, while I
4698: have counsel within me which is yet unspoken. For my mind, as I have
4699: often said, was shut up as by a dam; the plenteous waters lay dark and
4700: motionless; but you, my Tito, have opened a duct for them, and they
4701: rush forward with a force that surprises myself. And now, what I want
4702: is, that we should go over our preliminary ground again, with a wider
4703: scheme of comment and illustration: otherwise I may lose opportunities
4704: which I now see retrospectively, and which may never occur again. You
4705: mark what I am saying, Tito?”
4706: 
4707: He had just stooped to reach his manuscript, which had rolled down, and
4708: Bardo’s jealous ear was alive to the slight movement.
4709: 
4710: Tito might have been excused for shrugging his shoulders at the
4711: prospect before him, but he was not naturally impatient; moreover, he
4712: had been bred up in that laborious erudition, at once minute and
4713: copious, which was the chief intellectual task of the age; and with
4714: Romola near, he was floated along by waves of agreeable sensation that
4715: made everything seem easy.
4716: 
4717: “Assuredly,” he said; “you wish to enlarge your comments on certain
4718: passages we have cited.”
4719: 
4720: “Not only so; I wish to introduce an occasional _excursus_, where we
4721: have noticed an author to whom I have given special study; for I may
4722: die too soon to achieve any separate work. And this is not a time for
4723: scholarly integrity and well-sifted learning to lie idle, when it is
4724: not only rash ignorance that we have to fear, but when there are men
4725: like Calderino, who, as Poliziano has well shown, have recourse to
4726: impudent falsities of citation to serve the ends of their vanity and
4727: secure a triumph to their own mistakes. Wherefore, my Tito, I think it
4728: not well that we should let slip the occasion that lies under our
4729: hands. And now we will turn back to the point where we have cited the
4730: passage from Thucydides, and I wish you, by way of preliminary, to go
4731: with me through all my notes on the Latin translation made by Lorenzo
4732: Valla, for which the incomparable Pope Nicholas the Fifth—with whose
4733: personal notice I was honoured while I was yet young, and when he was
4734: still Thomas of Sarzana—paid him (I say not unduly) the sum of five
4735: hundred gold scudi. But inasmuch as Valla, though otherwise of dubious
4736: fame, is held in high honour for his severe scholarship, whence the
4737: epigrammatist has jocosely said of him that since he went among the
4738: shades, Pluto himself has not dared to speak in the ancient languages,
4739: it is the more needful that his name should not be as a stamp
4740: warranting false wares; and therefore I would introduce an _excursus_
4741: on Thucydides, wherein my castigations of Valla’s text may find a
4742: fitting place. My Romola, thou wilt reach the needful volumes—thou
4743: knowest them—on the fifth shelf of the cabinet.”
4744: 
4745: Tito rose at the same moment with Romola, saying, “I will reach them,
4746: if you will point them out,” and followed her hastily into the
4747: adjoining small room, where the walls were also covered with ranges of
4748: books in perfect order.
4749: 
4750: “There they are,” said Romola, pointing upward; “every book is just
4751: where it was when my father ceased to see them.”
4752: 
4753: Tito stood by her without hastening to reach the books. They had never
4754: been in this room together before.
4755: 
4756: “I hope,” she continued, turning her eyes full on Tito, with a look of
4757: grave confidence—“I hope he will not weary you; this work makes him so
4758: happy.”
4759: 
4760: “And me too, Romola—if you will only let me say, I love you—if you will
4761: only think me worth loving a little.”
4762: 
4763: His speech was the softest murmur, and the dark beautiful face, nearer
4764: to hers than it had ever been before, was looking at her with
4765: beseeching tenderness.
4766: 
4767: “I do love you,” murmured Romola; she looked at him with the same
4768: simple majesty as ever, but her voice had never in her life before sunk
4769: to that murmur. It seemed to them both that they were looking at each
4770: other a long while before her lips moved again; yet it was but a moment
4771: till she said, “I know _now_ what it is to be happy.”
4772: 
4773: The faces just met, and the dark curls mingled for an instant with the
4774: rippling gold. Quick as lightning after that, Tito set his foot on a
4775: projecting ledge of the book-shelves and reached down the needful
4776: volumes. They were both contented to be silent and separate, for that
4777: first blissful experience of mutual consciousness was all the more
4778: exquisite for being unperturbed by immediate sensation.
4779: 
4780: It had all been as rapid as the irreversible mingling of waters, for
4781: even the eager and jealous Bardo had not become impatient.
4782: 
4783: “You have the volumes, my Romola?” the old man said, as they came near
4784: him again. “And now you will get your pen ready; for, as Tito marks off
4785: the scholia we determine on extracting, it will be well for you to copy
4786: them without delay—numbering them carefully, mind, to correspond with
4787: the numbers in the text which he will write.”
4788: 
4789: Romola always had some task which gave her a share in this joint work.
4790: Tito took his stand at the leggio, where he both wrote and read, and
4791: she placed herself at a table just in front of him, where she was ready
4792: to give into her father’s hands anything that he might happen to want,
4793: or relieve him of a volume that he had done with. They had always been
4794: in that position since the work began, yet on this day it seemed new;
4795: it was so different now for them to be opposite each other; so
4796: different for Tito to take a book from her, as she lifted it from her
4797: father’s knee. Yet there was no finesse to secure an additional look or
4798: touch. Each woman creates in her own likeness the love-tokens that are
4799: offered to her; and Romola’s deep calm happiness encompassed Tito like
4800: the rich but quiet evening light which dissipates all unrest.
4801: 
4802: They had been two hours at their work, and were just desisting because
4803: of the fading light, when the door opened and there entered a figure
4804: strangely incongruous with the current of their thoughts and with the
4805: suggestions of every object around them. It was the figure of a short
4806: stout black-eyed woman, about fifty, wearing a black velvet berretta,
4807: or close cap, embroidered with pearls, under which surprisingly massive
4808: black braids surmounted the little bulging forehead, and fell in rich
4809: plaited curves over the ears, while an equally surprising carmine tint
4810: on the upper region of the fat cheeks contrasted with the surrounding
4811: sallowness. Three rows of pearls and a lower necklace of gold reposed
4812: on the horizontal cushion of her neck; the embroidered border of her
4813: trailing black velvet gown and her embroidered long-drooping sleeves of
4814: rose-coloured damask, were slightly faded, but they conveyed to the
4815: initiated eye the satisfactory assurance that they were the splendid
4816: result of six months’ labour by a skilled workman; and the
4817: rose-coloured petticoat, with its dimmed white fringe and seed-pearl
4818: arabesques, was duly exhibited in order to suggest a similar pleasing
4819: reflection. A handsome coral rosary hung from one side of an
4820: inferential belt, which emerged into certainty with a large clasp of
4821: silver wrought in niello; and, on the other side, where the belt again
4822: became inferential, hung a scarsella, or large purse, of crimson
4823: velvet, stitched with pearls. Her little fat right-hand, which looked
4824: as if it had been made of paste, and had risen out of shape under
4825: partial baking, held a small book of devotions, also splendid with
4826: velvet, pearls, and silver.
4827: 
4828: The figure was already too familiar to Tito to be startling, for Monna
4829: Brigida was a frequent visitor at Bardo’s, being excepted from the
4830: sentence of banishment passed on feminine triviality, on the ground of
4831: her cousinship to his dead wife and her early care for Romola, who now
4832: looked round at her with an affectionate smile, and rose to draw the
4833: leather seat to a due distance from her father’s chair, that the coming
4834: gush of talk might not be too near his ear.
4835: 
4836: “_La cugina_?” said Bardo, interrogatively, detecting the short steps
4837: and the sweeping drapery.
4838: 
4839: “Yes, it is your cousin,” said Monna Brigida, in an alert voice,
4840: raising her fingers smilingly at Tito, and then lifting up her face to
4841: be kissed by Romola. “Always the troublesome cousin breaking in on your
4842: wisdom,” she went on, seating herself and beginning to fan herself with
4843: the white veil hanging over her arm. “Well, well; if I didn’t bring you
4844: some news of the world now and then, I do believe you’d forget there
4845: was anything in life but these mouldy ancients, who want sprinkling
4846: with holy water if all I hear about them is true. Not but what the
4847: world is bad enough nowadays, for the scandals that turn up under one’s
4848: nose at every corner—_I_ don’t want to hear and see such things, but
4849: one can’t go about with one’s head in a bag; and it was only
4850: yesterday—well, well, you needn’t burst out at me, Bardo, I’m not going
4851: to tell anything; if I’m not as wise as the three kings, I know how
4852: many legs go into one boot. But, nevertheless, Florence is a wicked
4853: city—is it not true, Messer Tito? for you go into the world. Not but
4854: what one must sin a little—Messer Domeneddio expects that of us, else
4855: what are the blessed sacraments for? And what I say is, we’ve got to
4856: reverence the saints, and not to set ourselves up as if we could be
4857: like them, else life would be unbearable; as it will be if things go on
4858: after this new fashion. For what do you think? I’ve been at the wedding
4859: to-day—Dianora Acciajoli’s with the young Albizzi that there has been
4860: so much talk of—and everybody wondered at its being to-day instead of
4861: yesterday; but, _cieli_! such a wedding as it was might have been put
4862: off till the next Quaresima for a penance. For there was the bride
4863: looking like a white nun—not so much as a pearl about her—and the
4864: bridegroom as solemn as San Giuseppe. It’s true! And half the people
4865: invited were _Piagnoni_—they call them _Piagnoni_ (funeral mourners:
4866: properly, paid mourners) now, these new saints of Fra Girolamo’s
4867: making. And to think of two families like the Albizzi and the Acciajoli
4868: taking up such notions, when they could afford to wear the best! Well,
4869: well, they invited me—but they could do no other, seeing my husband was
4870: Luca Antonio’s uncle by the mother’s side—and a pretty time I had of it
4871: while we waited under the canopy in front of the house, before they let
4872: us in. I couldn’t stand in my clothes, it seemed, without giving
4873: offence; for there was Monna Berta, who has had worse secrets in her
4874: time than any I could tell of myself, looking askance at me from under
4875: her hood like a _pinzochera_, (a Sister of the Third Order of Saint
4876: Francis: an uncloistered nun) and telling me to read the Frate’s book
4877: about widows, from which she had found great guidance. Holy Madonna! it
4878: seems as if widows had nothing to do now but to buy their coffins, and
4879: think it a thousand years till they get into them, instead of enjoying
4880: themselves a little when they’ve got their hands free for the first
4881: time. And what do you think was the music we had, to make our dinner
4882: lively? A long discourse from Fra Domenico of San Marco, about the
4883: doctrines of their blessed Fra Girolamo—the three doctrines we are all
4884: to get by heart; and he kept marking them off on his fingers till he
4885: made my flesh creep: and the first is, Florence, or the Church—I don’t
4886: know which, for first he said one and then the other—shall be scourged;
4887: but if he means the pestilence, the Signory ought to put a stop to such
4888: preaching, for it’s enough to raise the swelling under one’s arms with
4889: fright: but then, after that, he says Florence is to be regenerated;
4890: but what will be the good of that when we’re all dead of the plague, or
4891: something else? And then, the third thing, and what he said oftenest,
4892: is, that it’s all to be in our days: and he marked that off on his
4893: thumb, till he made me tremble like the very jelly before me. They had
4894: jellies, to be sure, with the arms of the Albizzi and the Acciajoli
4895: raised on them in all colours; they’ve not turned the world quite
4896: upside down yet. But all their talk is, that we are to go back to the
4897: old ways: for up starts Francesco Valori, that I’ve danced with in the
4898: Via Larga when he was a bachelor and as fond of the Medici as anybody,
4899: and he makes a speech about the old times, before the Florentines had
4900: left off crying ‘Popolo’ and begun to cry ‘Palle’—as if that had
4901: anything to do with a wedding!—and how we ought to keep to the rules
4902: the Signory laid down heaven knows when, that we were not to wear this
4903: and that, and not to eat this and that—and how our manners were
4904: corrupted and we read bad books; though he can’t say that of _me_—”
4905: 
4906: “Stop, cousin!” said Bardo, in his imperious tone, for he had a remark
4907: to make, and only desperate measures could arrest the rattling
4908: lengthiness of Monna Brigida’s discourse. But now she gave a little
4909: start, pursed up her mouth, and looked at him with round eyes.
4910: 
4911: “Francesco Valori is not altogether wrong,” Bardo went on. “Bernardo,
4912: indeed, rates him not highly, and is rather of opinion that he
4913: christens private grudges by the name of public zeal; though I must
4914: admit that my good Bernardo is too slow of belief in that unalloyed
4915: patriotism which was found in all its lustre amongst the ancients. But
4916: it is true, Tito, that our manners have degenerated somewhat from that
4917: noble frugality which, as has been well seen in the public acts of our
4918: citizens, is the parent of true magnificence. For men, as I hear, will
4919: now spend on the transient show of a Giostra sums which would suffice
4920: to found a library, and confer a lasting possession on mankind. Still,
4921: I conceive, it remains true of us Florentines that we have more of that
4922: magnanimous sobriety which abhors a trivial lavishness that it may be
4923: grandly open-handed on grand occasions, than can be found in any other
4924: city of Italy; for I understand that the Neapolitan and Milanese
4925: courtiers laugh at the scarcity of our plate, and think scorn of our
4926: great families for borrowing from each other that furniture of the
4927: table at their entertainments. But in the vain laughter of folly wisdom
4928: hears half its applause.”
4929: 
4930: “Laughter, indeed!” burst forth Monna Brigida again, the moment, Bardo
4931: paused. “If anybody wanted to hear laughter at the wedding to-day they
4932: were disappointed, for when young Niccolò Macchiavelli tried to make a
4933: joke, and told stories out of Franco Sacchetti’s book, how it was no
4934: use for the Signoria to make rules for us women, because we were
4935: cleverer than all the painters, and architects, and doctors of logic in
4936: the world, for we could make black look white, and yellow look pink,
4937: and crooked look straight, and, if anything was forbidden, we could
4938: find a new name for it—Holy Virgin! the Piagnoni looked more dismal
4939: than before, and somebody said Sacchetti’s book was wicked. Well, I
4940: don’t read it—they can’t accuse _me_ of reading anything. Save me from
4941: going to a wedding again, if that’s to be the fashion; for all of us
4942: who were not Piagnoni were as comfortable as wet chickens. I was never
4943: caught in a worse trap but once before, and that was when I went to
4944: hear their precious Frate last Quaresima in San Lorenzo. Perhaps I
4945: never told you about it, Messer Tito?—it almost freezes my blood when I
4946: think of it. How he rated us poor women! and the men, too, to tell the
4947: truth, but I didn’t mind that so much. He called us cows, and lumps of
4948: flesh, and wantons, and mischief-makers—and I could just bear that, for
4949: there were plenty others more fleshy and spiteful than I was, though
4950: every now and then his voice shook the very bench under me like a
4951: trumpet; but then he came to the false hair, and, O misericordia! he
4952: made a picture—I see it now—of a young woman lying a pale corpse, and
4953: us light-minded widows—of course he meant me as well as the rest, for I
4954: had my plaits on, for if one is getting old, one doesn’t want to look
4955: as ugly as the Befana,[1]—us widows rushing up to the corpse, like
4956: bare-pated vultures as we were, and cutting off its young dead hair to
4957: deck our old heads with. Oh, the dreams I had after that! And then he
4958: cried, and wrung his hands at us, and I cried too. And to go home, and
4959: to take off my jewels, this very clasp, and everything, and to make
4960: them into a packet, _fù tutt’uno_; and I was within a hair of sending
4961: them to the Good Men of Saint Martin to give to the poor, but, by
4962: heaven’s mercy, I bethought me of going first to my confessor, Fra
4963: Cristoforo, at Santa Croce, and he told me how it was all the work of
4964: the devil, this preaching and prophesying of their Fra Girolamo, and
4965: the Dominicans were trying to turn the world upside down, and I was
4966: never to go and hear him again, else I must do penance for it; for the
4967: great preachers Fra Mariano and Fra Menico had shown how Fra Girolamo
4968: preached lies—and that was true, for I heard them both in the Duomo—and
4969: how the Pope’s dream of San Francesco propping up the Church with his
4970: arms was being fulfilled still, and the Dominicans were beginning to
4971: pull it down. Well and good: I went away _con Dio_, and made myself
4972: easy. I am not going to be frightened by a Frate Predicatore again. And
4973: all I say is, I wish it hadn’t been the Dominicans that poor Dino
4974: joined years ago, for then I should have been glad when I heard them
4975: say he was come back—”
4976: 
4977:  [1] The name given to the grotesque black-faced figures, supposed to
4978:  represent the Magi, carried about or placed in the windows on Twelfth
4979:  Night: a corruption of Epifania.
4980: 
4981: 
4982: “Silenzio!” said Bardo, in a loud agitated voice, while Romola half
4983: started from her chair, clasped her hands, and looked round at Tito, as
4984: if now she might appeal to him. Monna Brigida gave a little scream, and
4985: bit her lip.
4986: 
4987: “Donna!” said Bardo, again, “hear once more my will. Bring no reports
4988: about that name to this house; and thou, Romola, I forbid thee to ask.
4989: My son is dead.”
4990: 
4991: Bardo’s whole frame seemed vibrating with passion, and no one dared to
4992: break silence again. Monna Brigida lifted her shoulders and her hands
4993: in mute dismay; then she rose as quietly as possible, gave many
4994: significant nods to Tito and Romola, motioning to them that they were
4995: not to move, and stole out of the room like a culpable fat spaniel who
4996: has barked unseasonably.
4997: 
4998: Meanwhile, Tito’s quick mind had been combining ideas with
4999: lightning-like rapidity. Bardo’s son was not really dead, then, as he
5000: had supposed: he was a monk; he was “come back:” and Fra Luca—yes! it
5001: was the likeness to Bardo and Romola that had made the face seem
5002: half-known to him. If he were only dead at Fiesole at that moment! This
5003: importunate selfish wish inevitably thrust itself before every other
5004: thought. It was true that Bardo’s rigid will was a sufficient safeguard
5005: against any intercourse between Romola and her brother; but _not_
5006: against the betrayal of what he knew to others, especially when the
5007: subject was suggested by the coupling of Romola’s name with that of the
5008: very Tito Melema whose description he had carried round his neck as an
5009: index. No! nothing but Fra Luca’s death could remove all danger; but
5010: his death was highly probable, and after the momentary shock of the
5011: discovery, Tito let his mind fall back in repose on that confident
5012: hope.
5013: 
5014: They had sat in silence, and in a deepening twilight for many minutes,
5015: when Romola ventured to say—
5016: 
5017: “Shall I light the lamp, father, and shall we go on?”
5018: 
5019: “No, my Romola, we will work no more to-night. Tito, come and sit by me
5020: here.”
5021: 
5022: Tito moved from the reading-desk, and seated himself on the other side
5023: of Bardo, close to his left elbow.
5024: 
5025: “Come nearer to me, figliuola mia,” said Bardo again, after a moment’s
5026: pause. And Romola seated herself on a low stool and let her arm rest on
5027: her father’s right knee, that he might lay his hand on her hair, as he
5028: was fond of doing.
5029: 
5030: “Tito, I never told you that I had once a son,” said Bardo, forgetting
5031: what had fallen from him in the emotion raised by their first
5032: interview. The old man had been deeply shaken, and was forced to pour
5033: out his feelings in spite of pride. “But he left me—he is dead to me. I
5034: have disowned him for ever. He was a ready scholar as you are, but more
5035: fervid and impatient, and yet sometimes rapt and self-absorbed, like a
5036: flame fed by some fitful source; showing a disposition from the very
5037: first to turn away his eyes from the clear lights of reason and
5038: philosophy, and to prostrate himself under the influences of a dim
5039: mysticism which eludes all rules of human duty as it eludes all
5040: argument. And so it ended. We will speak no more of him: he is dead to
5041: me. I wish his face could be blotted from that world of memory in which
5042: the distant seems to grow clearer and the near to fade.”
5043: 
5044: Bardo paused, but neither Romola nor Tito dared to speak—his voice was
5045: too tremulous, the poise of his feelings too doubtful. But he presently
5046: raised his hand and found Tito’s shoulder to rest it on, while he went
5047: on speaking, with an effort to be calmer.
5048: 
5049: “But _you_ have come to me, Tito—not quite too late. I will lose no
5050: time in vain regret. When you are working by my side I seem to have
5051: found a son again.”
5052: 
5053: The old man, preoccupied with the governing interest of his life, was
5054: only thinking of the much-meditated book which had quite thrust into
5055: the background the suggestion, raised by Bernardo del Nero’s warning,
5056: of a possible marriage between Tito and Romola. But Tito could not
5057: allow the moment to pass unused.
5058: 
5059: “Will you let me be always and altogether your son? Will you let me
5060: take care of Romola—be her husband? I think she will not deny me. She
5061: has said she loves me. I know I am not equal to her in birth—in
5062: anything; but I am no longer a destitute stranger.”
5063: 
5064: “Is it true, my Romola?” said Bardo, in a lower tone, an evident
5065: vibration passing through him and dissipating the saddened aspect of
5066: his features.
5067: 
5068: “Yes, father,” said Romola, firmly. “I love Tito—I wish to marry him,
5069: that we may both be your children and never part.”
5070: 
5071: Tito’s hand met hers in a strong clasp for the first time, while she
5072: was speaking, but their eyes were fixed anxiously on her father.
5073: 
5074: “Why should it not be?” said Bardo, as if arguing against any
5075: opposition to his assent, rather than assenting. “It would be a
5076: happiness to me; and thou, too, Romola, wouldst be the happier for it.”
5077: 
5078: He stroked her long hair gently and bent towards her.
5079: 
5080: “Ah, I have been apt to forget that thou needest some other love than
5081: mine. And thou wilt be a noble wife. Bernardo thinks I shall hardly
5082: find a husband fitting for thee. And he is perhaps right. For thou art
5083: not like the herd of thy sex: thou art such a woman as the immortal
5084: poets had a vision of when they sang the lives of the heroes—tender but
5085: strong, like thy voice, which has been to me instead of the light in
5086: the years of my blindness... And so thou lovest him?”
5087: 
5088: He sat upright again for a minute, and then said, in the same tone as
5089: before, “Why should it not be? I will think of it; I will talk with
5090: Bernardo.”
5091: 
5092: Tito felt a disagreeable chill at this answer, for Bernardo del Nero’s
5093: eyes had retained their keen suspicion whenever they looked at him, and
5094: the uneasy remembrance of Fra Luca converted all uncertainty into fear.
5095: 
5096: “Speak for me, Romola,” he said, pleadingly. “Messer Bernardo is sure
5097: to be against me.”
5098: 
5099: “No, Tito,” said Romola, “my godfather will not oppose what my father
5100: firmly wills. And it is your will that I should marry Tito—is it not
5101: true, father? Nothing has ever come to me before that I have wished for
5102: strongly: I did not think it possible that I could care so much for
5103: anything that could happen to myself.”
5104: 
5105: It was a brief and simple plea; but it was the condensed story of
5106: Romola’s self-repressing colourless young life, which had thrown all
5107: its passion into sympathy with aged sorrows, aged ambition, aged pride
5108: and indignation. It had never occurred to Romola that she should not
5109: speak as directly and emphatically of her love for Tito as of any other
5110: subject.
5111: 
5112: “Romola mia!” said her father fondly, pausing on the words, “it is true
5113: thou hast never urged on me any wishes of thy own. And I have no will
5114: to resist thine; rather, my heart met Tito’s entreaty at its very first
5115: utterance. Nevertheless, I must talk with Bernardo about the measures
5116: needful to be observed. For we must not act in haste, or do anything
5117: unbeseeming my name. I am poor, and held of little account by the
5118: wealthy of our family—nay, I may consider myself a lonely man—but I
5119: must nevertheless remember that generous birth has its obligations. And
5120: I would not be reproached by my fellow-citizens for rash haste in
5121: bestowing my daughter. Bartolommeo Scala gave his Alessandra to the
5122: Greek Marullo, but Marullo’s lineage was well-known, and Scala himself
5123: is of no extraction. I know Bernardo will hold that we must take time:
5124: he will, perhaps, reproach me with want of due forethought. Be patient,
5125: my children: you are very young.”
5126: 
5127: No more could be said, and Romola’s heart was perfectly satisfied. Not
5128: so Tito’s. If the subtle mixture of good and evil prepares suffering
5129: for human truth and purity, there is also suffering prepared for the
5130: wrong-doer by the same mingled conditions. As Tito kissed Romola on
5131: their parting that evening, the very strength of the thrill that moved
5132: his whole being at the sense that this woman, whose beauty it was
5133: hardly possible to think of as anything but the necessary consequence
5134: of her noble nature, loved him with all the tenderness that spoke in
5135: her clear eyes, brought a strong reaction of regret that he had not
5136: kept himself free from that first deceit which had dragged him into the
5137: danger of being disgraced before her. There was a spring of bitterness
5138: mingling with that fountain of sweets. Would the death of Fra Luca
5139: arrest it? He hoped it would.
5140: 
5141: 
5142: 
5143: 
5144: CHAPTER XIII.
5145: The Shadow of Nemesis.
5146: 
5147: 
5148: It was the lazy afternoon time on the seventh of September, more than
5149: two months after the day on which Romola and Tito had confessed their
5150: love to each other.
5151: 
5152: Tito, just descended into Nello’s shop, had found the barber stretched
5153: on the bench with his cap over his eyes; one leg was drawn up, and the
5154: other had slipped towards the ground, having apparently carried with it
5155: a manuscript volume of verse, which lay with its leaves crushed. In a
5156: corner sat Sandro, playing a game at _mora_ by himself, and watching
5157: the slow reply of his left fingers to the arithmetical demands of his
5158: right with solemn-eyed interest.
5159: 
5160: Treading with the gentlest step, Tito snatched up the lute, and bending
5161: over the barber, touched the strings lightly while he sang—
5162: 
5163: “Quant’ è bella giovinezza,
5164: Che si fugge tuttavia!
5165: Chi vuol esser lieto sia,
5166: Di doman non c’è certezza.”[1]
5167: 
5168: 
5169:  [1] “Beauteous is life in blossom!
5170: And it fleeteth—fleeteth ever;
5171: Whoso would be joyful—let him!
5172: There’s no surety for the morrow.”
5173: 
5174: _Carnival Song by Lorenzo de’ Medici_.
5175: 
5176: 
5177: Nello was as easily awaked as a bird. The cap was off his eyes in an
5178: instant, and he started up.
5179: 
5180: “Ah, my Apollino! I am somewhat late with my siesta on this hot day, it
5181: seems. That comes of not going to sleep in the natural way, but taking
5182: a potion of potent poesy. Hear you, how I am beginning to match my
5183: words by the initial letter, like a Trovatore? That is one of my bad
5184: symptoms: I am sorely afraid that the good wine of my understanding is
5185: going to run off at the spigot of authorship, and I shall be left an
5186: empty cask with an odour of dregs, like many another incomparable
5187: genius of my acquaintance. What is it, my Orpheus?” here Nello
5188: stretched out his arms to their full length, and then brought them
5189: round till his hands grasped Tito’s curls, and drew them out playfully.
5190: “What is it you want of your well-tamed Nello? For I perceive a coaxing
5191: sound in that soft strain of yours. Let me see the very needle’s eye of
5192: your desire, as the sublime poet says, that I may thread it.”
5193: 
5194: “That is but a tailor’s image of your sublime poet’s,” said Tito, still
5195: letting his fingers fall in a light dropping way on the strings. “But
5196: you have divined the reason of my affectionate impatience to see your
5197: eyes open. I want you to give me an extra touch of your art—not on my
5198: chin, no; but on the zazzera, which is as tangled as your Florentine
5199: politics. You have an adroit way of inserting your comb, which flatters
5200: the skin, and stirs the animal spirits agreeably in that region; and a
5201: little of your most delicate orange-scent would not lie amiss, for I am
5202: bound to the Scala palace, and am to present myself in radiant company.
5203: The young cardinal Giovanni de’ Medici is to be there, and he brings
5204: with him a certain young Bernardo Dovizi of Bibbiena, whose wit is so
5205: rapid that I see no way of out-rivalling it save by the scent of
5206: orange-blossoms.”
5207: 
5208: Nello had already seized and flourished his comb, and pushed Tito
5209: gently backward into the chair, wrapping the cloth round him.
5210: 
5211: “Never talk of rivalry, bel giovane mio: Bernardo Dovizi is a keen
5212: youngster, who will never carry a net out to catch the wind; but he has
5213: something of the same sharp-muzzled look as his brother Ser Piero, the
5214: weasel that Piero de’ Medici keeps at his beck to slip through small
5215: holes for him. No! you distance all rivals, and may soon touch the sky
5216: with your forefinger. They tell me you have even carried enough honey
5217: with you to sweeten the sour Messer Angelo; for he has pronounced you
5218: less of an ass than might have been expected, considering there is such
5219: a good understanding between you and the Secretary.”
5220: 
5221: “And between ourselves, Nello mio, that Messer Angelo has more genius
5222: and erudition than I can find in all the other Florentine scholars put
5223: together. It may answer very well for them to cry me up now, when
5224: Poliziano is beaten down with grief, or illness, or something else; I
5225: can try a flight with such a sparrow-hawk as Pietro Crinito, but for
5226: Poliziano, he is a large-beaked eagle who would swallow me, feathers
5227: and all, and not feel any difference.”
5228: 
5229: “I will not contradict your modesty there, if you will have it so; but
5230: you don’t expect us clever Florentines to keep saying the same things
5231: over again every day of our lives, as we must do if we always told the
5232: truth. We cry down Dante, and we cry up Francesco Cei, just for the
5233: sake of variety; and if we cry you up as a new Poliziano, heaven has
5234: taken care that it shall not be quite so great a lie as it might have
5235: been. And are you not a pattern of virtue in this wicked city? with
5236: your ears double-waxed against all siren invitations that would lure
5237: you from the Via de’ Bardi, and the great work which is to astonish
5238: posterity?”
5239: 
5240: “Posterity in good truth, whom it will probably astonish as the
5241: universe does, by the impossibility of seeing what was the plan of it.”
5242: 
5243: “Yes, something like that was being prophesied here the other day.
5244: Cristoforo Landino said that the excellent Bardo was one of those
5245: scholars who lie overthrown in their learning, like cavaliers in heavy
5246: armour, and then get angry because they are over-ridden—which pithy
5247: remark, it seems to me, was not a herb out of his own garden; for of
5248: all men, for feeding one with an empty spoon and gagging one with vain
5249: expectation by long discourse, Messer Cristoforo is the pearl. Ecco!
5250: you are perfect now.” Here Nello drew away the cloth. “Impossible to
5251: add a grace more! But love is not always to be fed on learning, eh? I
5252: shall have to dress the zazzera for the betrothal before long—is it not
5253: true?”
5254: 
5255: “Perhaps,” said Tito, smiling, “unless Messer Bernardo should next
5256: recommend Bardo to require that I should yoke a lion and a wild boar to
5257: the car of the Zecca before I can win my Alcestis. But I confess he is
5258: right in holding me unworthy of Romola; she is a Pleiad that may grow
5259: dim by marrying any mortal.”
5260: 
5261: “_Gnaffè_, your modesty is in the right place there. Yet fate seems to
5262: have measured and chiselled you for the niche that was left empty by
5263: the old man’s son, who, by the way, Cronaca was telling me, is now at
5264: San Marco. Did you know?”
5265: 
5266: A slight electric shock passed through Tito as he rose from the chair,
5267: but it was not outwardly perceptible, for he immediately stooped to
5268: pick up the fallen book, and busied his fingers with flattening the
5269: leaves, while he said—
5270: 
5271: “No; he was at Fiesole, I thought. Are you sure he is come back to San
5272: Marco?”
5273: 
5274: “Cronaca is my authority,” said Nello, with a shrug. “I don’t frequent
5275: that sanctuary, but he does. Ah,” he added, taking the book from Tito’s
5276: hands, “my poor Nencia da Barberino! It jars your scholarly feelings to
5277: see the pages dog’s-eared. I was lulled to sleep by the well-rhymed
5278: charms of that rustic maiden—‘prettier than the turnip-flower,’ ‘with a
5279: cheek more savoury than cheese.’ But to get such a well-scented notion
5280: of the contadina, one must lie on velvet cushions in the Via Larga—not
5281: go to look at the Fierucoloni stumping in to the Piazza della Nunziata
5282: this evening after sundown.”
5283: 
5284: “And pray who are the Fierucoloni?” said Tito, indifferently, settling
5285: his cap.
5286: 
5287: “The contadine who came from the mountains of Pistoia, and the
5288: Casentino, and heaven knows where, to keep their vigil in the church of
5289: the Nunziata, and sell their yarn and dried mushrooms at the Fierucola
5290: (the little Fair), as we call it. They make a queer show, with their
5291: paper lanterns, howling their hymns to the Virgin on this eve of her
5292: nativity—if you had the leisure to see them. No?—well, I have had
5293: enough of it myself, for there is wild work in the Piazza. One may
5294: happen to get a stone or two about one’s ears or shins without asking
5295: for it, and I was never fond of that pressing attention. Addio.”
5296: 
5297: Tito carried a little uneasiness with him on his visit, which ended
5298: earlier than he had expected, the boy-cardinal Giovanni de’ Medici,
5299: youngest of red-hatted fathers, who has since presented his broad dark
5300: cheek very conspicuously to posterity as Pope Leo the Tenth, having
5301: been detained at his favourite pastime of the chase, and having failed
5302: to appear. It still wanted half an hour of sunset as he left the door
5303: of the Scala palace, with the intention of proceeding forthwith to the
5304: Via de’ Bardi; but he had not gone far when, to his astonishment, he
5305: saw Romola advancing towards him along the Borgo Pinti.
5306: 
5307: She wore a thick black veil and black mantle, but it was impossible to
5308: mistake her figure and her walk; and by her side was a short stout
5309: form, which he recognised as that of Monna Brigida, in spite of the
5310: unusual plainness of her attire. Romola had not been bred up to
5311: devotional observances, and the occasions on which she took the air
5312: elsewhere than under the loggia on the roof of the house, were so rare
5313: and so much dwelt on beforehand, because of Bardo’s dislike to be left
5314: without her, that Tito felt sure there must have been some sudden and
5315: urgent ground for an absence of which he had heard nothing the day
5316: before. She saw him through her veil and hastened her steps.
5317: 
5318: “Romola, has anything happened?” said Tito, turning to walk by her
5319: side.
5320: 
5321: She did not answer at the first moment, and Monna Brigida broke in.
5322: 
5323: “Ah, Messer Tito, you do well to turn round, for we are in haste. And
5324: is it not a misfortune?—we are obliged to go round by the walls and
5325: turn up the Via del Maglio, because of the Fair; for the contadine
5326: coming in block up the way by the Nunziata, which would have taken us
5327: to San Marco in half the time.”
5328: 
5329: Tito’s heart gave a great bound, and began to beat violently.
5330: 
5331: “Romola,” he said, in a lower tone, “are you going to San Marco?”
5332: 
5333: They were now out of the Borgo Pinti and were under the city walls,
5334: where they had wide gardens on their left-hand, and all was quiet.
5335: Romola put aside her veil for the sake of breathing the air, and he
5336: could see the subdued agitation in her face.
5337: 
5338: “Yes, Tito mio,” she said, looking directly at him with sad eyes. “For
5339: the first time I am doing something unknown to my father. It comforts
5340: me that I have met you, for at least I can tell _you_. But if you are
5341: going to him, it will be well for you not to say that you met me. He
5342: thinks I am only gone to my cousin, because she sent for me. I left my
5343: godfather with him: _he_ knows where I am going, and why. You remember
5344: that evening when my brother’s name was mentioned and my father spoke
5345: of him to you?”
5346: 
5347: “Yes,” said Tito, in a low tone. There was a strange complication in
5348: his mental state. His heart sank at the probability that a great change
5349: was coming over his prospects, while at the same time his thoughts were
5350: darting over a hundred details of the course he would take when the
5351: change had come; and yet he returned Romola’s gaze with a hungry sense
5352: that it might be the last time she would ever bend it on him with full
5353: unquestioning confidence.
5354: 
5355: “The _cugina_ had heard that he was come back, and the evening
5356: before—the evening of San Giovanni—as I afterwards found, he had been
5357: seen by our good Maso near the door of our house; but when Maso went to
5358: inquire at San Marco, Dino, that is, my brother—he was christened
5359: Bernardino, after our godfather, but now he calls himself Fra Luca—had
5360: been taken to the monastery at Fiesole, because he was ill. But this
5361: morning a message came to Maso, saying that he was come back to San
5362: Marco, and Maso went to him there. He is very ill, and he has adjured
5363: me to go and see him. I cannot refuse it, though I hold him guilty; I
5364: still remember how I loved him when I was a little girl, before I knew
5365: that he would forsake my father. And perhaps he has some word of
5366: penitence to send by me. It cost me a struggle to act in opposition to
5367: my father’s feeling, which I have always held to be just. I am almost
5368: sure you will think I have chosen rightly, Tito, because I have noticed
5369: that your nature is less rigid than mine, and nothing makes you angry:
5370: it would cost you less to be forgiving; though, if you had seen your
5371: father forsaken by one to whom he had given his chief love—by one in
5372: whom he had planted his labour and his hopes—forsaken when his need was
5373: becoming greatest—even you, Tito, would find it hard to forgive.”
5374: 
5375: What could he say? He was not equal to the hypocrisy of telling Romola
5376: that such offences ought not to be pardoned; and he had not the courage
5377: to utter any words of dissuasion.
5378: 
5379: “You are right, my Romola; you are always right, except in thinking too
5380: well of me.”
5381: 
5382: There was really some genuineness in those last words, and Tito looked
5383: very beautiful as he uttered them, with an unusual pallor in his face,
5384: and a slight quivering of his lip. Romola, interpreting all things
5385: largely, like a mind prepossessed with high beliefs, had a tearful
5386: brightness in her eyes as she looked at him, touched with keen joy that
5387: he felt so strongly whatever she felt. But without pausing in her walk,
5388: she said—
5389: 
5390: “And now, Tito, I wish you to leave me, for the _cugina_ and I shall be
5391: less noticed if we enter the piazza alone.”
5392: 
5393: “Yes, it were better you should leave us,” said Monna Brigida; “for to
5394: say the truth, Messer Tito, all eyes follow you, and let Romola muffle
5395: herself as she will, every one wants to see what there is under her
5396: veil, for she has that way of walking like a procession. Not that I
5397: find fault with her for it, only it doesn’t suit my steps. And, indeed,
5398: I would rather not have us seen going to San Marco, and that’s why I am
5399: dressed as if I were one of the Piagnoni themselves, and as old as
5400: Sant’ Anna; for if it had been anybody but poor Dino, who ought to be
5401: forgiven if he’s dying, for what’s the use of having a grudge against
5402: dead people?—make them feel while they live, say I—”
5403: 
5404: No one made a scruple of interrupting Monna Brigida, and Tito, having
5405: just raised Romola’s hand to his lips, and said, “I understand, I obey
5406: you,” now turned away, lifting his cap—a sign of reverence rarely made
5407: at that time by native Florentines, and which excited Bernardo del
5408: Nero’s contempt for Tito as a fawning Greek, while to Romola, who loved
5409: homage, it gave him an exceptional grace.
5410: 
5411: He was half glad of the dismissal, half disposed to cling to Romola to
5412: the last moment in which she would love him without suspicion. For it
5413: seemed to him certain that this brother would before all things want to
5414: know, and that Romola would before all things confide to him, what was
5415: her father’s position and her own after the years which must have
5416: brought so much change. She would tell him that she was soon to be
5417: publicly betrothed to a young scholar, who was to fill up the place
5418: left vacant long ago by a wandering son. He foresaw the impulse that
5419: would prompt Romola to dwell on that prospect, and what would follow on
5420: the mention of the future husband’s name. Fra Luca would tell all he
5421: knew and conjectured, and Tito saw no possible falsity by which he
5422: could now ward off the worst consequences of his former dissimulation.
5423: It was all over with his prospects in Florence. There was Messer
5424: Bernardo del Nero, who would be delighted at seeing confirmed the
5425: wisdom of his advice about deferring the betrothal until Tito’s
5426: character and position had been established by a longer residence; and
5427: the history of the young Greek professor, whose benefactor was in
5428: slavery, would be the talk under every loggia. For the first time in
5429: his life he felt too fevered and agitated to trust his power of
5430: self-command; he gave up his intended visit to Bardo, and walked up and
5431: down under the walls until the yellow light in the west had quite
5432: faded, when, without any distinct purpose, he took the first turning,
5433: which happened to be the Via San Sebastiano, leading him directly
5434: towards the Piazza dell’ Annunziata.
5435: 
5436: He was at one of those lawless moments which come to us all if we have
5437: no guide but desire, and if the pathway where desire leads us seems
5438: suddenly closed; he was ready to follow any beckoning that offered him
5439: an immediate purpose.
5440: 
5441: 
5442: 
5443: 
5444: CHAPTER XIV.
5445: The Peasants’ Fair.
5446: 
5447: 
5448: The moving crowd and the strange mixture of noises that burst on him at
5449: the entrance of the piazza, reminded Tito of what Nello had said to him
5450: about the Fierucoloni, and he pushed his way into the crowd with a sort
5451: of pleasure in the hooting and elbowing, which filled the empty
5452: moments, and dulled that calculation of the future which had so new a
5453: dreariness for him, as he foresaw himself wandering away solitary in
5454: pursuit of some unknown fortune, that his thought had even glanced
5455: towards going in search of Baldassarre after all.
5456: 
5457: At each of the opposite inlets he saw people struggling into the
5458: piazza, while above them paper lanterns, held aloft on sticks, were
5459: waving uncertainly to and fro. A rude monotonous chant made a
5460: distinctly traceable strand of noise, across which screams, whistles,
5461: gibing chants in piping boyish voices, the beating of drums, and the
5462: ringing of little bells, met each other in confused din. Every now and
5463: then one of the dim floating lights disappeared with a smash from a
5464: stone launched more or less vaguely in pursuit of mischief, followed by
5465: a scream and renewed shouts. But on the outskirts of the whirling
5466: tumult there were groups who were keeping this vigil of the Nativity of
5467: the Virgin in a more methodical manner than by fitful stone-throwing
5468: and gibing. Certain ragged men, darting a hard sharp glance around them
5469: while their tongues rattled merrily, were inviting country people to
5470: game with them on fair and open-handed terms; two masquerading figures
5471: on stilts, who had snatched lanterns from the crowd, were swaying the
5472: lights to and fro in meteoric fashion, as they strode hither and
5473: thither; a sage trader was doing a profitable business at a small
5474: covered stall, in hot _berlingozzi_, a favourite farinaceous delicacy;
5475: one man standing on a barrel, with his back firmly planted against a
5476: pillar of the loggia in front of the Foundling Hospital (Spedale degl’
5477: Innocenti), was selling efficacious pills, invented by a doctor of
5478: Salerno, warranted to prevent toothache and death by drowning; and not
5479: far off, against another pillar, a tumbler was showing off his tricks
5480: on a small platform; while a handful of ’prentices, despising the slack
5481: entertainment of guerilla stone-throwing, were having a private
5482: concentrated match of that favourite Florentine sport at the narrow
5483: entrance of the Via de’ Febbrai.
5484: 
5485: Tito, obliged to make his way through chance openings in the crowd,
5486: found himself at one moment close to the trotting procession of
5487: barefooted, hard-heeled contadine, and could see their sun-dried,
5488: bronzed faces, and their strange, fragmentary garb, dim with hereditary
5489: dirt, and of obsolete stuffs and fashions, that made them look, in the
5490: eyes of the city people, like a way-worn ancestry returning from a
5491: pilgrimage on which they had set out a century ago. Just then it was
5492: the hardy, scant-feeding peasant-women from the mountains of Pistoia,
5493: who were entering with a year’s labour in a moderate bundle of yarn on
5494: their backs, and in their hearts that meagre hope of good and that wide
5495: dim fear of harm, which were somehow to be cared for by the Blessed
5496: Virgin, whose miraculous image, painted by the angels, was to have the
5497: curtain drawn away from it on this Eve of her Nativity, that its
5498: potency might stream forth without obstruction.
5499: 
5500: At another moment he was forced away towards the boundary of the
5501: piazza, where the more stationary candidates for attention and small
5502: coin had judiciously placed themselves, in order to be safe in their
5503: rear. Among these Tito recognised his acquaintance Bratti, who stood
5504: with his back against a pillar, and his mouth pursed up in disdainful
5505: silence, eyeing every one who approached him with a cold glance of
5506: superiority, and keeping his hand fast on a serge covering which
5507: concealed the contents of the basket slung before him. Rather surprised
5508: at a deportment so unusual in an anxious trader, Tito went nearer and
5509: saw two women go up to Bratti’s basket with a look of curiosity,
5510: whereupon the pedlar drew the covering tighter, and looked another way.
5511: It was quite too provoking, and one of the women was fain to ask what
5512: there was in his basket?
5513: 
5514: “Before I answer that, Monna, I must know whether you mean to buy. I
5515: can’t show such wares as mine in this fair for every fly to settle on
5516: and pay nothing. My goods are a little too choice for that. Besides,
5517: I’ve only two left, and I’ve no mind to soil them; for with the chances
5518: of the pestilence that wise men talk of, there is likelihood of their
5519: being worth their weight in gold. No, no: _andate con Dio_.”
5520: 
5521: The two women looked at each other.
5522: 
5523: “And what may be the price?” said the second.
5524: 
5525: “Not within what you are likely to have in your purse, buona donna,”
5526: said Bratti, in a compassionately supercilious tone. “I recommend you
5527: to trust in Messer Domeneddio and the saints: poor people can do no
5528: better for themselves.”
5529: 
5530: “Not so poor!” said the second woman, indignantly, drawing out her
5531: money-bag. “Come, now! what do you say to a grosso?”
5532: 
5533: “I say you may get twenty-one quattrini for it,” said Bratti, coolly;
5534: “but not of me, for I haven’t got that small change.”
5535: 
5536: “Come; two, then?” said the woman, getting exasperated, while her
5537: companion looked at her with some envy. “It will hardly be above two, I
5538: think.”
5539: 
5540: After further bidding, and further mercantile coquetry, Bratti put on
5541: an air of concession.
5542: 
5543: “Since you’ve set your mind on it,” he said, slowly raising the cover,
5544: “I should be loth to do you a mischief; for Maestro Gabbadeo used to
5545: say, when a woman sets her mind on a thing and doesn’t get it, she’s in
5546: worse danger of the pestilence than before. Ecco! I have but two left;
5547: and let me tell you, the fellow to them is on the finger of Maestro
5548: Gabbadeo, who is gone to Bologna—as wise a doctor as sits at any door.”
5549: 
5550: The precious objects were two clumsy iron rings, beaten into the
5551: fashion of old Roman rings, such as were sometimes disinterred. The
5552: rust on them, and the entirely hidden character of their potency, were
5553: so satisfactory, that the grossi were paid without grumbling, and the
5554: first woman, destitute of those handsome coins, succeeded after much
5555: show of reluctance on Bratti’s part in driving a bargain with some of
5556: her yarn, and carried off the remaining ring in triumph. Bratti covered
5557: up his basket, which was now filled with miscellanies, probably
5558: obtained under the same sort of circumstances as the yarn, and, moving
5559: from his pillar, came suddenly upon Tito, who, if he had had time,
5560: would have chosen to avoid recognition.
5561: 
5562: “By the head of San Giovanni, now,” said Bratti, drawing Tito back to
5563: the pillar, “this is a piece of luck. For I was talking of you this
5564: morning, Messer Greco; but, I said, he is mounted up among the signori
5565: now—and I’m glad of it, for I was at the bottom of his fortune—but I
5566: can rarely get speech of him, for he’s not to be caught lying on the
5567: stones now—not he! But it’s your luck, not mine, Messer Greco, save and
5568: except some small trifle to satisfy me for my trouble in the
5569: transaction.”
5570: 
5571: “You speak in riddles, Bratti,” said Tito. “Remember, I don’t sharpen
5572: my wits, as you do, by driving hard bargains for iron rings: you must
5573: be plain.”
5574: 
5575: “By the Holy ’Vangels! it was an easy bargain I gave them. If a Hebrew
5576: gets thirty-two per cent, I hope a Christian may get a little more. If
5577: I had not borne a conscience, I should have got twice the money and
5578: twice the yarn. But, talking of rings, it is your ring—that very ring
5579: you’ve got on your finger—that I could get you a purchaser for; ay, and
5580: a purchaser with a deep money-bag.”
5581: 
5582: “Truly?” said Tito, looking at his ring and listening.
5583: 
5584: “A Genoese who is going straight away into Hungary, as I understand. He
5585: came and looked all over my shop to see if I had any old things I
5586: didn’t know the price of; I warrant you, he thought I had a pumpkin on
5587: my shoulders. He had been rummaging all the shops in Florence. And he
5588: had a ring on—not like yours, but something of the same fashion; and as
5589: he was talking of rings, I said I knew a fine young man, a particular
5590: acquaintance of mine, who had a ring of that sort. And he said, ‘Who is
5591: he, pray? Tell him I’ll give him his price for it.’ And I thought of
5592: going after you to Nello’s to-morrow; for it’s my opinion of you,
5593: Messer Greco, that you’re not one who’d see the Arno run broth, and
5594: stand by without dipping your finger.”
5595: 
5596: Tito had lost no word of what Bratti had said, yet his mind had been
5597: very busy all the while. Why should he keep the ring? It had been a
5598: mere sentiment, a mere fancy, that had prevented him from selling it
5599: with the other gems; if he had been wiser and had sold it, he might
5600: perhaps have escaped that identification by Fra Luca. It was true that
5601: it had been taken from Baldassarre’s finger and put on his own as soon
5602: as his young hand had grown to the needful size; but there was really
5603: no valid good to anybody in those superstitious scruples about
5604: inanimate objects. The ring had helped towards the recognition of him.
5605: Tito had begun to dislike recognition, which was a claim from the past.
5606: This foreigner’s offer, if he would really give a good price, was an
5607: opportunity for getting rid of the ring without the trouble of seeking
5608: a purchaser.
5609: 
5610: “You speak with your usual wisdom, Bratti,” said Tito. “I have no
5611: objection to hear what your Genoese will offer. But when and where
5612: shall I have speech of him?”
5613: 
5614: “To-morrow, at three hours after sunrise, he will be at my shop, and if
5615: your wits are of that sharpness I have always taken them to be, Messer
5616: Greco, you will ask him a heavy price; for he minds not money. It’s my
5617: belief he’s buying for somebody else, and not for himself—perhaps for
5618: some great signor.”
5619: 
5620: “It is well,” said Tito. “I will be at your shop, if nothing hinders.”
5621: 
5622: “And you will doubtless deal nobly by me for old acquaintance’ sake,
5623: Messer Greco, so I will not stay to fix the small sum you will give me
5624: in token of my service in the matter. It seems to me a thousand years
5625: now till I get out of the piazza, for a fair is a dull, not to say a
5626: wicked thing, when one has no more goods to sell.”
5627: 
5628: Tito made a hasty sign of assent and adieu, and moving away from the
5629: pillar, again found himself pushed towards the middle of the piazza and
5630: back again, without the power of determining his own course. In this
5631: zigzag way he was carried along to the end of the piazza opposite the
5632: church, where, in a deep recess formed by an irregularity in the line
5633: of houses, an entertainment was going forward which seemed to be
5634: especially attractive to the crowd. Loud bursts of laughter interrupted
5635: a monologue which was sometimes slow and oratorical, at others rattling
5636: and buffoonish. Here a girl was being pushed forward into the inner
5637: circle with apparent reluctance, and there a loud laughing minx was
5638: finding a way with her own elbows. It was a strange light that was
5639: spread over the piazza. There were the pale stars breaking out above,
5640: and the dim waving lanterns below, leaving all objects indistinct
5641: except when they were seen close under the fitfully moving lights; but
5642: in this recess there was a stronger light, against which the heads of
5643: the encircling spectators stood in dark relief as Tito was gradually
5644: pushed towards them, while above them rose the head of a man wearing a
5645: white mitre with yellow cabalistic figures upon it.
5646: 
5647: “Behold, my children!” Tito heard him saying, “behold your opportunity!
5648: neglect not the holy sacrament of matrimony when it can be had for the
5649: small sum of a white quattrino—the cheapest matrimony ever offered, and
5650: dissolved by special bull beforehand at every man’s own will and
5651: pleasure. Behold the bull!” Here the speaker held up a piece of
5652: parchment with huge seals attached to it. “Behold the indulgence
5653: granted by his Holiness Alexander the Sixth, who, being newly elected
5654: Pope for his peculiar piety, intends to reform and purify the Church,
5655: and wisely begins by abolishing that priestly abuse which keeps too
5656: large a share of this privileged matrimony to the clergy and stints the
5657: laity. Spit once, my sons, and pay a white quattrino! This is the whole
5658: and sole price of the indulgence. The quattrino is the only difference
5659: the Holy Father allows to be put any longer between us and the
5660: clergy—who spit and pay nothing.”
5661: 
5662: Tito thought he knew the voice, which had a peculiarly sharp ring, but
5663: the face was too much in shadow from the lights behind for him to be
5664: sure of the features. Stepping as near as he could, he saw within the
5665: circle behind the speaker an altar-like table raised on a small
5666: platform, and covered with a red drapery stitched all over with yellow
5667: cabalistical figures. Half-a-dozen thin tapers burned at the back of
5668: this table, which had a conjuring apparatus scattered over it, a large
5669: open book in the centre, and at one of the front angles a monkey
5670: fastened by a cord to a small ring and holding a small taper, which in
5671: his incessant fidgety movements fell more or less aslant, whilst an
5672: impish boy in a white surplice occupied himself chiefly in cuffing the
5673: monkey, and adjusting the taper. The man in the mitre also wore a
5674: surplice, and over it a chasuble on which the signs of the zodiac were
5675: rudely marked in black upon a yellow ground. Tito was sure now that he
5676: recognised the sharp upward-tending angles of the face under the mitre:
5677: it was that of Maestro Vaiano, the mountebank, from whom he had rescued
5678: Tessa. Pretty little Tessa! Perhaps she too had come in among the
5679: troops of contadine.
5680: 
5681: “Come, my maidens! This is the time for the pretty who can have many
5682: chances, and for the ill-favoured who have few. Matrimony to be
5683: had—hot, eaten, and done with as easily as _berlingozzi_! And see!”
5684: here the conjuror held up a cluster of tiny bags. “To every bride I
5685: give a _Breve_ with a secret in it—the secret alone worth the money you
5686: pay for the matrimony. The secret how to—no, no, I will not tell you
5687: what the secret is about, and that makes it a double secret. Hang it
5688: round your neck if you like, and never look at it; I don’t say _that_
5689: will not be the best, for then you will see many things you don’t
5690: expect: though if you open it you may break your leg, _è vero_, but you
5691: will know a secret! Something nobody knows but me! And mark—I give you
5692: the _Breve_, I don’t sell it, as many another holy man would: the
5693: quattrino is for the matrimony, and the _Breve_ you get for nothing.
5694: _Orsù, giovanetti_, come like dutiful sons of the Church and buy the
5695: Indulgence of his Holiness Alexander the Sixth.”
5696: 
5697: This buffoonery just fitted the taste of the audience; the _fierucola_
5698: was but a small occasion, so the townsmen might be contented with jokes
5699: that were rather less indecent than those they were accustomed to hear
5700: at every carnival, put into easy rhyme by the Magnifico and his poetic
5701: satellites; while the women, over and above any relish of the fun,
5702: really began to have an itch for the _Brevi_. Several couples had
5703: already gone through the ceremony, in which the conjuror’s solemn
5704: gibberish and grimaces over the open book, the antics of the monkey,
5705: and even the preliminary spitting, had called forth peals of laughter;
5706: and now a well-looking, merry-eyed youth of seventeen, in a loose tunic
5707: and red cap, pushed forward, holding by the hand a plump brunette,
5708: whose scanty ragged dress displayed her round arms and legs very
5709: picturesquely.
5710: 
5711: “Fetter us without delay, Maestro!” said the youth, “for I have got to
5712: take my bride home and paint her under the light of a lantern.”
5713: 
5714: “Ha! Mariotto, my son, I commend your pious observance...” The conjuror
5715: was going on, when a loud chattering behind warned him that an
5716: unpleasant crisis had arisen with his monkey.
5717: 
5718: The temper of that imperfect acolyth was a little tried by the
5719: over-active discipline of his colleague in the surplice, and a sudden
5720: cuff administered as his taper fell to a horizontal position, caused
5721: him to leap back with a violence that proved too much for the slackened
5722: knot by which his cord was fastened. His first leap was to the other
5723: end of the table, from which position his remonstrances were so
5724: threatening that the imp in the surplice took up a wand by way of an
5725: equivalent threat, whereupon the monkey leaped on to the head of a tall
5726: woman in the foreground, dropping his taper by the way, and chattering
5727: with increased emphasis from that eminence. Great was the screaming and
5728: confusion, not a few of the spectators having a vague dread of the
5729: Maestro’s monkey, as capable of more hidden mischief than mere teeth
5730: and claws could inflict; and the conjuror himself was in some alarm
5731: lest any harm should happen to his familiar. In the scuffle to seize
5732: the monkey’s string, Tito got out of the circle, and, not caring to
5733: contend for his place again, he allowed himself to be gradually pushed
5734: towards the church of the Nunziata, and to enter amongst the
5735: worshippers.
5736: 
5737: The brilliant illumination within seemed to press upon his eyes with
5738: palpable force after the pale scattered lights and broad shadows of the
5739: piazza, and for the first minute or two he could see nothing
5740: distinctly. That yellow splendour was in itself something supernatural
5741: and heavenly to many of the peasant-women, for whom half the sky was
5742: hidden by mountains, and who went to bed in the twilight; and the
5743: uninterrupted chant from the choir was repose to the ear after the
5744: hellish hubbub of the crowd outside. Gradually the scene became
5745: clearer, though still there was a thin yellow haze from incense
5746: mingling with the breath of the multitude. In a chapel on the left-hand
5747: of the nave, wreathed with silver lamps, was seen unveiled the
5748: miraculous fresco of the Annunciation, which, in Tito’s oblique view of
5749: it from the right-hand side of the nave, seemed dark with the excess of
5750: light around it. The whole area of the great church was filled with
5751: peasant-women, some kneeling, some standing; the coarse bronzed skins,
5752: and the dingy clothing of the rougher dwellers on the mountains,
5753: contrasting with the softer-lined faces and white or red head-drapery
5754: of the well-to-do dwellers in the valley, who were scattered in
5755: irregular groups. And spreading high and far over the walls and ceiling
5756: there was another multitude, also pressing close against each other,
5757: that they might be nearer the potent Virgin. It was the crowd of votive
5758: waxen images, the effigies of great personages, clothed in their habit
5759: as they lived: Florentines of high name in their black silk lucco, as
5760: when they sat in council; popes, emperors, kings, cardinals, and famous
5761: condottieri with plumed morion seated on their chargers; all notable
5762: strangers who passed through Florence or had aught to do with its
5763: affairs—Mohammedans, even, in well-tolerated companionship with
5764: Christian cavaliers; some of them with faces blackened and robes
5765: tattered by the corroding breath of centuries, others fresh and bright
5766: in new red mantle or steel corselet, the exact doubles of the living.
5767: And wedged in with all these were detached arms, legs, and other
5768: members, with only here and there a gap where some image had been
5769: removed for public disgrace, or had fallen ominously, as Lorenzo’s had
5770: done six months before. It was a perfect resurrection-swarm of remote
5771: mortals and fragments of mortals, reflecting, in their varying degrees
5772: of freshness, the sombre dinginess and sprinkled brightness of the
5773: crowd below.
5774: 
5775: Tito’s glance wandered over the wild multitude in search of something.
5776: He had already thought of Tessa, and the white hoods suggested the
5777: possibility that he might detect her face under one of them. It was at
5778: least a thought to be courted, rather than the vision of Romola looking
5779: at him with changed eyes. But he searched in vain; and he was leaving
5780: the church, weary of a scene which had no variety, when, just against
5781: the doorway, he caught sight of Tessa, only two yards off him. She was
5782: kneeling with her back against the wall, behind a group of
5783: peasant-women, who were standing and looking for a spot nearer to the
5784: sacred image. Her head hung a little aside with a look of weariness,
5785: and her blue eyes were directed rather absently towards an altar-piece
5786: where the Archangel Michael stood in his armour, with young face and
5787: floating hair, amongst bearded and tonsured saints. Her right-hand,
5788: holding a bunch of cocoons, fell by her side listlessly, and her round
5789: cheek was paled, either by the light or by the weariness that was
5790: expressed in her attitude: her lips were pressed poutingly together,
5791: and every now and then her eyelids half fell: she was a large image of
5792: a sweet sleepy child. Tito felt an irresistible desire to go up to her
5793: and get her pretty trusting looks and prattle: this creature who was
5794: without moral judgment that could condemn him, whose little loving
5795: ignorant soul made a world apart, where he might feel in freedom from
5796: suspicions and exacting demands, had a new attraction for him now. She
5797: seemed a refuge from the threatened isolation that would come with
5798: disgrace. He glanced cautiously round, to assure himself that Monna
5799: Ghita was not near, and then, slipping quietly to her side, kneeled on
5800: one knee, and said, in the softest voice, “Tessa!”
5801: 
5802: She hardly started, any more than she would have started at a soft
5803: breeze that fanned her gently when she was needing it. She turned her
5804: head and saw Tito’s face close to her: it was very much more beautiful
5805: than the Archangel Michael’s, who was so mighty and so good that he
5806: lived with the Madonna and all the saints and was prayed to along with
5807: them. She smiled in happy silence, for that nearness of Tito quite
5808: filled her mind.
5809: 
5810: “My little Tessa! you look very tired. How long have you been kneeling
5811: here?”
5812: 
5813: She seemed to be collecting her thoughts for a minute or two, and at
5814: last she said—
5815: 
5816: “I’m very hungry.”
5817: 
5818: “Come, then; come with me.”
5819: 
5820: He lifted her from her knees, and led her out under the cloisters
5821: surrounding the atrium, which were then open, and not yet adorned with
5822: the frescoes of Andrea del Sarto.
5823: 
5824: “How is it you are all by yourself, and so hungry, Tessa?”
5825: 
5826: “The Madre is ill; she has very bad pains in her legs, and sent me to
5827: bring these cocoons to the Santissima Nunziata, because they’re so
5828: wonderful; see!”—she held up the bunch of cocoons, which were arranged
5829: with fortuitous regularity on a stem,—“and she had kept them to bring
5830: them herself, but she couldn’t, and so she sent me because she thinks
5831: the Holy Madonna may take away her pains; and somebody took my bag with
5832: the bread and chestnuts in it, and the people pushed me back, and I was
5833: so frightened coming in the crowd, and I couldn’t get anywhere near the
5834: Holy Madonna, to give the cocoons to the Padre, but I must—oh, I must.”
5835: 
5836: “Yes, my little Tessa, you shall take them; but first come and let me
5837: give you some berlingozzi. There are some to be had not far off.”
5838: 
5839: “Where did you come from?” said Tessa, a little bewildered. “I thought
5840: you would never come to me again, because you never came to the Mercato
5841: for milk any more. I set myself Aves to say, to see if they would bring
5842: you back, but I left off, because they didn’t.”
5843: 
5844: “You see I come when you want some one to take care of you, Tessa.
5845: Perhaps the Aves fetched me, only it took them a long while. But what
5846: shall you do if you are here all alone? Where shall you go?”
5847: 
5848: “Oh, I shall stay and sleep in the church—a great many of them do—in
5849: the church and all about here—I did once when I came with my mother;
5850: and the _patrigno_ is coming with the mules in the morning.”
5851: 
5852: They were out in the piazza now, where the crowd was rather less
5853: riotous than before, and the lights were fewer, the stream of pilgrims
5854: having ceased. Tessa clung fast to Tito’s arm in satisfied silence,
5855: while he led her towards the stall where he remembered seeing the
5856: eatables. Their way was the easier because there was just now a great
5857: rush towards the middle of the piazza, where the masqued figures on
5858: stilts had found space to execute a dance. It was very pretty to see
5859: the guileless thing giving her cocoons into Tito’s hand, and then
5860: eating her berlingozzi with the relish of a hungry child. Tito had
5861: really come to take care of her, as he did before, and that wonderful
5862: happiness of being with him had begun again for her. Her hunger was
5863: soon appeased, all the sooner for the new stimulus of happiness that
5864: had roused her from her languor, and, as they turned away from the
5865: stall, she said nothing about going into the church again, but looked
5866: round as if the sights in the piazza were not without attraction to her
5867: now she was safe under Tito’s arm.
5868: 
5869: “How can they do that?” she exclaimed, looking up at the dancers on
5870: stilts. Then, after a minute’s silence, “Do you think Saint Christopher
5871: helps them?”
5872: 
5873: “Perhaps. What do you think about it, Tessa?” said Tito, slipping his
5874: right arm round her, and looking down at her fondly.
5875: 
5876: “Because Saint Christopher is so very tall; and he is very good: if
5877: anybody looks at him he takes care of them all day. He is on the wall
5878: of the church—too tall to stand up there—but I saw him walking through
5879: the streets one San Giovanni, carrying the little Gesu.”
5880: 
5881: “You pretty pigeon! Do you think anybody could help taking care of
5882: _you_, if you looked at them?”
5883: 
5884: “Shall you always come and take care of me?” said Tessa, turning her
5885: face up to him, as he crushed her cheek with his left-hand. “And shall
5886: you always be a long while first?”
5887: 
5888: Tito was conscious that some bystanders were laughing at them, and
5889: though the licence of street fun, among artists and young men of the
5890: wealthier sort as well as among the populace, made few adventures
5891: exceptional, still less disreputable, he chose to move away towards the
5892: end of the piazza.
5893: 
5894: “Perhaps I shall come again to you very soon, Tessa,” he answered,
5895: rather dreamily, when they had moved away. He was thinking that when
5896: all the rest had turned their backs upon him, it would be pleasant to
5897: have this little creature adoring him and nestling against him. The
5898: absence of presumptuous self-conceit in Tito made him feel all the more
5899: defenceless under prospective obloquy: he needed soft looks and
5900: caresses too much ever to be impudent.
5901: 
5902: “In the Mercato?” said Tessa. “Not to-morrow morning, because the
5903: _patrigno_ will be there, and he is so cross. Oh! but you have money,
5904: and he will not be cross if you buy some salad. And there are some
5905: chestnuts. Do you like chestnuts?”
5906: 
5907: He said nothing, but continued to look down at her with a dreamy
5908: gentleness, and Tessa felt herself in a state of delicious wonder;
5909: everything seemed as new as if she were being carried on a chariot of
5910: clouds.
5911: 
5912: “Holy Virgin!” she exclaimed again presently. “There is a holy father
5913: like the Bishop I saw at Prato.”
5914: 
5915: Tito looked up too, and saw that he had unconsciously advanced to
5916: within a few yards of the conjuror, Maestro Vaiano, who for the moment
5917: was forsaken by the crowd. His face was turned away from them, and he
5918: was occupied with the apparatus on his altar or table, preparing a new
5919: diversion by the time the interest in the dancing should be exhausted.
5920: The monkey was imprisoned under the red cloth, out of reach of
5921: mischief, and the youngster in the white surplice was holding a sort of
5922: dish or salver, from which his master was taking some ingredient. The
5923: altar-like table, with its gorgeous cloth, the row of tapers, the sham
5924: episcopal costume, the surpliced attendant, and even the movements of
5925: the mitred figure, as he alternately bent his head and then raised
5926: something before the lights, were a sufficiently near parody of sacred
5927: things to rouse poor little Tessa’s veneration; and there was some
5928: additional awe produced by the mystery of their apparition in this
5929: spot, for when she had seen an altar in the street before, it had been
5930: on Corpus Christi Day, and there had been a procession to account for
5931: it. She crossed herself and looked up at Tito, but then, as if she had
5932: had time for reflection, said, “It is because of the Nativita.”
5933: 
5934: Meanwhile Vaiano had turned round, raising his hands to his mitre with
5935: the intention of changing his dress, when his quick eye recognised Tito
5936: and Tessa who were both looking at him, their faces being shone upon by
5937: the light of his tapers, while his own was in shadow.
5938: 
5939: “Ha! my children!” he said, instantly, stretching out his hands in a
5940: benedictory attitude, “you are come to be married. I commend your
5941: penitence—the blessing of Holy Church can never come too late.”
5942: 
5943: But whilst he was speaking, he had taken in the whole meaning of
5944: Tessa’s attitude and expression, and he discerned an opportunity for a
5945: new kind of joke which required him to be cautious and solemn.
5946: 
5947: “Should you like to be married to me, Tessa?” said Tito, softly, half
5948: enjoying the comedy, as he saw the pretty childish seriousness on her
5949: face, half prompted by hazy previsions which belonged to the
5950: intoxication of despair.
5951: 
5952: He felt her vibrating before she looked up at him and said, timidly,
5953: “Will you let me?”
5954: 
5955: He answered only by a smile, and by leading her forward in front of the
5956: _cerretano_, who, seeing an excellent jest in Tessa’s evident delusion,
5957: assumed a surpassing sacerdotal solemnity, and went through the mimic
5958: ceremony with a liberal expenditure of _lingua furbesca_ or thieves’
5959: Latin. But some symptoms of a new movement in the crowd urged him to
5960: bring it to a speedy conclusion and dismiss them with hands
5961: outstretched in a benedictory attitude over their kneeling figures.
5962: Tito, disposed always to cultivate goodwill, though it might be the
5963: least select, put a piece of four grossi into his hand as he moved
5964: away, and was thanked by a look which, the conjuror felt sure, conveyed
5965: a perfect understanding of the whole affair.
5966: 
5967: But Tito himself was very far from that understanding, and did not, in
5968: fact, know whether, the next moment, he should tell Tessa of the joke
5969: and laugh at her for a little goose, or whether he should let her
5970: delusion last, and see what would come of it—see what she would say and
5971: do next.
5972: 
5973: “Then you will not go away from me again,” said Tessa, after they had
5974: walked a few steps, “and you will take me to where you live.” She spoke
5975: meditatively, and not in a questioning tone. But presently she added,
5976: “I must go back once to the Madre though, to tell her I brought the
5977: cocoons, and that I am married, and shall not go back again.”
5978: 
5979: Tito felt the necessity of speaking now; and in the rapid thought
5980: prompted by that necessity, he saw that by undeceiving Tessa he should
5981: be robbing himself of some at least of that pretty trustfulness which
5982: might, by-and-by, be his only haven from contempt. It would spoil Tessa
5983: to make her the least particle wiser or more suspicious.
5984: 
5985: “Yes, my little Tessa,” he said, caressingly, “you must go back to the
5986: Madre; but you must not tell her you are married—you must keep that a
5987: secret from everybody; else some very great harm would happen to me,
5988: and you would never see me again.”
5989: 
5990: She looked up at him with fear in her face.
5991: 
5992: “You must go back and feed your goats and mules, and do just as you
5993: have always done before, and say no word to any one about me.”
5994: 
5995: The corners of her mouth fell a little.
5996: 
5997: “And then, perhaps, I shall come and take care of you again when you
5998: want me, as I did before. But you must do just what I tell you, else
5999: you will not see me again.”
6000: 
6001: “Yes, I will, I will,” she said, in a loud whisper, frightened at that
6002: blank prospect.
6003: 
6004: They were silent a little while; and then Tessa, looking at her hand,
6005: said—
6006: 
6007: “The Madre wears a betrothal ring. She went to church and had it put
6008: on, and then after that, another day, she was married. And so did the
6009: cousin Nannina. But then _she_ married Gollo,” added the poor little
6010: thing, entangled in the difficult comparison between her own case and
6011: others within her experience.
6012: 
6013: “But you must not wear a betrothal ring, my Tessa, because no one must
6014: know you are married,” said Tito, feeling some insistence necessary.
6015: “And the _buona fortuna_ that I gave you did just as well for
6016: betrothal. Some people are betrothed with rings and some are not.”
6017: 
6018: “Yes, it is true, they would see the ring,” said Tessa, trying to
6019: convince herself that a thing she would like very much was really not
6020: good for her.
6021: 
6022: They were now near the entrance of the church again, and she remembered
6023: her cocoons which were still in Tito’s hand.
6024: 
6025: “Ah, you must give me the _boto_,” she said; “and we must go in, and I
6026: must take it to the Padre, and I must tell the rest of my beads,
6027: because I was too tired before.”
6028: 
6029: “Yes, you must go in, Tessa; but I will not go in. I must leave you
6030: now,” said Tito, too feverish and weary to re-enter that stifling heat,
6031: and feeling that this was the least difficult way of parting with her.
6032: 
6033: “And not come back? Oh, where do you go?” Tessa’s mind had never formed
6034: an image of his whereabout or his doings when she did not see him: he
6035: had vanished, and her thought, instead of following him, had stayed in
6036: the same spot where he was with her.
6037: 
6038: “I shall come back some time, Tessa,” said Tito, taking her under the
6039: cloisters to the door of the church. “You must not cry—you must go to
6040: sleep, when you have said your beads. And here is money to buy your
6041: breakfast. Now kiss me, and look happy, else I shall not come again.”
6042: 
6043: She made a great effort over herself as she put up her lips to kiss
6044: him, and submitted to be gently turned round, with her face towards the
6045: door of the church. Tito saw her enter; and then with a shrug at his
6046: own resolution, leaned against a pillar, took off his cap, rubbed his
6047: hair backward, and wondered where Romola was now, and what she was
6048: thinking of him. Poor little Tessa had disappeared behind the curtain
6049: among the crowd of peasants; but the love which formed one web with all
6050: his worldly hopes, with the ambitions and pleasures that must make the
6051: solid part of his days—the love that was identified with his larger
6052: self—was not to be banished from his consciousness. Even to the man who
6053: presents the most elastic resistance to whatever is unpleasant, there
6054: will come moments when the pressure from without is too strong for him,
6055: and he must feel the smart and the bruise in spite of himself. Such a
6056: moment had come to Tito. There was no possible attitude of mind, no
6057: scheme of action by which the uprooting of all his newly-planted hopes
6058: could be made otherwise than painful.
6059: 
6060: 
6061: 
6062: 
6063: CHAPTER XV.
6064: The Dying Message.
6065: 
6066: 
6067: When Romola arrived at the entrance of San Marco she found one of the
6068: Frati waiting there in expectation of her arrival. Monna Brigida
6069: retired into the adjoining church, and Romola was conducted to the door
6070: of the chapter-house in the outer cloister, whither the invalid had
6071: been conveyed; no woman being allowed admission beyond this precinct.
6072: 
6073: When the door opened, the subdued external light blending with that of
6074: two tapers placed behind a truckle-bed, showed the emaciated face of
6075: Fra Luca, with the tonsured crown of golden hair above it, and with
6076: deep-sunken hazel eyes fixed on a small crucifix which he held before
6077: him. He was propped up into nearly a sitting posture; and Romola was
6078: just conscious, as she threw aside her veil, that there was another
6079: monk standing by the bed, with the black cowl drawn over his head, and
6080: that he moved towards the door as she entered; just conscious that in
6081: the background there was a crucified form rising high and pale on the
6082: frescoed wall, and pale faces of sorrow looking out from it below.
6083: 
6084: The next moment her eyes met Fra Luca’s as they looked up at her from
6085: the crucifix, and she was absorbed in that pang of recognition which
6086: identified this monkish emaciated form with the image of her fair young
6087: brother.
6088: 
6089: “Dino!” she said, in a voice like a low cry of pain. But she did not
6090: bend towards him; she held herself erect, and paused at two yards’
6091: distance from him. There was an unconquerable repulsion for her in that
6092: monkish aspect; it seemed to her the brand of the dastardly
6093: undutifulness which had left her father desolate—of the grovelling
6094: superstition which could give such undutifulness the name of piety. Her
6095: father, whose proud sincerity and simplicity of life had made him one
6096: of the few frank pagans of his time, had brought her up with a silent
6097: ignoring of any claims the Church could have to regulate the belief and
6098: action of beings with a cultivated reason. The Church, in her mind,
6099: belonged to that actual life of the mixed multitude from which they had
6100: always lived apart, and she had no ideas that could render her
6101: brother’s course an object of any other feeling than incurious,
6102: indignant contempt. Yet the lovingness of Romola’s soul had clung to
6103: that image in the past, and while she stood rigidly aloof, there was a
6104: yearning search in her eyes for something too faintly discernible.
6105: 
6106: But there was no corresponding emotion in the face of the monk. He
6107: looked at the little sister returned to him in her full womanly beauty,
6108: with the far-off gaze of a revisiting spirit.
6109: 
6110: “My sister!” he said, with a feeble and interrupted but yet distinct
6111: utterance, “it is well thou hast not longer delayed to come, for I have
6112: a message to deliver to thee, and my time is short.”
6113: 
6114: Romola took a step nearer: the message, she thought, would be one of
6115: affectionate penitence to her father, and her heart began to open.
6116: Nothing could wipe out the long years of desertion; but the culprit,
6117: looking back on those years with the sense of irremediable wrong
6118: committed, would call forth pity. Now, at the last, there would be
6119: understanding and forgiveness. Dino would pour out some natural filial
6120: feeling; he would ask questions about his father’s blindness—how
6121: rapidly it had come on? how the long dark days had been filled? what
6122: the life was now in the home where he himself had been nourished?—and
6123: the last message from the dying lips would be one of tenderness and
6124: regret.
6125: 
6126: “Romola,” Fra Luca began, “I have had a vision concerning thee. Thrice
6127: I have had it in the last two months: each time it has been clearer.
6128: Therefore I came from Fiesole, deeming it a message from heaven that I
6129: was bound to deliver. And I gather a promise of mercy to thee in this,
6130: that my breath is preserved in order to—”
6131: 
6132: The difficult breathing which continually interrupted him would not let
6133: him finish the sentence.
6134: 
6135: Romola had felt her heart chilling again. It was a vision, then, this
6136: message—one of those visions she had so often heard her father allude
6137: to with bitterness. Her indignation rushed to her lips.
6138: 
6139: “Dino, I thought you had some words to send to my father. You forsook
6140: him when his sight was failing; you made his life very desolate. Have
6141: you never cared about that? never repented? What is this religion of
6142: yours, that places visions before natural duties?”
6143: 
6144: The deep-sunken hazel eyes turned slowly towards her, and rested upon
6145: her in silence for some moments, as if he were meditating whether he
6146: should answer her.
6147: 
6148: “No,” he said at last; speaking as before, in a low passionless tone,
6149: as of some spirit not human, speaking through dying human organs. “No;
6150: I have never repented fleeing from the stifling poison-breath of sin
6151: that was hot and thick around me, and threatened to steal over my
6152: senses like besotting wine. My father could not hear the voice that
6153: called me night and day; he knew nothing of the demon-tempters that
6154: tried to drag me back from following it. My father has lived amidst
6155: human sin and misery without believing in them: he has been like one
6156: busy picking shining stones in a mine, while there was a world dying of
6157: plague above him. I spoke, but he listened with scorn. I told him the
6158: studies he wished me to live for were either childish trifling—dead
6159: toys—or else they must be made warm and living by pulses that beat to
6160: worldly ambitions and fleshly lusts, for worldly ambitions and fleshly
6161: lusts made all the substance of the poetry and history he wanted me to
6162: bend my eyes on continually.”
6163: 
6164: “Has not my father led a pure and noble life, then?” Romola burst
6165: forth, unable to hear in silence this implied accusation against her
6166: father. “He has sought no worldly honours; he has been truthful; he has
6167: denied himself all luxuries; he has lived like one of the ancient
6168: sages. He never wished you to live for worldly ambitions and fleshly
6169: lusts; he wished you to live as he himself has done, according to the
6170: purest maxims of philosophy, in which he brought you up.”
6171: 
6172: Romola spoke partly by rote, as all ardent and sympathetic young
6173: creatures do; but she spoke with intense belief. The pink flush was in
6174: her face, and she quivered from head to foot. Her brother was again
6175: slow to answer; looking at her passionate face with strange passionless
6176: eyes.
6177: 
6178: “What were the maxims of philosophy to me? They told me to be strong,
6179: when I felt myself weak; when I was ready, like the blessed Saint
6180: Benedict, to roll myself among thorns, and court smarting wounds as a
6181: deliverance from temptation. For the Divine love had sought me, and
6182: penetrated me, and created a great need in me; like a seed that wants
6183: room to grow. I had been brought up in carelessness of the true faith;
6184: I had not studied the doctrines of our religion; but it seemed to take
6185: possession of me like a rising flood. I felt that there was a life of
6186: perfect love and purity for the soul; in which there would be no uneasy
6187: hunger after pleasure, no tormenting questions, no fear of suffering.
6188: Before I knew the history of the saints, I had a foreshadowing of their
6189: ecstasy. For the same truth had penetrated even into pagan philosophy:
6190: that it is a bliss within the reach of man to die to mortal needs, and
6191: live in the life of God as the Unseen Perfectness. But to attain that I
6192: must forsake the world: I must have no affection, no hope, wedding me
6193: to that which passeth away; I must live with my fellow-beings only as
6194: human souls related to the eternal unseen life. That need was urging me
6195: continually: it came over me in visions when my mind fell away weary
6196: from the vain words which record the passions of dead men: it came over
6197: me after I had been tempted into sin and had turned away with loathing
6198: from the scent of the emptied cup. And in visions I saw the meaning of
6199: the Crucifix.”
6200: 
6201: He paused, breathing hard for a minute or two: but Romola was not
6202: prompted to speak again. It was useless for her mind to attempt any
6203: contact with the mind of this unearthly brother: as useless as for her
6204: hand to try and grasp a shadow. When he spoke again his heaving chest
6205: was quieter.
6206: 
6207: “I felt whom I must follow: but I saw that even among the servants of
6208: the Cross who professed to have renounced the world, my soul would be
6209: stifled with the fumes of hypocrisy, and lust, and pride. God had not
6210: chosen me, as he chose Saint Dominic and Saint Francis, to wrestle with
6211: evil in the Church and in the world. He called upon me to flee: I took
6212: the sacred vows and I fled—fled to lands where danger and scorn and
6213: want bore me continually, like angels, to repose on the bosom of God. I
6214: have lived the life of a hermit, I have ministered to pilgrims; but my
6215: task has been short: the veil has worn very thin that divides me from
6216: my everlasting rest. I came back to Florence that—”
6217: 
6218: “Dino, you _did_ want to know if my father was alive,” interrupted
6219: Romola, the picture of that suffering life touching her again with the
6220: desire for union and forgiveness.
6221: 
6222: ”—That before I died I might urge others of our brethren to study the
6223: Eastern tongues, as I had not done, and go out to greater ends than I
6224: did; and I find them already bent on the work. And since I came,
6225: Romola, I have felt that I was sent partly to thee—not to renew the
6226: bonds of earthly affection, but to deliver the heavenly warning
6227: conveyed in a vision. For I have had that vision thrice. And through
6228: all the years since first the Divine voice called me, while I was yet
6229: in the world, I have been taught and guided by visions. For in the
6230: painful linking together of our waking thoughts we can never be sure
6231: that we have not mingled our own error with the light we have prayed
6232: for; but in visions and dreams we are passive, and our souls are as an
6233: instrument in the Divine hand. Therefore listen, and speak not
6234: again—for the time is short.”
6235: 
6236: Romola’s mind recoiled strongly from listening to this vision. Her
6237: indignation had subsided, but it was only because she had felt the
6238: distance between her brother and herself widening. But while Fra Luca
6239: was speaking, the figure of another monk had entered, and again stood
6240: on the other side of the bed, with the cowl drawn over his head.
6241: 
6242: “Kneel, my daughter, for the Angel of Death is present, and waits while
6243: the message of heaven is delivered: bend thy pride before it is bent
6244: for thee by a yoke of iron,” said a strong rich voice, startlingly in
6245: contrast with Fra Luca’s.
6246: 
6247: The tone was not that of imperious command, but of quiet
6248: self-possession and assurance of the right, blended with benignity.
6249: Romola, vibrating to the sound, looked round at the figure on the
6250: opposite side of the bed. His face was hardly discernible under the
6251: shadow of the cowl, and her eyes fell at once on his hands, which were
6252: folded across his breast and lay in relief on the edge of his black
6253: mantle. They had a marked physiognomy which enforced the influence of
6254: the voice: they were very beautiful and almost of transparent delicacy.
6255: Romola’s disposition to rebel against command, doubly active in the
6256: presence of monks, whom she had been taught to despise, would have
6257: fixed itself on any repulsive detail as a point of support. But the
6258: face was hidden, and the hands seemed to have an appeal in them against
6259: all hardness. The next moment the right-hand took the crucifix to
6260: relieve the fatigued grasp of Fra Luca, and the left touched his lips
6261: with a wet sponge which lay near. In the act of bending, the cowl was
6262: pushed back, and the features of the monk had the full light of the
6263: tapers on them. They were very marked features, such as lend themselves
6264: to popular description. There was the high arched nose, the prominent
6265: under-lip, the coronet of thick dark hair above the brow, all seeming
6266: to tell of energy and passion; there were the blue-grey eyes, shining
6267: mildly under auburn eyelashes, seeming, like the hands, to tell of
6268: acute sensitiveness. Romola felt certain they were the features of Fra
6269: Girolamo Savonarola, the prior of San Marco, whom she had chiefly
6270: thought of as more offensive than other monks, because he was more
6271: noisy. Her rebellion was rising against the first impression, which had
6272: almost forced her to bend her knees.
6273: 
6274: “Kneel, my daughter,” the penetrating voice said again, “the pride of
6275: the body is a barrier against the gifts that purify the soul.”
6276: 
6277: He was looking at her with mild fixedness while he spoke, and again she
6278: felt that subtle mysterious influence of a personality by which it has
6279: been given to some rare men to move their fellows.
6280: 
6281: Slowly Romola fell on her knees, and in the very act a tremor came over
6282: her; in the renunciation of her proud erectness, her mental attitude
6283: seemed changed, and she found herself in a new state of passiveness.
6284: Her brother began to speak again—
6285: 
6286: “Romola, in the deep night, as I lay awake, I saw my father’s room—the
6287: library—with all the books and the marbles and the leggio, where I used
6288: to stand and read; and I saw you—you were revealed to me as I see you
6289: now, with fair long hair, sitting before my father’s chair. And at the
6290: leggio stood a man whose face I could not see. I looked, and looked,
6291: and it was a blank to me, even as a painting effaced; and I saw him
6292: move and take thee, Romola, by the hand; and then I saw thee take my
6293: father by the hand; and you all three went down the stone steps into
6294: the streets, the man whose face was a blank to me leading the way. And
6295: you stood at the altar in Santa Croce, and the priest who married you
6296: had the face of death; and the graves opened, and the dead in their
6297: shrouds rose and followed you like a bridal train. And you passed on
6298: through the streets and the gates into the valley, and it seemed to me
6299: that he who led you hurried you more than you could bear, and the dead
6300: were weary of following you, and turned back to their graves. And at
6301: last you came to a stony place where there was no water, and no trees
6302: or herbage; but instead of water, I saw written parchment unrolling
6303: itself everywhere, and instead of trees and herbage I saw men of bronze
6304: and marble springing up and crowding round you. And my father was faint
6305: for want of water and fell to the ground; and the man whose face was a
6306: blank loosed thy hand and departed: and as he went I could see his
6307: face; and it was the face of the Great Tempter. And thou, Romola, didst
6308: wring thy hands and seek for water, and there was none. And the bronze
6309: and marble figures seemed to mock thee and hold out cups of water, and
6310: when thou didst grasp them and put them to my father’s lips, they
6311: turned to parchment. And the bronze and marble figures seemed to turn
6312: into demons and snatch my father’s body from thee, and the parchments
6313: shrivelled up, and blood ran everywhere instead of them, and fire upon
6314: the blood, till they all vanished, and the plain was bare and stony
6315: again, and thou wast alone in the midst of it. And then it seemed that
6316: the night fell and I saw no more... Thrice I have had that vision,
6317: Romola. I believe it is a revelation meant for thee: to warn thee
6318: against marriage as a temptation of the enemy; it calls upon thee to
6319: dedicate thyself—”
6320: 
6321: His pauses had gradually become longer and more frequent, and he was
6322: now compelled to cease by a severe fit of gasping, in which his eyes
6323: were turned on the crucifix as on a light that was vanishing. Presently
6324: he found strength to speak again, but in a feebler, scarcely audible
6325: tone.
6326: 
6327: “To renounce the vain philosophy and corrupt thoughts of the heathens:
6328: for in the hour of sorrow and death their pride will turn to mockery,
6329: and the unclean gods will—”
6330: 
6331: The words died away.
6332: 
6333: In spite of the thought that was at work in Romola, telling her that
6334: this vision was no more than a dream, fed by youthful memories and
6335: ideal convictions, a strange awe had come over her. Her mind was not
6336: apt to be assailed by sickly fancies; she had the vivid intellect and
6337: the healthy human passion, which are too keenly alive to the constant
6338: relations of things to have any morbid craving after the exceptional.
6339: Still the images of the vision she despised jarred and distressed her
6340: like painful and cruel cries. And it was the first time she had
6341: witnessed the struggle with approaching death: her young life had been
6342: sombre, but she had known nothing of the utmost human needs; no acute
6343: suffering—no heart-cutting sorrow; and this brother, come back to her
6344: in his hour of supreme agony, was like a sudden awful apparition from
6345: an invisible world. The pale faces of sorrow in the fresco on the
6346: opposite wall seemed to have come nearer, and to make one company with
6347: the pale face on the bed.
6348: 
6349: “Frate,” said the dying voice.
6350: 
6351: Fra Girolamo leaned down. But no other word came for some moments.
6352: 
6353: “Romola,” it said next.
6354: 
6355: She leaned forward too: but again there was silence. The words were
6356: struggling in vain.
6357: 
6358: “Fra Girolamo, give her—”
6359: 
6360: “The crucifix,” said the voice of Fra Girolamo.
6361: 
6362: No other sound came from the dying lips.
6363: 
6364: “Dino!” said Romola, with a low but piercing cry, as the certainty came
6365: upon her that the silence of misunderstanding could never be broken.
6366: 
6367: “Take the crucifix, my daughter,” said Fra Girolamo, after a few
6368: minutes. “His eyes behold it no more.”
6369: 
6370: Romola stretched out her hand to the crucifix, and this act appeared to
6371: relieve the tension of her mind. A great sob burst from her. She bowed
6372: her head by the side of her dead brother, and wept aloud.
6373: 
6374: It seemed to her as if this first vision of death must alter the
6375: daylight for her for evermore.
6376: 
6377: Fra Girolamo moved towards the door, and called in a lay Brother who
6378: was waiting outside. Then he went up to Romola and said in a tone of
6379: gentle command, “Rise, my daughter, and be comforted. Our brother is
6380: with the blessed. He has left you the crucifix, in remembrance of the
6381: heavenly warning—that it may be a beacon to you in the darkness.”
6382: 
6383: She rose from her knees, trembling, folded her veil over her head, and
6384: hid the crucifix under her mantle. Fra Girolamo then led the way out
6385: into the cloistered court, lit now only by the stars and by a lantern
6386: which was held by some one near the entrance. Several other figures in
6387: the dress of the dignified laity were grouped about the same spot. They
6388: were some of the numerous frequenters of San Marco, who had come to
6389: visit the Prior, and having heard that he was in attendance on the
6390: dying Brother in the chapter-house, had awaited him here.
6391: 
6392: Romola was dimly conscious of footsteps and rustling forms moving
6393: aside: she heard the voice of Fra Girolamo saying, in a low tone, “Our
6394: brother is departed;” she felt a hand laid on her arm. The next moment
6395: the door was opened, and she was out in the wide piazza of San Marco,
6396: with no one but Monna Brigida, and the servant carrying the lantern.
6397: 
6398: The fresh sense of space revived her, and helped her to recover her
6399: self-mastery. The scene which had just closed upon her was terribly
6400: distinct and vivid, but it began to narrow under the returning
6401: impressions of the life that lay outside it. She hastened her steps,
6402: with nervous anxiety to be again with her father—and with Tito—for were
6403: they not together in her absence? The images of that vision, while they
6404: clung about her like a hideous dream not yet to be shaken off, made her
6405: yearn all the more for the beloved faces and voices that would assure
6406: her of her waking life.
6407: 
6408: Tito, we know, was not with Bardo; his destiny was being shaped by a
6409: guilty consciousness, urging on him the despairing belief that by this
6410: time Romola possessed the knowledge which would lead to their final
6411: separation.
6412: 
6413: And the lips that could have conveyed that knowledge were for ever
6414: closed. The prevision that Fra Luca’s words had imparted to Romola had
6415: been such as comes from the shadowy region where human souls seek
6416: wisdom apart from the human sympathies which are the very life and
6417: substance of our wisdom; the revelation that might have come from the
6418: simple questions of filial and brotherly affection had been carried
6419: into irrevocable silence.
6420: 
6421: 
6422: 
6423: 
6424: CHAPTER XVI.
6425: A Florentine Joke.
6426: 
6427: 
6428: Early the next morning Tito was returning from Bratti’s shop in the
6429: narrow thoroughfare of the Ferravecchi. The Genoese stranger had
6430: carried away the onyx ring, and Tito was carrying away fifty florins.
6431: It did just cross his mind that if, after all, Fortune, by one of her
6432: able devices, saved him from the necessity of quitting Florence, it
6433: would be better for him not to have parted with his ring, since he had
6434: been understood to wear it for the sake of peculiar memories and
6435: predilections; still, it was a slight matter, not worth dwelling on
6436: with any emphasis, and in those moments he had lost his confidence in
6437: fortune. The feverish excitement of the first alarm which had impelled
6438: his mind to travel into the future had given place to a dull, regretful
6439: lassitude. He cared so much for the pleasures that could only come to
6440: him through the good opinion of his fellow-men, that he wished now he
6441: had never risked ignominy by shrinking from what his fellow-men called
6442: obligations.
6443: 
6444: But our deeds are like children that are born to us; they live and act
6445: apart from our own will. Nay, children may be strangled, but deeds
6446: never: they have an indestructible life both in and out of our
6447: consciousness; and that dreadful vitality of deeds was pressing hard on
6448: Tito for the first time.
6449: 
6450: He was going back to his lodgings in the Piazza di San Giovanni, but he
6451: avoided passing through the Mercato Vecchio, which was his nearest way,
6452: lest he should see Tessa. He was not in the humour to seek anything; he
6453: could only await the first sign of his altering lot.
6454: 
6455: The piazza with its sights of beauty was lit up by that warm morning
6456: sunlight under which the autumn dew still lingers, and which invites to
6457: an idleness undulled by fatigue. It was a festival morning, too, when
6458: the soft warmth seems to steal over one with a special invitation to
6459: lounge and gaze. Here, too, the signs of the fair were present; in the
6460: spaces round the octagonal baptistery, stalls were being spread with
6461: fruit and flowers, and here and there laden mules were standing quietly
6462: absorbed in their nose-bags, while their drivers were perhaps gone
6463: through the hospitable sacred doors to kneel before the blessed Virgin
6464: on this morning of her Nativity. On the broad marble steps of the Duomo
6465: there were scattered groups of beggars and gossiping talkers: here an
6466: old crone with white hair and hard sunburnt face encouraging a
6467: round-capped baby to try its tiny bare feet on the warmed marble, while
6468: a dog sitting near snuffed at the performance suspiciously; there a
6469: couple of shaggy-headed boys leaning to watch a small pale cripple who
6470: was cutting a face on a cherry-stone; and above them on the wide
6471: platform men were making changing knots in laughing desultory chat, or
6472: else were standing in close couples gesticulating eagerly.
6473: 
6474: But the largest and most important company of loungers was that towards
6475: which Tito had to direct his steps. It was the busiest time of the day
6476: with Nello, and in this warm season and at an hour when clients were
6477: numerous, most men preferred being shaved under the pretty red and
6478: white awning in front of the shop rather than within narrow walls. It
6479: is not a sublime attitude for a man, to sit with lathered chin thrown
6480: backward, and have his nose made a handle of; but to be shaved was a
6481: fashion of Florentine respectability, and it is astonishing how gravely
6482: men look at each other when they are all in the fashion. It was the
6483: hour of the day, too, when yesterday’s crop of gossip was freshest, and
6484: the barber’s tongue was always in its glory when his razor was busy;
6485: the deft activity of those two instruments seemed to be set going by a
6486: common spring. Tito foresaw that it would be impossible for him to
6487: escape being drawn into the circle; he must smile and retort, and look
6488: perfectly at his ease. Well! it was but the ordeal of swallowing bread
6489: and cheese pills after all. The man who let the mere anticipation of
6490: discovery choke him was simply a man of weak nerves.
6491: 
6492: But just at that time Tito felt a hand laid on his shoulder, and no
6493: amount of previous resolution could prevent the very unpleasant
6494: sensation with which that sudden touch jarred him. His face, as he
6495: turned it round, betrayed the inward shock; but the owner of the hand
6496: that seemed to have such evil magic in it broke into a light laugh. He
6497: was a young man about Tito’s own age, with keen features, small
6498: close-clipped head, and close-shaven lip and chin, giving the idea of a
6499: mind as little encumbered as possible with material that was not
6500: nervous. The keen eyes were bright with hope and friendliness, as so
6501: many other young eyes have been that have afterwards closed on the
6502: world in bitterness and disappointment; for at that time there were
6503: none but pleasant predictions about Niccolò Macchiavelli, as a young
6504: man of promise, who was expected to mend the broken fortunes of his
6505: ancient family.
6506: 
6507: “Why, Melema, what evil dream did you have last night, that you took my
6508: light grasp for that of a _sbirro_ or something worse?”
6509: 
6510: “Ah, Messer Niccolò!” said Tito, recovering himself immediately; “it
6511: must have been an extra amount of dulness in my veins this morning that
6512: shuddered at the approach of your wit. But the fact is, I have had a
6513: bad night.”
6514: 
6515: “That is unlucky, because you will be expected to shine without any
6516: obstructing fog to-day in the Rucellai Gardens. I take it for granted
6517: you are to be there.”
6518: 
6519: “Messer Bernardo did me the honour to invite me,” said Tito; “but I
6520: shall be engaged elsewhere.”
6521: 
6522: “Ah! I remember, you are in love,” said Macchiavelli, with a shrug,
6523: “else you would never have such inconvenient engagements. Why, we are
6524: to eat a peacock and ortolans under the loggia among Bernardo
6525: Rucellai’s rare trees; there are to be the choicest spirits in Florence
6526: and the choicest wines. Only, as Piero de’ Medici is to be there, the
6527: choice spirits may happen to be swamped in the capping of impromptu
6528: verses. I hate that game; it is a device for the triumph of small wits,
6529: who are always inspired the most by the smallest occasions.”
6530: 
6531: “What is that you are saying about Piero de’ Medici and small wits,
6532: Messer Niccolò?” said Nello, whose light figure was at that moment
6533: predominating over the Herculean frame of Niccolò Caparra.
6534: 
6535: That famous worker in iron, whom we saw last with bared muscular arms
6536: and leathern apron in the Mercato Vecchio, was this morning dressed in
6537: holiday suit, and as he sat submissively while Nello skipped round him,
6538: lathered him, seized him by the nose, and scraped him with magical
6539: quickness, he looked much as a lion might if it had donned linen and
6540: tunic and was preparing to go into society.
6541: 
6542: “A private secretary will never rise in the world if he couples great
6543: and small in that way,” continued Nello. “When great men are not
6544: allowed to marry their sons and daughters as they like, small men must
6545: not expect to marry their words as they like. Have you heard the news
6546: Domenico Cennini, here, has been telling us?—that Pagolantonio Soderini
6547: has given Ser Piero da Bibbiena a box on the ear for setting on Piero
6548: de’ Medici to interfere with the marriage between young Tommaso
6549: Soderini and Fiammetta Strozzi, and is to be sent ambassador to Venice
6550: as a punishment?”
6551: 
6552: “I don’t know which I envy him most,” said Macchiavelli, “the offence
6553: or the punishment. The offence will make him the most popular man in
6554: all Florence, and the punishment will take him among the only people in
6555: Italy who have known how to manage their own affairs.”
6556: 
6557: “Yes, if Soderini stays long enough at Venice,” said Cennini, “he may
6558: chance to learn the Venetian fashion, and bring it home with him. The
6559: Soderini have been fast friends of the Medici, but what has happened is
6560: likely to open Pagolantonio’s eyes to the good of our old Florentine
6561: trick of choosing a new harness when the old one galls us; if we have
6562: not quite lost the trick in these last fifty years.”
6563: 
6564: “Not we,” said Niccolò Caparra, who was rejoicing in the free use of
6565: his lips again. “Eat eggs in Lent and the snow will melt. That’s what I
6566: say to our people when they get noisy over their cups at San Gallo, and
6567: talk of raising a _romor_ (insurrection): I say, never do you plan a
6568: _romor_; you may as well try to fill Arno with buckets. When there’s
6569: water enough Arno will be full, and that will not be till the torrent
6570: is ready.”
6571: 
6572: “Caparra, that oracular speech of yours is due to my excellent
6573: shaving,” said Nello. “You could never have made it with that dark rust
6574: on your chin. Ecco, Messer Domenico, I am ready for you now. By the
6575: way, my bel erudito,” continued Nello, as he saw Tito moving towards
6576: the door, “here has been old Maso seeking for you, but your nest was
6577: empty. He will come again presently. The old man looked mournful, and
6578: seemed in haste. I hope there is nothing wrong in the Via de’ Bardi.”
6579: 
6580: “Doubtless Messer Tito knows that Bardo’s son is dead,” said Cronaca,
6581: who had just come up.
6582: 
6583: Tito’s heart gave a leap—had the death happened before Romola saw him?
6584: 
6585: “No, I had not heard it,” he said, with no more discomposure than the
6586: occasion seemed to warrant, turning and leaning against the doorpost,
6587: as if he had given up his intention of going away. “I knew that his
6588: sister had gone to see him. Did he die before she arrived?”
6589: 
6590: “No,” said Cronaca; “I was in San Marco at the time, and saw her come
6591: out from the chapter-house with Fra Girolamo, who told us that the
6592: dying man’s breath had been preserved as by a miracle, that he might
6593: make a disclosure to his sister.”
6594: 
6595: Tito felt that his fate was decided. Again his mind rushed over all the
6596: circumstances of his departure from Florence, and he conceived a plan
6597: of getting back his money from Cennini before the disclosure had become
6598: public. If he once had his money he need not stay long in endurance of
6599: scorching looks and biting words. He would wait now, and go away with
6600: Cennini and get the money from him at once. With that project in his
6601: mind he stood motionless—his hands in his belt, his eyes fixed absently
6602: on the ground. Nello, glancing at him, felt sure that he was absorbed
6603: in anxiety about Romola, and thought him such a pretty image of
6604: self-forgetful sadness, that he just perceptibly pointed his razor at
6605: him, and gave a challenging look at Piero di Cosimo, whom he had never
6606: forgiven for his refusal to see any prognostics of character in his
6607: favourite’s handsome face. Piero, who was leaning against the other
6608: doorpost, close to Tito, shrugged his shoulders: the frequent
6609: recurrence of such challenges from Nello had changed the painter’s
6610: first declaration of neutrality into a positive inclination to believe
6611: ill of the much-praised Greek.
6612: 
6613: “So you have got your Fra Girolamo back again, Cronaca? I suppose we
6614: shall have him preaching again this next Advent,” said Nello.
6615: 
6616: “And not before there is need,” said Cronaca, gravely. “We have had the
6617: best testimony to his words since the last Quaresima; for even to the
6618: wicked wickedness has become a plague; and the ripeness of vice is
6619: turning to rottenness in the nostrils even of the vicious. There has
6620: not been a change since the Quaresima, either in Rome or at Florence,
6621: but has put a new seal on the Frate’s words—that the harvest of sin is
6622: ripe, and that God will reap it with a sword.”
6623: 
6624: “I hope he has had a new vision, however,” said Francesco Cei,
6625: sneeringly. “The old ones are somewhat stale. Can’t your Frate get a
6626: poet to help out his imagination for him?”
6627: 
6628: “He has no lack of poets about him,” said Cronaca, with quiet contempt,
6629: “but they are great poets and not little ones; so they are contented to
6630: be taught by him, and no more think the truth stale which God has given
6631: him to utter, than they think the light of the moon is stale. But
6632: perhaps certain high prelates and princes who dislike the Frate’s
6633: denunciations might be pleased to hear that, though Giovanni Pico, and
6634: Poliziano, and Marsilio Ficino, and most other men of mark in Florence,
6635: reverence Fra Girolamo, Messer Francesco Cei despises him.”
6636: 
6637: “Poliziano?” said Cei, with a scornful laugh. “Yes, doubtless he
6638: believes in your new Jonah; witness the fine orations he wrote for the
6639: envoys of Sienna, to tell Alexander the Sixth that the world and the
6640: Church were never so well off as since he became Pope.”
6641: 
6642: “Nay, Francesco,” said Macchiavelli, smiling, “a various scholar must
6643: have various opinions. And as for the Frate, whatever we may think of
6644: his saintliness, you judge his preaching too narrowly. The secret of
6645: oratory lies, not in saying new things, but in saying things with a
6646: certain power that moves the hearers—without which, as old Filelfo has
6647: said, your speaker deserves to be called, ‘non oratorem, sed aratorem.’
6648: And, according to that test, Fra Girolamo is a great orator.”
6649: 
6650: “That is true, Niccolò,” said Cennini, speaking from the shaving-chair,
6651: “but part of the secret lies in the prophetic visions. Our people—no
6652: offence to you, Cronaca—will run after anything in the shape of a
6653: prophet, especially if he prophesies terrors and tribulations.”
6654: 
6655: “Rather say, Cennini,” answered Cronaca, “that the chief secret lies in
6656: the Frate’s pure life and strong faith, which stamp him as a messenger
6657: of God.”
6658: 
6659: “I admit it—I admit it,” said Cennini, opening his palms, as he rose
6660: from the chair. “His life is spotless: no man has impeached it.”
6661: 
6662: “He is satisfied with the pleasant lust of arrogance,” Cei burst out,
6663: bitterly. “I can see it in that proud lip and satisfied eye of his. He
6664: hears the air filled with his own name—Fra Girolamo Savonarola, of
6665: Ferrara; the prophet, the saint, the mighty preacher, who frightens the
6666: very babies of Florence into laying down their wicked baubles.”
6667: 
6668: “Come, come, Francesco, you are out of humour with waiting,” said the
6669: conciliatory Nello. “Let me stop your mouth with a little lather. I
6670: must not have my friend Cronaca made angry: I have a regard for his
6671: chin; and his chin is in no respect altered since he became a Piagnone.
6672: And for my own part, I confess, when the Frate was preaching in the
6673: Duomo last Advent, I got into such a trick of slipping in to listen to
6674: him that I might have turned Piagnone too, if I had not been hindered
6675: by the liberal nature of my art; and also by the length of the sermons,
6676: which are sometimes a good while before they get to the moving point.
6677: But, as Messer Niccolò here says, the Frate lays hold of the people by
6678: some power over and above his prophetic visions. Monks and nuns who
6679: prophesy are not of that rareness. For what says Luigi Pulci?
6680: ‘Dombruno’s sharp-cutting scimitar had the fame of being enchanted;
6681: but,’ says Luigi, ‘I am rather of opinion that it cut sharp because it
6682: was of strongly-tempered steel.’ Yes, yes; Paternosters may shave
6683: clean, but they must be said over a good razor.”
6684: 
6685: “See, Nello!” said Macchiavelli, “what doctor is this advancing on his
6686: Bucephalus? I thought your piazza was free from those furred and
6687: scarlet-robed lackeys of death. This man looks as if he had had some
6688: such night adventure as Boccaccio’s Maestro Simone, and had his bonnet
6689: and mantle pickled a little in the gutter; though he himself is as
6690: sleek as a miller’s rat.”
6691: 
6692: “A–ah!” said Nello, with a low long-drawn intonation, as he looked up
6693: towards the advancing figure—a round-headed, round-bodied personage,
6694: seated on a raw young horse, which held its nose out with an air of
6695: threatening obstinacy, and by a constant effort to back and go off in
6696: an oblique line showed free views about authority very much in advance
6697: of the age.
6698: 
6699: “And I have a few more adventures in pickle for him,” continued Nello,
6700: in an undertone, “which I hope will drive his inquiring nostrils to
6701: another quarter of the city. He’s a doctor from Padua; they say he has
6702: been at Prato for three months, and now he’s come to Florence to see
6703: what he can net. But his great trick is making rounds among the
6704: contadini. And do you note those great saddle-bags he carries? They are
6705: to hold the fat capons and eggs and meal he levies on silly clowns with
6706: whom coin is scarce. He vends his own secret medicines, so he keeps
6707: away from the doors of the druggists; and for this last week he has
6708: taken to sitting in my piazza for two or three hours every day, and
6709: making it a resort for asthmas and squalling bambini. It stirs my gall
6710: to see the toad-faced quack fingering the greasy quattrini, or bagging
6711: a pigeon in exchange for his pills and powders. But I’ll put a few
6712: thorns in his saddle, else I’m no Florentine. Laudamus! he is coming to
6713: be shaved; that’s what I’ve waited for. Messer Domenico, go not away:
6714: wait; you shall see a rare bit of fooling, which I devised two days
6715: ago. Here, Sandro!”
6716: 
6717: Nello whispered in the ear of Sandro, who rolled his solemn eyes,
6718: nodded, and, following up these signs of understanding with a slow
6719: smile, took to his heels with surprising rapidity.
6720: 
6721: “How is it with you, Maestro Tacco?” said Nello, as the doctor, with
6722: difficulty, brought his horse’s head round towards the barber’s shop.
6723: “That is a fine young horse of yours, but something raw in the mouth,
6724: eh?”
6725: 
6726: “He is an accursed beast, the _vermocane_ seize him!” said Maestro
6727: Tacco, with a burst of irritation, descending from his saddle and
6728: fastening the old bridle, mended with string, to an iron staple in the
6729: wall. “Nevertheless,” he added, recollecting himself, “a sound beast
6730: and a valuable, for one who wanted to purchase, and get a profit by
6731: training him. I had him cheap.”
6732: 
6733: “Rather too hard riding for a man who carries your weight of learning:
6734: eh, Maestro?” said Nello. “You seem hot.”
6735: 
6736: “Truly, I am likely to be hot,” said the doctor, taking off his bonnet,
6737: and giving to full view a bald low head and flat broad face, with high
6738: ears, wide lipless mouth, round eyes, and deep arched lines above the
6739: projecting eyebrows, which altogether made Nello’s epithet “toad-faced”
6740: dubiously complimentary to the blameless batrachian. “Riding from
6741: Peretola, when the sun is high, is not the same thing as kicking your
6742: heels on a bench in the shade, like your Florence doctors. Moreover, I
6743: have had not a little pulling to get through the carts and mules into
6744: the Mercato, to find out the husband of a certain Monna Ghita, who had
6745: had a fatal seizure before I was called in; and if it had not been that
6746: I had to demand my fees—”
6747: 
6748: “Monna Ghita!” said Nello, as the perspiring doctor interrupted himself
6749: to rub his head and face. “Peace be with her angry soul! The Mercato
6750: will want a whip the more if her tongue is laid to rest.”
6751: 
6752: Tito, who had roused himself from his abstraction, and was listening to
6753: the dialogue, felt a new rush of the vague half-formed ideas about
6754: Tessa, which had passed through his mind the evening before: if Monna
6755: Ghita were really taken out of the way, it would be easier for him to
6756: see Tessa again—whenever he wanted to see her.
6757: 
6758: “_Gnaffè_, Maestro,” Nello went on, in a sympathising tone, “you are
6759: the slave of rude mortals, who, but for you, would die like brutes,
6760: without help of pill or powder. It is pitiful to see your learned lymph
6761: oozing from your pores as if it were mere vulgar moisture. You think my
6762: shaving will cool and disencumber you? One moment and I have done with
6763: Messer Francesco here. It seems to me a thousand years till I wait upon
6764: a man who carries all the science of Arabia in his head and
6765: saddle-bags. Ecco!”
6766: 
6767: Nello held up the shaving-cloth with an air of invitation, and Maestro
6768: Tacco advanced and seated himself under a preoccupation with his heat
6769: and his self-importance, which made him quite deaf to the irony
6770: conveyed in Nello’s officiously polite speech.
6771: 
6772: “It is but fitting that a great medicus like you,” said Nello,
6773: adjusting the cloth, “should be shaved by the same razor that has
6774: shaved the illustrious Antonio Benevieni, the greatest master of the
6775: chirurgic art.”
6776: 
6777: “The chirurgic art!” interrupted the doctor, with an air of
6778: contemptuous disgust. “Is it your Florentine fashion to put the masters
6779: of the science of medicine on a level with men who do carpentry on
6780: broken limbs, and sew up wounds like tailors, and carve away
6781: excrescences as a butcher trims meat? _Via_! A manual art, such as any
6782: artificer might learn, and which has been practised by simple barbers
6783: like yourself—on a level with the noble science of Hippocrates, Galen,
6784: and Avicenna, which penetrates into the occult influences of the stars
6785: and plants and gems!—a science locked up from the vulgar!”
6786: 
6787: “No, in truth, Maestro,” said Nello, using his lather very
6788: deliberately, as if he wanted to prolong the operation to the utmost,
6789: “I never thought of placing them on a level: I know your science comes
6790: next to the miracles of Holy Church for mystery. But there, you see, is
6791: the pity of it,”—here Nello fell into a tone of regretful
6792: sympathy—“your high science is sealed from the profane and the vulgar,
6793: and so you become an object of envy and slander. I grieve to say it,
6794: but there are low fellows in this city—mere _sgherri_, who go about in
6795: nightcaps and long beards, and make it their business to sprinkle gall
6796: in every man’s broth who is prospering. Let me tell you—for you are a
6797: stranger—this is a city where every man had need carry a large nail
6798: ready to fasten on the wheel of Fortune when his side happens to be
6799: uppermost. Already there are stories—mere fables doubtless—beginning to
6800: be buzzed about concerning you, that make me wish I could hear of your
6801: being well on your way to Arezzo. I would not have a man of your metal
6802: stoned, for though San Stefano was stoned, he was not great in medicine
6803: like San Cosmo and San Damiano...”
6804: 
6805: “What stories? what fables?” stammered Maestro Tacco. “What do you
6806: mean?”
6807: 
6808: “_Lasso_! I fear me you are come into the trap for your cheese,
6809: Maestro. The fact is, there is a company of evil youths who go prowling
6810: about the houses of our citizens carrying sharp tools in their
6811: pockets;—no sort of door, or window, or shutter, but they will pierce
6812: it. They are possessed with a diabolical patience to watch the doings
6813: of people who fancy themselves private. It must be they who have done
6814: it—it must be they who have spread the stories about you and your
6815: medicines. Have you by chance detected any small aperture in your door,
6816: or window-shutter? No? Well, I advise you to look; for it is now
6817: commonly talked of that you have been seen in your dwelling at the
6818: Canto di Paglia, making your secret specifics by night: pounding dried
6819: toads in a mortar, compounding a salve out of mashed worms, and making
6820: your pills from the dried livers of rats which you mix with saliva
6821: emitted during the utterance of a blasphemous incantation—which indeed
6822: these witnesses profess to repeat.”
6823: 
6824: “It is a pack of lies!” exclaimed the doctor, struggling to get
6825: utterance, and then desisting in alarm at the approaching razor.
6826: 
6827: “It is not to me, or any of this respectable company, that you need to
6828: say that, doctor. _We_ are not the heads to plant such carrots as those
6829: in. But what of that? What are a handful of reasonable men against a
6830: crowd with stones in their hands? There are those among us who think
6831: Cecco d’Ascoli was an innocent sage—and we all know how he was burnt
6832: alive for being wiser than his fellows. Ah, doctor, it is not by living
6833: at Padua that you can learn to know Florentines. My belief is, they
6834: would stone the Holy Father himself, if they could find a good excuse
6835: for it; and they are persuaded that you are a necromancer, who is
6836: trying to raise the pestilence by selling secret medicines—and I am
6837: told your specifics have in truth an evil smell.”
6838: 
6839: “It is false!” burst out the doctor, as Nello moved away his razor; “it
6840: is false! I will show the pills and the powders to these honourable
6841: signori—and the salve—it has an excellent odour—an odour of—of salve.”
6842: He started up with the lather on his chin, and the cloth round his
6843: neck, to search in his saddle-bag for the belied medicines, and Nello
6844: in an instant adroitly shifted the shaving-chair till it was in the
6845: close vicinity of the horse’s head, while Sandro, who had now returned,
6846: at a sign from his master placed himself near the bridle.
6847: 
6848: “Behold, Messeri!” said the doctor, bringing a small box of medicines
6849: and opening it before them.
6850: 
6851: “Let any signor apply this box to his nostrils and he will find an
6852: honest odour of medicaments—not indeed of pounded gems, or rare
6853: vegetables from the East, or stones found in the bodies of birds; for I
6854: practise on the diseases of the vulgar, for whom heaven has provided
6855: cheaper and less powerful remedies according to their degree: and there
6856: are even remedies known to our science which are entirely free of
6857: cost—as the new _tussis_ may be counteracted in the poor, who can pay
6858: for no specifics, by a resolute holding of the breath. And here is a
6859: paste which is even of savoury odour, and is infallible against
6860: melancholia, being concocted under the conjunction of Jupiter and
6861: Venus; and I have seen it allay spasms.”
6862: 
6863: “Stay, Maestro,” said Nello, while the doctor had his lathered face
6864: turned towards the group near the door, eagerly holding out his box,
6865: and lifting out one specific after another; “here comes a crying
6866: contadina with her baby. Doubtless she is in search of you; it is
6867: perhaps an opportunity for you to show this honourable company a proof
6868: of your skill. Here, buona donna! here is the famous doctor. Why, what
6869: is the matter with the sweet _bimbo_?”
6870: 
6871: This question was addressed to a sturdy-looking, broad-shouldered
6872: contadina, with her head-drapery folded about her face so that little
6873: was to be seen but a bronzed nose and a pair of dark eyes and eyebrows.
6874: She carried her child packed up in the stiff mummy-shaped case in which
6875: Italian babies have been from time immemorial introduced into society,
6876: turning its face a little towards her bosom, and making those sorrowful
6877: grimaces which women are in the habit of using as a sort of pulleys to
6878: draw down reluctant tears.
6879: 
6880: “Oh, for the love of the Holy Madonna!” said the woman, in a wailing
6881: voice; “will you look at my poor bimbo? I know I can’t pay you for it,
6882: but I took it into the Nunziata last night, and it’s turned a worse
6883: colour than before; it’s the convulsions. But when I was holding it
6884: before the Santissima Nunziata, I remembered they said there was a new
6885: doctor come who cured everything; and so I thought it might be the will
6886: of the Holy Madonna that I should bring it to you.”
6887: 
6888: “Sit down, Maestro, sit down,” said Nello. “Here is an opportunity for
6889: you; here are honourable witnesses who will declare before the
6890: Magnificent Eight that they have seen you practising honestly and
6891: relieving a poor woman’s child. And then if your life is in danger, the
6892: Magnificent Eight will put you in prison a little while just to insure
6893: your safety, and after that, their sbirri will conduct you out of
6894: Florence by night, as they did the zealous Frate Minore who preached
6895: against the Jews. What! our people are given to stone-throwing; but we
6896: have magistrates.”
6897: 
6898: The doctor, unable to refuse, seated himself in the shaving-chair,
6899: trembling, half with fear and half with rage, and by this time quite
6900: unconscious of the lather which Nello had laid on with such
6901: profuseness. He deposited his medicine-case on his knees, took out his
6902: precious spectacles (wondrous Florentine device!) from his wallet,
6903: lodged them carefully above his flat nose and high ears, and lifting up
6904: his brows, turned towards the applicant.
6905: 
6906: “O Santiddio! look at him,” said the woman, with a more piteous wail
6907: than ever, as she held out the small mummy, which had its head
6908: completely concealed by dingy drapery wound round the head of the
6909: portable cradle, but seemed to be struggling and crying in a demoniacal
6910: fashion under this imprisonment. “The fit is on him! _Ohimè_! I know
6911: what colour he is; it’s the evil eye—oh!”
6912: 
6913: The doctor, anxiously holding his knees together to support his box,
6914: bent his spectacles towards the baby, and said cautiously, “It may be a
6915: new disease; unwind these rags, Monna!”
6916: 
6917: The contadina, with sudden energy, snatched off the encircling linen,
6918: when out struggled—scratching, grinning, and screaming—what the doctor
6919: in his fright fully believed to be a demon, but what Tito recognised as
6920: Vaiano’s monkey, made more formidable by an artificial blackness, such
6921: as might have come from a hasty rubbing up the chimney.
6922: 
6923: Up started the unfortunate doctor, letting his medicine-box fall, and
6924: away jumped the no less terrified and indignant monkey, finding the
6925: first resting-place for his claws on the horse’s mane, which he used as
6926: a sort of rope-ladder till he had fairly found his equilibrium, when he
6927: continued to clutch it as a bridle. The horse wanted no spur under such
6928: a rider, and, the already loosened bridle offering no resistance,
6929: darted off across the piazza, with the monkey, clutching, grinning, and
6930: blinking, on his neck.
6931: 
6932: “_Il cavallo! Il Diavolo_!” was now shouted on all sides by the idle
6933: rascals who gathered from all quarters of the piazza, and was echoed in
6934: tones of alarm by the stall-keepers, whose vested interests seemed in
6935: some danger; while the doctor, out of his wits with confused terror at
6936: the Devil, the possible stoning, and the escape of his horse, took to
6937: his heels with spectacles on nose, lathered face, and the shaving-cloth
6938: about his neck, crying—“Stop him! stop him! for a powder—a florin—stop
6939: him for a florin!” while the lads, outstripping him, clapped their
6940: hands and shouted encouragement to the runaway.
6941: 
6942: The _cerretano_, who had not bargained for the flight of his monkey
6943: along with the horse, had caught up his petticoats with much celerity,
6944: and showed a pair of parti-coloured hose above his contadina’s shoes,
6945: far in advance of the doctor. And away went the grotesque race up the
6946: Corso degli Adimari—the horse with the singular jockey, the contadina
6947: with the remarkable hose, and the doctor in lather and spectacles, with
6948: furred mantle outflying.
6949: 
6950: It was a scene such as Florentines loved, from the potent and reverend
6951: signor going to council in his lucco, down to the grinning youngster,
6952: who felt himself master of all situations when his bag was filled with
6953: smooth stones from the convenient dry bed of the torrent. The
6954: grey-headed Domenico Cennini laughed no less heartily than the younger
6955: men, and Nello was triumphantly secure of the general admiration.
6956: 
6957: “Aha!” he exclaimed, snapping his fingers when the first burst of
6958: laughter was subsiding. “I have cleared my piazza of that unsavoury
6959: fly-trap, _mi pare_. Maestro Tacco will no more come here again to sit
6960: for patients than he will take to licking marble for his dinner.”
6961: 
6962: “You are going towards the Piazza della Signoria, Messer Domenico,”
6963: said Macchiavelli. “I will go with you, and we shall perhaps see who
6964: has deserved the _palio_ among these racers. Come, Melema, will you go
6965: too?”
6966: 
6967: It had been precisely Tito’s intention to accompany Cennini, but before
6968: he had gone many steps, he was called back by Nello, who saw Maso
6969: approaching.
6970: 
6971: Maso’s message was from Romola. She wished Tito to go to the Via de’
6972: Bardi as soon as possible. She would see him under the loggia, at the
6973: top of the house, as she wished to speak to him alone.
6974: 
6975: 
6976: 
6977: 
6978: CHAPTER XVII.
6979: Under the Loggia.
6980: 
6981: 
6982: The loggia at the top of Bardo’s house rose above the buildings on each
6983: side of it, and formed a gallery round quadrangular walls. On the side
6984: towards the street the roof was supported by columns; but on the
6985: remaining sides, by a wall pierced with arched openings, so that at the
6986: back, looking over a crowd of irregular, poorly-built dwellings towards
6987: the hill of Bogoli, Romola could at all times have a walk sheltered
6988: from observation. Near one of those arched openings, close to the door
6989: by which he had entered the loggia, Tito awaited her, with a sickening
6990: sense of the sunlight that slanted before him and mingled itself with
6991: the ruin of his hopes. He had never for a moment relied on Romola’s
6992: passion for him as likely to be too strong for the repulsion created by
6993: the discovery of his secret; he had not the presumptuous vanity which
6994: might have hindered him from feeling that her love had the same root
6995: with her belief in him. But as he imagined her coming towards him in
6996: her radiant beauty, made so loveably mortal by her soft hazel eyes, he
6997: fell into wishing that she had been something lower, if it were only
6998: that she might let him clasp her and kiss her before they parted. He
6999: had had no real caress from her—nothing but now and then a long glance,
7000: a kiss, a pressure of the hand; and he had so often longed that they
7001: should be alone together. They were going to be alone now; but he saw
7002: her standing inexorably aloof from him. His heart gave a great throb as
7003: he saw the door move: Romola was there. It was all like a flash of
7004: lightning: he felt, rather than saw, the glory about her head, the
7005: tearful appealing eyes; he felt, rather than heard, the cry of love
7006: with which she said, “Tito!”
7007: 
7008: And in the same moment she was in his arms, and sobbing with her face
7009: against his.
7010: 
7011: How poor Romola had yearned through the watches of the night to see
7012: that bright face! The new image of death; the strange bewildering doubt
7013: infused into her by the story of a life removed from her understanding
7014: and sympathy; the haunting vision, which she seemed not only to hear
7015: uttered by the low gasping voice, but to live through, as if it had
7016: been her own dream, had made her more conscious than ever that it was
7017: Tito who had first brought the warm stream of hope and gladness into
7018: her life, and who had first turned away the keen edge of pain in the
7019: remembrance of her brother. She would tell Tito everything; there was
7020: no one else to whom she could tell it. She had been restraining herself
7021: in the presence of her father all the morning; but now, that
7022: long-pent-up sob might come forth. Proud and self-controlled to all the
7023: world beside, Romola was as simple and unreserved as a child in her
7024: love for Tito. She had been quite contented with the days when they had
7025: only looked at each other; but now, when she felt the need of clinging
7026: to him, there was no thought that hindered her.
7027: 
7028: “My Romola! my goddess!” Tito murmured with passionate fondness, as he
7029: clasped her gently, and kissed the thick golden ripples on her neck. He
7030: was in paradise: disgrace, shame, parting—there was no fear of them any
7031: longer. This happiness was too strong to be marred by the sense that
7032: Romola was deceived in him; nay, he could only rejoice in her delusion;
7033: for, after all, concealment had been wisdom. The only thing he could
7034: regret was his needless dread; if, indeed, the dread had not been worth
7035: suffering for the sake of this sudden rapture.
7036: 
7037: The sob had satisfied itself, and Romola raised her head. Neither of
7038: them spoke; they stood looking at each other’s faces with that sweet
7039: wonder which belongs to young love—she with her long white hands on the
7040: dark-brown curls, and he with his dark fingers bathed in the streaming
7041: gold. Each was so beautiful to the other; each was experiencing that
7042: undisturbed mutual consciousness for the first time. The cold pressure
7043: of a new sadness on Romola’s heart made her linger the more in that
7044: silent soothing sense of nearness and love; and Tito could not even
7045: seek to press his lips to hers, because that would be change.
7046: 
7047: “Tito,” she said at last, “it has been altogether painful, but I must
7048: tell you everything. Your strength will help me to resist the
7049: impressions that will not be shaken off by reason.”
7050: 
7051: “I know, Romola—I know he is dead,” said Tito; and the long lustrous
7052: eyes told nothing of the many wishes that would have brought about that
7053: death long ago if there had been such potency in mere wishes. Romola
7054: only read her own pure thoughts in their dark depths, as we read
7055: letters in happy dreams.
7056: 
7057: “So changed, Tito! It pierced me to think that it was Dino. And so
7058: strangely hard: not a word to my father; nothing but a vision that he
7059: wanted to tell me. And yet it was so piteous—the struggling breath, and
7060: the eyes that seemed to look towards the crucifix, and yet not to see
7061: it. I shall never forget it; it seems as if it would come between me
7062: and everything I shall look at.”
7063: 
7064: Romola’s heart swelled again, so that she was forced to break off. But
7065: the need she felt to disburden her mind to Tito urged her to repress
7066: the rising anguish. When she began to speak again, her thoughts had
7067: travelled a little.
7068: 
7069: “It was strange, Tito. The vision was about our marriage, and yet he
7070: knew nothing of you.”
7071: 
7072: “What was it, my Romola? Sit down and tell me,” said Tito, leading her
7073: to the bench that stood near. A fear had come across him lest the
7074: vision should somehow or other relate to Baldassarre; and this sudden
7075: change of feeling prompted him to seek a change of position.
7076: 
7077: Romola told him all that had passed, from her entrance into San Marco,
7078: hardly leaving out one of her brother’s words, which had burnt
7079: themselves into her memory as they were spoken. But when she was at the
7080: end of the vision, she paused; the rest came too vividly before her to
7081: be uttered, and she sat looking at the distance, almost unconscious for
7082: the moment that Tito was near her. _His_ mind was at ease now; that
7083: vague vision had passed over him like white mist, and left no mark. But
7084: he was silent, expecting her to speak again.
7085: 
7086: “I took it,” she went on, as if Tito had been reading her thoughts; “I
7087: took the crucifix; it is down below in my bedroom.”
7088: 
7089: “And now, my Romola,” said Tito, entreatingly, “you will banish these
7090: ghastly thoughts. The vision was an ordinary monkish vision, bred of
7091: fasting and fanatical ideas. It surely has no weight with you.”
7092: 
7093: “No, Tito; no. But poor Dino, _he_ believed it was a divine message. It
7094: is strange,” she went on meditatively, “this life of men possessed with
7095: fervid beliefs that seem like madness to their fellow-beings. Dino was
7096: not a vulgar fanatic; and that Fra Girolamo—his very voice seems to
7097: have penetrated me with a sense that there is some truth in what moves
7098: them: some truth of which I know nothing.”
7099: 
7100: “It was only because your feelings were highly wrought, my Romola. Your
7101: brother’s state of mind was no more than a form of that theosophy which
7102: has been the common disease of excitable dreamy minds in all ages; the
7103: same ideas that your father’s old antagonist, Marsilio Ficino, pores
7104: over in the New Platonists; only your brother’s passionate nature drove
7105: him to act out what other men write and talk about. And for Fra
7106: Girolamo, he is simply a narrow-minded monk, with a gift of preaching
7107: and infusing terror into the multitude. Any words or any voice would
7108: have shaken you at that moment. When your mind has had a little repose,
7109: you will judge of such things as you have always done before.”
7110: 
7111: “Not about poor Dino,” said Romola. “I was angry with him; my heart
7112: seemed to close against him while he was speaking; but since then I
7113: have thought less of what was in my own mind and more of what was in
7114: his. Oh, Tito! it was very piteous to see his young life coming to an
7115: end in that way. That yearning look at the crucifix when he was gasping
7116: for breath—I can never forget it. Last night I looked at the crucifix a
7117: long while, and tried to see that it would help him, until at last it
7118: seemed to me by the lamplight as if the suffering face shed pity.”
7119: 
7120: “My Romola, promise me to resist such thoughts; they are fit for sickly
7121: nuns, not for my golden-tressed Aurora, who looks made to scatter all
7122: such twilight fantasies. Try not to think of them now; we shall not
7123: long be alone together.”
7124: 
7125: The last words were uttered in a tone of tender beseeching, and he
7126: turned her face towards him with a gentle touch of his right-hand.
7127: 
7128: Romola had had her eyes fixed absently on the arched opening, but she
7129: had not seen the distant hill; she had all the while been in the
7130: chapter house, looking at the pale images of sorrow and death.
7131: 
7132: Tito’s touch and beseeching voice recalled her; and now in the warm
7133: sunlight she saw that rich dark beauty which seemed to gather round it
7134: all images of joy—purple vines festooned between the elms, the strong
7135: corn perfecting itself under the vibrating heat, bright winged
7136: creatures hurrying and resting among the flowers, round limbs beating
7137: the earth in gladness with cymbals held aloft, light melodies chanted
7138: to the thrilling rhythm of strings—all objects and all sounds that tell
7139: of Nature revelling in her force. Strange, bewildering transition from
7140: those pale images of sorrow and death to this bright youthfulness, as
7141: of a sun-god who knew nothing of night! What thought could reconcile
7142: that worn anguish in her brother’s face—that straining after something
7143: invisible—with this satisfied strength and beauty, and make it
7144: intelligible that they belonged to the same world? Or was there never
7145: any reconciling of them, but only a blind worship of clashing deities,
7146: first in mad joy and then in wailing? Romola for the first time felt
7147: this questioning need like a sudden uneasy dizziness and want of
7148: something to grasp; it was an experience hardly longer than a sigh, for
7149: the eager theorising of ages is compressed, as in a seed, in the
7150: momentary want of a single mind. But there was no answer to meet the
7151: need, and it vanished before the returning rush of young sympathy with
7152: the glad loving beauty that beamed upon her in new radiance, like the
7153: dawn after we have looked away from it to the grey west.
7154: 
7155: “Your mind lingers apart from our love, my Romola,” Tito said, with a
7156: soft reproachful murmur. “It seems a forgotten thing to you.”
7157: 
7158: She looked at the beseeching eyes in silence, till the sadness all
7159: melted out of her own.
7160: 
7161: “My joy!” she said, in her full clear voice.
7162: 
7163: “Do you really care for me enough, then, to banish those chill fancies,
7164: or shall you always be suspecting me as the Great Tempter?” said Tito,
7165: with his bright smile.
7166: 
7167: “How should I not care for you more than for everything else?
7168: Everything I had felt before in all my life—about my father, and about
7169: my loneliness—was a preparation to love you. You would laugh at me,
7170: Tito, if you knew what sort of man I used to think I should marry—some
7171: scholar with deep lines in his face, like Alamanno Rinuccini, and with
7172: rather grey hair, who would agree with my father in taking the side of
7173: the Aristotelians, and be willing to live with him. I used to think
7174: about the love I read of in the poets, but I never dreamed that
7175: anything like that could happen to me here in Florence in our old
7176: library. And then _you_ came, Tito, and were so much to my father, and
7177: I began to believe that life could be happy for me too.”
7178: 
7179: “My goddess! is there any woman like you?” said Tito, with a mixture of
7180: fondness and wondering admiration at the blended majesty and simplicity
7181: in her.
7182: 
7183: “But, dearest,” he went on, rather timidly, “if you minded more about
7184: our marriage, you would persuade your father and Messer Bernardo not to
7185: think of any more delays. But you seem not to mind about it.”
7186: 
7187: “Yes, Tito, I will, I do mind. But I am sure my godfather will urge
7188: more delay now, because of Dino’s death. He has never agreed with my
7189: father about disowning Dino, and you know he has always said that we
7190: ought to wait until you have been at least a year in Florence. Do not
7191: think hardly of my godfather. I know he is prejudiced and narrow, but
7192: yet he is very noble. He has often said that it is folly in my father
7193: to want to keep his library apart, that it may bear his name; yet he
7194: would try to get my father’s wish carried out. That seems to me very
7195: great and noble—that power of respecting a feeling which he does not
7196: share or understand.”
7197: 
7198: “I have no rancour against Messer Bernardo for thinking you too
7199: precious for me, my Romola,” said Tito: and that was true. “But your
7200: father, then, knows of his son’s death?”
7201: 
7202: “Yes, I told him—I could not help it. I told him where I had been, and
7203: that I had seen Dino die; but nothing else; and he has commanded me not
7204: to speak of it again. But he has been very silent this morning, and has
7205: had those restless movements which always go to my heart; they look as
7206: if he were trying to get outside the prison of his blindness. Let us go
7207: to him now. I had persuaded him to try to sleep, because he slept
7208: little in the night. Your voice will soothe him, Tito: it always does.”
7209: 
7210: “And not one kiss? I have not had one,” said Tito, in his gentle
7211: reproachful tone, which gave him an air of dependence very charming in
7212: a creature with those rare gifts that seem to excuse presumption.
7213: 
7214: The sweet pink blush spread itself with the quickness of light over
7215: Romola’s face and neck as she bent towards him. It seemed impossible
7216: that their kisses could ever become common things.
7217: 
7218: “Let us walk once round the loggia,” said Romola, “before we go down.”
7219: 
7220: “There is something grim and grave to me always about Florence,” said
7221: Tito, as they paused in the front of the house, where they could see
7222: over the opposite roofs to the other side of the river, “and even in
7223: its merriment there is something shrill and hard—biting rather than
7224: gay. I wish we lived in Southern Italy, where thought is broken, not by
7225: weariness, but by delicious languors such as never seem to come over
7226: the ‘ingenia acerrima Florentina.’ I should like to see you under that
7227: southern sun, lying among the flowers, subdued into mere enjoyment,
7228: while I bent over you and touched the lute and sang to you some little
7229: unconscious strain that seemed all one with the light and the warmth.
7230: You have never known that happiness of the nymphs, my Romola.”
7231: 
7232: “No; but I have dreamed of it often since you came. I am very thirsty
7233: for a deep draught of joy—for a life all bright like you. But we will
7234: not think of it now, Tito; it seems to me as if there would always be
7235: pale sad faces among the flowers, and eyes that look in vain. Let us
7236: go.”
7237: 
7238: 
7239: 
7240: 
7241: CHAPTER XVIII.
7242: The Portrait.
7243: 
7244: 
7245: When Tito left the Via de’ Bardi that day in exultant satisfaction at
7246: finding himself thoroughly free from the threatened peril, his
7247: thoughts, no longer claimed by the immediate presence of Romola and her
7248: father, recurred to those futile hours of dread in which he was
7249: conscious of having not only felt but acted as he would not have done
7250: if he had had a truer foresight. He would not have parted with his
7251: ring; for Romola, and others to whom it was a familiar object, would be
7252: a little struck with the apparent sordidness of parting with a gem he
7253: had professedly cherished, unless he feigned as a reason the desire to
7254: make some special gift with the purchase-money; and Tito had at that
7255: moment a nauseating weariness of simulation. He was well out of the
7256: possible consequences that might have fallen on him from that initial
7257: deception, and it was no longer a load on his mind; kind fortune had
7258: brought him immunity, and he thought it was only fair that she should.
7259: Who was hurt by it? The results to Baldassarre were too problematical
7260: to be taken into account. But he wanted now to be free from any hidden
7261: shackles that would gall him, though ever so little, under his ties to
7262: Romola. He was not aware that that very delight in immunity which
7263: prompted resolutions not to entangle himself again, was deadening the
7264: sensibilities which alone could save him from entanglement.
7265: 
7266: But, after all, the sale of the ring was a slight matter. Was it also a
7267: slight matter that little Tessa was under a delusion which would
7268: doubtless fill her small head with expectations doomed to
7269: disappointment? Should he try to see the little thing alone again and
7270: undeceive her at once, or should he leave the disclosure to time and
7271: chance? Happy dreams are pleasant, and they easily come to an end with
7272: daylight and the stir of life. The sweet, pouting, innocent, round
7273: thing! It was impossible not to think of her. Tito thought he should
7274: like some time to take her a present that would please her, and just
7275: learn if her step-father treated her more cruelly now her mother was
7276: dead. Or, should he at once undeceive Tessa, and then tell Romola about
7277: her, so that they might find some happier lot for the poor thing? No:
7278: that unfortunate little incident of the _cerretano_ and the marriage,
7279: and his allowing Tessa to part from him in delusion, must never be
7280: known to Romola, and since no enlightenment could expel it from Tessa’s
7281: mind, there would always be a risk of betrayal; besides even little
7282: Tessa might have some gall in her when she found herself disappointed
7283: in her love—yes, she _must_ be a little in love with him, and that
7284: might make it well that he should not see her again. Yet it was a
7285: trifling adventure such as a country girl would perhaps ponder on till
7286: some ruddy contadino made acceptable love to her, when she would break
7287: her resolution of secrecy and get at the truth that she was free.
7288: _Dunque_—good-bye, Tessa! kindest wishes! Tito had made up his mind
7289: that the silly little affair of the _cerretano_ should have no further
7290: consequences for himself; and people are apt to think that resolutions
7291: taken on their own behalf will be firm. As for the fifty-five florins,
7292: the purchase-money of the ring, Tito had made up his mind what to do
7293: with some of them; he would carry out a pretty ingenious thought which
7294: would set him more at ease in accounting for the absence of his ring to
7295: Romola, and would also serve him as a means of guarding her mind from
7296: the recurrence of those monkish fancies which were especially repugnant
7297: to him; and with this thought in his mind, he went to the Via Gualfonda
7298: to find Piero di Cosimo, the artist who at that time was pre-eminent in
7299: the fantastic mythological design which Tito’s purpose required.
7300: 
7301: Entering the court on which Piero’s dwelling opened, Tito found the
7302: heavy iron knocker on the door thickly bound round with wool and
7303: ingeniously fastened with cords. Remembering the painter’s practice of
7304: stuffing his ears against obtrusive noises, Tito was not much surprised
7305: at this mode of defence against visitors’ thunder, and betook himself
7306: first to tapping modestly with his knuckles, and then to a more
7307: importunate attempt to shake the door. In vain! Tito was moving away,
7308: blaming himself for wasting his time on this visit, instead of waiting
7309: till he saw the painter again at Nello’s, when a little girl entered
7310: the court with a basket of eggs on her arm, went up to the door, and
7311: standing on tiptoe, pushed up a small iron plate that ran in grooves,
7312: and putting her mouth to the aperture thus disclosed, called out in a
7313: piping voice, “Messer Piero!”
7314: 
7315: In a few moments Tito heard the sound of bolts, the door opened, and
7316: Piero presented himself in a red night-cap and a loose brown serge
7317: tunic, with sleeves rolled up to the shoulder. He darted a look of
7318: surprise at Tito, but without further notice of him stretched out his
7319: hand to take the basket from the child, re-entered the house, and
7320: presently returning with the empty basket, said, “How much to pay?”
7321: 
7322: “Two grossoni, Messer Piero; they are all ready boiled, my mother
7323: says.”
7324: 
7325: Piero took the coin out of the leathern scarsella at his belt, and the
7326: little maiden trotted away, not without a few upward glances of awed
7327: admiration at the surprising young signor.
7328: 
7329: Piero’s glance was much less complimentary as he said—
7330: 
7331: “What do you want at my door, Messer Greco? I saw you this morning at
7332: Nello’s; if you had asked me then, I could have told you that I see no
7333: man in this house without knowing his business and agreeing with him
7334: beforehand.”
7335: 
7336: “Pardon, Messer Piero,” said Tito, with his imperturbable good-humour;
7337: “I acted without sufficient reflection. I remembered nothing but your
7338: admirable skill in inventing pretty caprices, when a sudden desire for
7339: something of that sort prompted me to come to you.”
7340: 
7341: The painter’s manners were too notoriously odd to all the world for
7342: this reception to be held a special affront; but even if Tito had
7343: suspected any offensive intention, the impulse to resentment would have
7344: been less strong in him than the desire to conquer goodwill.
7345: 
7346: Piero made a grimace which was habitual with him when he was spoken to
7347: with flattering suavity. He grinned, stretched out the corners of his
7348: mouth, and pressed down his brows, so as to defy any divination of his
7349: feelings under that kind of stroking.
7350: 
7351: “And what may that need be?” he said, after a moment’s pause. In his
7352: heart he was tempted by the hinted opportunity of applying his
7353: invention.
7354: 
7355: “I want a very delicate miniature device taken from certain fables of
7356: the poets, which you will know how to combine for me. It must be
7357: painted on a wooden case—I will show you the size—in the form of a
7358: triptych. The inside may be simple gilding: it is on the outside I want
7359: the device. It is a favourite subject with you Florentines—the triumph
7360: of Bacchus and Ariadne; but I want it treated in a new way. A story in
7361: Ovid will give you the necessary hints. The young Bacchus must be
7362: seated in a ship, his head bound with clusters of grapes, and a spear
7363: entwined with vine-leaves in his hand: dark-berried ivy must wind about
7364: the masts and sails, the oars must be thyrsi, and flowers must wreathe
7365: themselves about the poop; leopards and tigers must be crouching before
7366: him, and dolphins must be sporting round. But I want to have the
7367: fair-haired Ariadne with him, made immortal with her golden crown—that
7368: is not in Ovid’s story, but no matter, you will conceive it all—and
7369: above there must be young Loves, such as you know how to paint,
7370: shooting with roses at the points of their arrows—”
7371: 
7372: “Say no more!” said Piero. “I have Ovid in the vulgar tongue. Find me
7373: the passage. I love not to be choked with other men’s thoughts. You may
7374: come in.”
7375: 
7376: Piero led the way through the first room, where a basket of eggs was
7377: deposited on the open hearth, near a heap of broken egg-shells and a
7378: bank of ashes. In strange keeping with that sordid litter, there was a
7379: low bedstead of carved ebony, covered carelessly with a piece of rich
7380: oriental carpet, that looked as if it had served to cover the steps to
7381: a Madonna’s throne; and a carved _cassone_, or large chest, with
7382: painted devices on its sides and lid. There was hardly any other
7383: furniture in the large room, except casts, wooden steps, easels and
7384: rough boxes, all festooned with cobwebs.
7385: 
7386: The next room was still larger, but it was also much more crowded.
7387: Apparently Piero was keeping the Festa, for the double door underneath
7388: the window which admitted the painter’s light from above, was thrown
7389: open, and showed a garden, or rather thicket, in which fig-trees and
7390: vines grew in tangled trailing wildness among nettles and hemlocks, and
7391: a tall cypress lifted its dark head from a stifling mass of yellowish
7392: mulberry-leaves. It seemed as if that dank luxuriance had begun to
7393: penetrate even within the walls of the wide and lofty room; for in one
7394: corner, amidst a confused heap of carved marble fragments and rusty
7395: armour, tufts of long grass and dark feathery fennel had made their
7396: way, and a large stone vase, tilted on one side, seemed to be pouring
7397: out the ivy that streamed around. All about the walls hung pen and
7398: oil-sketches of fantastic sea-monsters; dances of satyrs and maenads;
7399: Saint Margaret’s resurrection out of the devouring dragon; Madonnas
7400: with the supernal light upon them; studies of plants and grotesque
7401: heads; and on irregular rough shelves a few books were scattered among
7402: great drooping bunches of corn, bullocks’ horns, pieces of dried
7403: honeycomb, stones with patches of rare-coloured lichen, skulls and
7404: bones, peacocks’ feathers, and large birds’ wings. Rising from amongst
7405: the dirty litter of the floor were lay figures: one in the frock of a
7406: Vallombrosan monk, strangely surmounted by a helmet with barred visor,
7407: another smothered with brocade and skins hastily tossed over it.
7408: Amongst this heterogeneous still life, several speckled and white
7409: pigeons were perched or strutting, too tame to fly at the entrance of
7410: men; three corpulent toads were crawling in an intimate friendly way
7411: near the door-stone; and a white rabbit, apparently the model for that
7412: which was frightening Cupid in the picture of Mars and Venus placed on
7413: the central easel, was twitching its nose with much content on a box
7414: full of bran.
7415: 
7416: “And now, Messer Greco,” said Piero, making a sign to Tito that he
7417: might sit down on a low stool near the door, and then standing over him
7418: with folded arms, “don’t be trying to see everything at once, like
7419: Messer Domeneddio, but let me know how large you would have this same
7420: triptych.”
7421: 
7422: Tito indicated the required dimensions, and Piero marked them on a
7423: piece of paper.
7424: 
7425: “And now for the book,” said Piero, reaching down a manuscript volume.
7426: 
7427: “There’s nothing about the Ariadne there,” said Tito, giving him the
7428: passage; “but you will remember I want the crowned Ariadne by the side
7429: of the young Bacchus: she must have golden hair.”
7430: 
7431: “Ha!” said Piero, abruptly, pursing up his lips again. “And you want
7432: them to be likenesses, eh?” he added, looking down into Tito’s face.
7433: 
7434: Tito laughed and blushed. “I know you are great at portraits, Messer
7435: Piero; but I could not ask Ariadne to sit for you, because the painting
7436: is a secret.”
7437: 
7438: “There it is! I want her to sit to me. Giovanni Vespucci wants me to
7439: paint him a picture of Oedipus and Antigone at Colonos, as he has
7440: expounded it to me: I have a fancy for the subject, and I want Bardo
7441: and his daughter to sit for it. Now, you ask them; and then I’ll put
7442: the likeness into Ariadne.”
7443: 
7444: “Agreed, if I can prevail with them. And your price for the Bacchus and
7445: Ariadne?”
7446: 
7447: “_Baie_! If you get them to let me paint them, that will pay me. I’d
7448: rather not have your money: you may pay for the case.”
7449: 
7450: “And when shall I sit for you?” said Tito; “for if we have one
7451: likeness, we must have two.”
7452: 
7453: “I don’t want _your_ likeness; I’ve got it already,” said Piero, “only
7454: I’ve made you look frightened. I must take the fright out of it for
7455: Bacchus.”
7456: 
7457: As he was speaking, Piero laid down the book and went to look among
7458: some paintings, propped with their faces against the wall. He returned
7459: with an oil-sketch in his hand.
7460: 
7461: “I call this as good a bit of portrait as I ever did,” he said, looking
7462: at it as he advanced. “Yours is a face that expresses fear well,
7463: because it’s naturally a bright one. I noticed it the first time I saw
7464: you. The rest of the picture is hardly sketched; but I’ve painted _you_
7465: in thoroughly.”
7466: 
7467: Piero turned the sketch, and held it towards Tito’s eyes. He saw
7468: himself with his right-hand uplifted, holding a wine-cup, in the
7469: attitude of triumphant joy, but with his face turned away from the cup
7470: with an expression of such intense fear in the dilated eyes and pallid
7471: lips, that he felt a cold stream through his veins, as if he were being
7472: thrown into sympathy with his imaged self.
7473: 
7474: “You are beginning to look like it already,” said Piero, with a short
7475: laugh, moving the picture away again. “He’s seeing a ghost—that fine
7476: young man. I shall finish it some day, when I’ve settled what sort of
7477: ghost is the most terrible—whether it should look solid, like a dead
7478: man come to life, or half transparent, like a mist.”
7479: 
7480: Tito, rather ashamed of himself for a sudden sensitiveness strangely
7481: opposed to his usual easy self-command, said carelessly—
7482: 
7483: “That is a subject after your own heart, Messer Piero—a revel
7484: interrupted by a ghost. You seem to love the blending of the terrible
7485: with the gay. I suppose that is the reason your shelves are so well
7486: furnished with death’s-heads, while you are painting those roguish
7487: Loves who are running away with the armour of Mars. I begin to think
7488: you are a Cynic philosopher in the pleasant disguise of a cunning
7489: painter.”
7490: 
7491: “Not I, Messer Greco; a philosopher is the last sort of animal I should
7492: choose to resemble. I find it enough to live, without spinning lies to
7493: account for life. Fowls cackle, asses bray, women chatter, and
7494: philosophers spin false reasons—that’s the effect the sight of the
7495: world brings out of them. Well, I am an animal that paints instead of
7496: cackling, or braying, or spinning lies. And now, I think, our business
7497: is done; you’ll keep to your side of the bargain about the Oedipus and
7498: Antigone?”
7499: 
7500: “I will do my best,” said Tito—on this strong hint, immediately moving
7501: towards the door.
7502: 
7503: “And you’ll let me know at Nello’s. No need to come here again.”
7504: 
7505: “I understand,” said Tito, laughingly, lifting his hand in sign of
7506: friendly parting.
7507: 
7508: 
7509: 
7510: 
7511: CHAPTER XIX.
7512: The Old Man’s Hope.
7513: 
7514: 
7515: Messer Bernardo del Nero was as inexorable as Romola had expected in
7516: his advice that the marriage should be deferred till Easter, and in
7517: this matter Bardo was entirely under the ascendancy of his sagacious
7518: and practical friend. Nevertheless, Bernardo himself, though he was as
7519: far as ever from any susceptibility to the personal fascination in Tito
7520: which was felt by others, could not altogether resist that argument of
7521: success which is always powerful with men of the world. Tito was making
7522: his way rapidly in high quarters. He was especially growing in favour
7523: with the young Cardinal Giovanni de’ Medici, who had even spoken of
7524: Tito’s forming part of his learned retinue on an approaching journey to
7525: Rome; and the bright young Greek who had a tongue that was always ready
7526: without ever being quarrelsome, was more and more wished for at gay
7527: suppers in the Via Larga, and at Florentine games in which he had no
7528: pretension to excel, and could admire the incomparable skill of Piero
7529: de’ Medici in the most graceful manner in the world. By an unfailing
7530: sequence, Tito’s reputation as an agreeable companion in “magnificent”
7531: society made his learning and talent appear more lustrous: and he was
7532: really accomplished enough to prevent an exaggerated estimate from
7533: being hazardous to him. Messer Bernardo had old prejudices and
7534: attachments which now began to argue down the newer and feebler
7535: prejudice against the young Greek stranger who was rather too supple.
7536: To the old Florentine it was impossible to despise the recommendation
7537: of standing well with the best Florentine families, and since Tito
7538: began to be thoroughly received into that circle whose views were the
7539: unquestioned standard of social value, it seemed irrational not to
7540: admit that there was no longer any check to satisfaction in the
7541: prospect of such a son-in-law for Bardo, and such a husband for Romola.
7542: It was undeniable that Tito’s coming had been the dawn of a new life
7543: for both father and daughter, and the first promise had even been
7544: surpassed. The blind old scholar—whose proud truthfulness would never
7545: enter into that commerce of feigned and preposterous admiration which,
7546: varied by a corresponding measurelessness in vituperation, made the
7547: woof of all learned intercourse—had fallen into neglect even among his
7548: fellow-citizens, and when he was alluded to at all, it had long been
7549: usual to say that, though his blindness and the loss of his son were
7550: pitiable misfortunes, he was tiresome in contending for the value of
7551: his own labours; and that his discontent was a little inconsistent in a
7552: man who had been openly regardless of religious rites, and who in days
7553: past had refused offers made to him from various quarters, on the
7554: slight condition that he would take orders, without which it was not
7555: easy for patrons to provide for every scholar. But since Tito’s coming,
7556: there was no longer the same monotony in the thought that Bardo’s name
7557: suggested; the old man, it was understood, had left off his plaints,
7558: and the fair daughter was no longer to be shut up in dowerless pride,
7559: waiting for a _parentado_. The winning manners and growing favour of
7560: the handsome Greek who was expected to enter into the double relation
7561: of son and husband helped to make the new interest a thoroughly
7562: friendly one, and it was no longer a rare occurrence when a visitor
7563: enlivened the quiet library. Elderly men came from that indefinite
7564: prompting to renew former intercourse which arises when an old
7565: acquaintance begins to be newly talked about; and young men whom Tito
7566: had asked leave to bring once, found it easy to go again when they
7567: overtook him on his way to the Via de’ Bardi, and, resting their hands
7568: on his shoulder, fell into easy chat with him. For it was pleasant to
7569: look at Romola’s beauty; to see her, like old Firenzuola’s type of
7570: womanly majesty, “sitting with a certain grandeur, speaking with
7571: gravity, smiling with modesty, and casting around, as it were, an odour
7572: of queenliness;”[1] and she seemed to unfold like a strong white lily
7573: under this genial breath of admiration and homage; it was all one to
7574: her with her new bright life in Tito’s love.
7575: 
7576:  [1] “Quando una donna è grande, ben formata, porta ben sua persona,
7577:  siede con una certa grandezza, parla con gravità, ride con modestia, e
7578:  finalmente getta quasi un odor di Regina; allora noi diciamo quella
7579:  donna pare una maestà, ella ha una maestà.”—Firenzuola: _Della
7580:  Bellezza delle Donne_.
7581: 
7582: 
7583: Tito had even been the means of strengthening the hope in Bardo’s mind
7584: that he might before his death receive the longed-for security
7585: concerning his library: that it should not be merged in another
7586: collection; that it should not be transferred to a body of monks, and
7587: be called by the name of a monastery; but that it should remain for
7588: ever the Bardi Library, for the use of Florentines. For the old habit
7589: of trusting in the Medici could not die out while their influence was
7590: still the strongest lever in the State; and Tito, once possessing the
7591: ear of the Cardinal Giovanni de’ Medici, might do more even than Messer
7592: Bernardo towards winning the desired interest, for he could demonstrate
7593: to a learned audience the peculiar value of Bardi’s collection. Tito
7594: himself talked sanguinely of such a result, willing to cheer the old
7595: man, and conscious that Romola repaid those gentle words to her father
7596: with a sort of adoration that no direct tribute to herself could have
7597: won from her.
7598: 
7599: This question of the library was the subject of more than one
7600: discussion with Bernardo del Nero when Christmas was turned and the
7601: prospect of the marriage was becoming near—but always out of Bardo’s
7602: hearing. For Bardo nursed a vague belief, which they dared not disturb,
7603: that his property, apart from the library, was adequate to meet all
7604: demands. He would not even, except under a momentary pressure of angry
7605: despondency, admit to himself that the will by which he had
7606: disinherited Dino would leave Romola the heir of nothing but debts; or
7607: that he needed anything from patronage beyond the security that a
7608: separate locality should be assigned to his library, in return for a
7609: deed of gift by which he made it over to the Florentine Republic.
7610: 
7611: “My opinion is,” said Bernardo to Romola, in a consultation they had
7612: under the loggia, “that since you are to be married, and Messer Tito
7613: will have a competent income, we should begin to wind up the affairs,
7614: and ascertain exactly the sum that would be necessary to save the
7615: library from being touched, instead of letting the debts accumulate any
7616: longer. Your father needs nothing but his shred of mutton and his
7617: macaroni every day, and I think Messer Tito may engage to supply that
7618: for the years that remain; he can let it be in place of the
7619: _morgen-cap_.”
7620: 
7621: “Tito has always known that my life is bound up with my father’s,” said
7622: Romola; “and he is better to my father than I am: he delights in making
7623: him happy.”
7624: 
7625: “Ah, he’s not made of the same clay as other men, is he?” said
7626: Bernardo, smiling. “Thy father has thought of shutting woman’s folly
7627: out of thee by cramming thee with Greek and Latin; but thou hast been
7628: as ready to believe in the first pair of bright eyes and the first soft
7629: words that have come within reach of thee, as if thou couldst say
7630: nothing by heart but Paternosters, like other Christian men’s
7631: daughters.”
7632: 
7633: “Now, godfather,” said Romola, shaking her head playfully, “as if it
7634: were only bright eyes and soft words that made me love Tito! You know
7635: better. You know I love my father and you because you are both good,
7636: and I love Tito too because he is so good. I see it, I feel it, in
7637: everything he says and does. And if he is handsome, too, why should I
7638: not love him the better for that? It seems to me beauty is part of the
7639: finished language by which goodness speaks. You know _you_ must have
7640: been a very handsome youth, godfather,”—she looked up with one of her
7641: happy, loving smiles at the stately old man—“you were about as tall as
7642: Tito, and you had very fine eyes; only you looked a little sterner and
7643: prouder, and—”
7644: 
7645: “And Romola likes to have all the pride to herself?” said Bernardo, not
7646: inaccessible to this pretty coaxing. “However, it is well that in one
7647: way Tito’s demands are more modest than those of any Florentine husband
7648: of fitting rank that we should have been likely to find for you; he
7649: wants no dowry.”
7650: 
7651: So it was settled in that way between Messer Bernardo del Nero, Romola,
7652: and Tito. Bardo assented with a wave of the hand when Bernardo told him
7653: that he thought it would be well now to begin to sell property and
7654: clear off debts; being accustomed to think of debts and property as a
7655: sort of thick wood that his imagination never even penetrated, still
7656: less got beyond. And Tito set about winning Messer Bernardo’s respect
7657: by inquiring, with his ready faculty, into Florentine money-matters,
7658: the secrets of the _Monti_ or public funds, the values of real
7659: property, and the profits of banking.
7660: 
7661: “You will soon forget that Tito is not a Florentine, godfather,” said
7662: Romola. “See how he is learning everything about Florence.”
7663: 
7664: “It seems to me he is one of the _demoni_, who are of no particular
7665: country, child,” said Bernardo, smiling. “His mind is a little too
7666: nimble to be weighted with all the stuff we men carry about in our
7667: hearts.”
7668: 
7669: Romola smiled too, in happy confidence.
7670: 
7671: 
7672: 
7673: 
7674: CHAPTER XX.
7675: The Day of the Betrothal.
7676: 
7677: 
7678: It was the last week of the Carnival, and the streets of Florence were
7679: at their fullest and noisiest: there were the masqued processions,
7680: chanting songs, indispensable now they had once been introduced by
7681: Lorenzo the Magnificent; there was the favourite rigoletto, or round
7682: dance, footed “in piazza” under the blue frosty sky; there were
7683: practical jokes of all sorts, from throwing comfits to throwing
7684: stones—especially stones. For the boys and striplings, always a strong
7685: element in Florentine crowds, became at the height of Carnival-time as
7686: loud and unmanageable as tree-crickets, and it was their immemorial
7687: privilege to bar the way with poles to all passengers, until a tribute
7688: had been paid towards furnishing those lovers of strong sensations with
7689: suppers and bonfires: to conclude with the standing entertainment of
7690: stone-throwing, which was not entirely monotonous, since the consequent
7691: maiming was various, and it was not always a single person who was
7692: killed. So that the pleasures of the Carnival were of a checkered kind,
7693: and if a painter were called upon to represent them truly, he would
7694: have to make a picture in which there would be so much grossness and
7695: barbarity that it must be turned with its face to the wall, except when
7696: it was taken down for the grave historical purpose of justifying a
7697: reforming zeal which, in ignorance of the facts, might be unfairly
7698: condemned for its narrowness. Still there was much of that more
7699: innocent picturesque merriment which is never wanting among a people
7700: with quick animal spirits and sensitive organs: there was not the heavy
7701: sottishness which belongs to the thicker northern blood, nor the
7702: stealthy fierceness which in the more southern regions of the peninsula
7703: makes the brawl lead to the dagger-thrust.
7704: 
7705: It was the high morning, but the merry spirits of the Carnival were
7706: still inclined to lounge and recapitulate the last night’s jests, when
7707: Tito Melema was walking at a brisk pace on the way to the Via de’
7708: Bardi. Young Bernardo Dovizi, who now looks at us out of Raphael’s
7709: portrait as the keen-eyed Cardinal da Bibbiena, was with him; and, as
7710: they went, they held animated talk about some subject that had
7711: evidently no relation to the sights and sounds through which they were
7712: pushing their way along the Por’ Santa Maria. Nevertheless, as they
7713: discussed, smiled, and gesticulated, they both, from time to time, cast
7714: quick glances around them, and at the turning towards the Lung’ Arno,
7715: leading to the Ponte Rubaconte, Tito had become aware, in one of these
7716: rapid surveys, that there was some one not far off him by whom he very
7717: much desired not to be recognised at that moment. His time and thoughts
7718: were thoroughly preoccupied, for he was looking forward to a unique
7719: occasion in his life: he was preparing for his betrothal, which was to
7720: take place on the evening of this very day. The ceremony had been
7721: resolved upon rather suddenly; for although preparations towards the
7722: marriage had been going forward for some time—chiefly in the
7723: application of Tito’s florins to the fitting up of rooms in Bardo’s
7724: dwelling, which, the library excepted, had always been scantily
7725: furnished—it had been intended to defer both the betrothal and the
7726: marriage until after Easter, when Tito’s year of probation, insisted on
7727: by Bernardo del Nero, would have been complete. But when an express
7728: proposition had come, that Tito should follow the Cardinal Giovanni to
7729: Rome to help Bernardo Dovizi with his superior knowledge of Greek in
7730: arranging a library, and there was no possibility of declining what lay
7731: so plainly on the road to advancement, he had become urgent in his
7732: entreaties that the betrothal might take place before his departure:
7733: there would be the less delay before the marriage on his return, and it
7734: would be less painful to part if he and Romola were outwardly as well
7735: as inwardly pledged to each other—if he had a claim which defied Messer
7736: Bernardo or any one else to nullify it. For the betrothal, at which
7737: rings were exchanged and mutual contracts were signed, made more than
7738: half the legality of marriage, to be completed on a separate occasion
7739: by the nuptial benediction. Romola’s feeling had met Tito’s in this
7740: wish, and the consent of the elders had been won.
7741: 
7742: And now Tito was hastening, amidst arrangements for his departure the
7743: next day, to snatch a morning visit to Romola, to say and hear any last
7744: words that were needful to be said before their meeting for the
7745: betrothal in the evening. It was not a time when any recognition could
7746: be pleasant that was at all likely to detain him; still less a
7747: recognition by Tessa. And it was unmistakably Tessa whom he had caught
7748: sight of moving along, with a timid and forlorn look, towards that very
7749: turn of the Lung’ Arno which he was just rounding. As he continued his
7750: talk with the young Dovizi, he had an uncomfortable undercurrent of
7751: consciousness which told him that Tessa had seen him and would
7752: certainly follow him: there was no escaping her along this direct road
7753: by the Arno, and over the Ponte Rubaconte. But she would not dare to
7754: speak to him or approach him while he was not alone, and he would
7755: continue to keep Dovizi with him till they reached Bardo’s door. He
7756: quickened his pace, and took up new threads of talk; but all the while
7757: the sense that Tessa was behind him, though he had no physical evidence
7758: of the fact, grew stronger and stronger; it was very irritating—perhaps
7759: all the more so because a certain tenderness and pity for the poor
7760: little thing made the determination to escape without any visible
7761: notice of her, a not altogether agreeable resource. Yet Tito persevered
7762: and carried his companion to the door, cleverly managing his “addio”
7763: without turning his face in a direction where it was possible for him
7764: to see an importunate pair of blue eyes; and as he went up the stone
7765: steps, he tried to get rid of unpleasant thoughts by saying to himself
7766: that after all Tessa might not have seen him, or, if she had, might not
7767: have followed him.
7768: 
7769: But—perhaps because that possibility could not be relied on
7770: strongly—when the visit was over, he came out of the doorway with a
7771: quick step and an air of unconsciousness as to anything that might be
7772: on his right-hand or his left. Our eyes are so constructed, however,
7773: that they take in a wide angle without asking any leave of our will;
7774: and Tito knew that there was a little figure in a white hood standing
7775: near the doorway—knew it quite well, before he felt a hand laid on his
7776: arm. It was a real grasp, and not a light, timid touch; for poor Tessa,
7777: seeing his rapid step, had started forward with a desperate effort. But
7778: when he stopped and turned towards her, her face wore a frightened
7779: look, as if she dreaded the effect of her boldness.
7780: 
7781: “Tessa!” said Tito, with more sharpness in his voice than she had ever
7782: heard in it before. “Why are you here? You must not follow me—you must
7783: not stand about door-places waiting for me.”
7784: 
7785: Her blue eyes widened with tears, and she said nothing. Tito was afraid
7786: of something worse than ridicule, if he were seen in the Via de’ Bardi
7787: with a girlish contadina looking pathetically at him. It was a street
7788: of high silent-looking dwellings, not of traffic; but Bernardo del
7789: Nero, or some one almost as dangerous, might come up at any moment.
7790: Even if it had not been the day of his betrothal, the incident would
7791: have been awkward and annoying. Yet it would be brutal—it was
7792: impossible—to drive Tessa away with harsh words. That accursed folly of
7793: his with the _cerretano_—that it should have lain buried in a quiet way
7794: for months, and now start up before him as this unseasonable crop of
7795: vexation! He could not speak harshly, but he spoke hurriedly.
7796: 
7797: “Tessa, I cannot—must not talk to you here. I will go on to the bridge
7798: and wait for you there. Follow me slowly.”
7799: 
7800: He turned and walked fast to the Ponte Rubaconte, and there leaned
7801: against the wall of one of the quaint little houses that rise at even
7802: distances on the bridge, looking towards the way by which Tessa would
7803: come. It would have softened a much harder heart than Tito’s to see the
7804: little thing advancing with her round face much paled and saddened
7805: since he had parted from it at the door of the “Nunziata.” Happily it
7806: was the least frequented of the bridges, and there were scarcely any
7807: passengers on it at this moment. He lost no time in speaking as soon as
7808: she came near him.
7809: 
7810: “Now, Tessa, I have very little time. You must not cry. Why did you
7811: follow me this morning? You must not do so again.”
7812: 
7813: “I thought,” said Tessa, speaking in a whisper, and struggling against
7814: a sob that _would_ rise immediately at this new voice of Tito’s—“I
7815: thought you wouldn’t be so long before you came to take care of me
7816: again. And the _patrigno_ beats me, and I can’t bear it any longer. And
7817: always when I come for a holiday I walk about to find you, and I can’t.
7818: Oh, please don’t send me away from you again! It has been so long, and
7819: I cry so now, because you never come to me. I can’t help it, for the
7820: days are so long, and I don’t mind about the goats and kids, or
7821: anything—and I can’t—”
7822: 
7823: The sobs came fast now, and the great tears. Tito felt that he could
7824: not do otherwise than comfort her. Send her away—yes; that he _must_
7825: do, at once. But it was all the more impossible to tell her anything
7826: that would leave her in a state of hopeless grief. He saw new trouble
7827: in the background, but the difficulty of the moment was too pressing
7828: for him to weigh distant consequences.
7829: 
7830: “Tessa, my little one,” he said, in his old caressing tones, “you must
7831: not cry. Bear with the cross _patrigno_ a little longer. I will come
7832: back to you. But I’m going now to Rome—a long, long way off. I shall
7833: come back in a few weeks, and then I promise you to come and see you.
7834: Promise me to be good and wait for me.”
7835: 
7836: It was the well-remembered voice again, and the mere sound was half
7837: enough to soothe Tessa. She looked up at him with trusting eyes, that
7838: still glittered with tears, sobbing all the while, in spite of her
7839: utmost efforts to obey him. Again he said, in a gentle voice—
7840: 
7841: “Promise me, my Tessa.”
7842: 
7843: “Yes,” she whispered. “But you won’t be long?”
7844: 
7845: “No, not long. But I must _go now_. And remember what I told you,
7846: Tessa. Nobody must know that you ever see me, else you will lose me for
7847: ever. And now, when I have left you, go straight home, and never follow
7848: me again. Wait till I come to you. Good-bye, my little Tessa: I _will_
7849: come.”
7850: 
7851: There was no help for it; he must turn and leave her without looking
7852: behind him to see how she bore it, for he had no time to spare. When he
7853: did look round he was in the Via de’ Benci, where there was no seeing
7854: what was happening on the bridge; but Tessa was too trusting and
7855: obedient not to do just what he had told her.
7856: 
7857: Yes, the difficulty was at an end for that day; yet this return of
7858: Tessa to him, at a moment when it was impossible for him to put an end
7859: to all difficulty with her by undeceiving her, was an unpleasant
7860: incident to carry in his memory. But Tito’s mind was just now
7861: thoroughly penetrated with a hopeful first love, associated with all
7862: happy prospects flattering to his ambition; and that future necessity
7863: of grieving Tessa could be scarcely more to him than the far-off cry of
7864: some little suffering animal buried in the thicket, to a merry
7865: cavalcade in the sunny plain. When, for the second time that day, Tito
7866: was hastening across the Ponte Rubaconte, the thought of Tessa caused
7867: no perceptible diminution of his happiness. He was well muffled in his
7868: mantle, less, perhaps, to protect him from the cold than from the
7869: additional notice that would have been drawn upon him by his dainty
7870: apparel. He leaped up the stone steps by two at a time, and said
7871: hurriedly to Maso, who met him—
7872: 
7873: “Where is the damigella?”
7874: 
7875: “In the library; she is quite ready, and Monna Brigida and Messer
7876: Bernardo are already there with Ser Braccio, but none of the rest of
7877: the company.”
7878: 
7879: “Ask her to give me a few minutes alone; I will await her in the
7880: _salotto_.”
7881: 
7882: Tito entered a room which had been fitted up in the utmost contrast
7883: with the half-pallid, half-sombre tints of the library. The walls were
7884: brightly frescoed with “caprices” of nymphs and loves sporting under
7885: the blue among flowers and birds. The only furniture besides the red
7886: leather seats and the central table were two tall white vases, and a
7887: young faun playing the flute, modelled by a promising youth named
7888: Michelangelo Buonarotti. It was a room that gave a sense of being in
7889: the sunny open air.
7890: 
7891: Tito kept his mantle round him, and looked towards the door. It was not
7892: long before Romola entered, all white and gold, more than ever like a
7893: tall lily. Her white silk garment was bound by a golden girdle, which
7894: fell with large tassels; and above that was the rippling gold of her
7895: hair, surmounted by the white mist of her long veil, which was fastened
7896: on her brow by a band of pearls, the gift of Bernardo del Nero, and was
7897: now parted off her face so that it all floated backward.
7898: 
7899: “Regina mia!” said Tito, as he took her hand and kissed it, still
7900: keeping his mantle round him. He could not help going backward to look
7901: at her again, while she stood in calm delight, with that exquisite
7902: self-consciousness which rises under the gaze of admiring love.
7903: 
7904: “Romola, will you show me the next room now?” said Tito, checking
7905: himself with the remembrance that the time might be short. “You said I
7906: should see it when you had arranged everything.”
7907: 
7908: Without speaking, she led the way into a long narrow room, painted
7909: brightly like the other, but only with birds and flowers. The furniture
7910: in it was all old; there were old faded objects for feminine use or
7911: ornament, arranged in an open cabinet between the two narrow windows;
7912: above the cabinet was the portrait of Romola’s mother; and below this,
7913: on the top of the cabinet, stood the crucifix which Romola had brought
7914: from San Marco.
7915: 
7916: “I have brought something under my mantle,” said Tito, smiling; and
7917: throwing off the large loose garment, he showed the little tabernacle
7918: which had been painted by Piero di Cosimo. The painter had carried out
7919: Tito’s intention charmingly, and so far had atoned for his long delay.
7920: “Do you know what this is for, my Romola?” added Tito, taking her by
7921: the hand, and leading her towards the cabinet. “It is a little shrine,
7922: which is to hide away from you for ever that remembrancer of sadness.
7923: You have done with sadness now; and we will bury all images of it—bury
7924: them in a tomb of joy. See!”
7925: 
7926: A slight quiver passed across Romola’s face as Tito took hold of the
7927: crucifix. But she had no wish to prevent his purpose; on the contrary,
7928: she herself wished to subdue certain importunate memories and
7929: questionings which still flitted like unexplained shadows across her
7930: happier thought.
7931: 
7932: He opened the triptych and placed the crucifix within the central
7933: space; then closing it again, taking out the key, and setting the
7934: little tabernacle in the spot where the crucifix had stood, said—
7935: 
7936: “Now, Romola, look and see if you are satisfied with the portraits old
7937: Piero has made of us. Is it not a dainty device? and the credit of
7938: choosing it is mine.”
7939: 
7940: “Ah! it is you—it is perfect!” said Romola, looking with moist joyful
7941: eyes at the miniature Bacchus, with his purple clusters. “And I am
7942: Ariadne, and you are crowning me! Yes, it is true, Tito; you have
7943: crowned my poor life.”
7944: 
7945: They held each other’s hands while she spoke, and both looked at their
7946: imaged selves. But the reality was far more beautiful; she all
7947: lily-white and golden, and he with his dark glowing beauty above the
7948: purple red-bordered tunic.
7949: 
7950: “And it was our good strange Piero who painted it?” said Romola. “Did
7951: you put it into his head to paint me as Antigone, that he might have my
7952: likeness for this?”
7953: 
7954: “No, it was he who made my getting leave for him to paint you and your
7955: father, a condition of his doing this for me.”
7956: 
7957: “Ah! I see now what it was you gave up your precious ring for. I
7958: perceived you had some cunning plan to give me pleasure.”
7959: 
7960: Tito did not blench. Romola’s little illusions about himself had long
7961: ceased to cause him anything but satisfaction. He only smiled and said—
7962: 
7963: “I might have spared my ring; Piero will accept no money from me; he
7964: thinks himself paid by painting you. And now, while I am away, you will
7965: look every day at those pretty symbols of our life together—the ship on
7966: the calm sea, and the ivy that never withers, and those Loves that have
7967: left off wounding us and shower soft petals that are like our kisses;
7968: and the leopards and tigers, they are the troubles of your life that
7969: are all quelled now; and the strange sea-monsters, with their merry
7970: eyes—let us see—they are the dull passages in the heavy books, which
7971: have begun to be amusing since we have sat by each other.”
7972: 
7973: “Tito mio!” said Romola, in a half-laughing voice of love; “but you
7974: will give me the key?” she added, holding out her hand for it.
7975: 
7976: “Not at all!” said Tito, with playful decision, opening his scarsella
7977: and dropping in the little key. “I shall drown it in the Arno.”
7978: 
7979: “But if I ever wanted to look at the crucifix again?”
7980: 
7981: “Ah! for that very reason it is hidden—hidden by these images of youth
7982: and joy.”
7983: 
7984: He pressed a light kiss on her brow, and she said no more, ready to
7985: submit, like all strong souls, when she felt no valid reason for
7986: resistance.
7987: 
7988: And then they joined the waiting company, which made a dignified little
7989: procession as it passed along the Ponte Rubaconte towards Santa Croce.
7990: Slowly it passed, for Bardo, unaccustomed for years to leave his own
7991: house, walked with a more timid step than usual; and that slow pace
7992: suited well with the gouty dignity of Messer Bartolommeo Scala, who
7993: graced the occasion by his presence, along with his daughter
7994: Alessandra. It was customary to have very long troops of kindred and
7995: friends at the _sposalizio_, or betrothal, and it had even been found
7996: necessary in time past to limit the number by law to no more than _four
7997: hundred_—two hundred on each side; for since the guests were all
7998: feasted after this initial ceremony, as well as after the _nozze_, or
7999: marriage, the very first stage of matrimony had become a ruinous
8000: expense, as that scholarly Benedict, Leonardo Bruno, complained in his
8001: own case. But Bardo, who in his poverty had kept himself proudly free
8002: from any appearance of claiming the advantages attached to a powerful
8003: family name, would have no invitations given on the strength of mere
8004: friendship; and the modest procession of twenty that followed the
8005: _sposi_ were, with three or four exceptions, friends of Bardo’s and
8006: Tito’s selected on personal grounds.
8007: 
8008: Bernardo del Nero walked as a vanguard before Bardo, who was led on the
8009: right by Tito, while Romola held her father’s other hand. Bardo had
8010: himself been married at Santa Croce, and had insisted on Romola’s being
8011: betrothed and married there, rather than in the little church of Santa
8012: Lucia close by their house, because he had a complete mental vision of
8013: the grand church where he hoped that a burial might be granted him
8014: among the Florentines who had deserved well. Happily the way was short
8015: and direct, and lay aloof from the loudest riot of the Carnival, if
8016: only they could return before any dances or shows began in the great
8017: piazza of Santa Croce. The west was red as they passed the bridge, and
8018: shed a mellow light on the pretty procession, which had a touch of
8019: solemnity in the presence of the blind father. But when the ceremony
8020: was over, and Tito and Romola came out on to the broad steps of the
8021: church, with the golden links of destiny on their fingers, the evening
8022: had deepened into struggling starlight, and the servants had their
8023: torches lit.
8024: 
8025: While they came out, a strange dreary chant, as of a _Miserere_, met
8026: their ears, and they saw that at the extreme end of the piazza there
8027: seemed to be a stream of people impelled by something approaching from
8028: the Borgo de’ Greci.
8029: 
8030: “It is one of their masqued processions, I suppose,” said Tito, who was
8031: now alone with Romola, while Bernardo took charge of Bardo.
8032: 
8033: And as he spoke there came slowly into view, at a height far above the
8034: heads of the onlookers, a huge and ghastly image of Winged Time with
8035: his scythe and hour-glass, surrounded by his winged children, the
8036: Hours. He was mounted on a high car completely covered with black, and
8037: the bullocks that drew the car were also covered with black, their
8038: horns alone standing out white above the gloom; so that in the sombre
8039: shadow of the houses it seemed to those at a distance as if Time and
8040: his children were apparitions floating through the air. And behind them
8041: came what looked like a troop of the sheeted dead gliding above
8042: blackness. And as they glided slowly, they chanted in a wailing strain.
8043: 
8044: A cold horror seized on Romola, for at the first moment it seemed as if
8045: her brother’s vision, which could never be effaced from her mind, was
8046: being half fulfilled. She clung to Tito, who, divining what was in her
8047: thoughts, said—
8048: 
8049: “What dismal fooling sometimes pleases your Florentines! Doubtless this
8050: is an invention of Piero di Cosimo, who loves such grim merriment.”
8051: 
8052: “Tito, I wish it had not happened. It will deepen the images of that
8053: vision which I would fain be rid of.”
8054: 
8055: “Nay, Romola, you will look only at the images of our happiness now. I
8056: have locked all sadness away from you.”
8057: 
8058: “But it is still there—it is only hidden,” said Romola, in a low tone,
8059: hardly conscious that she spoke.
8060: 
8061: “See, they are all gone now!” said Tito. “You will forget this ghastly
8062: mummery when we are in the light, and can see each other’s eyes. My
8063: Ariadne must never look backward now—only forward to Easter, when she
8064: will triumph with her Care-dispeller.”
8065: 
8066: 
8067: 
8068: 
8069: CHAPTER XXI.
8070: Florence expects a Guest.
8071: 
8072: 
8073: It was the 17th of November 1494: more than eighteen months since Tito
8074: and Romola had been finally united in the joyous Easter time, and had
8075: had a rainbow-tinted shower of comfits thrown over them, after the
8076: ancient Greek fashion, in token that the heavens would shower sweets on
8077: them through all their double life.
8078: 
8079: Since that Easter a great change had come over the prospects of
8080: Florence; and as in the tree that bears a myriad of blossoms, each
8081: single bud with its fruit is dependent on the primary circulation of
8082: the sap, so the fortunes of Tito and Romola were dependent on certain
8083: grand political and social conditions which made an epoch in the
8084: history of Italy.
8085: 
8086: In this very November, little more than a week ago, the spirit of the
8087: old centuries seemed to have re-entered the breasts of Florentines. The
8088: great bell in the palace tower had rung out the hammer-sound of alarm,
8089: and the people had mustered with their rusty arms, their tools and
8090: impromptu cudgels, to drive out the Medici. The gate of San Gallo had
8091: been fairly shut on the arrogant, exasperating Piero, galloping away
8092: towards Bologna with his hired horsemen frightened behind him, and shut
8093: on his keener young brother, the cardinal, escaping in the disguise of
8094: a Franciscan monk: a price had been set on both their heads. After
8095: that, there had been some sacking of houses, according to old
8096: precedent; the ignominious images, painted on the public buildings, of
8097: the men who had conspired against the Medici in days gone by, were
8098: effaced; the exiled enemies of the Medici were invited home. The
8099: half-fledged tyrants were fairly out of their splendid nest in the Via
8100: Larga, and the Republic had recovered the use of its will again.
8101: 
8102: But now, a week later, the great palace in the Via Larga had been
8103: prepared for the reception of another tenant; and if drapery roofing
8104: the streets with unwonted colour, if banners and hangings pouring out
8105: of the windows, if carpets and tapestry stretched over all steps and
8106: pavement on which exceptional feet might tread, were an unquestionable
8107: proof of joy, Florence was very joyful in the expectation of its new
8108: guest. The stream of colour flowed from the palace in the Via Larga
8109: round by the Cathedral, then by the great Piazza della Signoria, and
8110: across the Ponte Vecchio to the Porta San Frediano—the gate that looks
8111: towards Pisa. There, near the gate, a platform and canopy had been
8112: erected for the Signoria; and Messer Luca Corsini, doctor of law, felt
8113: his heart palpitating a little with the sense that he had a Latin
8114: oration to read; and every chief elder in Florence had to make himself
8115: ready, with smooth chin and well-lined silk lucco, to walk in
8116: procession; and the well-born youths were looking at their rich new
8117: tunics after the French mode which was to impress the stranger as
8118: having a peculiar grace when worn by Florentines; and a large body of
8119: the clergy, from the archbishop in his effulgence to the train of
8120: monks, black, white, and grey, were consulting betimes in the morning
8121: how they should marshal themselves, with their burden of relics and
8122: sacred banners and consecrated jewels, that their movements might be
8123: adjusted to the expected arrival of the illustrious visitor, at three
8124: o’clock in the afternoon.
8125: 
8126: An unexampled visitor! For he had come through the passes of the Alps
8127: with such an army as Italy had not seen before: with thousands of
8128: terrible Swiss, well used to fight for love and hatred as well as for
8129: hire; with a host of gallant cavaliers proud of a name; with an
8130: unprecedented infantry, in which every man in a hundred carried an
8131: arquebus; nay, with cannon of bronze, shooting not stones but iron
8132: balls, drawn not by bullocks but by horses, and capable of firing a
8133: second time before a city could mend the breach made by the first ball.
8134: Some compared the new-comer to Charlemagne, reputed rebuilder of
8135: Florence, welcome conqueror of degenerate kings, regulator and
8136: benefactor of the Church; some preferred the comparison to Cyrus,
8137: liberator of the chosen people, restorer of the Temple. For he had come
8138: across the Alps with the most glorious projects: he was to march
8139: through Italy amidst the jubilees of a grateful and admiring people; he
8140: was to satisfy all conflicting complaints at Rome; he was to take
8141: possession, by virtue of hereditary right and a little fighting, of the
8142: kingdom of Naples; and from that convenient starting-point he was to
8143: set out on the conquest of the Turks, who were partly to be cut to
8144: pieces and partly converted to the faith of Christ. It was a scheme
8145: that seemed to befit the Most Christian King, head of a nation which,
8146: thanks to the devices of a subtle Louis the Eleventh who had died in
8147: much fright as to his personal prospects ten years before, had become
8148: the strongest of Christian monarchies; and this antitype of Cyrus and
8149: Charlemagne was no other than the son of that subtle Louis—the young
8150: Charles the Eighth of France.
8151: 
8152: Surely, on a general statement, hardly anything could seem more
8153: grandiose, or fitter to revive in the breasts of men the memory of
8154: great dispensations by which new strata had been laid in the history of
8155: mankind. And there was a very widely spread conviction that the advent
8156: of the French king and his army into Italy was one of those events at
8157: which marble statues might well be believed to perspire, phantasmal
8158: fiery warriors to fight in the air, and quadrupeds to bring forth
8159: monstrous births—that it did not belong to the usual order of
8160: Providence, but was in a peculiar sense the work of God. It was a
8161: conviction that rested less on the necessarily momentous character of a
8162: powerful foreign invasion than on certain moral emotions to which the
8163: aspect of the times gave the form of presentiments: emotions which had
8164: found a very remarkable utterance in the voice of a single man.
8165: 
8166: That man was Fra Girolamo Savonarola, Prior of the Dominican convent of
8167: San Marco in Florence. On a September morning, when men’s ears were
8168: ringing with the news that the French army had entered Italy, he had
8169: preached in the Cathedral of Florence from the text, “Behold I, even I,
8170: do bring a flood of waters upon the earth.” He believed it was by
8171: supreme guidance that he had reached just so far in his exposition of
8172: Genesis the previous Lent; and he believed the “flood of water”—emblem
8173: at once of avenging wrath and purifying mercy—to be the
8174: divinely—indicated symbol of the French army. His audience, some of
8175: whom were held to be among the choicest spirits of the age—the most
8176: cultivated men in the most cultivated of Italian cities—believed it
8177: too, and listened with shuddering awe. For this man had a power rarely
8178: paralleled, of impressing his beliefs on others, and of swaying very
8179: various minds. And as long as four years ago he had proclaimed from the
8180: chief pulpit of Florence that a scourge was about to descend on Italy,
8181: and that by this scourge the Church was to be purified. Savonarola
8182: appeared to believe, and his hearers more or less waveringly believed,
8183: that he had a mission like that of the Hebrew prophets, and that the
8184: Florentines amongst whom his message was delivered were in some sense a
8185: second chosen people. The idea of prophetic gifts was not a remote one
8186: in that age: seers of visions, circumstantial heralds of things to be,
8187: were far from uncommon either outside or inside the cloister; but this
8188: very fact made Savonarola stand out the more conspicuously as a grand
8189: exception. While in others the gift of prophecy was very much like a
8190: farthing candle illuminating small corners of human destiny with
8191: prophetic gossip, in Savonarola it was like a mighty beacon shining far
8192: out for the warning and guidance of men. And to some of the soberest
8193: minds the supernatural character of his insight into the future
8194: gathered a strong attestation from the peculiar conditions of the age.
8195: 
8196: At the close of 1492, the year in which Lorenzo de’ Medici died and
8197: Tito Melema came as a wanderer to Florence, Italy was enjoying a peace
8198: and prosperity unthreatened by any near and definite danger. There was
8199: no fear of famine, for the seasons had been plenteous in corn, and
8200: wine, and oil; new palaces had been rising in all fair cities, new
8201: villas on pleasant slopes and summits; and the men who had more than
8202: their share of these good things were in no fear of the larger number
8203: who had less. For the citizens’ armour was getting rusty, and
8204: populations seemed to have become tame, licking the hands of masters
8205: who paid for a ready-made army when they wanted it, as they paid for
8206: goods of Smyrna. Even the fear of the Turk had ceased to be active, and
8207: the Pope found it more immediately profitable to accept bribes from him
8208: for a little prospective poisoning than to form plans either for
8209: conquering or for converting him.
8210: 
8211: Altogether this world, with its partitioned empire and its roomy
8212: universal Church, seemed to be a handsome establishment for the few who
8213: were lucky or wise enough to reap the advantages of human folly: a
8214: world in which lust and obscenity, lying and treachery, oppression and
8215: murder, were pleasant, useful, and when properly managed, not
8216: dangerous. And as a sort of fringe or adornment to the substantial
8217: delights of tyranny, avarice, and lasciviousness, there was the
8218: patronage of polite learning and the fine arts, so that flattery could
8219: always be had in the choicest Latin to be commanded at that time, and
8220: sublime artists were at hand to paint the holy and the unclean with
8221: impartial skill. The Church, it was said, had never been so disgraced
8222: in its head, had never shown so few signs of renovating, vital belief
8223: in its lower members; nevertheless it was much more prosperous than in
8224: some past days. The heavens were fair and smiling above; and below
8225: there were no signs of earthquake.
8226: 
8227: Yet at that time, as we have seen, there was a man in Florence who for
8228: two years and more had been preaching that a scourge was at hand; that
8229: the world was certainly not framed for the lasting convenience of
8230: hypocrites, libertines, and oppressors. From the midst of those smiling
8231: heavens he had seen a sword hanging—the sword of God’s justice—which
8232: was speedily to descend with purifying punishment on the Church and the
8233: world. In brilliant Ferrara, seventeen years before, the contradiction
8234: between men’s lives and their professed beliefs had pressed upon him
8235: with a force that had been enough to destroy his appetite for the
8236: world, and at the age of twenty-three had driven him into the cloister.
8237: He believed that God had committed to the Church the sacred lamp of
8238: truth for the guidance and salvation of men, and he saw that the
8239: Church, in its corruption, had become a sepulchre to hide the lamp. As
8240: the years went on scandals increased and multiplied, and hypocrisy
8241: seemed to have given place to impudence. Had the world, then, ceased to
8242: have a righteous Ruler? Was the Church finally forsaken? No, assuredly:
8243: in the Sacred Book there was a record of the past in which might be
8244: seen as in a glass what would be in the days to come, and the book
8245: showed that when the wickedness of the chosen people, type of the
8246: Christian Church, had become crying, the judgments of God had descended
8247: on them. Nay, reason itself declared that vengeance was imminent, for
8248: what else would suffice to turn men from their obstinacy in evil? And
8249: unless the Church were reclaimed, how could the promises be fulfilled,
8250: that the heathens should be converted and the whole world become
8251: subject to the one true law? He had seen his belief reflected in
8252: visions—a mode of seeing which had been frequent with him from his
8253: youth up.
8254: 
8255: But the real force of demonstration for Girolamo Savonarola lay in his
8256: own burning indignation at the sight of wrong; in his fervent belief in
8257: an Unseen Justice that would put an end to the wrong, and in an Unseen
8258: Purity to which lying and uncleanness were an abomination. To his
8259: ardent, power-loving soul, believing in great ends, and longing to
8260: achieve those ends by the exertion of its own strong will, the faith in
8261: a supreme and righteous Ruler became one with the faith in a speedy
8262: divine interposition that would punish and reclaim.
8263: 
8264: Meanwhile, under that splendid masquerade of dignities sacred and
8265: secular which seemed to make the life of lucky Churchmen and princely
8266: families so luxurious and amusing, there were certain conditions at
8267: work which slowly tended to disturb the general festivity. Ludovico
8268: Sforza—copious in gallantry, splendid patron of an incomparable
8269: Leonardo da Vinci—holding the ducal crown of Milan in his grasp, and
8270: wanting to put it on his own head rather than let it rest on that of a
8271: feeble nephew who would take very little to poison him, was much afraid
8272: of the Spanish-born old King Ferdinand and the Crown Prince Alfonso of
8273: Naples, who, not liking cruelty and treachery which were useless to
8274: themselves, objected to the poisoning of a near relative for the
8275: advantage of a Lombard usurper; the royalties of Naples again were
8276: afraid of their suzerain, Pope Alexander Borgia; all three were
8277: anxiously watching Florence, lest with its midway territory it should
8278: determine the game by underhand backing; and all four, with every small
8279: state in Italy, were afraid of Venice—Venice the cautious, the stable,
8280: and the strong, that wanted to stretch its arms not only along both
8281: sides of the Adriatic but across to the ports of the western coast.
8282: 
8283: Lorenzo de’ Medici, it was thought, did much to prevent the fatal
8284: outbreak of such jealousies, keeping up the old Florentine alliance
8285: with Naples and the Pope, and yet persuading Milan that the alliance
8286: was for the general advantage. But young Piero de’ Medici’s rash vanity
8287: had quickly nullified the effect of his father’s wary policy, and
8288: Ludovico Sforza, roused to suspicion of a league against him, thought
8289: of a move which would checkmate his adversaries: he determined to
8290: invite the French king to march into Italy, and, as heir of the house
8291: of Anjou, take possession of Naples. Ambassadors—“orators,” as they
8292: were called in those haranguing times—went and came; a recusant
8293: cardinal, determined not to acknowledge a Pope elected by bribery (and
8294: his own particular enemy), went and came also, and seconded the
8295: invitation with hot rhetoric; and the young king seemed to lend a
8296: willing ear. So that in 1493 the rumour spread and became louder and
8297: louder that Charles the Eighth of France was about to cross the Alps
8298: with a mighty army; and the Italian populations, accustomed, since
8299: Italy had ceased to be the heart of the Roman empire, to look for an
8300: arbitrator from afar, began vaguely to regard his coming as a means of
8301: avenging their wrongs and redressing their grievances.
8302: 
8303: And in that rumour Savonarola had heard the assurance that his prophecy
8304: was being verified. What was it that filled the ears of the prophets of
8305: old but the distant tread of foreign armies, coming to do the work of
8306: justice? He no longer looked vaguely to the horizon for the coming
8307: storm: he pointed to the rising cloud. The French army was that new
8308: deluge which was to purify the earth from iniquity; the French king,
8309: Charles the Eighth, was the instrument elected by God, as Cyrus had
8310: been of old, and all men who desired good rather than evil were to
8311: rejoice in his coming. For the scourge would fall destructively on the
8312: impenitent alone. Let any city of Italy, let Florence above
8313: all—Florence beloved of God, since to its ear the warning voice had
8314: been specially sent—repent and turn from its ways, like Nineveh of old,
8315: and the storm-cloud would roll over it and leave only refreshing
8316: raindrops.
8317: 
8318: Fra Girolamo’s word was powerful; yet now that the new Cyrus had
8319: already been three months in Italy, and was not far from the gates of
8320: Florence, his presence was expected there with mixed feelings, in which
8321: fear and distrust certainly predominated. At present it was not
8322: understood that he had redressed any grievances; and the Florentines
8323: clearly had nothing to thank him for. He held their strong frontier
8324: fortresses, which Piero de’ Medici had given up to him without securing
8325: any honourable terms in return; he had done nothing to quell the
8326: alarming revolt of Pisa, which had been encouraged by his presence to
8327: throw off the Florentine yoke; and “orators,” even with a prophet at
8328: their head, could win no assurance from him, except that he would
8329: settle everything when he was once within the walls of Florence. Still,
8330: there was the satisfaction of knowing that the exasperating Piero de’
8331: Medici had been fairly pelted out for the ignominious surrender of the
8332: fortresses, and in that act of energy the spirit of the Republic had
8333: recovered some of its old fire.
8334: 
8335: The preparations for the equivocal guest were not entirely those of a
8336: city resigned to submission. Behind the bright drapery and banners
8337: symbolical of joy, there were preparations of another sort made with
8338: common accord by government and people. Well hidden within walls there
8339: were hired soldiers of the Republic, hastily called in from the
8340: surrounding districts; there were old arms duly furbished, and sharp
8341: tools and heavy cudgels laid carefully at hand, to be snatched up on
8342: short notice; there were excellent boards and stakes to form barricades
8343: upon occasion, and a good supply of stones to make a surprising hail
8344: from the upper windows. Above all, there were people very strongly in
8345: the humour for fighting any personage who might be supposed to have
8346: designs of hectoring over them, they having lately tasted that new
8347: pleasure with much relish. This humour was not diminished by the sight
8348: of occasional parties of Frenchmen, coming beforehand to choose their
8349: quarters, with a hawk, perhaps, on their left wrist, and,
8350: metaphorically speaking, a piece of chalk in their right-hand to mark
8351: Italian doors withal; especially as creditable historians imply that
8352: many sons of France were at that time characterised by something
8353: approaching to a swagger, which must have whetted the Florentine
8354: appetite for a little stone-throwing.
8355: 
8356: And this was the temper of Florence on the morning of the 17th of
8357: November 1494.
8358: 
8359: 
8360: 
8361: 
8362: CHAPTER XXII.
8363: The Prisoners.
8364: 
8365: 
8366: The sky was grey, but that made little difference in the Piazza del
8367: Duomo, which was covered with its holiday sky of blue drapery, and its
8368: constellations of yellow lilies and coats of arms. The sheaves of
8369: banners were unfurled at the angles of the Baptistery, but there was no
8370: carpet yet on the steps of the Duomo, for the marble was being trodden
8371: by numerous feet that were not at all exceptional. It was the hour of
8372: the Advent sermons, and the very same reasons which had flushed the
8373: streets with holiday colour were reasons why the preaching in the Duomo
8374: could least of all be dispensed with.
8375: 
8376: But not all the feet in the Piazza were hastening towards the steps.
8377: People of high and low degree were moving to and fro with the brisk
8378: pace of men who had errands before them; groups of talkers were thickly
8379: scattered, some willing to be late for the sermon, and others content
8380: not to hear it at all.
8381: 
8382: The expression on the faces of these apparent loungers was not that of
8383: men who are enjoying the pleasant laziness of an opening holiday. Some
8384: were in close and eager discussion; others were listening with keen
8385: interest to a single spokesman, and yet from time to time turned round
8386: with a scanning glance at any new passer-by. At the corner, looking
8387: towards the Via de’ Cerretani—just where the artificial rainbow light
8388: of the Piazza ceased, and the grey morning fell on the sombre stone
8389: houses—there was a remarkable cluster of the working people, most of
8390: them bearing on their dress or persons the signs of their daily labour,
8391: and almost all of them carrying some weapon, or some tool which might
8392: serve as a weapon upon occasion. Standing in the grey light of the
8393: street, with bare brawny arms and soiled garments, they made all the
8394: more striking the transition from the brightness of the Piazza. They
8395: were listening to the thin notary, Ser Cioni, who had just paused on
8396: his way to the Duomo. His biting words could get only a contemptuous
8397: reception two years and a half before in the Mercato, but now he spoke
8398: with the more complacent humour of a man whose party is uppermost, and
8399: who is conscious of some influence with the people.
8400: 
8401: “Never talk to me,” he was saying, in his incisive voice, “never talk
8402: to me of bloodthirsty Swiss or fierce French infantry: they might as
8403: well be in the narrow passes of the mountains as in our streets; and
8404: peasants have destroyed the finest armies of our condottieri in time
8405: past, when they had once got them between steep precipices. I tell you,
8406: Florentines need be afraid of no army in their own streets.”
8407: 
8408: “That’s true, Ser Cioni,” said a man whose arms and hands were
8409: discoloured by crimson dye, which looked like blood-stains, and who had
8410: a small hatchet stuck in his belt; “and those French cavaliers, who
8411: came in squaring themselves in their smart doublets the other day, saw
8412: a sample of the dinner we could serve up for them. I was carrying my
8413: cloth in Ognissanti, when I saw my fine Messeri going by, looking round
8414: as if they thought the houses of the Vespucci and the Agli a poor pick
8415: of lodgings for them, and eyeing us Florentines, like top-knotted cocks
8416: as they are, as if they pitied us because we didn’t know how to strut.
8417: ‘Yes, my fine _Galli_,’ says I, ‘stick out your stomachs; I’ve got a
8418: meat-axe in my belt that will go inside you all the easier;’ when
8419: presently the old cow lowed,[1] and I knew something had happened—no
8420: matter what. So I threw my cloth in at the first doorway, and took hold
8421: of my meat-axe and ran after my fine cavaliers towards the Vigna Nuova.
8422: And, ‘What is it, Guccio?’ said I, when he came up with me. ‘I think
8423: it’s the Medici coming back,’ said Guccio. _Bembè_! I expected so! And
8424: up we reared a barricade, and the Frenchmen looked behind and saw
8425: themselves in a trap; and up comes a good swarm of our _Ciompi_[2] and
8426: one of them with a big scythe he had in his hand mowed off one of the
8427: fine cavalier’s feathers:—it’s true! And the lasses peppered a few
8428: stones down to frighten them. However, Piero de’ Medici wasn’t come
8429: after all; and it was a pity; for we’d have left him neither legs nor
8430: wings to go away with again.”
8431: 
8432:  [1] “_La vacca muglia_” was the phrase for the sounding of the great
8433:  bell in the tower of the Palazzo Vecchio.
8434: 
8435: 
8436:  [2] The poorer artisans connected with the wool trade—wool-beaters,
8437:  carders, washers, etcetera.
8438: 
8439: 
8440: “Well spoken, Oddo,” said a young butcher, with his knife at his belt;
8441: “and it’s my belief Piero will be a good while before he wants to come
8442: back, for he looked as frightened as a hunted chicken, when we hustled
8443: and pelted him in the piazza. He’s a coward, else he might have made a
8444: better stand when he’d got his horsemen. But we’ll swallow no Medici
8445: any more, whatever else the French king wants to make us swallow.”
8446: 
8447: “But I like not those French cannon they talk of,” said Goro, none the
8448: less fat for two years’ additional grievances. “San Giovanni defend us!
8449: If Messer Domeneddio means so well by us as your Frate says he does,
8450: Ser Cioni, why shouldn’t he have sent the French another way to
8451: Naples?”
8452: 
8453: “Ay, Goro,” said the dyer; “that’s a question worth putting. Thou art
8454: not such a pumpkin-head as I took thee for. Why, they might have gone
8455: to Naples by Bologna, eh, Ser Cioni? or if they’d gone to Arezzo—we
8456: wouldn’t have minded their going to Arezzo.”
8457: 
8458: “Fools! It will be for the good and glory of Florence,” Ser Cioni
8459: began. But he was interrupted by the exclamation, “Look there!” which
8460: burst from several voices at once, while the faces were all turned to a
8461: party who were advancing along the Via de’ Cerretani.
8462: 
8463: “It’s Lorenzo Tornabuoni, and one of the French noblemen who are in his
8464: house,” said Ser Cioni, in some contempt at this interruption. “He
8465: pretends to look well satisfied—that deep Tornabuoni—but he’s a
8466: Medicean in his heart: mind that.”
8467: 
8468: The advancing party was rather a brilliant one, for there was not only
8469: the distinguished presence of Lorenzo Tornabuoni, and the splendid
8470: costume of the Frenchman with his elaborately displayed white linen and
8471: gorgeous embroidery; there were two other Florentines of high birth in
8472: handsome dresses donned for the coming procession, and on the left-hand
8473: of the Frenchman was a figure that was not to be eclipsed by any amount
8474: of intention or brocade—a figure we have often seen before. He wore
8475: nothing but black, for he was in mourning; but the black was presently
8476: to be covered by a red mantle, for he too was to walk in procession as
8477: Latin Secretary to the Ten. Tito Melema had become conspicuously
8478: serviceable in the intercourse with the French guests, from his
8479: familiarity with Southern Italy, and his readiness in the French
8480: tongue, which he had spoken in his early youth; and he had paid more
8481: than one visit to the French camp at Signa. The lustre of good fortune
8482: was upon him; he was smiling, listening, and explaining, with his usual
8483: graceful unpretentious ease, and only a very keen eye bent on studying
8484: him could have marked a certain amount of change in him which was not
8485: to be accounted for by the lapse of eighteen months. It was that change
8486: which comes from the final departure of moral youthfulness—from the
8487: distinct self-conscious adoption of a part in life. The lines of the
8488: face were as soft as ever, the eyes as pellucid; but something was
8489: gone—something as indefinable as the changes in the morning twilight.
8490: 
8491: The Frenchman was gathering instructions concerning ceremonial before
8492: riding back to Signa, and now he was going to have a final survey of
8493: the Piazza del Duomo, where the royal procession was to pause for
8494: religious purposes. The distinguished party attracted the notice of all
8495: eyes as it entered the piazza, but the gaze was not entirely cordial
8496: and admiring; there were remarks not altogether allusive and mysterious
8497: to the Frenchman’s hoof-shaped shoes—delicate flattery of royal
8498: superfluity in toes; and there was no care that certain snarlings at
8499: “Mediceans” should be strictly inaudible. But Lorenzo Tornabuoni
8500: possessed that power of dissembling annoyance which is demanded in a
8501: man who courts popularity, and Tito, besides his natural disposition to
8502: overcome ill-will by good-humour, had the unimpassioned feeling of the
8503: alien towards names and details that move the deepest passions of the
8504: native.
8505: 
8506: Arrived where they could get a good oblique view of the Duomo, the
8507: party paused. The festoons and devices placed over the central doorway
8508: excited some demur, and Tornabuoni beckoned to Piero di Cosimo, who, as
8509: was usual with him at this hour, was lounging in front of Nello’s shop.
8510: There was soon an animated discussion, and it became highly amusing
8511: from the Frenchman’s astonishment at Piero’s odd pungency of statement,
8512: which Tito translated literally. Even snarling onlookers became
8513: curious, and their faces began to wear the half-smiling,
8514: half-humiliated expression of people who are not within hearing of the
8515: joke which is producing infectious laughter. It was a delightful moment
8516: for Tito, for he was the only one of the party who could have made so
8517: amusing an interpreter, and without any disposition to triumphant
8518: self-gratulation he revelled in the sense that he was an object of
8519: liking—he basked in approving glances. The rainbow light fell about the
8520: laughing group, and the grave church-goers had all disappeared within
8521: the walls. It seemed as if the piazza had been decorated for a real
8522: Florentine holiday.
8523: 
8524: Meanwhile in the grey light of the unadorned streets there were
8525: on-comers who made no show of linen and brocade, and whose humour was
8526: far from merry. Here, too, the French dress and hoofed shoes were
8527: conspicuous, but they were being pressed upon by a larger and larger
8528: number of non-admiring Florentines. In the van of the crowd were three
8529: men in scanty clothing; each had his hands bound together by a cord,
8530: and a rope was fastened round his neck and body, in such a way that he
8531: who held the extremity of the rope might easily check any rebellious
8532: movement by the threat of throttling. The men who held the ropes were
8533: French soldiers, and by broken Italian phrases and strokes from the
8534: knotted end of the rope, they from time to time stimulated their
8535: prisoners to beg. Two of them were obedient, and to every Florentine
8536: they had encountered had held out their bound hands and said in piteous
8537: tones—
8538: 
8539: “For the love of God and the Holy Madonna, give us something towards
8540: our ransom! We are Tuscans: we were made prisoners in Lunigiana.”
8541: 
8542: But the third man remained obstinately silent under all the strokes
8543: from the knotted cord. He was very different in aspect from his two
8544: fellow-prisoners. They were young and hardy, and, in the scant clothing
8545: which the avarice of their captors had left them, looked like vulgar,
8546: sturdy mendicants. But he had passed the boundary of old age, and could
8547: hardly be less than four or five and sixty. His beard, which had grown
8548: long in neglect, and the hair which fell thick and straight round his
8549: baldness, were nearly white. His thickset figure was still firm and
8550: upright, though emaciated, and seemed to express energy in spite of
8551: age—an expression that was partly carried out in the dark eyes and
8552: strong dark eyebrows, which had a strangely isolated intensity of
8553: colour in the midst of his yellow, bloodless, deep-wrinkled face with
8554: its lank grey hairs. And yet there was something fitful in the eyes
8555: which contradicted the occasional flash of energy: after looking round
8556: with quick fierceness at windows and faces, they fell again with a lost
8557: and wandering look. But his lips were motionless, and he held his hands
8558: resolutely down. He would not beg.
8559: 
8560: This sight had been witnessed by the Florentines with growing
8561: exasperation. Many standing at their doors or passing quietly along had
8562: at once given money—some in half-automatic response to an appeal in the
8563: name of God, others in that unquestioning awe of the French soldiery
8564: which had been created by the reports of their cruel warfare, and on
8565: which the French themselves counted as a guarantee of immunity in their
8566: acts of insolence. But as the group had proceeded farther into the
8567: heart of the city, that compliance had gradually disappeared, and the
8568: soldiers found themselves escorted by a gathering troop of men and
8569: boys, who kept up a chorus of exclamations sufficiently intelligible to
8570: foreign ears without any interpreter. The soldiers themselves began to
8571: dislike their position, for, with a strong inclination to use their
8572: weapons, they were checked by the necessity for keeping a secure hold
8573: on their prisoners, and they were now hurrying along in the hope of
8574: finding shelter in a hostelry.
8575: 
8576: “French dogs!”
8577: 
8578: “Bullock-feet!”
8579: 
8580: “Snatch their pikes from them!”
8581: 
8582: “Cut the cords and make them run for their prisoners. They’ll run as
8583: fast as geese—don’t you see they’re web-footed?” These were the cries
8584: which the soldiers vaguely understood to be jeers, and probably
8585: threats. But every one seemed disposed to give invitations of this
8586: spirited kind rather than to act upon them.
8587: 
8588: “Santiddio! here’s a sight!” said the dyer, as soon as he had divined
8589: the meaning of the advancing tumult, “and the fools do nothing but
8590: hoot. Come along!” he added, snatching his axe from his belt, and
8591: running to join the crowd, followed by the butcher and all the rest of
8592: his companions, except Goro, who hastily retreated up a narrow passage.
8593: 
8594: The sight of the dyer, running forward with blood-red arms and axe
8595: uplifted, and with his cluster of rough companions behind him, had a
8596: stimulating effect on the crowd. Not that he did anything else than
8597: pass beyond the soldiers and thrust himself well among his
8598: fellow-citizens, flourishing his axe; but he served as a stirring
8599: symbol of street-fighting, like the waving of a well-known gonfalon.
8600: And the first sign that fire was ready to burst out was something as
8601: rapid as a little leaping tongue of flame: it was an act of the
8602: conjuror’s impish lad Lollo, who was dancing and jeering in front of
8603: the ingenuous boys that made the majority of the crowd. Lollo had no
8604: great compassion for the prisoners, but being conscious of an excellent
8605: knife which was his unfailing companion, it had seemed to him from the
8606: first that to jump forward, cut a rope, and leap back again before the
8607: soldier who held it could use his weapon, would be an amusing and
8608: dexterous piece of mischief. And now, when the people began to hoot and
8609: jostle more vigorously, Lollo felt that his moment was come—he was
8610: close to the eldest prisoner: in an instant he had cut the cord.
8611: 
8612: “Run, old one!” he piped in the prisoner’s ear, as soon as the cord was
8613: in two; and himself set the example of running as if he were helped
8614: along with wings, like a scared fowl.
8615: 
8616: The prisoner’s sensations were not too slow for him to seize the
8617: opportunity: the idea of escape had been continually present with him,
8618: and he had gathered fresh hope from the temper of the crowd. He ran at
8619: once; but his speed would hardly have sufficed for him if the
8620: Florentines had not instantaneously rushed between him and his captor.
8621: He ran on into the piazza, but he quickly heard the tramp of feet
8622: behind him, for the other two prisoners had been released, and the
8623: soldiers were struggling and fighting their way after them, in such
8624: tardigrade fashion as their hoof-shaped shoes would allow—impeded, but
8625: not very resolutely attacked, by the people. One of the two younger
8626: prisoners turned up the Borgo di San Lorenzo, and thus made a partial
8627: diversion of the hubbub; but the main struggle was still towards the
8628: piazza, where all eyes were turned on it with alarmed curiosity. The
8629: cause could not be precisely guessed, for the French dress was screened
8630: by the impeding crowd.
8631: 
8632: “An escape of prisoners,” said Lorenzo Tornabuoni, as he and his party
8633: turned round just against the steps of the Duomo, and saw a prisoner
8634: rushing by them. “The people are not content with having emptied the
8635: Bargello the other day. If there is no other authority in sight they
8636: must fall on the sbirri and secure freedom to thieves. Ah! there is a
8637: French soldier: that is more serious.”
8638: 
8639: The soldier he saw was struggling along on the north side of the
8640: piazza, but the object of his pursuit had taken the other direction.
8641: That object was the eldest prisoner, who had wheeled round the
8642: Baptistery and was running towards the Duomo, determined to take refuge
8643: in that sanctuary rather than trust to his speed. But in mounting the
8644: steps, his foot received a shock; he was precipitated towards the group
8645: of signori, whose backs were turned to him, and was only able to
8646: recover his balance as he clutched one of them by the arm.
8647: 
8648: It was Tito Melema who felt that clutch. He turned his head, and saw
8649: the face of his adoptive father, Baldassarre Calvo, close to his own.
8650: 
8651: The two men looked at each other, silent as death: Baldassarre, with
8652: dark fierceness and a tightening grip of the soiled worn hands on the
8653: velvet-clad arm; Tito, with cheeks and lips all bloodless, fascinated
8654: by terror. It seemed a long while to them—it was but a moment.
8655: 
8656: The first sound Tito heard was the short laugh of Piero di Cosimo, who
8657: stood close by him and was the only person that could see his face.
8658: 
8659: “Ha, ha! I know what a ghost should be now.”
8660: 
8661: “This is another escaped prisoner,” said Lorenzo Tornabuoni. “Who is
8662: he, I wonder?”
8663: 
8664: “_Some madman, surely_,” said Tito.
8665: 
8666: He hardly knew how the words had come to his lips: there are moments
8667: when our passions speak and decide for us, and we seem to stand by and
8668: wonder. They carry in them an inspiration of crime, that in one instant
8669: does the work of long premeditation.
8670: 
8671: The two men had not taken their eyes off each other, and it seemed to
8672: Tito, when he had spoken, that some magical poison had darted from
8673: Baldassarre’s eyes, and that he felt it rushing through his veins. But
8674: the next instant the grasp on his arm had relaxed, and Baldassarre had
8675: disappeared within the church.
8676: 
8677: 
8678: 
8679: 
8680: CHAPTER XXIII.
8681: After-Thoughts.
8682: 
8683: 
8684: “You are easily frightened, though,” said Piero, with another scornful
8685: laugh. “My portrait is not as good as the original. But the old fellow
8686: _had_ a tiger look: I must go into the Duomo and see him again.”
8687: 
8688: “It is not pleasant to be laid hold of by a madman, if madman he be,”
8689: said Lorenzo Tornabuoni, in polite excuse of Tito, “but perhaps he is
8690: only a ruffian. We shall hear. I think we must see if we have authority
8691: enough to stop this disturbance between our people and your
8692: countrymen,” he added, addressing the Frenchman.
8693: 
8694: They advanced toward the crowd with their swords drawn, all the quiet
8695: spectators making an escort for them. Tito went too: it was necessary
8696: that he should know what others knew about Baldassarre, and the first
8697: palsy of terror was being succeeded by the rapid devices to which
8698: mortal danger will stimulate the timid.
8699: 
8700: The rabble of men and boys, more inclined to hoot at the soldier and
8701: torment him than to receive or inflict any serious wounds, gave way at
8702: the approach of signori with drawn swords, and the French soldier was
8703: interrogated. He and his companions had simply brought their prisoners
8704: into the city that they might beg money for their ransom: two of the
8705: prisoners were Tuscan soldiers taken in Lunigiana; the other, an
8706: elderly man, was with a party of Genoese, with whom the French foragers
8707: had come to blows near Fivizzano. He might be mad, but he was harmless.
8708: The soldier knew no more, being unable to understand a word the old man
8709: said. Tito heard so far, but he was deaf to everything else till he was
8710: specially addressed. It was Tornabuoni who spoke.
8711: 
8712: “Will you go back with us, Melema? Or, since Messere is going off to
8713: Signa now, will you wisely follow the fashion of the times and go to
8714: hear the Frate, who will be like the torrent at its height this
8715: morning? It’s what we must all do, you know, if we are to save our
8716: Medicean skins. _I_ should go if I had the leisure.”
8717: 
8718: Tito’s face had recovered its colour now, and he could make an effort
8719: to speak with gaiety.
8720: 
8721: “Of course I am among the admirers of the inspired orator,” he said,
8722: smilingly; “but, unfortunately, I shall be occupied with the Segretario
8723: till the time of the procession.”
8724: 
8725: “_I_ am going into the Duomo to look at that savage old man again,”
8726: said Piero.
8727: 
8728: “Then have the charity to show him to one of the hospitals for
8729: travellers, Piero mio,” said Tornabuoni. “The monks may find out
8730: whether he wants putting into a cage.”
8731: 
8732: The party separated, and Tito took his way to the Palazzo Vecchio,
8733: where he was to find Bartolommeo Scala. It was not a long walk, but,
8734: for Tito, it was stretched out like the minutes of our morning dreams:
8735: the short spaces of street and piazza held memories, and previsions,
8736: and torturing fears, that might have made the history of months. He
8737: felt as if a serpent had begun to coil round his limbs. Baldassarre
8738: living, and in Florence, was a living revenge, which would no more rest
8739: than a winding serpent would rest until it had crushed its prey. It was
8740: not in the nature of that man to let an injury pass unavenged: his love
8741: and his hatred were of that passionate fervour which subjugates all the
8742: rest of the being, and makes a man sacrifice himself to his passion as
8743: if it were a deity to be worshipped with self-destruction. Baldassarre
8744: had relaxed his hold, and had disappeared. Tito knew well how to
8745: interpret that: it meant that the vengeance was to be studied that it
8746: might be sure. If he had not uttered those decisive words—“He is a
8747: madman”—if he could have summoned up the state of mind, the courage,
8748: necessary for avowing his recognition of Baldassarre, would not the
8749: risk have been less? He might have declared himself to have had what he
8750: believed to be positive evidence of Baldassarre’s death; and the only
8751: persons who could ever have had positive knowledge to contradict him,
8752: were Fra Luca, who was dead, and the crew of the companion galley, who
8753: had brought him the news of the encounter with the pirates. The chances
8754: were infinite against Baldassarre’s having met again with any one of
8755: that crew, and Tito thought with bitterness that a timely, well-devised
8756: falsehood might have saved him from any fatal consequences. But to have
8757: told that falsehood would have required perfect self-command in the
8758: moment of a convulsive shock: he seemed to have spoken without any
8759: preconception: the words had leaped forth like a sudden birth that had
8760: been begotten and nourished in the darkness.
8761: 
8762: Tito was experiencing that inexorable law of human souls, that we
8763: prepare ourselves for sudden deeds by the reiterated choice of good or
8764: evil which gradually determines character.
8765: 
8766: There was but one chance for him now; the chance of Baldassarre’s
8767: failure in finding his revenge. And—Tito grasped at a thought more
8768: actively cruel than any he had ever encouraged before: might not his
8769: own unpremeditated words have some truth in them? Enough truth, at
8770: least, to bear him out in his denial of any declaration Baldassarre
8771: might make about him? The old man looked strange and wild; with his
8772: eager heart and brain, suffering was likely enough to have produced
8773: madness. If it were so, the vengeance that strove to inflict disgrace
8774: might be baffled.
8775: 
8776: But there was another form of vengeance not to be baffled by ingenious
8777: lying. Baldassarre belonged to a race to whom the thrust of the dagger
8778: seems almost as natural an impulse as the outleap of the tiger’s
8779: talons. Tito shrank with shuddering dread from disgrace; but he had
8780: also that physical dread which is inseparable from a soft
8781: pleasure-loving nature, and which prevents a man from meeting wounds
8782: and death as a welcome relief from disgrace. His thoughts flew at once
8783: to some hidden defensive armour that might save him from a vengeance
8784: which no subtlety could parry.
8785: 
8786: He wondered at the power of the passionate fear that possessed him. It
8787: was as if he had been smitten with a blighting disease that had
8788: suddenly turned the joyous sense of young life into pain.
8789: 
8790: There was still one resource open to Tito. He might have turned back,
8791: sought Baldassarre again, confessed everything to him—to Romola—to all
8792: the world. But he never thought of that. The repentance which cuts off
8793: all moorings to evil, demands something more than selfish fear. He had
8794: no sense that there was strength and safety in truth; the only strength
8795: he trusted to lay in his ingenuity and his dissimulation. Now that the
8796: first shock, which had called up the traitorous signs of fear, was well
8797: past, he hoped to be prepared for all emergencies by cool deceit—and
8798: defensive armour.
8799: 
8800: It was a characteristic fact in Tito’s experience at this crisis, that
8801: no direct measures for ridding himself of Baldassarre ever occurred to
8802: him. All other possibilities passed through his mind, even to his own
8803: flight from Florence; but he never thought of any scheme for removing
8804: his enemy. His dread generated no active malignity, and he would still
8805: have been glad not to give pain to any mortal. He had simply chosen to
8806: make life easy to himself—to carry his human lot, if possible, in such
8807: a way that it should pinch him nowhere; and the choice had, at various
8808: times, landed him in unexpected positions. The question now was, not
8809: whether he should divide the common pressure of destiny with his
8810: suffering fellow-men; it was whether all the resources of lying would
8811: save him from being crushed by the consequences of that habitual
8812: choice.
8813: 
8814: 
8815: 
8816: 
8817: CHAPTER XXIV.
8818: Inside the Duomo.
8819: 
8820: 
8821: When Baldassarre, with his hands bound together, and the rope round his
8822: neck and body, pushed his way behind the curtain, and saw the interior
8823: of the Duomo before him, he gave a start of astonishment, and stood
8824: still against the doorway. He had expected to see a vast nave empty of
8825: everything but lifeless emblems—side altars with candles unlit, dim
8826: pictures, pale and rigid statues—with perhaps a few worshippers in the
8827: distant choir following a monotonous chant. That was the ordinary
8828: aspect of churches to a man who never went into them with any religious
8829: purpose.
8830: 
8831: And he saw, instead, a vast multitude of warm, living faces, upturned
8832: in breathless silence towards the pulpit, at the angle between the nave
8833: and the choir. The multitude was of all ranks, from magistrates and
8834: dames of gentle nurture to coarsely-clad artisans and country people.
8835: In the pulpit was a Dominican friar, with strong features and dark
8836: hair, preaching with the crucifix in his hand.
8837: 
8838: For the first few minutes Baldassarre noted nothing of his preaching.
8839: Silent as his entrance had been, some eyes near the doorway had been
8840: turned on him with surprise and suspicion. The rope indicated plainly
8841: enough that he was an escaped prisoner, but in that case the church was
8842: a sanctuary which he had a right to claim; his advanced years and look
8843: of wild misery were fitted to excite pity rather than alarm; and as he
8844: stood motionless, with eyes that soon wandered absently from the wide
8845: scene before him to the pavement at his feet, those who had observed
8846: his entrance presently ceased to regard him, and became absorbed again
8847: in the stronger interest of listening to the sermon.
8848: 
8849: Among the eyes that had been turned towards him were Romola’s: she had
8850: entered late through one of the side doors and was so placed that she
8851: had a full view of the main entrance. She had looked long and
8852: attentively at Baldassarre, for grey hairs made a peculiar appeal to
8853: her, and the stamp of some unwonted suffering in the face, confirmed by
8854: the cord round his neck, stirred in her those sensibilities towards the
8855: sorrows of age, which her whole life had tended to develop. She fancied
8856: that his eyes had met hers in their first wandering gaze; but
8857: Baldassarre had not, in reality, noted her; he had only had a startled
8858: consciousness of the general scene, and the consciousness was a mere
8859: flash that made no perceptible break in the fierce tumult of emotion
8860: which the encounter with Tito had created. Images from the past kept
8861: urging themselves upon him like delirious visions strangely blended
8862: with thirst and anguish. No distinct thought for the future could shape
8863: itself in the midst of that fiery passion: the nearest approach to such
8864: thought was the bitter sense of enfeebled powers, and a vague
8865: determination to universal distrust and suspicion. Suddenly he felt
8866: himself vibrating to loud tones, which seemed like the thundering echo
8867: of his own passion. A voice that penetrated his very marrow with its
8868: accent of triumphant certitude was saying—“The day of vengeance is at
8869: hand!”
8870: 
8871: Baldassarre quivered and looked up. He was too distant to see more than
8872: the general aspect of the preacher standing, with his right arm
8873: outstretched, lifting up the crucifix; but he panted for the
8874: threatening voice again as if it had been a promise of bliss. There was
8875: a pause before the preacher spoke again. He gradually lowered his arm.
8876: He deposited the crucifix on the edge of the pulpit, and crossed his
8877: arms over his breast, looking round at the multitude as if he would
8878: meet the glance of every individual face.
8879: 
8880: “All ye in Florence are my witnesses, for I spoke not in a corner. Ye
8881: are my witnesses, that four years ago, when there were yet no signs of
8882: war and tribulation, I preached the coming of the scourge. I lifted up
8883: my voice as a trumpet to the prelates and princes and people of Italy
8884: and said, The cup of your iniquity is full. Behold, the thunder of the
8885: Lord is gathering, and it shall fall and break the cup, and your
8886: iniquity, which seems to you as pleasant wine, shall be poured out upon
8887: you, and shall be as molten lead. And you, O priests, who say, Ha, ha!
8888: there is no Presence in the sanctuary—the Shechinah is nought—the
8889: Mercy-seat is bare: we may sin behind the veil, and who shall punish
8890: us? To you, I said, the presence of God shall be revealed in his temple
8891: as a consuming fire, and your sacred garments shall become a
8892: winding-sheet of flame, and for sweet music there shall be shrieks and
8893: hissing, and for soft couches there shall be thorns, and for the breath
8894: of wantons shall come the pestilence. Trust not in your gold and
8895: silver, trust not in your high fortresses; for, though the walls were
8896: of iron, and the fortresses of adamant, the Most High shall put terror
8897: into your hearts and weakness into your councils, so that you shall be
8898: confounded and flee like women. He shall break in pieces mighty men
8899: without number, and put others in their stead. For God will no longer
8900: endure the pollution of his sanctuary; he will thoroughly purge his
8901: Church.
8902: 
8903: “And forasmuch as it is written that God will do nothing but he
8904: revealeth it to his servants the prophets, he has chosen me, his
8905: unworthy servant, and made his purpose present to my soul in the living
8906: word of the Scriptures, and in the deeds of his providence; and by the
8907: ministry of angels he has revealed it to me in visions. And his word
8908: possesses me so that I am but as the branch of the forest when the wind
8909: of heaven penetrates it, and it is not in me to keep silence, even
8910: though I may be a derision to the scorner. And for four years I have
8911: preached in obedience to the Divine will: in the face of scoffing I
8912: have preached three things, which the Lord has delivered to me: that
8913: _in these times God will regenerate his Church_, and that _before the
8914: regeneration must come the scourge over all Italy_, and that _these
8915: things will come quickly_.
8916: 
8917: “But hypocrites who cloak their hatred of the truth with a show of love
8918: have said to me, ‘Come now, Frate, leave your prophesyings: it is
8919: enough to teach virtue.’ To these I answer: ‘Yes, you say in your
8920: hearts, God lives afar off, and his word is as a parchment written by
8921: dead men, and he deals not as in the days of old, rebuking the nations,
8922: and punishing the oppressors, and smiting the unholy priests as he
8923: smote the sons of Eli. But I cry again in your ears: God is near and
8924: not afar off; his judgments change not. He is the God of armies; the
8925: strong men who go up to battle are his ministers, even as the storm,
8926: and fire, and pestilence. He drives them by the breath of his angels,
8927: and they come upon the chosen land which has forsaken the covenant. And
8928: thou, O Italy, art the chosen land; has not God placed his sanctuary
8929: within thee, and thou hast polluted it? Behold, the ministers of his
8930: wrath are upon thee—they are at thy very doors!’”
8931: 
8932: Savonarola’s voice had been rising in impassioned force up to this
8933: point, when he became suddenly silent, let his hands fall and clasped
8934: them quietly before him. His silence, instead of being the signal for
8935: small movements amongst his audience, seemed to be as strong a spell to
8936: them as his voice. Through the vast area of the cathedral men and women
8937: sat with faces upturned, like breathing statues, till the voice was
8938: heard again in clear low tones.
8939: 
8940: “Yet there is a pause—even as in the days when Jerusalem was destroyed
8941: there was a pause that the children of God might flee from it. There is
8942: a stillness before the storm: lo, there is blackness above, but not a
8943: leaf quakes: the winds are stayed, that the voice of God’s warning may
8944: be heard. Hear it now, O Florence, chosen city in the chosen land!
8945: Repent and forsake evil: do justice: love mercy: put away all
8946: uncleanness from among you, that the spirit of truth and holiness may
8947: fill your souls and breathe through all your streets and habitations,
8948: and then the pestilence shall not enter, and the sword shall pass over
8949: you and leave you unhurt.
8950: 
8951: “For the sword is hanging from the sky; it is quivering; it is about to
8952: fall! _The sword of God upon the earth, swift and sudden_! Did I not
8953: tell you, years ago, that I had beheld the vision and heard the voice?
8954: And behold, it is fulfilled! Is there not a king with his army at your
8955: gates? Does not the earth shake with the tread of horses and the wheels
8956: of swift cannon? Is there not a fierce multitude that can lay bare the
8957: land as with a sharp razor? I tell you the French king with his army is
8958: the minister of God: God shall guide him as the hand guides a sharp
8959: sickle, and the joints of the wicked shall melt before him, and they
8960: shall be mown down as stubble: he that fleeth of them shall not flee
8961: away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered. And the
8962: tyrants who have made to themselves a throne out of the vices of the
8963: multitude, and the unbelieving priests who traffic in the souls of men
8964: and fill the very sanctuary with fornication, shall be hurled from
8965: their soft couches into burning hell; and the pagans and they who
8966: sinned under the old covenant shall stand aloof and say: ‘Lo, these men
8967: have brought the stench of a new wickedness into the everlasting fire.’
8968: 
8969: “But thou, O Florence, take the offered mercy. See! the Cross is held
8970: out to you: come and be healed. Which among the nations of Italy has
8971: had a token like unto yours? The tyrant is driven out from among you:
8972: the men who held a bribe in their left-hand and a rod in the right are
8973: gone forth, and no blood has been spilled. And now put away every other
8974: abomination from among you, and you shall be strong in the strength of
8975: the living God. Wash yourselves from the black pitch of your vices,
8976: which have made you even as the heathens: put away the envy and hatred
8977: that have made your city as a nest of wolves. And there shall no harm
8978: happen to you: and the passage of armies shall be to you as a flight of
8979: birds, and rebellious Pisa shall be given to you again, and famine and
8980: pestilence shall be far from your gates, and you shall be as a beacon
8981: among the nations. But, mark! while you suffer the accursed thing to
8982: lie in the camp you shall be afflicted and tormented, even though a
8983: remnant among you may be saved.”
8984: 
8985: These admonitions and promises had been spoken in an incisive tone of
8986: authority; but in the next sentence the preacher’s voice melted into a
8987: strain of entreaty.
8988: 
8989: “Listen, O people, over whom my heart yearns, as the heart of a mother
8990: over the children she has travailed for! God is my witness that but for
8991: your sakes I would willingly live as a turtle in the depths of the
8992: forest, singing low to my Beloved, who is mine and I am his. For you I
8993: toil, for you I languish, for you my nights are spent in watching, and
8994: my soul melteth away for very heaviness. O Lord, thou knowest I am
8995: willing—I am ready. Take me, stretch me on thy cross: let the wicked
8996: who delight in blood, and rob the poor, and defile the temple of their
8997: bodies, and harden themselves against thy mercy—let them wag their
8998: heads and shoot out the lip at me: let the thorns press upon my brow,
8999: and let my sweat be anguish—I desire to be made like thee in thy great
9000: love. But let me see the fruit of my travail—let this people be saved!
9001: Let me see them clothed in purity: let me hear their voices rise in
9002: concord as the voices of the angels: let them see no wisdom but in thy
9003: eternal law, no beauty but in holiness. Then they shall lead the way
9004: before the nations, and the people from the four winds shall follow
9005: them, and be gathered into the fold of the blessed. For it is thy will,
9006: O God, that the earth shall be converted unto thy law: it is thy will
9007: that wickedness shall cease and love shall reign. Come, O blessed
9008: promise; and behold, I am willing—lay me on the altar: let my blood
9009: flow and the fire consume me; but let my witness be remembered among
9010: men, that iniquity shall not prosper for ever.”
9011: 
9012: During the last appeal, Savonarola had stretched out his arms and
9013: lifted up his eyes to heaven; his strong voice had alternately trembled
9014: with emotion and risen again in renewed energy; but the passion with
9015: which he offered himself as a victim became at last too strong to allow
9016: of further speech, and he ended in a sob. Every changing tone,
9017: vibrating through the audience, shook them into answering emotion.
9018: There were plenty among them who had very moderate faith in the Frate’s
9019: prophetic mission, and who in their cooler moments loved him little;
9020: nevertheless, they too were carried along by the great wave of feeling
9021: which gathered its force from sympathies that lay deeper than all
9022: theory. A loud responding sob rose at once from the wide multitude,
9023: while Savonarola had fallen on his knees and buried his face in his
9024: mantle. He felt in that moment the rapture and glory of martyrdom
9025: without its agony.
9026: 
9027: In that great sob of the multitude Baldassarre’s had mingled. Among all
9028: the human beings present, there was perhaps not one whose frame
9029: vibrated more strongly than his to the tones and words of the preacher;
9030: but it had vibrated like a harp of which all the strings had been
9031: wrenched away except one. That threat of a fiery inexorable
9032: vengeance—of a future into which the hated sinner might be pursued and
9033: held by the avenger in an eternal grapple, had come to him like the
9034: promise of an unquenchable fountain to unquenchable thirst. The
9035: doctrines of the sages, the old contempt for priestly superstitions,
9036: had fallen away from his soul like a forgotten language: if he could
9037: have remembered them, what answer could they have given to his great
9038: need like the answer given by this voice of energetic conviction? The
9039: thunder of denunciation fell on his passion-wrought nerves with all the
9040: force of self-evidence: his thought never went beyond it into
9041: questions—he was possessed by it as the war-horse is possessed by the
9042: clash of sounds. No word that was not a threat touched his
9043: consciousness; he had no fibre to be thrilled by it. But the fierce
9044: exultant delight to which he was moved by the idea of perpetual
9045: vengeance found at once a climax and a relieving outburst in the
9046: preacher’s words of self-sacrifice. To Baldassarre those words only
9047: brought the vague triumphant sense that he too was devoting
9048: himself—signing with his own blood the deed by which he gave himself
9049: over to an unending fire, that would seem but coolness to his burning
9050: hatred.
9051: 
9052: “I rescued him—I cherished him—if I might clutch his heart-strings for
9053: ever! Come, O blessed promise! Let my blood flow; let the fire consume
9054: me!”
9055: 
9056: The one cord vibrated to its utmost. Baldassarre clutched his own
9057: palms, driving his long nails into them, and burst into a sob with the
9058: rest.
9059: 
9060: 
9061: 
9062: 
9063: CHAPTER XXV.
9064: Outside the Duomo.
9065: 
9066: 
9067: While Baldassarre was possessed by the voice of Savonarola, he had not
9068: noticed that another man had entered through the doorway behind him,
9069: and stood not far off observing him. It was Piero di Cosimo, who took
9070: no heed of the preaching, having come solely to look at the escaped
9071: prisoner. During the pause, in which the preacher and his audience had
9072: given themselves up to inarticulate emotion, the new-comer advanced and
9073: touched Baldassarre on the arm. He looked round with the tears still
9074: slowly rolling down his face, but with a vigorous sigh, as if he had
9075: done with that outburst. The painter spoke to him in a low tone—
9076: 
9077: “Shall I cut your cords for you? I have heard how you were made
9078: prisoner.”
9079: 
9080: Baldassarre did not reply immediately; he glanced suspiciously at the
9081: officious stranger. At last he said, “If you will.”
9082: 
9083: “Better come outside,” said Piero.
9084: 
9085: Baldassarre again looked at him suspiciously; and Piero, partly
9086: guessing his thought, smiled, took out a knife, and cut the cords. He
9087: began to think that the idea of the prisoner’s madness was not
9088: improbable, there was something so peculiar in the expression of his
9089: face. “Well,” he thought, “if he does any mischief, he’ll soon get tied
9090: up again. The poor devil shall have a chance, at least.”
9091: 
9092: “You are afraid of me,” he said again, in an undertone; “you don’t want
9093: to tell me anything about yourself.”
9094: 
9095: Baldassarre was folding his arms in enjoyment of the long-absent
9096: muscular sensation. He answered Piero with a less suspicious look and a
9097: tone which had some quiet decision in it.
9098: 
9099: “No, I have nothing to tell.”
9100: 
9101: “As you please,” said Piero, “but perhaps you want shelter, and may not
9102: know how hospitable we Florentines are to visitors with torn doublets
9103: and empty stomachs. There’s an hospital for poor travellers outside all
9104: our gates, and, if you liked, I could put you in the way to one.
9105: There’s no danger from your French soldier. He has been sent off.”
9106: 
9107: Baldassarre nodded, and turned in silent acceptance of the offer, and
9108: he and Piero left the church together.
9109: 
9110: “You wouldn’t like to sit to me for your portrait, should you?” said
9111: Piero, as they went along the Via dell’ Oriuolo, on the way to the gate
9112: of Santa Croce. “I am a painter: I would give you money to get your
9113: portrait.”
9114: 
9115: The suspicion returned into Baldassarre’s glance, as he looked at
9116: Piero, and said decidedly, “No.”
9117: 
9118: “Ah!” said the painter, curtly. “Well, go straight on, and you’ll find
9119: the Porta Santa Croce, and outside it there’s an hospital for
9120: travellers. So you’ll not accept any service from me?”
9121: 
9122: “I give you thanks for what you have done already. I need no more.”
9123: 
9124: “It is well,” said Piero, with a shrug, and they turned away from each
9125: other.
9126: 
9127: “A mysterious old tiger!” thought the artist, “well worth painting.
9128: Ugly—with deep lines—looking as if the plough and the harrow had gone
9129: over his heart. A fine contrast to my bland and smiling Messer Greco—my
9130: _Bacco trionfante_, who has married the fair Antigone in contradiction
9131: to all history and fitness. Aha! his scholar’s blood curdled
9132: uncomfortably at the old fellow’s clutch!” When Piero re-entered the
9133: Piazza del Duomo the multitude who had been listening to Fra Girolamo
9134: were pouring out from all the doors, and the haste they made to go on
9135: their several ways was a proof how important they held the preaching
9136: which had detained them from the other occupations of the day. The
9137: artist leaned against an angle of the Baptistery and watched the
9138: departing crowd, delighting in the variety of the garb and of the keen
9139: characteristic faces—faces such as Masaccio had painted more than fifty
9140: years before: such as Domenico Ghirlandajo had not yet quite left off
9141: painting.
9142: 
9143: This morning was a peculiar occasion, and the Frate’s audience, always
9144: multifarious, had represented even more completely than usual the
9145: various classes and political parties of Florence. There were men of
9146: high birth, accustomed to public charges at home and abroad, who had
9147: become newly conspicuous not only as enemies of the Medici and friends
9148: of popular government, but as thorough Piagnoni, espousing to the
9149: utmost the doctrines and practical teaching of the Frate, and
9150: frequenting San Marco as the seat of another Samuel: some of them men
9151: of authoritative and handsome presence, like Francesco Valori, and
9152: perhaps also of a hot and arrogant temper, very much gratified by an
9153: immediate divine authority for bringing about freedom in their own way;
9154: others, like Soderini, with less of the ardent Piagnone, and more of
9155: the wise politician. There were men, also of family, like Piero
9156: Capponi, simply brave undoctrinal lovers of a sober republican liberty,
9157: who preferred fighting to arguing, and had no particular reasons for
9158: thinking any ideas false that kept out the Medici and made room for
9159: public spirit. At their elbows were doctors of law whose studies of
9160: Accursius and his brethren had not so entirely consumed their ardour as
9161: to prevent them from becoming enthusiastic Piagnoni: Messer Luca
9162: Corsini himself, for example, who on a memorable occasion yet to come
9163: was to raise his learned arms in street stone-throwing for the cause of
9164: religion, freedom, and the Frate. And among the dignities who carried
9165: their black lucco or furred mantle with an air of habitual authority,
9166: there was an abundant sprinkling of men with more contemplative and
9167: sensitive faces: scholars inheriting such high names as Strozzi and
9168: Acciajoli, who were already minded to take the cowl and join the
9169: community of San Marco; artists, wrought to a new and higher ambition
9170: by the teaching of Savonarola, like that young painter who had lately
9171: surpassed himself in his fresco of the divine child on the wall of the
9172: Frate’s bare cell—unconscious yet that he would one day himself wear
9173: the tonsure and the cowl, and be called Fra Bartolommeo. There was the
9174: mystic poet Girolamo Benevieni hastening, perhaps, to carry tidings of
9175: the beloved Frate’s speedy coming to his friend Pico della Mirandola,
9176: who was never to see the light of another morning. There were well-born
9177: women attired with such scrupulous plainness that their more refined
9178: grace was the chief distinction between them and their less
9179: aristocratic sisters. There was a predominant proportion of the genuine
9180: _popolani_ or middle class, belonging both to the Major and Minor Arts,
9181: conscious of purses threatened by war-taxes. And more striking and
9182: various, perhaps, than all the other classes of the Frate’s disciples,
9183: there was the long stream of poorer tradesmen and artisans, whose faith
9184: and hope in his Divine message varied from the rude and
9185: undiscriminating trust in him as the friend of the poor and the enemy
9186: of the luxurious oppressive rich, to that eager tasting of all the
9187: subtleties of biblical interpretation which takes a peculiarly strong
9188: hold on the sedentary artisan, illuminating the long dim spaces beyond
9189: the board where he stitches, with a pale flame that seems to him the
9190: light of Divine science.
9191: 
9192: But among these various disciples of the Frate were scattered many who
9193: were not in the least his disciples. Some were Mediceans who had
9194: already, from motives of fear and policy, begun to show the presiding
9195: spirit of the popular party a feigned deference. Others were sincere
9196: advocates of a free government, but regarded Savonarola simply as an
9197: ambitious monk—half sagacious, half fanatical—who had made himself a
9198: powerful instrument with the people, and must be accepted as an
9199: important social fact. There were even some of his bitter enemies:
9200: members of the old aristocratic anti-Medicean party—determined to try
9201: and get the reins once more tight in the hands of certain chief
9202: families; or else licentious young men, who detested him as the killjoy
9203: of Florence. For the sermons in the Duomo had already become political
9204: incidents, attracting the ears of curiosity and malice, as well as of
9205: faith. The men of ideas, like young Niccolò Macchiavelli, went to
9206: observe and write reports to friends away in country villas; the men of
9207: appetites, like Dolfo Spini, bent on hunting down the Frate, as a
9208: public nuisance who made game scarce, went to feed their hatred and lie
9209: in wait for grounds of accusation.
9210: 
9211: Perhaps, while no preacher ever had a more massive influence than
9212: Savonarola, no preacher ever had more heterogeneous materials to work
9213: upon. And one secret of the massive influence lay in the highly mixed
9214: character of his preaching. Baldassarre, wrought into an ecstasy of
9215: self-martyring revenge, was only an extreme case among the partial and
9216: narrow sympathies of that audience. In Savonarola’s preaching there
9217: were strains that appealed to the very finest susceptibilities of men’s
9218: natures, and there were elements that gratified low egoism, tickled
9219: gossiping curiosity, and fascinated timorous superstition. His need of
9220: personal predominance, his labyrinthine allegorical interpretations of
9221: the Scriptures, his enigmatic visions, and his false certitude about
9222: the Divine intentions, never ceased, in his own large soul, to be
9223: ennobled by that fervid piety, that passionate sense of the infinite,
9224: that active sympathy, that clear-sighted demand for the subjection of
9225: selfish interests to the general good, which he had in common with the
9226: greatest of mankind. But for the mass of his audience all the pregnancy
9227: of his preaching lay in his strong assertion of supernatural claims, in
9228: his denunciatory visions, in the false certitude which gave his sermons
9229: the interest of a political bulletin; and having once held that
9230: audience in his mastery, it was necessary to his nature—it was
9231: necessary for their welfare—that he should _keep_ the mastery. The
9232: effect was inevitable. No man ever struggled to retain power over a
9233: mixed multitude without suffering vitiation; his standard must be their
9234: lower needs and not his own best insight.
9235: 
9236: The mysteries of human character have seldom been presented in a way
9237: more fitted to check the judgments of facile knowingness than in
9238: Girolamo Savonarola; but we can give him a reverence that needs no
9239: shutting of the eyes to fact, if we regard his life as a drama in which
9240: there were great inward modifications accompanying the outward changes.
9241: And up to this period, when his more direct action on political affairs
9242: had only just begun, it is probable that his imperious need of
9243: ascendancy had burned undiscernibly in the strong flame of his zeal for
9244: God and man.
9245: 
9246: It was the fashion of old, when an ox was led out for sacrifice to
9247: Jupiter, to chalk the dark spots, and give the offering a false show of
9248: unblemished whiteness. Let us fling away the chalk, and boldly say,—the
9249: victim is spotted, but it is not therefore in vain that his mighty
9250: heart is laid on the altar of men’s highest hopes.
9251: 
9252: 
9253: 
9254: 
9255: CHAPTER XXVI.
9256: The Garment of Fear.
9257: 
9258: 
9259: At six o’clock that evening most people in Florence were glad the
9260: entrance of the new Charlemagne was fairly over. Doubtless when the
9261: roll of drums, the blast of trumpets, and the tramp of horses along the
9262: Pisan road began to mingle with the pealing of the excited bells, it
9263: was a grand moment for those who were stationed on turreted roofs, and
9264: could see the long-winding terrible pomp on the background of the green
9265: hills and valley. There was no sunshine to light up the splendour of
9266: banners, and spears, and plumes, and silken surcoats, but there was no
9267: thick cloud of dust to hide it, and as the picked troops advanced into
9268: close view, they could be seen all the more distinctly for the absence
9269: of dancing glitter. Tall and tough Scotch archers, Swiss halberdiers
9270: fierce and ponderous, nimble Gascons ready to wheel and climb, cavalry
9271: in which each man looked like a knight-errant with his indomitable
9272: spear and charger—it was satisfactory to be assured that they would
9273: injure nobody but the enemies of God! With that confidence at heart it
9274: was a less dubious pleasure to look at the array of strength and
9275: splendour in nobles and knights, and youthful pages of choice
9276: lineage—at the bossed and jewelled sword-hilts, at the satin scarfs
9277: embroidered with strange symbolical devices of pious or gallant
9278: meaning, at the gold chains and jewelled aigrettes, at the gorgeous
9279: horse-trappings and brocaded mantles, and at the transcendent canopy
9280: carried by select youths above the head of the Most Christian King. To
9281: sum up with an old diarist, whose spelling and diction halted a little
9282: behind the wonders of this royal visit,—“_fù gran magnificenza_.”
9283: 
9284: But for the Signoria, who had been waiting on their platform against
9285: the gates, and had to march out at the right moment, with their orator
9286: in front of them, to meet the mighty guest, the grandeur of the scene
9287: had been somewhat screened by unpleasant sensations. If Messer Luca
9288: Corsini could have had a brief Latin welcome depending from his mouth
9289: in legible characters, it would have been less confusing when the rain
9290: came on, and created an impatience in men and horses that broke off the
9291: delivery of his well-studied periods, and reduced the representatives
9292: of the scholarly city to offer a makeshift welcome in impromptu French.
9293: But that sudden confusion had created a great opportunity for Tito. As
9294: one of the secretaries he was among the officials who were stationed
9295: behind the Signoria, and with whom these highest dignities were
9296: promiscuously thrown when pressed upon by the horses.
9297: 
9298: “Somebody step forward and say a few words in French,” said Soderini.
9299: But no one of high importance chose to risk a second failure. “You,
9300: Francesco Gaddi—you can speak.” But Gaddi, distrusting his own
9301: promptness, hung back, and pushing Tito, said, “You, Melema.”
9302: 
9303: Tito stepped forward in an instant, and, with the air of profound
9304: deference that came as naturally to him as walking, said the few
9305: needful words in the name of the Signoria; then gave way gracefully,
9306: and let the king pass on. His presence of mind, which had failed him in
9307: the terrible crisis of the morning, had been a ready instrument this
9308: time. It was an excellent livery servant that never forsook him when
9309: danger was not visible. But when he was complimented on his opportune
9310: service, he laughed it off as a thing of no moment, and to those who
9311: had not witnessed it, let Gaddi have the credit of the improvised
9312: welcome. No wonder Tito was popular: the touchstone by which men try us
9313: is most often their own vanity.
9314: 
9315: Other things besides the oratorical welcome had turned out rather worse
9316: than had been expected. If everything had happened according to
9317: ingenious preconceptions, the Florentine procession of clergy and laity
9318: would not have found their way choked up and been obliged to take a
9319: makeshift course through the back streets, so as to meet the king at
9320: the Cathedral only. Also, if the young monarch under the canopy, seated
9321: on his charger with his lance upon his thigh, had looked more like a
9322: Charlemagne and less like a hastily modelled grotesque, the imagination
9323: of his admirers would have been much assisted. It might have been
9324: wished that the scourge of Italian wickedness and “Champion of the
9325: honour of women” had had a less miserable leg, and only the normal sum
9326: of toes; that his mouth had been of a less reptilian width of slit, his
9327: nose and head of a less exorbitant outline. But the thin leg rested on
9328: cloth of gold and pearls, and the face was only an interruption of a
9329: few square inches in the midst of black velvet and gold, and the blaze
9330: of rubies, and the brilliant tints of the embroidered and bepearled
9331: canopy,—“_fù gran magnificenza_.”
9332: 
9333: And the people had cried _Francia, Francia_! with an enthusiasm
9334: proportioned to the splendour of the canopy which they had torn to
9335: pieces as their spoil, according to immemorial custom; royal lips had
9336: duly kissed the altar; and after all mischances the royal person and
9337: retinue were lodged in the Palace of the Via Larga, the rest of the
9338: nobles and gentry were dispersed among the great houses of Florence,
9339: and the terrible soldiery were encamped in the Prato and other open
9340: quarters. The business of the day was ended.
9341: 
9342: But the streets still presented a surprising aspect, such as
9343: Florentines had not seen before under the November stars. Instead of a
9344: gloom unbroken except by a lamp burning feebly here and there before a
9345: saintly image at the street-corners, or by a stream of redder light
9346: from an open doorway, there were lamps suspended at the windows of all
9347: houses, so that men could walk along no less securely and commodiously
9348: than by day,—_fù gran magnificenza_.
9349: 
9350: Along those illuminated streets Tito Melema was walking at about eight
9351: o’clock in the evening, on his way homeward. He had been exerting
9352: himself throughout the day under the pressure of hidden anxieties, and
9353: had at last made his escape unnoticed from the midst of after-supper
9354: gaiety. Once at leisure thoroughly to face and consider his
9355: circumstances, he hoped that he could so adjust himself to them and to
9356: all probabilities as to get rid of his childish fear. If he had only
9357: not been wanting in the presence of mind necessary to recognise
9358: Baldassarre under that surprise!—it would have been happier for him on
9359: all accounts; for he still winced under the sense that he was
9360: deliberately inflicting suffering on his father: he would very much
9361: have preferred that Baldassarre should be prosperous and happy. But he
9362: had left himself no second path now: there could be no conflict any
9363: longer: the only thing he had to do was to take care of himself.
9364: 
9365: While these thoughts were in his mind he was advancing from the Piazza
9366: di Santa Croce along the Via dei Benci, and as he neared the angle
9367: turning into the Borgo Santa Croce his ear was struck by a music which
9368: was not that of evening revelry, but of vigorous labour—the music of
9369: the anvil. Tito gave a slight start and quickened his pace, for the
9370: sounds had suggested a welcome thought. He knew that they came from the
9371: workshop of Niccolò Caparra, famous resort of all Florentines who cared
9372: for curious and beautiful iron-work.
9373: 
9374: “What makes the giant at work so late?” thought Tito. “But so much the
9375: better for me. I can do that little bit of business to-night instead of
9376: to-morrow morning.”
9377: 
9378: Preoccupied as he was, he could not help pausing a moment in admiration
9379: as he came in front of the workshop. The wide doorway, standing at the
9380: truncated angle of a great block or “isle” of houses, was surmounted by
9381: a loggia roofed with fluted tiles, and supported by stone columns with
9382: roughly carved capitals. Against the red light framed in by the outline
9383: of the fluted tiles and columns stood in black relief the grand figure
9384: of Niccolò, with his huge arms in rhythmic rise and fall, first hiding
9385: and then disclosing the profile of his firm mouth and powerful brow.
9386: Two slighter ebony figures, one at the anvil, the other at the bellows,
9387: served to set off his superior massiveness.
9388: 
9389: Tito darkened the doorway with a very different outline, standing in
9390: silence, since it was useless to speak until Niccolò should deign to
9391: pause and notice him. That was not until the smith had beaten the head
9392: of an axe to the due sharpness of edge and dismissed it from his anvil.
9393: But in the meantime Tito had satisfied himself by a glance round the
9394: shop that the object of which he was in search had not disappeared.
9395: 
9396: Niccolò gave an unceremonious but good-humoured nod as he turned from
9397: the anvil and rested his hammer on his hip.
9398: 
9399: “What is it, Messer Tito? Business?”
9400: 
9401: “Assuredly, Niccolò; else I should not have ventured to interrupt you
9402: when you are working out of hours, since I take that as a sign that
9403: your work is pressing.”
9404: 
9405: “I’ve been at the same work all day—making axes and spear-heads. And
9406: every fool that has passed my shop has put his pumpkin-head in to say,
9407: ‘Niccolò, wilt thou not come and see the King of France and his
9408: soldiers?’ and I’ve answered, ‘No: I don’t want to see their faces—I
9409: want to see their backs.’”
9410: 
9411: “Are you making arms for the citizens, then, Niccolò, that they may
9412: have something better than rusty scythes and spits in case of an
9413: uproar?”
9414: 
9415: “We shall see. Arms are good, and Florence is likely to want them. The
9416: Frate tells us we shall get Pisa again, and I hold with the Frate; but
9417: I should be glad to know how the promise is to be fulfilled, if we
9418: don’t get plenty of good weapons forged? The Frate sees a long way
9419: before him; that I believe. But he doesn’t see birds caught with
9420: winking at them, as some of our people try to make out. He sees sense,
9421: and not nonsense. But you’re a bit of a Medicean, Messer Tito Melema.
9422: Ebbene! so I’ve been myself in my time, before the cask began to run
9423: sour. What’s your business?”
9424: 
9425: “Simply to know the price of that fine coat of mail I saw hanging up
9426: here the other day. I want to buy it for a certain personage who needs
9427: a protection of that sort under his doublet.”
9428: 
9429: “Let him come and buy it himself, then,” said Niccolò, bluntly. “I’m
9430: rather nice about what I sell, and whom I sell to. I like to know who’s
9431: my customer.”
9432: 
9433: “I know your scruples, Niccolò. But that is only defensive armour: it
9434: can hurt nobody.”
9435: 
9436: “True: but it may make the man who wears it feel himself all the safer
9437: if he should want to hurt somebody. No, no; it’s not my own work; but
9438: it’s fine work of Maso of Brescia; I should be loth for it to cover the
9439: heart of a scoundrel. I must know who is to wear it.”
9440: 
9441: “Well, then, to be plain with you, Niccolò mio, I want it myself,” said
9442: Tito, knowing it was useless to try persuasion. “The fact is, I am
9443: likely to have a journey to take—and you know what journeying is in
9444: these times. You don’t suspect _me_ of treason against the Republic?”
9445: 
9446: “No, I know no harm of you,” said Niccolò, in his blunt way again. “But
9447: have you the money to pay for the coat? For you’ve passed my shop often
9448: enough to know my sign: you’ve seen the burning account-books. I trust
9449: nobody. The price is twenty florins, and that’s because it’s
9450: second-hand. You’re not likely to have so much money with you. Let it
9451: be till to-morrow.”
9452: 
9453: “I happen to have the money,” said Tito, who had been winning at play
9454: the day before, and had not emptied his purse. “I’ll carry the armour
9455: home with me.”
9456: 
9457: Niccolò reached down the finely-wrought coat, which fell together into
9458: little more than two handfuls.
9459: 
9460: “There, then,” he said, when the florins had been told down on his
9461: palm. “Take the coat. It’s made to cheat sword, or poniard, or arrow.
9462: But, for my part, I would never put such a thing on. It’s like carrying
9463: fear about with one.”
9464: 
9465: Niccolò’s words had an unpleasant intensity of meaning for Tito. But he
9466: smiled and said—
9467: 
9468: “Ah, Niccolò, we scholars are all cowards. Handling the pen doesn’t
9469: thicken the arm as your hammer-wielding does. Addio!”
9470: 
9471: He folded the armour under his mantle, and hastened across the Ponte
9472: Rubaconte.
9473: 
9474: 
9475: 
9476: 
9477: CHAPTER XXVII.
9478: The Young Wife.
9479: 
9480: 
9481: While Tito was hastening across the bridge with the new-bought armour
9482: under his mantle, Romola was pacing up and down the old library,
9483: thinking of him and longing for his return.
9484: 
9485: It was but a few fair faces that had not looked forth from windows that
9486: day to see the entrance of the French king and his nobles. One of the
9487: few was Romola’s. She had been present at no festivities since her
9488: father had died—died quite suddenly in his chair, three months before.
9489: 
9490: “Is not Tito coming to write?” he had said, when the bell had long ago
9491: sounded the usual hour in the evening. He had not asked before, from
9492: dread of a negative; but Romola had seen by his listening face and
9493: restless movements that nothing else was in his mind.
9494: 
9495: “No, father, he had to go to a supper at the cardinal’s: you know he is
9496: wanted so much by every one,” she answered, in a tone of gentle excuse.
9497: 
9498: “Ah! then perhaps he will bring some positive word about the library;
9499: the cardinal promised last week,” said Bardo, apparently pacified by
9500: this hope.
9501: 
9502: He was silent a little while; then, suddenly flushing, he said—
9503: 
9504: “I must go on without him, Romola. Get the pen. He has brought me no
9505: new text to comment on; but I must say what I want to say about the New
9506: Platonists. I shall die and nothing will have been done. Make haste, my
9507: Romola.”
9508: 
9509: “I am ready, father,” she said, the next minute, holding the pen in her
9510: hand.
9511: 
9512: But there was silence. Romola took no note of this for a little while,
9513: accustomed to pauses in dictation; and when at last she looked round
9514: inquiringly, there was no change of attitude.
9515: 
9516: “I am quite ready, father!”
9517: 
9518: Still Bardo was silent, and his silence was never again broken.
9519: 
9520: Romola looked back on that hour with some indignation against herself,
9521: because even with the first outburst of her sorrow there had mingled
9522: the irrepressible thought, “Perhaps my life with Tito will be more
9523: perfect now.”
9524: 
9525: For the dream of a triple life with an undivided sum of happiness had
9526: not been quite fulfilled. The rainbow-tinted shower of sweets, to have
9527: been perfectly typical, should have had some invisible seeds of
9528: bitterness mingled with them; the crowned Ariadne, under the snowing
9529: roses, had felt more and more the presence of unexpected thorns. It was
9530: not Tito’s fault, Romola had continually assured herself. He was still
9531: all gentleness to her, and to her father also. But it was in the nature
9532: of things—she saw it clearly now—it was in the nature of things that no
9533: one but herself could go on month after month, and year after year,
9534: fulfilling patiently all her father’s monotonous exacting demands. Even
9535: she, whose sympathy with her father had made all the passion and
9536: religion of her young years, had not always been patient, had been
9537: inwardly very rebellious. It was true that before their marriage, and
9538: even for some time after, Tito had seemed more unwearying than herself;
9539: but then, of course, the effort had the ease of novelty. We assume a
9540: load with confident readiness, and up to a certain point the growing
9541: irksomeness of pressure is tolerable; but at last the desire for relief
9542: can no longer be resisted. Romola said to herself that she had been
9543: very foolish and ignorant in her girlish time: she was wiser now, and
9544: would make no unfair demands on the man to whom she had given her best
9545: woman’s love and worship. The breath of sadness that still cleaved to
9546: her lot while she saw her father month after month sink from elation
9547: into new disappointment as Tito gave him less and less of his time, and
9548: made bland excuses for not continuing his own share of the joint
9549: work—that sadness was no fault of Tito’s, she said, but rather of their
9550: inevitable destiny. If he stayed less and less with her, why, that was
9551: because they could hardly ever be alone. His caresses were no less
9552: tender: if she pleaded timidly on any one evening that he should stay
9553: with her father instead of going to another engagement which was not
9554: peremptory, he excused himself with such charming gaiety, he seemed to
9555: linger about her with such fond playfulness before he could quit her,
9556: that she could only feel a little heartache in the midst of her love,
9557: and then go to her father and try to soften his vexation and
9558: disappointment. But all the while inwardly her imagination was busy
9559: trying to see how Tito could be as good as she had thought he was, and
9560: yet find it impossible to sacrifice those pleasures of society which
9561: were necessarily more vivid to a bright creature like him than to the
9562: common run of men. She herself would have liked more gaiety, more
9563: admiration: it was true, she gave it up willingly for her father’s
9564: sake—she would have given up much more than that for the sake even of a
9565: slight wish on Tito’s part. It was clear that their natures differed
9566: widely; but perhaps it was no more than the inherent difference between
9567: man and woman, that made her affections more absorbing. If there were
9568: any other difference she tried to persuade herself that the inferiority
9569: was on her side. Tito was really kinder than she was, better tempered,
9570: less proud and resentful; he had no angry retorts, he met all
9571: complaints with perfect sweetness; he only escaped as quietly as he
9572: could from things that were unpleasant.
9573: 
9574: It belongs to every large nature, when it is not under the immediate
9575: power of some strong unquestioning emotion, to suspect itself, and
9576: doubt the truth of its own impressions, conscious of possibilities
9577: beyond its own horizon. And Romola was urged to doubt herself the more
9578: by the necessity of interpreting her disappointment in her life with
9579: Tito so as to satisfy at once her love and her pride. Disappointment?
9580: Yes, there was no other milder word that would tell the truth. Perhaps
9581: all women had to suffer the disappointment of ignorant hopes, if she
9582: only knew their experience. Still, there had been something peculiar in
9583: her lot: her relation to her father had claimed unusual sacrifices from
9584: her husband. Tito had once thought that his love would make those
9585: sacrifices easy; his love had not been great enough for that. She was
9586: not justified in resenting a self-delusion. No! resentment must not
9587: rise: all endurance seemed easy to Romola rather than a state of mind
9588: in which she would admit to herself that Tito acted unworthily. If she
9589: had felt a new heartache in the solitary hours with her father through
9590: the last months of his life, it had been by no inexcusable fault of her
9591: husband’s; and now—it was a hope that would make its presence felt even
9592: in the first moments when her father’s place was empty—there was no
9593: longer any importunate claim to divide her from Tito; their young lives
9594: would flow in one current, and their true marriage would begin.
9595: 
9596: But the sense of something like guilt towards her father in a hope that
9597: grew out of his death, gave all the more force to the anxiety with
9598: which she dwelt on the means of fulfilling his supreme wish. That piety
9599: towards his memory was all the atonement she could make now for a
9600: thought that seemed akin to joy at his loss. The laborious simple life,
9601: pure from vulgar corrupting ambitions, embittered by the frustration of
9602: the dearest hopes, imprisoned at last in total darkness—a long
9603: seed-time without a harvest—was at an end now, and all that remained of
9604: it besides the tablet in Sante Croce and the unfinished commentary on
9605: Tito’s text, was the collection of manuscripts and antiquities, the
9606: fruit of half a century’s toil and frugality. The fulfilment of her
9607: father’s lifelong ambition about this library was a sacramental
9608: obligation for Romola.
9609: 
9610: The precious relic was safe from creditors, for when the deficit
9611: towards their payment had been ascertained, Bernardo del Nero, though
9612: he was far from being among the wealthiest Florentines, had advanced
9613: the necessary sum of about a thousand florins—a large sum in those
9614: days—accepting a lien on the collection as a security.
9615: 
9616: “The State will repay me,” he had said to Romola, making light of the
9617: service, which had really cost him some inconvenience. “If the cardinal
9618: finds a building, as he seems to say he will, our Signoria may consent
9619: to do the rest. I have no children, I can afford the risk.”
9620: 
9621: But within the last ten days all hopes in the Medici had come to an
9622: end: and the famous Medicean collections in the Via Larga were
9623: themselves in danger of dispersion. French agents had already begun to
9624: see that such very fine antique gems as Lorenzo had collected belonged
9625: by right to the first nation in Europe; and the Florentine State, which
9626: had got possession of the Medicean library, was likely to be glad of a
9627: customer for it. With a war to recover Pisa hanging over it, and with
9628: the certainty of having to pay large subsidies to the French king, the
9629: State was likely to prefer money to manuscripts.
9630: 
9631: To Romola these grave political changes had gathered their chief
9632: interest from their bearing on the fulfilment of her father’s wish. She
9633: had been brought up in learned seclusion from the interests of actual
9634: life, and had been accustomed to think of heroic deeds and great
9635: principles as something antithetic to the vulgar present, of the Pnyx
9636: and the Forum as something more worthy of attention than the councils
9637: of living Florentine men. And now the expulsion of the Medici meant
9638: little more for her than the extinction of her best hope about her
9639: father’s library. The times, she knew, were unpleasant for friends of
9640: the Medici, like her godfather and Tito: superstitious shopkeepers and
9641: the stupid rabble were full of suspicions; but her new keen interest in
9642: public events, in the outbreak of war, in the issue of the French
9643: king’s visit, in the changes that were likely to happen in the State,
9644: was kindled solely by the sense of love and duty to her father’s
9645: memory. All Romola’s ardour had been concentrated in her affections.
9646: Her share in her father’s learned pursuits had been for her little more
9647: than a toil which was borne for his sake; and Tito’s airy brilliant
9648: faculty had no attraction for her that was not merged in the deeper
9649: sympathies that belong to young love and trust. Romola had had contact
9650: with no mind that could stir the larger possibilities of her nature;
9651: they lay folded and crushed like embryonic wings, making no element in
9652: her consciousness beyond an occasional vague uneasiness.
9653: 
9654: But this new personal interest of hers in public affairs had made her
9655: care at last to understand precisely what influence Fra Girolamo’s
9656: preaching was likely to have on the turn of events. Changes in the form
9657: of the State were talked of, and all she could learn from Tito, whose
9658: secretaryship and serviceable talents carried him into the heart of
9659: public business, made her only the more eager to fill out her lonely
9660: day by going to hear for herself what it was that was just now leading
9661: all Florence by the ears. This morning, for the first time, she had
9662: been to hear one of the Advent sermons in the Duomo. When Tito had left
9663: her, she had formed a sudden resolution, and after visiting the spot
9664: where her father was buried in Santa Croce, had walked on to the Duomo.
9665: The memory of that last scene with Dino was still vivid within her
9666: whenever she recalled it, but it had receded behind the experience and
9667: anxieties of her married life. The new sensibilities and questions
9668: which it had half awakened in her were quieted again by that subjection
9669: to her husband’s mind which is felt by every wife who loves her husband
9670: with passionate devotedness and full reliance. She remembered the
9671: effect of Fra Girolamo’s voice and presence on her as a ground for
9672: expecting that his sermon might move her in spite of his being a
9673: narrow-minded monk. But the sermon did no more than slightly deepen her
9674: previous impression, that this fanatical preacher of tribulations was
9675: after all a man towards whom it might be possible for her to feel
9676: personal regard and reverence. The denunciations and exhortations
9677: simply arrested her attention. She felt no terror, no pangs of
9678: conscience: it was the roll of distant thunder, that seemed grand, but
9679: could not shake her. But when she heard Savonarola invoke martyrdom,
9680: she sobbed with the rest: she felt herself penetrated with a new
9681: sensation—a strange sympathy with something apart from all the
9682: definable interests of her life. It was not altogether unlike the
9683: thrill which had accompanied certain rare heroic touches in history and
9684: poetry; but the resemblance was as that between the memory of music,
9685: and the sense of being possessed by actual vibrating harmonies.
9686: 
9687: But that transient emotion, strong as it was, seemed to lie quite
9688: outside the inner chamber and sanctuary of her life. She was not
9689: thinking of Fra Girolamo now; she was listening anxiously for the step
9690: of her husband. During these three months of their double solitude she
9691: had thought of each day as an epoch in which their union might begin to
9692: be more perfect. She was conscious of being sometimes a little too sad
9693: or too urgent about what concerned her father’s memory—a little too
9694: critical or coldly silent when Tito narrated the things that were said
9695: and done in the world he frequented—a little too hasty in suggesting
9696: that by living quite simply as her father had done, they might become
9697: rich enough to pay Bernardo del Nero, and reduce the difficulties about
9698: the library. It was not possible that Tito could feel so strongly on
9699: this last point as she did, and it was asking a great deal from him to
9700: give up luxuries for which he really laboured. The next time Tito came
9701: home she would be careful to suppress all those promptings that seemed
9702: to isolate her from him. Romola was labouring, as a loving woman must,
9703: to subdue her nature to her husband’s. The great need of her heart
9704: compelled her to strangle, with desperate resolution, every rising
9705: impulse of suspicion, pride, and resentment; she felt equal to any
9706: self-infliction that would save her from ceasing to love. That would
9707: have been like the hideous nightmare in which the world had seemed to
9708: break away all round her, and leave her feet overhanging the darkness.
9709: Romola had never distinctly imagined such a future for herself; she was
9710: only beginning to feel the presence of effort in that clinging trust
9711: which had once been mere repose.
9712: 
9713: She waited and listened long, for Tito had not come straight home after
9714: leaving Niccolò Caparra, and it was more than two hours after the time
9715: when he was crossing the Ponte Rubaconte that Romola heard the great
9716: door of the court turning on its hinges, and hastened to the head of
9717: the stone steps. There was a lamp hanging over the stairs, and they
9718: could see each other distinctly as he ascended. The eighteen months had
9719: produced a more definable change in Romola’s face than in Tito’s; the
9720: expression was more subdued, less cold, and more beseeching, and, as
9721: the pink flush overspread her face now, in her joy that the long
9722: waiting was at an end, she was much lovelier than on the day when Tito
9723: had first seen her. On that day, any on-looker would have said that
9724: Romola’s nature was made to command, and Tito’s to bend; yet now
9725: Romola’s mouth was quivering a little, and there was some timidity in
9726: her glance.
9727: 
9728: He made an effort to smile, as she said—
9729: 
9730: “My Tito, you are tired; it has been a fatiguing day: is it not true?”
9731: 
9732: Maso was there, and no more was said until they had crossed the
9733: ante-chamber and closed the door of the library behind them. The wood
9734: was burning brightly on the great dogs; that was one welcome for Tito,
9735: late as he was, and Romola’s gentle voice was another.
9736: 
9737: He just turned and kissed her when she took off his mantle; then he
9738: went towards a high-backed chair placed for him near the fire, threw
9739: himself into it, and flung away his cap, saying, not peevishly, but in
9740: a fatigued tone of remonstrance, as he gave a slight shudder—
9741: 
9742: “Romola, I wish you would give up sitting in this library. Surely our
9743: own rooms are pleasanter in this chill weather.”
9744: 
9745: Romola felt hurt. She had never seen Tito so indifferent in his manner;
9746: he was usually full of lively solicitous attention. And she had thought
9747: so much of his return to her after the long day’s absence! He must be
9748: very weary.
9749: 
9750: “I wonder you have forgotten, Tito,” she answered, looking at him
9751: anxiously, as if she wanted to read an excuse for him in the signs of
9752: bodily fatigue. “You know I am making the catalogue on the new plan
9753: that my father wished for; you have not time to help me, so I must work
9754: at it closely.”
9755: 
9756: Tito, instead of meeting Romola’s glance, closed his eyes and rubbed
9757: his hands over his face and hair. He felt he was behaving unlike
9758: himself, but he would make amends to-morrow. The terrible resurrection
9759: of secret fears, which, if Romola had known them, would have alienated
9760: her from him for ever, caused him to feel an alienation already begun
9761: between them—caused him to feel a certain repulsion towards a woman
9762: from whose mind he was in danger. The feeling had taken hold of him
9763: unawares, and he was vexed with himself for behaving in this new cold
9764: way to her. He could not suddenly command any affectionate looks or
9765: words; he could only exert himself to say what might serve as an
9766: excuse.
9767: 
9768: “I am not well, Romola; you must not be surprised if I am peevish.”
9769: 
9770: “Ah, you have had so much to tire you to-day,” said Romola, kneeling
9771: down close to him, and laying her arm on his chest while she put his
9772: hair back caressingly.
9773: 
9774: Suddenly she drew her arm away with a start, and a gaze of alarmed
9775: inquiry.
9776: 
9777: “What have you got under your tunic, Tito? Something as hard as iron.”
9778: 
9779: “It _is_ iron—it is chain-armour,” he said at once. He was prepared for
9780: the surprise and the question, and he spoke quietly, as of something
9781: that he was not hurried to explain.
9782: 
9783: “There was some unexpected danger to-day, then?” said Romola, in a tone
9784: of conjecture. “You had it lent to you for the procession?”
9785: 
9786: “No; it is my own. I shall be obliged to wear it constantly, for some
9787: time.”
9788: 
9789: “What is it that threatens you, my Tito?” said Romola, looking
9790: terrified, and clinging to him again.
9791: 
9792: “Every one is threatened in these times, who is not a rabid enemy of
9793: the Medici. Don’t look distressed, my Romola—this armour will make me
9794: safe against covert attacks.”
9795: 
9796: Tito put his hand on her neck and smiled. This little dialogue about
9797: the armour had broken through the new crust, and made a channel for the
9798: sweet habit of kindness.
9799: 
9800: “But my godfather, then,” said Romola; “is not he, too, in danger? And
9801: he takes no precautions—ought he not? since he must surely be in more
9802: danger than you, who have so little influence compared with him.”
9803: 
9804: “It is just because I am less important that I am in more danger,” said
9805: Tito, readily. “I am suspected constantly of being an envoy. And men
9806: like Messer Bernardo are protected by their position and their
9807: extensive family connections, which spread among all parties, while I
9808: am a Greek that nobody would avenge.”
9809: 
9810: “But, Tito, is it a fear of some particular person, or only a vague
9811: sense of danger, that has made you think of wearing this?” Romola was
9812: unable to repel the idea of a degrading fear in Tito, which mingled
9813: itself with her anxiety.
9814: 
9815: “I have had special threats,” said Tito, “but I must beg you to be
9816: silent on the subject, my Romola. I shall consider that you have broken
9817: my confidence, if you mention it to your godfather.”
9818: 
9819: “Assuredly I will not mention it,” said Romola, blushing, “if you wish
9820: it to be a secret. But, dearest Tito,” she added, after a moment’s
9821: pause, in a tone of loving anxiety, “it will make you very wretched.”
9822: 
9823: “What will make me wretched?” he said, with a scarcely perceptible
9824: movement across his face, as from some darting sensation.
9825: 
9826: “This fear—this heavy armour. I can’t help shuddering as I feel it
9827: under my arm. I could fancy it a story of enchantment—that some
9828: malignant fiend had changed your sensitive human skin into a hard
9829: shell. It seems so unlike my bright, light-hearted Tito!”
9830: 
9831: “Then you would rather have your husband exposed to danger, when he
9832: leaves you?” said Tito, smiling. “If you don’t mind my being poniarded
9833: or shot, why need I mind? I will give up the armour—shall I?”
9834: 
9835: “No, Tito, no. I am fanciful. Do not heed what I have said. But such
9836: crimes are surely not common in Florence? I have always heard my father
9837: and godfather say so. Have they become frequent lately?”
9838: 
9839: “It is not unlikely they will become frequent, with the bitter hatreds
9840: that are being bred continually.”
9841: 
9842: Romola was silent a few moments. She shrank from insisting further on
9843: the subject of the armour. She tried to shake it off.
9844: 
9845: “Tell me what has happened to-day,” she said, in a cheerful tone. “Has
9846: all gone off well?”
9847: 
9848: “Excellently well. First of all, the rain came and put an end to Luca
9849: Corsini’s oration, which nobody wanted to hear, and a ready-tongued
9850: personage—some say it was Gaddi, some say it was Melema, but really it
9851: was done so quickly no one knows who it was—had the honour of giving
9852: the Cristianissimo the briefest possible welcome in bad French.”
9853: 
9854: “Tito, it was you, I know,” said Romola, smiling brightly, and kissing
9855: him. “How is it you never care about claiming anything? And after
9856: that?”
9857: 
9858: “Oh! after that, there was a shower of armour and jewels, and
9859: trappings, such as you saw at the last Florentine _giostra_, only a
9860: great deal more of them. There was strutting, and prancing, and
9861: confusion, and scrambling, and the people shouted, and the
9862: Cristianissimo smiled from ear to ear. And after that there was a great
9863: deal of flattery, and eating, and play. I was at Tornabuoni’s. I will
9864: tell you about it to-morrow.”
9865: 
9866: “Yes, dearest, never mind now. But is there any more hope that things
9867: will end peaceably for Florence, that the Republic will not get into
9868: fresh troubles?”
9869: 
9870: Tito gave a shrug. “Florence will have no peace but what it pays well
9871: for; that is clear.”
9872: 
9873: Romola’s face saddened, but she checked herself, and said, cheerfully,
9874: “You would not guess where I went to-day, Tito. I went to the Duomo, to
9875: hear Fra Girolamo.”
9876: 
9877: Tito looked startled; he had immediately thought of Baldassarre’s
9878: entrance into the Duomo; but Romola gave his look another meaning.
9879: 
9880: “You are surprised, are you not? It was a sudden thought. I want to
9881: know all about the public affairs now, and I determined to hear for
9882: myself what the Frate promised the people about this French invasion.”
9883: 
9884: “Well, and what did you think of the prophet?”
9885: 
9886: “He certainly has a very mysterious power, that man. A great deal of
9887: his sermon was what I expected; but once I was strangely moved—I sobbed
9888: with the rest.”
9889: 
9890: “Take care, Romola,” said Tito, playfully, feeling relieved that she
9891: had said nothing about Baldassarre; “you have a touch of fanaticism in
9892: you. I shall have you seeing visions, like your brother.”
9893: 
9894: “No; it was the same with every one else. He carried them all with him;
9895: unless it were that gross Dolfo Spini, whom I saw there making
9896: grimaces. There was even a wretched-looking man, with a rope round his
9897: neck—an escaped prisoner, I should think, who had run in for shelter—a
9898: very wild-eyed old man: I saw him with great tears rolling down his
9899: cheeks, as he looked and listened quite eagerly.”
9900: 
9901: There was a slight pause before Tito spoke.
9902: 
9903: “I saw the man,” he said,—“the prisoner. I was outside the Duomo with
9904: Lorenzo Tornabuoni when he ran in. He had escaped from a French
9905: soldier. Did you see him when you came out?”
9906: 
9907: “No, he went out with our good old Piero di Cosimo. I saw Piero come in
9908: and cut off his rope, and take him out of the church. But you want
9909: rest, Tito? You feel ill?”
9910: 
9911: “Yes,” said Tito, rising. The horrible sense that he must live in
9912: continual dread of what Baldassarre had said or done pressed upon him
9913: like a cold weight.
9914: 
9915: 
9916: 
9917: 
9918: CHAPTER XXVIII.
9919: The Painted Record.
9920: 
9921: 
9922: Four days later, Romola was on her way to the house of Piero di Cosimo,
9923: in the Via Gualfonda. Some of the streets through which she had to pass
9924: were lined with Frenchmen who were gazing at Florence, and with
9925: Florentines who were gazing at the French, and the gaze was not on
9926: either side entirely friendly and admiring. The first nation in Europe,
9927: of necessity finding itself, when out of its own country, in the
9928: presence of general inferiority, naturally assumed an air of conscious
9929: pre-eminence; and the Florentines, who had taken such pains to play the
9930: host amiably, were getting into the worst humour with their too
9931: superior guests.
9932: 
9933: For after the first smiling compliments and festivities were over—after
9934: wondrous Mysteries with unrivalled machinery of floating clouds and
9935: angels had been presented in churches—after the royal guest had
9936: honoured Florentine dames with much of his Most Christian ogling at
9937: balls and suppers, and business had begun to be talked of—it appeared
9938: that the new Charlemagne regarded Florence as a conquered city,
9939: inasmuch as he had entered it with his lance in rest, talked of leaving
9940: his viceroy behind him, and had thoughts of bringing back the Medici.
9941: Singular logic this appeared to be on the part of an elect instrument
9942: of God! since the policy of Piero de’ Medici, disowned by the people,
9943: had been the only offence of Florence against the majesty of France.
9944: And Florence was determined not to submit. The determination was being
9945: expressed very strongly in consultations of citizens inside the Old
9946: Palace, and it was beginning to show itself on the broad flags of the
9947: streets and piazza wherever there was an opportunity of flouting an
9948: insolent Frenchman. Under these circumstances the streets were not
9949: altogether a pleasant promenade for well-born women; but Romola,
9950: shrouded in her black veil and mantle, and with old Maso by her side,
9951: felt secure enough from impertinent observation.
9952: 
9953: And she was impatient to visit Piero di Cosimo. A copy of her father’s
9954: portrait as Oedipus, which he had long ago undertaken to make for her,
9955: was not yet finished; and Piero was so uncertain in his work—sometimes,
9956: when the demand was not peremptory, laying aside a picture for months;
9957: sometimes thrusting it into a corner or coffer, where it was likely to
9958: be utterly forgotten—that she felt it necessary to watch over his
9959: progress. She was a favourite with the painter, and he was inclined to
9960: fulfil any wish of hers, but no general inclination could be trusted as
9961: a safeguard against his sudden whims. He had told her the week before
9962: that the picture would perhaps be finished by this time; and Romola was
9963: nervously anxious to have in her possession a copy of the only portrait
9964: existing of her father in the days of his blindness, lest his image
9965: should grow dim in her mind. The sense of defect in her devotedness to
9966: him made her cling with all the force of compunction as well as
9967: affection to the duties of memory. Love does not aim simply at the
9968: conscious good of the beloved object: it is not satisfied without
9969: perfect loyalty of heart; it aims at its own completeness.
9970: 
9971: Romola, by special favour, was allowed to intrude upon the painter
9972: without previous notice. She lifted the iron slide and called Piero in
9973: a flute-like tone, as the little maiden with the eggs had done in
9974: Tito’s presence. Piero was quick in answering, but when he opened the
9975: door he accounted for his quickness in a manner that was not
9976: complimentary.
9977: 
9978: “Ah, Madonna Romola, is it you? I thought my eggs were come; I wanted
9979: them.”
9980: 
9981: “I have brought you something better than hard eggs, Piero. Maso has
9982: got a little basket full of cakes and _confetti_ for you,” said Romola,
9983: smiling, as she put back her veil. She took the basket from Maso, and
9984: stepping into the house, said—
9985: 
9986: “I know you like these things when you can have them without trouble.
9987: Confess you do.”
9988: 
9989: “Yes, when they come to me as easily as the light does,” said Piero,
9990: folding his arms and looking down at the sweetmeats as Romola uncovered
9991: them and glanced at him archly. “And they are come along with the light
9992: now,” he added, lifting his eyes to her face and hair with a painter’s
9993: admiration, as her hood, dragged by the weight of her veil, fell
9994: backward.
9995: 
9996: “But I know what the sweetmeats are for,” he went on; “they are to stop
9997: my mouth while you scold me. Well, go on into the next room, and you
9998: will see I’ve done something to the picture since you saw it, though
9999: it’s not finished yet. But I didn’t promise, you know: I take care not
10000: to promise:—
10001: 
10002: 
10003: “‘Chi promette e non mantiene
10004: L’anima sua non va mai bene.’”
10005: 
10006: 
10007: The door opening on the wild garden was closed now, and the painter was
10008: at work. Not at Romola’s picture, however. That was standing on the
10009: floor, propped against the wall, and Piero stooped to lift it, that he
10010: might carry it into the proper light. But in lifting away this picture,
10011: he had disclosed another—the oil-sketch of Tito, to which he had made
10012: an important addition within the last few days. It was so much smaller
10013: than the other picture, that it stood far within it, and Piero, apt to
10014: forget where he had placed anything, was not aware of what he had
10015: revealed as, peering at some detail in the painting which he held in
10016: his hands, he went to place it on an easel. But Romola exclaimed,
10017: flushing with astonishment—
10018: 
10019: “That is Tito!”
10020: 
10021: Piero looked round, and gave a silent shrug. He was vexed at his own
10022: forgetfulness.
10023: 
10024: She was still looking at the sketch in astonishment; but presently she
10025: turned towards the painter, and said with puzzled alarm—
10026: 
10027: “What a strange picture! When did you paint it? What does it mean?”
10028: 
10029: “A mere fancy of mine,” said Piero, lifting off his skull-cap,
10030: scratching his head, and making the usual grimace by which he avoided
10031: the betrayal of any feeling. “I wanted a handsome young face for it,
10032: and your husband’s was just the thing.”
10033: 
10034: He went forward, stooped down to the picture, and lifting it away with
10035: its back to Romola, pretended to be giving it a passing examination,
10036: before putting it aside as a thing not good enough to show.
10037: 
10038: But Romola, who had the fact of the armour in her mind, and was
10039: penetrated by this strange coincidence of things which associated Tito
10040: with the idea of fear, went to his elbow and said—
10041: 
10042: “Don’t put it away; let me look again. That man with the rope round his
10043: neck—I saw him—I saw you come to him in the Duomo. What was it that
10044: made you put him into a picture with Tito?”
10045: 
10046: Piero saw no better resource than to tell part of the truth.
10047: 
10048: “It was a mere accident. The man was running away—running up the steps,
10049: and caught hold of your husband: I suppose he had stumbled. I happened
10050: to be there, and saw it, and I thought the savage-looking old fellow
10051: was a good subject. But it’s worth nothing—it’s only a freakish daub of
10052: mine.” Piero ended contemptuously, moving the sketch away with an air
10053: of decision, and putting it on a high shelf. “Come and look at the
10054: Oedipus.”
10055: 
10056: He had shown a little too much anxiety in putting the sketch out of her
10057: sight, and had produced the very impression he had sought to
10058: prevent—that there was really something unpleasant, something
10059: disadvantageous to Tito, in the circumstances out of which the picture
10060: arose. But this impression silenced her: her pride and delicacy shrank
10061: from questioning further, where questions might seem to imply that she
10062: could entertain even a slight suspicion against her husband. She merely
10063: said, in as quiet a tone as she could—
10064: 
10065: “He was a strange piteous-looking man, that prisoner. Do you know
10066: anything more of him?”
10067: 
10068: “No more: I showed him the way to the hospital, that’s all. See, now,
10069: the face of Oedipus is pretty nearly finished; tell me what you think
10070: of it.”
10071: 
10072: Romola now gave her whole attention to her father’s portrait, standing
10073: in long silence before it.
10074: 
10075: “Ah,” she said at last, “you have done what I wanted. You have given it
10076: more of the listening look. My good Piero,”—she turned towards him with
10077: bright moist eyes—“I am very grateful to you.”
10078: 
10079: “Now that’s what I can’t bear in you women,” said Piero, turning
10080: impatiently, and kicking aside the objects that littered the floor—“you
10081: are always pouring out feelings where there’s no call for them. Why
10082: should you be grateful to me for a picture you pay me for, especially
10083: when I make you wait for it? And if I paint a picture, I suppose it’s
10084: for my own pleasure and credit to paint it well, eh? Are you to thank a
10085: man for not being a rogue or a noodle? It’s enough if he himself thanks
10086: Messer Domeneddio, who has made him neither the one nor the other. But
10087: women think walls are held together with honey.”
10088: 
10089: “You crusty Piero! I forgot how snappish you are. Here, put this nice
10090: sweetmeat in your mouth,” said Romola, smiling through her tears, and
10091: taking something very crisp and sweet from the little basket.
10092: 
10093: Piero accepted it very much as that proverbial bear that dreams of
10094: pears might accept an exceedingly mellow “swan-egg”—really liking the
10095: gift, but accustomed to have his pleasures and pains concealed under a
10096: shaggy coat.
10097: 
10098: “It’s good, Madonna Antigone,” said Piero, putting his fingers in the
10099: basket for another. He had eaten nothing but hard eggs for a fortnight.
10100: Romola stood opposite him, feeling her new anxiety suspended for a
10101: little while by the sight of this _naïve_ enjoyment.
10102: 
10103: “Good-bye, Piero,” she said, presently, setting down the basket. “I
10104: promise not to thank you if you finish the portrait soon and well I
10105: will tell you, you were bound to do it for your own credit.”
10106: 
10107: “Good,” said Piero, curtly, helping her with much deftness to fold her
10108: mantle and veil round her.
10109: 
10110: “I’m glad she asked no more questions about that sketch,” he thought,
10111: when he had closed the door behind her. “I should be sorry for her to
10112: guess that I thought her fine husband a good model for a coward. But I
10113: made light of it; she’ll not think of it again.”
10114: 
10115: Piero was too sanguine, as open-hearted men are apt to be when they
10116: attempt a little clever simulation. The thought of the picture pressed
10117: more and more on Romola as she walked homeward. She could not help
10118: putting together the two facts of the chain-armour and the encounter
10119: mentioned by Piero between her husband and the prisoner, which had
10120: happened on the morning of the day when the armour was adopted. That
10121: look of terror which the painter had given Tito, had he seen it? What
10122: could it all mean?
10123: 
10124: “It means nothing,” she tried to assure herself. “It was a mere
10125: coincidence. Shall I ask Tito about it?” Her mind said at last, “No: I
10126: will not question him about anything he did not tell me spontaneously.
10127: It is an offence against the trust I owe him.” Her heart said, “I dare
10128: not ask him.”
10129: 
10130: There was a terrible flaw in the trust: she was afraid of any hasty
10131: movement, as men are who hold something precious and want to believe
10132: that it is not broken.
10133: 
10134: 
10135: 
10136: 
10137: CHAPTER XXIX.
10138: A Moment of Triumph.
10139: 
10140: 
10141: “The old fellow has vanished; went on towards Arezzo the next morning;
10142: not liking the smell of the French, I suppose, after being their
10143: prisoner. I went to the hospital to inquire after him; I wanted to know
10144: if those broth-making monks had found out whether he was in his right
10145: mind or not. However, they said he showed no signs of madness—only took
10146: no notice of questions, and seemed to be planting a vine twenty miles
10147: off. He was a mysterious old tiger. I should have liked to know
10148: something more about him.”
10149: 
10150: It was in Nello’s shop that Piero di Cosimo was speaking, on the
10151: twenty-fourth of November, just a week after the entrance of the
10152: French. There was a party of six or seven assembled at the rather
10153: unusual hour of three in the afternoon; for it was a day on which all
10154: Florence was excited by the prospect of some decisive political event.
10155: Every lounging-place was full, and every shopkeeper who had no wife or
10156: deputy to leave in charge, stood at his door with his thumbs in his
10157: belt; while the streets were constantly sprinkled with artisans pausing
10158: or passing lazily like floating splinters, ready to rush forward
10159: impetuously if any object attracted them.
10160: 
10161: Nello had been thrumming the lute as he half sat on the board against
10162: the shop-window, and kept an outlook towards the piazza.
10163: 
10164: “Ah,” he said, laying down the lute, with emphasis, “I would not for a
10165: gold florin have missed that sight of the French soldiers waddling in
10166: their broad shoes after their runaway prisoners! That comes of leaving
10167: my shop to shave magnificent chins. It is always so: if ever I quit
10168: this navel of the earth something takes the opportunity of happening in
10169: my piazza.”
10170: 
10171: “Yes, you ought to have been there,” said Piero, in his biting way,
10172: “just to see your favourite Greek look as frightened as if Satanasso
10173: had laid hold of him. I like to see your ready-smiling Messeri caught
10174: in a sudden wind and obliged to show their lining in spite of
10175: themselves. What colour do you think a man’s liver is, who looks like a
10176: bleached deer as soon as a chance stranger lays hold of him suddenly?”
10177: 
10178: “Piero, keep that vinegar of thine as sauce to thine own eggs! What is
10179: it against my _bel erudito_ that he looked startled when he felt a pair
10180: of claws upon him and saw an unchained madman at his elbow? Your
10181: scholar is not like those beastly Swiss and Germans, whose heads are
10182: only fit for battering-rams, and who have such large appetites that
10183: they think nothing of taking a cannon-ball before breakfast. We
10184: Florentines count some other qualities in a man besides that vulgar
10185: stuff called bravery, which is to be got by hiring dunderheads at so
10186: much per dozen. I tell you, as soon as men found out that they had more
10187: brains than oxen, they set the oxen to draw for them; and when we
10188: Florentines found out that we had more brains than other men we set
10189: them to fight for us.”
10190: 
10191: “Treason, Nello!” a voice called out from the inner sanctum; “that is
10192: not the doctrine of the State. Florence is grinding its weapons; and
10193: the last well-authenticated vision announced by the Frate was Mars
10194: standing on the Palazzo Vecchio with his arm on the shoulder of San
10195: Giovanni Battista, who was offering him a piece of honeycomb.”
10196: 
10197: “It is well, Francesco,” said Nello. “Florence has a few thicker skulls
10198: that may do to bombard Pisa with; there will still be the finer spirits
10199: left at home to do the thinking and the shaving. And as for our Piero
10200: here, if he makes such a point of valour, let him carry his biggest
10201: brush for a weapon and his palette for a shield, and challenge the
10202: widest-mouthed Swiss he can see in the Prato to a single combat.”
10203: 
10204: “_Va_, Nello,” growled Piero, “thy tongue runs on as usual, like a mill
10205: when the Arno’s full—whether there’s grist or not.”
10206: 
10207: “Excellent grist, I tell thee. For it would be as reasonable to expect
10208: a grizzled painter like thee to be fond of getting a javelin inside
10209: thee as to expect a man whose wits have been sharpened on the classics
10210: to like having his handsome face clawed by a wild beast.”
10211: 
10212: “There you go, supposing you’ll get people to put their legs into a
10213: sack because you call it a pair of hosen,” said Piero. “Who said
10214: anything about a wild beast, or about an unarmed man rushing on battle?
10215: Fighting is a trade, and it’s not my trade. I should be a fool to run
10216: after danger, but I could face it if it came to me.”
10217: 
10218: “How is it you’re so afraid of the thunder, then, my Piero?” said
10219: Nello, determined to chase down the accuser. “You ought to be able to
10220: understand why one man is shaken by a thing that seems a trifle to
10221: others—you who hide yourself with the rats as soon as a storm comes
10222: on.”
10223: 
10224: “That is because I have a particular sensibility to loud sounds; it has
10225: nothing to do with my courage or my conscience.”
10226: 
10227: “Well, and Tito Melema may have a peculiar sensibility to being laid
10228: hold of unexpectedly by prisoners who have run away from French
10229: soldiers. Men are born with antipathies; I myself can’t abide the smell
10230: of mint. Tito was born with an antipathy to old prisoners who stumble
10231: and clutch. Ecco!”
10232: 
10233: There was a general laugh at Nello’s defence, and it was clear that
10234: Piero’s disinclination towards Tito was not shared by the company. The
10235: painter, with his undecipherable grimace, took the tow from his
10236: scarsella and stuffed his ears in indignant contempt, while Nello went
10237: on triumphantly—
10238: 
10239: “No, my Piero, I can’t afford to have my _bel erudito_ decried; and
10240: Florence can’t afford it either, with her scholars moulting off her at
10241: the early age of forty. Our Phoenix Pico just gone straight to
10242: Paradise, as the Frate has informed us; and the incomparable Poliziano,
10243: not two months since, gone to—well, well, let us hope he is not gone to
10244: the eminent scholars in the Malebolge.”
10245: 
10246: “By the way,” said Francesco Cei, “have you heard that Camilla Rucellai
10247: has outdone the Frate in her prophecies? She prophesied two years ago
10248: that Pico would die in the time of lilies. He has died in November.
10249: ‘Not at all the time of lilies,’ said the scorners. ‘Go to!’ says
10250: Camilla; ‘it is the lilies of France I meant, and it seems to me they
10251: are close enough under your nostrils.’ I say, ‘Euge, Camilla!’ If the
10252: Frate can prove that any one of his visions has been as well fulfilled,
10253: I’ll declare myself a Piagnone to-morrow.”
10254: 
10255: “You are something too flippant about the Frate, Francesco,” said
10256: Pietro Cennini, the scholarly. “We are all indebted to him in these
10257: weeks for preaching peace and quietness, and the laying aside of party
10258: quarrels. They are men of small discernment who would be glad to see
10259: the people slipping the Frate’s leash just now. And if the Most
10260: Christian King is obstinate about the treaty to-day, and will not sign
10261: what is fair and honourable to Florence, Fra Girolamo is the man we
10262: must trust in to bring him to reason.”
10263: 
10264: “You speak truth, Messer Pietro,” said Nello; “the Frate is one of the
10265: firmest nails Florence has to hang on—at least, that is the opinion of
10266: the most respectable chins I have the honour of shaving. But young
10267: Messer Niccolò was saying here the other morning—and doubtless
10268: Francesco means the same thing—there is as wonderful a power of
10269: stretching in the meaning of visions as in Dido’s bull’s hide. It seems
10270: to me a dream may mean whatever comes after it. As our Franco Sacchetti
10271: says, a woman dreams over-night of a serpent biting her, breaks a
10272: drinking-cup the next day, and cries out, ‘Look you, I thought
10273: something would happen—it’s plain now what the serpent meant.’”
10274: 
10275: “But the Frate’s visions are not of that sort,” said Cronaca. “He not
10276: only says what will happen—that the Church will be scourged and
10277: renovated, and the heathens converted—he says it shall happen quickly.
10278: He is no slippery pretender who provides loopholes for himself, he is—”
10279: 
10280: “What is this? what is this?” exclaimed Nello, jumping off the board,
10281: and putting his head out at the door. “Here are people streaming into
10282: the piazza, and shouting. Something must have happened in the Via
10283: Larga. Aha!” he burst forth with delighted astonishment, stepping out
10284: laughing and waving his cap.
10285: 
10286: All the rest of the company hastened to the door. News from the Via
10287: Larga was just what they had been waiting for. But if the news had come
10288: into the piazza, they were not a little surprised at the form of its
10289: advent. Carried above the shoulders of the people, on a bench
10290: apparently snatched up in the street, sat Tito Melema, in smiling
10291: amusement at the compulsion he was under. His cap had slipped off his
10292: head, and hung by the becchetto which was wound loosely round his neck;
10293: and as he saw the group at Nello’s door he lifted up his fingers in
10294: beckoning recognition. The next minute he had leaped from the bench on
10295: to a cart filled with bales, that stood in the broad space between the
10296: Baptistery and the steps of the Duomo, while the people swarmed round
10297: him with the noisy eagerness of poultry expecting to be fed. But there
10298: was silence when he began to speak in his clear mellow voice—
10299: 
10300: “Citizens of Florence! I have no warrant to tell the news except your
10301: will. But the news is good, and will harm no man in the telling. The
10302: Most Christian King is signing a treaty that is honourable to Florence.
10303: But you owe it to one of your citizens, who spoke a word worthy of the
10304: ancient Romans—you owe it to Piero Capponi!”
10305: 
10306: Immediately there was a roar of voices. “Capponi! Capponi! What said
10307: our Piero?” “Ah! he wouldn’t stand being sent from Herod to Pilate!”
10308: “We knew Piero!” “_Orsù_! Tell us, what did he say?”
10309: 
10310: When the roar of insistence had subsided a little, Tito began again—
10311: 
10312: “The Most Christian King demanded a little too much—was obstinate—said
10313: at last, ‘I shall order my trumpets to sound.’ Then, Florentine
10314: citizens! your Piero Capponi, speaking with the voice of a free city,
10315: said, ‘If you sound your trumpets, we will ring our bells!’ He snatched
10316: the copy of the dishonouring conditions from the hands of the
10317: secretary, tore it in pieces, and turned to leave the royal presence.”
10318: 
10319: Again there were loud shouts—and again impatient demands for more.
10320: 
10321: “Then, Florentines, the high majesty of France felt, perhaps for the
10322: first time, all the majesty of a free city. And the Most Christian King
10323: himself hastened from his place to call Piero Capponi back. The great
10324: spirit of your Florentine city did its work by a great word, without
10325: need of the great actions that lay ready behind it. And the King has
10326: consented to sign the treaty, which preserves the honour, as well as
10327: the safety, of Florence. The banner of France will float over every
10328: Florentine galley in sign of amity and common privilege, but above that
10329: banner will be written the word ‘Liberty!’
10330: 
10331: “That is all the news I have to tell; is it not enough?—since it is for
10332: the glory of every one of you, citizens of Florence, that you have a
10333: fellow-citizen who knows how to speak your will.”
10334: 
10335: As the shouts rose again, Tito looked round with inward amusement at
10336: the various crowd, each of whom was elated with the notion that Piero
10337: Capponi had somehow represented him—that he was the mind of which
10338: Capponi was the mouthpiece. He enjoyed the humour of the incident,
10339: which had suddenly transformed him, an alien, and a friend of the
10340: Medici, into an orator who tickled the ears of the people blatant for
10341: some unknown good which they called liberty. He felt quite glad that he
10342: had been laid hold of and hurried along by the crowd as he was coming
10343: out of the palace in the Via Larga with a commission to the Signoria.
10344: It was very easy, very pleasant, this exercise of speaking to the
10345: general satisfaction: a man who knew how to persuade need never be in
10346: danger from any party; he could convince each that he was feigning with
10347: all the others. The gestures and faces of weavers and dyers were
10348: certainly amusing when looked at from above in this way.
10349: 
10350: Tito was beginning to get easier in his armour, and at this moment was
10351: quite unconscious of it. He stood with one hand holding his recovered
10352: cap, and with the other at his belt, the light of a complacent smile in
10353: his long lustrous eyes, as he made a parting reverence to his audience,
10354: before springing down from the bales—when suddenly his glance met that
10355: of a man who had not at all the amusing aspect of the exulting weavers,
10356: dyers, and woolcarders. The face of this man was clean-shaven, his hair
10357: close-clipped, and he wore a decent felt hat. A single glance would
10358: hardly have sufficed to assure any one but Tito that this was the face
10359: of the escaped prisoner who had laid hold of him on the steps. But to
10360: Tito it came not simply as the face of the escaped prisoner, but as a
10361: face with which he had been familiar long years before.
10362: 
10363: It seemed all compressed into a second—the sight of Baldassarre looking
10364: at him, the sensation shooting through him like a fiery arrow, and the
10365: act of leaping from the cart. He would have leaped down in the same
10366: instant, whether he had seen Baldassarre or not, for he was in a hurry
10367: to be gone to the Palazzo Vecchio: this time he had not betrayed
10368: himself by look or movement, and he said inwardly that he should not be
10369: taken by surprise again; he should be prepared to see this face rise up
10370: continually like the intermittent blotch that comes in diseased vision.
10371: But this reappearance of Baldassarre so much more in his own likeness
10372: tightened the pressure of dread: the idea of his madness lost its
10373: likelihood now he was shaven and clad like a decent though poor
10374: citizen. Certainly, there was a great change in his face; but how could
10375: it be otherwise? And yet, if he were perfectly sane—in possession of
10376: all his powers and all his learning, why was he lingering in this way
10377: before making known his identity? It must be for the sake of making his
10378: scheme of vengeance more complete. But he did linger: that at least
10379: gave an opportunity for flight. And Tito began to think that flight was
10380: his only resource.
10381: 
10382: But while he, with his back turned on the Piazza del Duomo, had lost
10383: the recollection of the new part he had been playing, and was no longer
10384: thinking of the many things which a ready brain and tongue made easy,
10385: but of a few things which destiny had somehow made very difficult, the
10386: enthusiasm which he had fed contemptuously was creating a scene in that
10387: piazza in grand contrast with the inward drama of self-centred fear
10388: which he had carried away from it.
10389: 
10390: The crowd, on Tito’s disappearance, had begun to turn their faces
10391: towards the outlets of the piazza in the direction of the Via Larga,
10392: when the sight of _mazzieri_, or mace-bearers, entering from the Via
10393: de’ Martelli, announced the approach of dignitaries. They must be the
10394: syndics, or commissioners charged with the effecting of the treaty; the
10395: treaty must be already signed, and they had come away from the royal
10396: presence. Piero Capponi was coming—the brave heart that had known how
10397: to speak for Florence. The effect on the crowd was remarkable; they
10398: parted with softening, dropping voices, subsiding into silence,—and the
10399: silence became so perfect that the tread of the syndics on the broad
10400: pavement, and the rustle of their black silk garments, could be heard,
10401: like rain in the night. There were four of them; but it was not the two
10402: learned doctors of law, Messer Guidantonio Vespucci and Messer Domenico
10403: Bonsi, that the crowd waited for; it was not Francesco Valori, popular
10404: as he had become in these late days. The moment belonged to another
10405: man, of firm presence, as little inclined to humour the people as to
10406: humour any other unreasonable claimants—loving order, like one who by
10407: force of fortune had been made a merchant, and by force of nature had
10408: become a soldier. It was not till he was seen at the entrance of the
10409: piazza that the silence was broken, and then one loud shout of
10410: “Capponi, Capponi! Well done, Capponi!” rang through the piazza.
10411: 
10412: The simple, resolute man looked round him with grave joy. His
10413: fellow-citizens gave him a great funeral two years later, when he had
10414: died in fight; there were torches carried by all the magistracy, and
10415: torches again, and trains of banners. But it is not known that he felt
10416: any joy in the oration that was delivered in his praise, as the banners
10417: waved over his bier. Let us be glad that he got some thanks and praise
10418: while he lived.
10419:

10421: 
10422: 
10423: CHAPTER XXX.
10424: The Avenger’s Secret.
10425: 
10426: 
10427: It was the first time that Baldassarre had been in the Piazza del Duomo
10428: since his escape. He had a strong desire to hear the remarkable monk
10429: preach again, but he had shrunk from reappearing in the same spot where
10430: he had been seen half naked, with neglected hair, with a rope round his
10431: neck—in the same spot where he had been called a madman. The feeling,
10432: in its freshness, was too strong to be overcome by any trust he had in
10433: the change he had made in his appearance; for when the words “_some
10434: madman, surely_,” had fallen from Tito’s lips, it was not their
10435: baseness and cruelty only that had made their viper sting—it was
10436: Baldassarre’s instantaneous bitter consciousness that he might be
10437: unable to prove the words false. Along with the passionate desire for
10438: vengeance which possessed him had arisen the keen sense that his power
10439: of achieving the vengeance was doubtful. It was as if Tito had been
10440: helped by some diabolical prompter, who had whispered Baldassarre’s
10441: saddest secret in the traitor’s ear. He was not mad; for he carried
10442: within him that piteous stamp of sanity, the clear consciousness of
10443: shattered faculties; he measured his own feebleness. With the first
10444: movement of vindictive rage awoke a vague caution, like that of a wild
10445: beast that is fierce but feeble—or like that of an insect whose little
10446: fragment of earth has given way, and made it pause in a palsy of
10447: distrust. It was this distrust, this determination to take no step
10448: which might betray anything concerning himself, that had made
10449: Baldassarre reject Piero di Cosimo’s friendly advances.
10450: 
10451: He had been equally cautious at the hospital, only telling, in answer
10452: to the questions of the brethren there, that he had been made a
10453: prisoner by the French on his way from Genoa. But his age, and the
10454: indications in his speech and manner that he was of a different class
10455: from the ordinary mendicants and poor travellers who were entertained
10456: in the hospital, had induced the monks to offer him extra charity: a
10457: coarse woollen tunic to protect him from the cold, a pair of peasant’s
10458: shoes, and a few _danari_, smallest of Florentine coins, to help him on
10459: his way. He had gone on the road to Arezzo early in the morning; but he
10460: had paused at the first little town, and had used a couple of his
10461: _danari_ to get himself shaved, and to have his circle of hair clipped
10462: short, in his former fashion. The barber there had a little hand-mirror
10463: of bright steel: it was a long while, it was years, since Baldassarre
10464: had looked at himself, and now, as his eyes fell on that hand-mirror, a
10465: new thought shot through his mind. “Was he so changed that Tito really
10466: did not know him?” The thought was such a sudden arrest of impetuous
10467: currents, that it was a painful shock to him; his hand shook like a
10468: leaf, as he put away the barber’s arm and asked for the mirror. He
10469: wished to see himself before he was shaved. The barber, noticing his
10470: tremulousness, held the mirror for him.
10471: 
10472: No, he was not so changed as that. He himself had known the wrinkles as
10473: they had been three years ago; they were only deeper now: there was the
10474: same rough, clumsy skin, making little superficial bosses on the brow,
10475: like so many cipher-marks; the skin was only yellower, only looked more
10476: like a lifeless rind. That shaggy white beard—it was no disguise to
10477: eyes that had looked closely at him for sixteen years—to eyes that
10478: ought to have searched for him with the expectation of finding him
10479: changed, as men search for the beloved among the bodies cast up by the
10480: waters. There was something different in his glance, but it was a
10481: difference that should only have made the recognition of him the more
10482: startling; for is not a known voice all the more thrilling when it is
10483: heard as a cry? But the doubt was folly: he had felt that Tito knew
10484: him. He put out his hand and pushed the mirror away. The strong
10485: currents were rushing on again, and the energies of hatred and
10486: vengeance were active once more.
10487: 
10488: He went back on the way towards Florence again, but he did not wish to
10489: enter the city till dusk; so he turned aside from the highroad, and sat
10490: down by a little pool shadowed on one side by alder-bushes still
10491: sprinkled with yellow leaves. It was a calm November day, and he no
10492: sooner saw the pool than he thought its still surface might be a mirror
10493: for him. He wanted to contemplate himself slowly, as he had not dared
10494: to do in the presence of the barber. He sat down on the edge of the
10495: pool, and bent forward to look earnestly at the image of himself.
10496: 
10497: Was there something wandering and imbecile in his face—something like
10498: what he felt in his mind?
10499: 
10500: Not now; not when he was examining himself with a look of eager
10501: inquiry: on the contrary, there was an intense purpose in his eyes. But
10502: at other times? Yes, it must be so: in the long hours when he had the
10503: vague aching of an unremembered past within him—when he seemed to sit
10504: in dark loneliness, visited by whispers which died out mockingly as he
10505: strained his ear after them, and by forms that seemed to approach him
10506: and float away as he thrust out his hand to grasp them—in those hours,
10507: doubtless, there must be continual frustration and amazement in his
10508: glance. And more horrible still, when the thick cloud parted for a
10509: moment, and, as he sprang forward with hope, rolled together again, and
10510: left him helpless as before; doubtless, there was then a blank
10511: confusion in his face, as of a man suddenly smitten with blindness.
10512: 
10513: Could he prove anything? Could he even begin to allege anything, with
10514: the confidence that the links of thought would not break away? Would
10515: any believe that he had ever had a mind filled with rare knowledge,
10516: busy with close thoughts, ready with various speech? It had all slipped
10517: away from him—that laboriously-gathered store. Was it utterly and for
10518: ever gone from him, like the waters from an urn lost in the wide ocean?
10519: Or, was it still within him, imprisoned by some obstruction that might
10520: one day break asunder?
10521: 
10522: It might be so; he tried to keep his grasp on that hope. For, since the
10523: day when he had first walked feebly from his couch of straw, and had
10524: felt a new darkness within him under the sunlight, his mind had
10525: undergone changes, partly gradual and persistent, partly sudden and
10526: fleeting. As he had recovered his strength of body, he had recovered
10527: his self-command and the energy of his will; he had recovered the
10528: memory of all that part of his life which was closely enwrought with
10529: his emotions; and he had felt more and more constantly and painfully
10530: the uneasy sense of lost knowledge. But more than that—once or twice,
10531: when he had been strongly excited, he had seemed momentarily to be in
10532: entire possession of his past self, as old men doze for an instant and
10533: get back the consciousness of their youth: he seemed again to see Greek
10534: pages and understand them, again to feel his mind moving unbenumbed
10535: among familiar ideas. It had been but a flash, and the darkness closing
10536: in again seemed the more horrible; but might not the same thing happen
10537: again for longer periods? If it would only come and stay long enough
10538: for him to achieve a revenge—devise an exquisite suffering, such as a
10539: mere right arm could never inflict!
10540: 
10541: He raised himself from his stooping attitude, and, folding his arms,
10542: attempted to concentrate all his mental force on the plan he must
10543: immediately pursue. He had to wait for knowledge and opportunity, and
10544: while he waited he must have the means of living without beggary. What
10545: he dreaded of all things now was, that any one should think him a
10546: foolish, helpless old man. No one must know that half his memory was
10547: gone: the lost strength might come again; and if it were only for a
10548: little while, _that_ might be enough.
10549: 
10550: He knew how to begin to get the information he wanted about Tito. He
10551: had repeated the words “Bratti Ferravecchi” so constantly after they
10552: had been uttered to him, that they never slipped from him for long
10553: together. A man at Genoa, on whose finger he had seen Tito’s ring, had
10554: told him that he bought that ring at Florence, of a young Greek,
10555: well-dressed, and with a handsome dark face, in the shop of a
10556: _rigattiere_ called Bratti Ferravecchi, in the street also called
10557: Ferravecchi. This discovery had caused a violent agitation in
10558: Baldassarre. Until then he had clung with all the tenacity of his
10559: fervent nature to his faith in Tito, and had not for a moment believed
10560: himself to be wilfully forsaken. At first he had said, “My bit of
10561: parchment has never reached him; that is why I am still toiling at
10562: Antioch. But he is searching; he knows where I was lost: he will trace
10563: me out, and find me at last.” Then, when he was taken to Corinth, he
10564: induced his owners, by the assurance that he should be sought out and
10565: ransomed, to provide securely against the failure of any inquiries that
10566: might be made about him at Antioch; and at Corinth he thought joyfully,
10567: “Here, at last, he must find me. Here he is sure to touch, whichever
10568: way he goes.” But before another year had passed, the illness had come
10569: from which he had risen with body and mind so shattered that he was
10570: worse than worthless to his owners, except for the sake of the ransom
10571: that did not come. Then, as he sat helpless in the morning sunlight, he
10572: began to think, “Tito has been drowned, or they have made _him_ a
10573: prisoner too. I shall see him no more. He set out after me, but
10574: misfortune overtook him. I shall see his face no more.” Sitting in his
10575: new feebleness and despair, supporting his head between his hands, with
10576: blank eyes and lips that moved uncertainly, he looked so much like a
10577: hopelessly imbecile old man, that his owners were contented to be rid
10578: of him, and allowed a Genoese merchant, who had compassion on him as an
10579: Italian, to take him on board his galley. In a voyage of many months in
10580: the Archipelago and along the seaboard of Asia Minor, Baldassarre had
10581: recovered his bodily strength, but on landing at Genoa he had so weary
10582: a sense of his desolateness that he almost wished he had died of that
10583: illness at Corinth. There was just one possibility that hindered the
10584: wish from being decided: it was that Tito might not be dead, but living
10585: in a state of imprisonment or destitution; and if he lived, there was
10586: still a hope for Baldassarre—faint, perhaps, and likely to be long
10587: deferred, but still a hope, that he might find his child, his cherished
10588: son again; might yet again clasp hands and meet face to face with the
10589: one being who remembered him as he had been before his mind was broken.
10590: In this state of feeling he had chanced to meet the stranger who wore
10591: Tito’s onyx ring, and though Baldassarre would have been unable to
10592: describe the ring beforehand, the sight of it stirred the dormant
10593: fibres, and he recognised it. That Tito nearly a year after his father
10594: had been parted from him should have been living in apparent prosperity
10595: at Florence, selling the gem which he ought not to have sold till the
10596: last extremity, was a fact that Baldassarre shrank from trying to
10597: account for: he was glad to be stunned and bewildered by it, rather
10598: than to have any distinct thought; he tried to feel nothing but joy
10599: that he should behold Tito again. Perhaps Tito had thought that his
10600: father was dead; somehow the mystery would be explained. “But at least
10601: I shall meet eyes that will remember me. I am not alone in the world.”
10602: 
10603: And now again Baldassarre said, “I am not alone in the world; I shall
10604: never be alone, for my revenge is with me.”
10605: 
10606: It was as the instrument of that revenge, as something merely external
10607: and subservient to his true life, that he bent down again to examine
10608: himself with hard curiosity—not, he thought, because he had any care
10609: for a withered, forsaken old man, whom nobody loved, whose soul was
10610: like a deserted home, where the ashes were cold upon the hearth, and
10611: the walls were bare of all but the marks of what had been. It is in the
10612: nature of all human passion, the lowest as well as the highest, that
10613: there is a point where it ceases to be properly egoistic, and is like a
10614: fire kindled within our being to which everything else in us is mere
10615: fuel.
10616: 
10617: He looked at the pale black-browed image in the water till he
10618: identified it with that self from which his revenge seemed to be a
10619: thing apart; and he felt as if the image too heard the silent language
10620: of his thought.
10621: 
10622: “I was a loving fool—I worshipped a woman once, and believed she could
10623: care for me; and then I took a helpless child and fostered him; and I
10624: watched him as he grew, to see if he would care for me only a
10625: little—care for _me_ over and above the good he got from me. I would
10626: have torn open my breast to warm him with my life-blood if I could only
10627: have seen him care a little for the pain of my wound. I have laboured,
10628: I have strained to crush out of this hard life one drop of unselfish
10629: love. Fool! men love their own delights; there is no delight to be had
10630: in me. And yet I watched till I believed I saw what I watched for. When
10631: he was a child he lifted soft eyes towards me, and held my hand
10632: willingly: I thought, this boy will surely love me a little: because I
10633: give my life to him and strive that he shall know no sorrow, he will
10634: care a little when I am thirsty—the drop he lays on my parched lips
10635: will be a joy to him... Curses on him! I wish I may see him lie with
10636: those red lips white and dry as ashes, and when he looks for pity I
10637: wish he may see my face rejoicing in his pain. It is all a lie—this
10638: world is a lie—there is no goodness but in hate. Fool! not one drop of
10639: love came with all your striving: life has not given you one drop. But
10640: there are deep draughts in this world for hatred and revenge. I have
10641: memory left for that, and there is strength in my arm—there is strength
10642: in my will—and if I can do nothing but kill him—”
10643: 
10644: But Baldassarre’s mind rejected the thought of that brief punishment.
10645: His whole soul had been thrilled into immediate unreasoning belief in
10646: that eternity of vengeance where he, an undying hate, might clutch for
10647: ever an undying traitor, and hear that fair smiling hardness cry and
10648: moan with anguish. But the primary need and hope was to see a slow
10649: revenge under the same sky and on the same earth where he himself had
10650: been forsaken and had fainted with despair. And as soon as he tried to
10651: concentrate his mind on the means of attaining his end, the sense of
10652: his weakness pressed upon him like a frosty ache. This despised body,
10653: which was to be the instrument of a sublime vengeance, must be
10654: nourished and decently clad. If he had to wait he must labour, and his
10655: labour must be of a humble sort, for he had no skill. He wondered
10656: whether the sight of written characters would so stimulate his
10657: faculties that he might venture to try and find work as a copyist:
10658: _that_ might win him some credence for his past scholarship. But no! he
10659: dared trust neither hand nor brain. He must be content to do the work
10660: that was most like that of a beast of burden: in this mercantile city
10661: many porters must be wanted, and he could at least carry weights.
10662: Thanks to the justice that struggled in this confused world in behalf
10663: of vengeance, his limbs had got back some of their old sturdiness. He
10664: was stripped of all else that men would give coin for.
10665: 
10666: But the new urgency of this habitual thought brought a new suggestion.
10667: There was something hanging by a cord round his bare neck; something
10668: apparently so paltry that the piety of Turks and Frenchmen had spared
10669: it—a tiny parchment bag blackened with age. It had hung round his neck
10670: as a precious charm when he was a boy, and he had kept it carefully on
10671: his breast, not believing that it contained anything but a tiny scroll
10672: of parchment rolled up hard. He might long ago have thrown it away as a
10673: relic of his dead mother’s superstition; but he had thought of it as a
10674: relic of her love, and had kept it. It was part of the piety associated
10675: with such _brevi_, that they should never be opened, and at any
10676: previous moment in his life Baldassarre would have said that no sort of
10677: thirst would prevail upon him to open this little bag for the chance of
10678: finding that it contained, not parchment, but an engraved amulet which
10679: would be worth money. But now a thirst had come like that which makes
10680: men open their own veins to satisfy it, and the thought of the possible
10681: amulet no sooner crossed Baldassarre’s mind than with nervous fingers
10682: he snatched the _breve_ from his neck. It all rushed through his
10683: mind—the long years he had worn it, the far-off sunny balcony at Naples
10684: looking towards the blue waters, where he had leaned against his
10685: mother’s knee; but it made no moment of hesitation: all piety now was
10686: transmuted into a just revenge. He bit and tore till the doubles of
10687: parchment were laid open, and then—it was a sight that made him
10688: pant—there _was_ an amulet. It was very small, but it was as blue as
10689: those far-off waters; it was an engraved sapphire, which must be worth
10690: some gold ducats. Baldassarre no sooner saw those possible ducats than
10691: he saw some of them exchanged for a poniard. He did not want to use the
10692: poniard yet, but he longed to possess it. If he could grasp its handle
10693: and try its edge, that blank in his mind—that past which fell away
10694: continually—would not make him feel so cruelly helpless: the sharp
10695: steel that despised talents and eluded strength would be at his side,
10696: as the unfailing friend of feeble justice. There was a sparkling
10697: triumph under Baldassarre’s black eyebrows as he replaced the little
10698: sapphire inside the bits of parchment and wound the string tightly
10699: round them.
10700: 
10701: It was nearly dusk now, and he rose to walk back towards Florence. With
10702: his _danari_ to buy him some bread, he felt rich: he could lie out in
10703: the open air, as he found plenty more doing in all corners of Florence.
10704: And in the next few days he had sold his sapphire, had added to his
10705: clothing, had bought a bright dagger, and had still a pair of gold
10706: florins left. But he meant to hoard that treasure carefully: his
10707: lodging was an outhouse with a heap of straw in it, in a thinly
10708: inhabited part of Oltrarno, and he thought of looking about for work as
10709: a porter.
10710: 
10711: He had bought his dagger at Bratti’s. Paying his meditated visit there
10712: one evening at dusk, he had found that singular rag-merchant just
10713: returned from one of his rounds, emptying out his basketful of broken
10714: glass and old iron amongst his handsome show of miscellaneous
10715: second-hand goods. As Baldassarre entered the shop, and looked towards
10716: the smart pieces of apparel, the musical instruments, and weapons,
10717: which were displayed in the broadest light of the window, his eye at
10718: once singled out a dagger hanging up high against a red scarf. By
10719: buying the dagger he could not only satisfy a strong desire, he could
10720: open his original errand in a more indirect manner than by speaking of
10721: the onyx ring. In the course of bargaining for the weapon, he let drop,
10722: with cautious carelessness, that he came from Genoa, and had been
10723: directed to Bratti’s shop by an acquaintance in that city who had
10724: bought a very valuable ring here. Had the respectable trader any more
10725: such rings?
10726: 
10727: Whereupon Bratti had much to say as to the unlikelihood of such rings
10728: being within reach of many people, with much vaunting of his own rare
10729: connections, due to his known wisdom, and honesty. It might be true
10730: that he was a pedlar—he chose to be a pedlar; though he was rich enough
10731: to kick his heels in his shop all day. But those who thought they had
10732: said all there was to be said about Bratti when they had called him a
10733: pedlar, were a good deal further off the truth than the other side of
10734: Pisa. How was it that he could put that ring in a stranger’s way? It
10735: was, because he had a very particular knowledge of a handsome young
10736: signor, who did not look quite so fine a feathered bird when Bratti
10737: first set eyes on him as he did at the present time. And by a question
10738: or two Baldassarre extracted, without any trouble, such a rough and
10739: rambling account of Tito’s life as the pedlar could give, since the
10740: time when he had found him sleeping under the Loggia de’ Cerchi. It
10741: never occurred to Bratti that the decent man (who was rather deaf,
10742: apparently, asking him to say many things twice over) had any curiosity
10743: about Tito; the curiosity was doubtless about himself, as a truly
10744: remarkable pedlar.
10745: 
10746: And Baldassarre left Bratti’s shop, not only with the dagger at his
10747: side, but also with a general knowledge of Tito’s conduct and
10748: position—of his early sale of the jewels, his immediate quiet
10749: settlement of himself at Florence, his marriage, and his great
10750: prosperity.
10751: 
10752: “What story had he told about his previous life—about his father?”
10753: 
10754: It would be difficult for Baldassarre to discover the answer to that
10755: question. Meanwhile, he wanted to learn all he could about Florence.
10756: But he found, to his acute distress, that of the new details he learned
10757: he could only retain a few, and those only by continual repetition; and
10758: he began to be afraid of listening to any new discourse, lest it should
10759: obliterate what he was already striving to remember.
10760: 
10761: The day he was discerned by Tito in the Piazza del Duomo, he had the
10762: fresh anguish of this consciousness in his mind, and Tito’s ready
10763: speech fell upon him like the mockery of a glib, defying demon.
10764: 
10765: As he went home to his heap of straw, and passed by the booksellers’
10766: shops in the Via del Garbo, he paused to look at the volumes spread
10767: open. Could he by long gazing at one of those books lay hold of the
10768: slippery threads of memory? Could he, by striving, get a firm grasp
10769: somewhere, and lift himself above these waters that flowed over him?
10770: 
10771: He was tempted, and bought the cheapest Greek book he could see. He
10772: carried it home and sat on his heap of straw, looking at the characters
10773: by the light of the small window; but no inward light arose on them.
10774: Soon the evening darkness came; but it made little difference to
10775: Baldassarre. His strained eyes seemed still to see the white pages with
10776: the unintelligible black marks upon them.
10777: 
10778: 
10779: 
10780: 
10781: CHAPTER XXXI.
10782: Fruit is Seed.
10783: 
10784: 
10785: “My Romola,” said Tito, the second morning after he had made his speech
10786: in the Piazza del Duomo, “I am to receive grand visitors to-day; the
10787: Milanese Count is coming again, and the Seneschal de Beaucaire, the
10788: great favourite of the Cristianissimo. I know you don’t care to go
10789: through smiling ceremonies with these rustling magnates, whom we are
10790: not likely to see again; and as they will want to look at the
10791: antiquities and the library, perhaps you had better give up your work
10792: to-day, and go to see your cousin Brigida.”
10793: 
10794: Romola discerned a wish in this intimation, and immediately assented.
10795: But presently, coming back in her hood and mantle, she said, “Oh, what
10796: a long breath Florence will take when the gates are flung open, and the
10797: last Frenchman is walking out of them! Even you are getting tired, with
10798: all your patience, my Tito; confess it. Ah, your head is hot.”
10799: 
10800: He was leaning over his desk, writing, and she had laid her hand on his
10801: head, meaning to give a parting caress. The attitude had been a
10802: frequent one, and Tito was accustomed, when he felt her hand there, to
10803: raise his head, throw himself a little backward, and look up at her.
10804: But he felt now as unable to raise his head as if her hand had been a
10805: leaden cowl. He spoke instead, in a light tone, as his pen still ran
10806: along.
10807: 
10808: “The French are as ready to go from Florence as the wasps to leave a
10809: ripe pear when they have just fastened on it.”
10810: 
10811: Romola, keenly sensitive to the absence of the usual response, took
10812: away her hand and said, “I am going, Tito.”
10813: 
10814: “Farewell, my sweet one. I must wait at home. Take Maso with you.”
10815: 
10816: Still Tito did not look up, and Romola went out without saying any
10817: more. Very slight things make epochs in married life, and this morning
10818: for the first time she admitted to herself not only that Tito had
10819: changed, but that he had changed towards her. Did the reason lie in
10820: herself? She might perhaps have thought so, if there had not been the
10821: facts of the armour and the picture to suggest some external event
10822: which was an entire mystery to her.
10823: 
10824: But Tito no sooner believed that Romola was out of the house than he
10825: laid down his pen and looked up, in delightful security from seeing
10826: anything else than parchment and broken marble. He was rather disgusted
10827: with himself that he had not been able to look up at Romola and behave
10828: to her just as usual. He would have chosen, if he could, to be even
10829: more than usually kind; but he could not, on a sudden, master an
10830: involuntary shrinking from her, which, by a subtle relation, depended
10831: on those very characteristics in him that made him desire not to fail
10832: in his marks of affection. He was about to take a step which he knew
10833: would arouse her deep indignation; he would have to encounter much that
10834: was unpleasant before he could win her forgiveness. And Tito could
10835: never find it easy to face displeasure and anger; his nature was one of
10836: those most remote from defiance or impudence, and all his inclinations
10837: leaned towards preserving Romola’s tenderness. He was not tormented by
10838: sentimental scruples which, as he had demonstrated to himself by a very
10839: rapid course of argument, had no relation to solid utility; but his
10840: freedom from scruples did not release him from the dread of what was
10841: disagreeable. Unscrupulousness gets rid of much, but not of toothache,
10842: or wounded vanity, or the sense of loneliness, against which, as the
10843: world at present stands, there is no security but a thoroughly healthy
10844: jaw, and a just, loving soul. And Tito was feeling intensely at this
10845: moment that no devices could save him from pain in the impending
10846: collision with Romola; no persuasive blandness could cushion him
10847: against the shock towards which he was being driven like a timid animal
10848: urged to a desperate leap by the terror of the tooth and the claw that
10849: are close behind it.
10850: 
10851: The secret feeling he had previously had that the tenacious adherence
10852: to Bardo’s wishes about the library had become under existing
10853: difficulties a piece of sentimental folly, which deprived himself and
10854: Romola of substantial advantages, might perhaps never have wrought
10855: itself into action but for the events of the past week, which had
10856: brought at once the pressure of a new motive and the outlet of a rare
10857: opportunity. Nay, it was not till his dread had been aggravated by the
10858: sight of Baldassarre looking more like his sane self, not until he had
10859: begun to feel that he might be compelled to flee from Florence, that he
10860: had brought himself to resolve on using his legal right to sell the
10861: library before the great opportunity offered by French and Milanese
10862: bidders slipped through his fingers. For if he had to leave Florence he
10863: did not want to leave it as a destitute wanderer. He had been used to
10864: an agreeable existence, and he wished to carry with him all the means
10865: at hand for retaining the same agreeable conditions. He wished among
10866: other things to carry Romola with him, and _not_, if possible, to carry
10867: any infamy. Success had given him a growing appetite for all the
10868: pleasures that depend on an advantageous social position, and at no
10869: moment could it look like a temptation to him, but only like a hideous
10870: alternative, to decamp under dishonour, even with a bag of diamonds,
10871: and incur the life of an adventurer. It was not possible for him to
10872: make himself independent even of those Florentines who only greeted him
10873: with regard; still less was it possible for him to make himself
10874: independent of Romola. She was the wife of his first love—he loved her
10875: still; she belonged to that furniture of life which he shrank from
10876: parting with. He winced under her judgment, he felt uncertain how far
10877: the revulsion of her feeling towards him might go; and all that sense
10878: of power over a wife which makes a husband risk betrayals that a lover
10879: never ventures on, would not suffice to counteract Tito’s uneasiness.
10880: This was the leaden weight which had been too strong for his will, and
10881: kept him from raising his head to meet her eyes. Their pure light
10882: brought too near him the prospect of a coming struggle. But it was not
10883: to be helped; if they had to leave Florence, they must have money;
10884: indeed, Tito could not arrange life at all to his mind without a
10885: considerable sum of money. And that problem of arranging life to his
10886: mind had been the source of all his misdoing. He would have been equal
10887: to any sacrifice that was not unpleasant.
10888: 
10889: The rustling magnates came and went, the bargains had been concluded,
10890: and Romola returned home; but nothing grave was said that night. Tito
10891: was only gay and chatty, pouring forth to her, as he had not done
10892: before, stories and descriptions of what he had witnessed during the
10893: French visit. Romola thought she discerned an effort in his liveliness,
10894: and attributing it to the consciousness in him that she had been
10895: wounded in the morning, accepted the effort as an act of penitence,
10896: inwardly aching a little at that sign of growing distance between
10897: them—that there was an offence about which neither of them dared to
10898: speak.
10899: 
10900: The next day Tito remained away from home until late at night. It was a
10901: marked day to Romola, for Piero di Cosimo, stimulated to greater
10902: industry on her behalf by the fear that he might have been the cause of
10903: pain to her in the past week, had sent home her father’s portrait. She
10904: had propped it against the back of his old chair, and had been looking
10905: at it for some time, when the door opened behind her, and Bernardo del
10906: Nero came in.
10907: 
10908: “It is you, godfather! How I wish you had come sooner! it is getting a
10909: little dusk,” said Romola, going towards him.
10910: 
10911: “I have just looked in to tell you the good news, for I know Tito has
10912: not come yet,” said Bernardo. “The French king moves off to-morrow: not
10913: before it is high time. There has been another tussle between our
10914: people and his soldiers this morning. But there’s a chance now of the
10915: city getting into order once more and trade going on.”
10916: 
10917: “That is joyful,” said Romola. “But it is sudden, is it not? Tito
10918: seemed to think yesterday that there was little prospect of the king’s
10919: going soon.”
10920: 
10921: “He has been well barked at, that’s the reason,” said Bernardo,
10922: smiling. “His own generals opened their throats pretty well, and at
10923: last our Signoria sent the mastiff of the city, Fra Girolamo. The
10924: Cristianissimo was frightened at that thunder, and has given the order
10925: to move. I’m afraid there’ll be small agreement among us when he’s
10926: gone, but, at any rate, all parties are agreed in being glad not to
10927: have Florence stifled with soldiery any longer, and the Frate has
10928: barked this time to some purpose. Ah, what is this?” he added, as
10929: Romola, clasping him by the arm, led him in front of the picture. “Let
10930: us see.”
10931: 
10932: He began to unwind his long scarf while she placed a seat for him.
10933: 
10934: “Don’t you want your spectacles, godfather?” said Romola, in anxiety
10935: that he should see just what she saw.
10936: 
10937: “No, child, no,” said Bernardo, uncovering his grey head, as he seated
10938: himself with firm erectness. “For seeing at this distance, my old eyes
10939: are perhaps better than your young ones. Old men’s eyes are like old
10940: men’s memories; they are strongest for things a long way off.”
10941: 
10942: “It is better than having no portrait,” said Romola, apologetically,
10943: after Bernardo had been silent a little while. “It is less like him now
10944: than the image I have in my mind, but then that might fade with the
10945: years.” She rested her arm on the old man’s shoulder as she spoke,
10946: drawn towards him strongly by their common interest in the dead.
10947: 
10948: “I don’t know,” said Bernardo. “I almost think I see Bardo as he was
10949: when he was young, better than that picture shows him to me as he was
10950: when he was old. Your father had a great deal of fire in his eyes when
10951: he was young. It was what I could never understand, that he, with his
10952: fiery spirit, which seemed much more impatient than mine, could hang
10953: over the books and live with shadows all his life. However, he had put
10954: his heart into that.”
10955: 
10956: Bernardo gave a slight shrug as he spoke the last words, but Romola
10957: discerned in his voice a feeling that accorded with her own.
10958: 
10959: “And he was disappointed to the last,” she said, involuntarily. But
10960: immediately fearing lest her words should be taken to imply an
10961: accusation against Tito, she went on almost hurriedly, “If we could
10962: only see his longest, dearest wish fulfilled just to his mind!”
10963: 
10964: “Well, so we may,” said Bernardo, kindly, rising and putting on his
10965: cap. “The times are cloudy now, but fish are caught by waiting. Who
10966: knows? When the wheel has turned often enough, I may be Gonfaloniere
10967: yet before I die; and no creditor can touch these things.” He looked
10968: round as he spoke. Then, turning to her, and patting her cheek, said,
10969: “And you need not be afraid of my dying; my ghost will claim nothing.
10970: I’ve taken care of that in my will.”
10971: 
10972: Romola seized the hand that was against her cheek, and put it to her
10973: lips in silence.
10974: 
10975: “Haven’t you been scolding your husband for keeping away from home so
10976: much lately? I see him everywhere but here,” said Bernardo, willing to
10977: change the subject.
10978: 
10979: She felt the flush spread over her neck and face as she said, “He has
10980: been very much wanted; you know he speaks so well. I am glad to know
10981: that his value is understood.”
10982: 
10983: “You are contented then, Madonna Orgogliosa?” said Bernardo, smiling,
10984: as he moved to the door.
10985: 
10986: “Assuredly.”
10987: 
10988: Poor Romola! There was one thing that would have made the pang of
10989: disappointment in her husband harder to bear; it was, that any one
10990: should know he gave her cause for disappointment. This might be a
10991: woman’s weakness, but it is closely allied to a woman’s nobleness. She
10992: who willingly lifts up the veil of her married life has profaned it
10993: from a sanctuary into a vulgar place.
10994: 
10995: 
10996: 
10997: 
10998: CHAPTER XXXII.
10999: A Revelation.
11000: 
11001: 
11002: The next day Romola, like every other Florentine, was excited about the
11003: departure of the French. Besides her other reasons for gladness, she
11004: had a dim hope, which she was conscious was half superstitious, that
11005: those new anxieties about Tito, having come with the burdensome guests,
11006: might perhaps vanish with them. The French had been in Florence hardly
11007: eleven days, but in that space she had felt more acute unhappiness than
11008: she had known in her life before. Tito had adopted the hateful armour
11009: on the day of their arrival, and though she could frame no distinct
11010: notion why their departure should remove the cause of his fear—though,
11011: when she thought of that cause, the image of the prisoner grasping him,
11012: as she had seen it in Piero’s sketch, urged itself before her and
11013: excluded every other—still, when the French were gone, she would be rid
11014: of something that was strongly associated with her pain.
11015: 
11016: Wrapped in her mantle she waited under the loggia at the top of the
11017: house, and watched for the glimpses of the troops and the royal retinue
11018: passing the bridges on their way to the Porta San Piero, that looks
11019: towards Siena and Rome. She even returned to her station when the gates
11020: had been closed, that she might feel herself vibrating with the great
11021: peal of the bells. It was dusk then, and when at last she descended
11022: into the library, she lit her lamp with the resolution that she would
11023: overcome the agitation which had made her idle all day, and sit down to
11024: work at her copying of the catalogue. Tito had left home early in the
11025: morning, and she did not expect him yet. Before he came she intended to
11026: leave the library, and sit in the pretty saloon, with the dancing
11027: nymphs and the birds. She had done so every evening since he had
11028: objected to the library as chill and gloomy.
11029: 
11030: To her great surprise, she had not been at work long before Tito
11031: entered. Her first thought was, how cheerless he would feel in the wide
11032: darkness of this great room, with one little oil-lamp burning at the
11033: further end, and the fire nearly out. She almost ran towards him.
11034: 
11035: “Tito, dearest, I did not know you would come so soon,” she said,
11036: nervously, putting up her white arms to unwind his becchetto.
11037: 
11038: “I am not welcome then?” he said, with one of his brightest smiles,
11039: clasping her, but playfully holding his head back from her.
11040: 
11041: “Tito!” She uttered the word in a tone of pretty, loving reproach, and
11042: then he kissed her fondly, stroked her hair, as his manner was, and
11043: seemed not to mind about taking off his mantle yet. Romola quivered
11044: with delight. All the emotions of the day had been preparing in her a
11045: keener sensitiveness to the return of this habitual manner. “It will
11046: come back,” she was saying to herself, “the old happiness will perhaps
11047: come back. He is like himself again.”
11048: 
11049: Tito was taking great pains to be like himself; his heart was
11050: palpitating with anxiety.
11051: 
11052: “If I had expected you so soon,” said Romola, as she at last helped him
11053: to take off his wrappings, “I would have had a little festival prepared
11054: to this joyful ringing of the bells. I did not mean to be here in the
11055: library when you came home.”
11056: 
11057: “Never mind, sweet,” he said, carelessly. “Do not think about the fire.
11058: Come—come and sit down.”
11059: 
11060: There was a low stool against Tito’s chair, and that was Romola’s
11061: habitual seat when they were talking together. She rested her arm on
11062: his knee, as she used to do on her father’s, and looked up at him while
11063: he spoke. He had never yet noticed the presence of the portrait, and
11064: she had not mentioned it—thinking of it all the more.
11065: 
11066: “I have been enjoying the clang of the bells for the first time, Tito,”
11067: she began. “I liked being shaken and deafened by them: I fancied I was
11068: something like a Bacchante possessed by a divine rage. Are not the
11069: people looking very joyful to-night?”
11070: 
11071: “Joyful after a sour and pious fashion,” said Tito, with a shrug. “But,
11072: in truth, those who are left behind in Florence have little cause to be
11073: joyful: it seems to me, the most reasonable ground of gladness would be
11074: to have got out of Florence.”
11075: 
11076: Tito had sounded the desired key-note without any trouble, or
11077: appearance of premeditation. He spoke with no emphasis, but he looked
11078: grave enough to make Romola ask rather anxiously—
11079: 
11080: “Why, Tito? Are there fresh troubles?”
11081: 
11082: “No need of fresh ones, my Romola. There are three strong parties in
11083: the city, all ready to fly at each other’s throats. And if the Frate’s
11084: party is strong enough to frighten the other two into silence, as seems
11085: most likely, life will be as pleasant and amusing as a funeral. They
11086: have the plan of a Great Council simmering already; and if they get it,
11087: the man who sings sacred Lauds the loudest will be the most eligible
11088: for office. And besides that, the city will be so drained by the
11089: payment of this great subsidy to the French king, and by the war to get
11090: back Pisa, that the prospect would be dismal enough without the rule of
11091: fanatics. On the whole, Florence will be a delightful place for those
11092: worthies who entertain themselves in the evening by going into crypts
11093: and lashing themselves; but for everything else, the exiles have the
11094: best of it. For my own part, I have been thinking seriously that we
11095: should be wise to quit Florence, my Romola.”
11096: 
11097: She started. “Tito, how could we leave Florence? Surely you do not
11098: think I could leave it—at least, not yet—not for a long while.” She had
11099: turned cold and trembling, and did not find it quite easy to speak.
11100: Tito must know the reasons she had in her mind.
11101: 
11102: “That is all a fabric of your own imagination, my sweet one. Your
11103: secluded life has made you lay such false stress on a few things. You
11104: know I used to tell you, before we were married, that I wished we were
11105: somewhere else than in Florence. If you had seen more places and more
11106: people, you would know what I mean when I say that there is something
11107: in the Florentines that reminds me of their cutting spring winds. I
11108: like people who take life less eagerly; and it would be good for my
11109: Romola, too, to see a new life. I should like to dip her a little in
11110: the soft waters of forgetfulness.”
11111: 
11112: He leaned forward and kissed her brow, and laid his hand on her fair
11113: hair again; but she felt his caress no more than if he had kissed a
11114: mask. She was too much agitated by the sense of the distance between
11115: their minds to be conscious that his lips touched her.
11116: 
11117: “Tito, it is not because I suppose Florence is the pleasantest place in
11118: the world that I desire not to quit it. It is because I—because we have
11119: to see my father’s wish fulfilled. My godfather is old; he is
11120: seventy-one; we could not leave it to him.”
11121: 
11122: “It is precisely those superstitions which hang about your mind like
11123: bedimming clouds, my Romola, that make one great reason why I could
11124: wish we were two hundred leagues from Florence. I am obliged to take
11125: care of you in opposition to your own will: if those dear eyes, that
11126: look so tender, see falsely, I must see for them, and save my wife from
11127: wasting her life in disappointing herself by impracticable dreams.”
11128: 
11129: Romola sat silent and motionless: she could not blind herself to the
11130: direction in which Tito’s words pointed: he wanted to persuade her that
11131: they might get the library deposited in some monastery, or take some
11132: other ready means to rid themselves of a task, and of a tie to
11133: Florence; and she was determined never to submit her mind to his
11134: judgment on this question of duty to her father; she was inwardly
11135: prepared to encounter any sort of pain in resistance. But the
11136: determination was kept latent in these first moments by the
11137: heart-crushing sense that now at last she and Tito must be confessedly
11138: divided in their wishes. He was glad of her silence; for, much as he
11139: had feared the strength of her feeling, it was impossible for him, shut
11140: up in the narrowness that hedges in all merely clever, unimpassioned
11141: men, not to over-estimate the persuasiveness of his own arguments. His
11142: conduct did not look ugly to himself, and his imagination did not
11143: suffice to show him exactly how it would look to Romola. He went on in
11144: the same gentle, remonstrating tone.
11145: 
11146: “You know, dearest—your own clear judgment always showed you—that the
11147: notion of isolating a collection of books and antiquities, and
11148: attaching a single name to them for ever, was one that had no valid,
11149: substantial good for its object: and yet more, one that was liable to
11150: be defeated in a thousand ways. See what has become of the Medici
11151: collections! And, for my part, I consider it even blameworthy to
11152: entertain those petty views of appropriation: why should any one be
11153: reasonably glad that Florence should possess the benefits of learned
11154: research and taste more than any other city? I understand your feeling
11155: about the wishes of the dead; but wisdom puts a limit to these
11156: sentiments, else lives might be continually wasted in that sort of
11157: futile devotion—like praising deaf gods for ever. You gave your life to
11158: your father while he lived; why should you demand more of yourself?”
11159: 
11160: “Because it was a trust,” said Romola, in a low but distinct voice. “He
11161: trusted me, he trusted you, Tito. I did not expect you to feel anything
11162: else about it—to feel as I do—but I did expect you to feel that.”
11163: 
11164: “Yes, dearest, of course I should feel it on a point where your
11165: father’s real welfare or happiness was concerned; but there is no
11166: question of that now. If we believed in purgatory, I should be as
11167: anxious as you to have masses said; and if I believed it could now pain
11168: your father to see his library preserved and used in a rather different
11169: way from what he had set his mind on, I should share the strictness of
11170: your views. But a little philosophy should teach us to rid ourselves of
11171: those air-woven fetters that mortals hang round themselves, spending
11172: their lives in misery under the mere imagination of weight. Your mind,
11173: which seizes ideas so readily, my Romola, is able to discriminate
11174: between substantial good and these brain-wrought fantasies. Ask
11175: yourself, dearest, what possible good can these books and antiquities
11176: do, stowed together under your father’s name in Florence, more than
11177: they would do if they were divided or carried elsewhere? Nay, is not
11178: the very dispersion of such things in hands that know how to value
11179: them, one means of extending their usefulness? This rivalry of Italian
11180: cities is very petty and illiberal. The loss of Constantinople was the
11181: gain of the whole civilised world.”
11182: 
11183: Romola was still too thoroughly under the painful pressure of the new
11184: revelation Tito was making of himself, for her resistance to find any
11185: strong vent. As that fluent talk fell on her ears there was a rising
11186: contempt within her, which only made her more conscious of her bruised,
11187: despairing love, her love for the Tito she had married and believed in.
11188: Her nature, possessed with the energies of strong emotion, recoiled
11189: from this hopelessly shallow readiness which professed to appropriate
11190: the widest sympathies and had no pulse for the nearest. She still spoke
11191: like one who was restrained from showing all she felt. She had only
11192: drawn away her arm from his knee, and sat with her hands clasped before
11193: her, cold and motionless as locked waters.
11194: 
11195: “You talk of substantial good, Tito! Are faithfulness, and love, and
11196: sweet grateful memories, no good? Is it no good that we should keep our
11197: silent promises on which others build because they believe in our love
11198: and truth? Is it no good that a just life should be justly honoured?
11199: Or, is it good that we should harden our hearts against all the wants
11200: and hopes of those who have depended on us? What good can belong to men
11201: who have such souls? To talk cleverly, perhaps, and find soft couches
11202: for themselves, and live and die with their base selves as their best
11203: companions.”
11204: 
11205: Her voice had gradually risen till there was a ring of scorn in the
11206: last words; she made a slight pause, but he saw there were other words
11207: quivering on her lips, and he chose to let them come.
11208: 
11209: “I know of no good for cities or the world if they are to be made up of
11210: such beings. But I am not thinking of other Italian cities and the
11211: whole civilised world—I am thinking of my father, and of my love and
11212: sorrow for him, and of his just claims on us. I would give up anything
11213: else, Tito,—I would leave Florence,—what else did I live for but for
11214: him and you? But I will not give up that duty. What have I to do with
11215: your arguments? It was a yearning of _his_ heart, and therefore it is a
11216: yearning of mine.”
11217: 
11218: Her voice, from having been tremulous, had become full and firm. She
11219: felt that she had been urged on to say all that it was needful for her
11220: to say. She thought, poor thing, there was nothing harder to come than
11221: this struggle against Tito’s suggestions as against the meaner part of
11222: herself.
11223: 
11224: He had begun to see clearly that he could not persuade her into assent:
11225: he must take another course, and show her that the time for resistance
11226: was past. That, at least, would put an end to further struggle; and if
11227: the disclosure were not made by himself to-night, to-morrow it must be
11228: made in another way. This necessity nerved his courage; and his
11229: experience of her affectionateness and unexpected submissiveness, ever
11230: since their marriage until now, encouraged him to hope that, at last,
11231: she would accommodate herself to what had been his will.
11232: 
11233: “I am sorry to hear you speak in that spirit of blind persistence, my
11234: Romola,” he said, quietly, “because it obliges me to give you pain. But
11235: I partly foresaw your opposition, and as a prompt decision was
11236: necessary, I avoided that obstacle, and decided without consulting you.
11237: The very care of a husband for his wife’s interest compels him to that
11238: separate action sometimes—even when he has such a wife as you, my
11239: Romola.”
11240: 
11241: She turned her eyes on him in breathless inquiry.
11242: 
11243: “I mean,” he said, answering her look, “that I have arranged for the
11244: transfer, both of the books and of the antiquities, where they will
11245: find the highest use and value. The books have been bought for the Duke
11246: of Milan, the marbles and bronzes and the rest are going to France: and
11247: both will be protected by the stability of a great Power, instead of
11248: remaining in a city which is exposed to ruin.”
11249: 
11250: Before he had finished speaking, Romola had started from her seat, and
11251: stood up looking down at him, with tightened hands falling before her,
11252: and, for the first time in her life, with a flash of fierceness in her
11253: scorn and anger.
11254: 
11255: “You have _sold_ them?” she asked, as if she distrusted her ears.
11256: 
11257: “I have,” said Tito, quailing a little. The scene was unpleasant—the
11258: descending scorn already scorched him.
11259: 
11260: “You are a treacherous man!” she said, with something grating in her
11261: voice, as she looked down at him.
11262: 
11263: She was silent for a minute, and he sat still, feeling that ingenuity
11264: was powerless just now. Suddenly she turned away, and said in an
11265: agitated tone, “It may be hindered—I am going to my godfather.”
11266: 
11267: In an instant Tito started up, went to the door, locked it, and took
11268: out the key. It was time for all the masculine predominance that was
11269: latent in him to show itself. But he was not angry; he only felt that
11270: the moment was eminently unpleasant, and that when this scene was at an
11271: end he should be glad to keep away from Romola for a little while. But
11272: it was absolutely necessary first that she should be reduced to
11273: passiveness.
11274: 
11275: “Try to calm yourself a little, Romola,” he said, leaning in the
11276: easiest attitude possible against a pedestal under the bust of a grim
11277: old Roman. Not that he was inwardly easy: his heart palpitated with a
11278: moral dread, against which no chain-armour could be found. He had
11279: locked in his wife’s anger and scorn, but he had been obliged to lock
11280: himself in with it; and his blood did not rise with contest—his olive
11281: cheek was perceptibly paled.
11282: 
11283: Romola had paused and turned her eyes on him as she saw him take his
11284: stand and lodge the key in his scarsella. Her eyes were flashing, and
11285: her whole frame seemed to be possessed by impetuous force that wanted
11286: to leap out in some deed. All the crushing pain of disappointment in
11287: her husband, which had made the strongest part of her consciousness a
11288: few minutes before, was annihilated by the vehemence of her
11289: indignation. She could not care in this moment that the man she was
11290: despising as he leaned there in his loathsome beauty—she could not care
11291: that he was her husband; she could only feel that she despised him. The
11292: pride and fierceness of the old Bardo blood had been thoroughly awaked
11293: in her for the first time.
11294: 
11295: “Try at least to understand the fact,” said Tito, “and do not seek to
11296: take futile steps which may be fatal. It is of no use for you to go to
11297: your godfather. Messer Bernardo cannot reverse what I have done. Only
11298: sit down. You would hardly wish, if you were quite yourself, to make
11299: known to any third person what passes between us in private.”
11300: 
11301: Tito knew that he had touched the right fibre there. But she did not
11302: sit down; she was too unconscious of her body voluntarily to change her
11303: attitude.
11304: 
11305: “Why can it not be reversed?” she said, after a pause. “Nothing is
11306: moved yet.”
11307: 
11308: “Simply because the sale has been concluded by written agreement; the
11309: purchasers have left Florence, and I hold the bonds for the
11310: purchase-money.”
11311: 
11312: “If my father had suspected you of being a faithless man,” said Romola,
11313: in a tone of bitter scorn, which insisted on darting out before she
11314: could say anything else, “he would have placed the library safely out
11315: of your power. But death overtook him too soon, and when you were sure
11316: his ear was deaf, and his hand stiff, you robbed him.” She paused an
11317: instant, and then said, with gathered passion, “Have you robbed
11318: somebody else, who is _not_ dead? Is that the reason you wear armour?”
11319: 
11320: Romola had been driven to utter the words as men are driven to use the
11321: lash of the horsewhip. At first, Tito felt horribly cowed; it seemed to
11322: him that the disgrace he had been dreading would be worse than he had
11323: imagined it. But soon there was a reaction: such power of dislike and
11324: resistance as there was within him was beginning to rise against a wife
11325: whose voice seemed like the herald of a retributive fate. Her, at
11326: least, his quick mind told him that he might master.
11327: 
11328: “It is useless,” he said, coolly, “to answer the words of madness,
11329: Romola. Your peculiar feeling about your father has made you mad at
11330: this moment. Any rational person looking at the case from a due
11331: distance will see that I have taken the wisest course. Apart from the
11332: influence of your exaggerated feelings on him, I am convinced that
11333: Messer Bernardo would be of that opinion.”
11334: 
11335: “He would not!” said Romola. “He lives in the hope of seeing my
11336: father’s wish exactly fulfilled. We spoke of it together only
11337: yesterday. He will help me yet. Who are these men to whom you have sold
11338: my father’s property?”
11339: 
11340: “There is no reason why you should not be told, except that it
11341: signifies little. The Count di San Severino and the Seneschal de
11342: Beaucaire are now on their way with the king to Siena.”
11343: 
11344: “They may be overtaken and persuaded to give up their purchase,” said
11345: Romola, eagerly, her anger beginning to be surmounted by anxious
11346: thought.
11347: 
11348: “No, they may not,” said Tito, with cool decision.
11349: 
11350: “Why?”
11351: 
11352: “Because I do not choose that they should.”
11353: 
11354: “But if you were paid the money?—we will pay you the money,” said
11355: Romola.
11356: 
11357: No words could have disclosed more fully her sense of alienation from
11358: Tito; but they were spoken with less of bitterness than of anxious
11359: pleading. And he felt stronger, for he saw that the first impulse of
11360: fury was past.
11361: 
11362: “No, my Romola. Understand that such thoughts as these are
11363: impracticable. You would not, in a reasonable moment, ask your
11364: godfather to bury three thousand florins in addition to what he has
11365: already paid on the library. I think your pride and delicacy would
11366: shrink from that.”
11367: 
11368: She began to tremble and turn cold again with discouragement, and sank
11369: down on the carved chest near which she was standing. He went on in a
11370: clear voice, under which she shuddered, as if it had been a narrow cold
11371: stream coursing over a hot cheek.
11372: 
11373: “Moreover, it is not my will that Messer Bernardo should advance the
11374: money, even if the project were not an utterly wild one. And I beg you
11375: to consider, before you take any step or utter any word on the subject,
11376: what will be the consequences of your placing yourself in opposition to
11377: me, and trying to exhibit your husband in the odious light which your
11378: own distempered feelings cast over him. What object will you serve by
11379: injuring me with Messer Bernardo? The event is irrevocable, the library
11380: is sold, and you are my wife.”
11381: 
11382: Every word was spoken for the sake of a calculated effect, for his
11383: intellect was urged into the utmost activity by the danger of the
11384: crisis. He knew that Romola’s mind would take in rapidly enough all the
11385: wide meaning of his speech. He waited and watched her in silence.
11386: 
11387: She had turned her eyes from him, and was looking on the ground, and in
11388: that way she sat for several minutes. When she spoke, her voice was
11389: quite altered,—it was quiet and cold.
11390: 
11391: “I have one thing to ask.”
11392: 
11393: “Ask anything that I can do without injuring us both, Romola.”
11394: 
11395: “That you will give me that portion of the money which belongs to my
11396: godfather, and let me pay him.”
11397: 
11398: “I must have some assurance from you, first, of the attitude you intend
11399: to take towards me.”
11400: 
11401: “Do you believe in assurances, Tito?” she said, with a tinge of
11402: returning bitterness.
11403: 
11404: “From you, I do.”
11405: 
11406: “I will do you no harm. I shall disclose nothing. I will say nothing to
11407: pain him or you. You say truly, the event is irrevocable.”
11408: 
11409: “Then I will do what you desire to-morrow morning.”
11410: 
11411: “To-night, if possible,” said Romola, “that we may not speak of it
11412: again.”
11413: 
11414: “It is possible,” he said, moving towards the lamp, while she sat
11415: still, looking away from him with absent eyes.
11416: 
11417: Presently he came and bent down over her, to put a piece of paper into
11418: her hand. “You will receive something in return, you are aware, my
11419: Romola?” he said, gently, not minding so much what had passed, now he
11420: was secure; and feeling able to try and propitiate her.
11421: 
11422: “Yes,” she said, taking the paper, without looking at him, “I
11423: understand.”
11424: 
11425: “And you will forgive me, my Romola, when you have had time to
11426: reflect.” He just touched her brow with his lips, but she took no
11427: notice, and seemed really unconscious of the act. She was aware that he
11428: unlocked the door and went out. She moved her head and listened. The
11429: great door of the court opened and shut again. She started up as if
11430: some sudden freedom had come, and going to her father’s chair where his
11431: picture was propped, fell on her knees before it, and burst into sobs.
11432: 
11433: 
11434: 
11435: 
11436: CHAPTER XXXIII.
11437: Baldassarre makes an Acquaintance.
11438: 
11439: 
11440: When Baldassarre was wandering about Florence in search of a spare
11441: outhouse where he might have the cheapest of sheltered beds, his steps
11442: had been attracted towards that sole portion of ground within the walls
11443: of the city which is not perfectly level, and where the spectator,
11444: lifted above the roofs of the houses, can see beyond the city to the
11445: protecting hills and far-stretching valley, otherwise shut out from his
11446: view except along the welcome opening made by the course of the Arno.
11447: Part of that ground has been already seen by us as the hill of Bogoli,
11448: at that time a great stone-quarry; but the side towards which
11449: Baldassarre directed his steps was the one that sloped down behind the
11450: Via de’ Bardi, and was most commonly called the hill of San Giorgio.
11451: Bratti had told him that Tito’s dwelling was in the Via de’ Bardi; and,
11452: after surveying that street, he turned up the slope of the hill which
11453: he had observed as he was crossing the bridge. If he could find a
11454: sheltering outhouse on that hill, he would be glad: he had now for some
11455: years been accustomed to live with a broad sky about him; and,
11456: moreover, the narrow passes of the streets, with their strip of sky
11457: above, and the unknown labyrinth around them, seemed to intensify his
11458: sense of loneliness and feeble memory.
11459: 
11460: The hill was sparsely inhabited, and covered chiefly by gardens; but in
11461: one spot was a piece of rough ground jagged with great stones, which
11462: had never been cultivated since a landslip had ruined some houses there
11463: towards the end of the thirteenth century. Just above the edge of this
11464: broken ground stood a queer little square building, looking like a
11465: truncated tower roofed in with fluted tiles, and close by was a small
11466: outhouse, apparently built up against a piece of ruined stone wall.
11467: Under a large half-dead mulberry-tree that was now sending its last
11468: fluttering leaves in at the open doorways, a shrivelled, hardy old
11469: woman was untying a goat with two kids, and Baldassarre could see that
11470: part of the outbuilding was occupied by live stock; but the door of the
11471: other part was open, and it was empty of everything but some tools and
11472: straw. It was just the sort of place he wanted. He spoke to the old
11473: woman; but it was not till he got close to her and shouted in her ear,
11474: that he succeeded in making her understand his want of a lodging, and
11475: his readiness to pay for it. At first he could get no answer beyond
11476: shakes of the head and the words, “No—no lodging,” uttered in the
11477: muffled tone of the deaf. But, by dint of persistence, he made clear to
11478: her that he was a poor stranger from a long way over seas, and could
11479: not afford to go to hostelries; that he only wanted to lie on the straw
11480: in the outhouse, and would pay her a quattrino or two a week for that
11481: shelter. She still looked at him dubiously, shaking her head and
11482: talking low to herself; but presently, as if a new thought occurred to
11483: her, she fetched a hatchet from the house, and, showing him a chump
11484: that lay half covered with litter in a corner, asked him if he would
11485: chop that up for her: if he would, he might lie in the outhouse for one
11486: night. He agreed, and Monna Lisa stood with her arms akimbo to watch
11487: him, with a smile of gratified cunning, saying low to herself—
11488: 
11489: “It’s lain there ever since my old man died. What then? I might as well
11490: have put a stone on the fire. He chops very well, though he does speak
11491: with a foreign tongue, and looks odd. I couldn’t have got it done
11492: cheaper. And if he only wants a bit of straw to lie on, I might make
11493: him do an errand or two up and down the hill. Who need know? And sin
11494: that’s hidden’s half forgiven. (‘Peccato celato e mezzo perdonato.’)
11495: He’s a stranger: he’ll take no notice of _her_. And I’ll tell her to
11496: keep her tongue still.”
11497: 
11498: The antecedent to these feminine pronouns had a pair of blue eyes,
11499: which at that moment were applied to a large round hole in the shutter
11500: of the upper window. The shutter was closed, not for any penal reasons,
11501: but because only the opposite window had the luxury of glass in it: the
11502: weather was not warm, and a round hole four inches in diameter served
11503: all the purposes of observation. The hole was, unfortunately, a little
11504: too high, and obliged the small observer to stand on a low stool of a
11505: rickety character; but Tessa would have stood a long while in a much
11506: more inconvenient position for the sake of seeing a little variety in
11507: her life. She had been drawn to the opening at the first loud tones of
11508: the strange voice speaking to Monna Lisa; and darting gently across her
11509: room every now and then to peep at something, she continued to stand
11510: there until the wood had been chopped, and she saw Baldassarre enter
11511: the outhouse, as the dusk was gathering, and seat himself on the straw.
11512: 
11513: A great temptation had laid hold of Tessa’s mind; she would go and take
11514: that old man part of her supper, and talk to him a little. He was not
11515: deaf like Monna Lisa, and besides she could say a great many things to
11516: him that it was no use to shout at Monna Lisa, who knew them already.
11517: And he was a stranger—strangers came from a long way off and went away
11518: again, and lived nowhere in particular. It was naughty, she knew, for
11519: obedience made the largest part in Tessa’s idea of duty; but it would
11520: be something to confess to the Padre next Pasqua, and there was nothing
11521: else to confess except going to sleep sometimes over her beads, and
11522: being a little cross with Monna Lisa because she was so deaf; for she
11523: had as much idleness as she liked now, and was never frightened into
11524: telling white lies. She turned away from her shutter with rather an
11525: excited expression in her childish face, which was as pretty and
11526: pouting as ever. Her garb was still that of a simple contadina, but of
11527: a contadina prepared for a festa: her gown of dark-green serge, with
11528: its red girdle, was very clean and neat; she had the string of red
11529: glass beads round her neck; and her brown hair, rough from curliness,
11530: was duly knotted up, and fastened with the silver pin. She had but one
11531: new ornament, and she was very proud of it, for it was a fine gold
11532: ring.
11533: 
11534: Tessa sat on the low stool, nursing her knees, for a minute or two,
11535: with her little soul poised in fluttering excitement on the edge of
11536: this pleasant transgression. It was quite irresistible. She had been
11537: commanded to make no acquaintances, and warned that if she did, all her
11538: new happy lot would vanish away, and be like a hidden treasure that
11539: turned to lead as soon as it was brought to the daylight; and she had
11540: been so obedient that when she had to go to church she had kept her
11541: face shaded by her hood and had pursed up her lips quite tightly. It
11542: was true her obedience had been a little helped by her own dread lest
11543: the alarming stepfather Nofri should turn up even in this quarter, so
11544: far from the Por’ del Prato, and beat her at least, if he did not drag
11545: her back to work for him. But this old man was not an acquaintance; he
11546: was a poor stranger going to sleep in the outhouse, and he probably
11547: knew nothing of stepfather Nofri; and, besides, if she took him some
11548: supper, he would like her, and not want to tell anything about her.
11549: Monna Lisa would say she must not go and talk to him, therefore Monna
11550: Lisa must not be consulted. It did not signify what she found out after
11551: it had been done.
11552: 
11553: Supper was being prepared, she knew—a mountain of macaroni flavoured
11554: with cheese, fragrant enough to tame any stranger. So she tripped
11555: down-stairs with a mind full of deep designs, and first asking with an
11556: innocent look what that noise of talking had been, without waiting for
11557: an answer, knit her brow with a peremptory air, something like a kitten
11558: trying to be formidable, and sent the old woman upstairs; saying, she
11559: chose to eat her supper down below. In three minutes Tessa with her
11560: lantern in one hand and a wooden bowl of macaroni in the other, was
11561: kicking gently at the door of the outhouse; and Baldassarre, roused
11562: from sad reverie, doubted in the first moment whether he were awake as
11563: he opened the door and saw this surprising little handmaid, with
11564: delight in her wide eyes, breaking in on his dismal loneliness.
11565: 
11566: “I’ve brought you some supper,” she said, lifting her mouth towards his
11567: ear and shouting, as if he had been deaf like Monna Lisa. “Sit down and
11568: eat it, while I stay with you.”
11569: 
11570: Surprise and distrust surmounted every other feeling in Baldassarre,
11571: but though he had no smile or word of gratitude ready, there could not
11572: be any impulse to push away this visitant, and he sank down passively
11573: on his straw again, while Tessa placed herself close to him, put the
11574: wooden bowl on his lap, and set down the lantern in front of them,
11575: crossing her hands before her, and nodding at the bowl with a
11576: significant smile, as much as to say, “Yes, you may really eat it.”
11577: For, in the excitement of carrying out her deed, she had forgotten her
11578: previous thought that the stranger would not be deaf, and had fallen
11579: into her habitual alternative of dumb show and shouting.
11580: 
11581: The invitation was not a disagreeable one, for he had been gnawing a
11582: remnant of dry bread, which had left plenty of appetite for anything
11583: warm and relishing. Tessa watched the disappearance of two or three
11584: mouthfuls without speaking, for she had thought his eyes rather fierce
11585: at first; but now she ventured to put her mouth to his ear again and
11586: cry—
11587: 
11588: “I like my supper, don’t you?”
11589: 
11590: It was not a smile, but rather the milder look of a dog touched by
11591: kindness, but unable to smile, that Baldassarre turned on this round
11592: blue-eyed thing that was caring about him.
11593: 
11594: “Yes,” he said; “but I can hear well—I’m not deaf.”
11595: 
11596: “It is true; I forgot,” said Tessa, lifting her hands and clasping
11597: them. “But Monna Lisa is deaf, and I live with her. She’s a kind old
11598: woman, and I’m not frightened at her. And we live very well: we have
11599: plenty of nice things. I can have nuts if I like. And I’m not obliged
11600: to work now. I used to have to work, and I didn’t like it; but I liked
11601: feeding the mules, and I should like to see poor Giannetta, the little
11602: mule, again. We’ve only got a goat and two kids, and I used to talk to
11603: the goat a good deal, because there was nobody else but Monna Lisa. But
11604: now I’ve got something else—can you guess what it is?”
11605: 
11606: She drew her head back, and looked with a challenging smile at
11607: Baldassarre, as if she had proposed a difficult riddle to him.
11608: 
11609: “No,” said he, putting aside his bowl, and looking at her dreamily. It
11610: seemed as if this young prattling thing were some memory come back out
11611: of his own youth.
11612: 
11613: “You like me to talk to you, don’t you?” said Tessa, “but you must not
11614: tell anybody. Shall I fetch you a bit of cold sausage?”
11615: 
11616: He shook his head, but he looked so mild now that Tessa felt quite at
11617: her ease.
11618: 
11619: “Well, then, I’ve got a little baby. Such a pretty bambinetto, with
11620: little fingers and nails! Not old yet; it was born at the Nativita,
11621: Monna Lisa says. I was married one Nativita, a long, long while ago,
11622: and nobody knew. O Santa Madonna! I didn’t mean to tell you that!”
11623: 
11624: Tessa set up her shoulders and bit her lip, looking at Baldassarre as
11625: if this betrayal of secrets must have an exciting effect on him too.
11626: But he seemed not to care much; and perhaps that was in the nature of
11627: strangers.
11628: 
11629: “Yes,” she said, carrying on her thought aloud, “you are a stranger;
11630: you don’t live anywhere or know anybody, do you?”
11631: 
11632: “No,” said Baldassarre, also thinking aloud, rather than consciously
11633: answering, “I only know one man.”
11634: 
11635: “His name is not Nofri, is it?” said Tessa, anxiously.
11636: 
11637: “No,” said Baldassarre, noticing her look of fear. “Is that your
11638: husband’s name?”
11639: 
11640: That mistaken supposition was very amusing to Tessa. She laughed and
11641: clapped her hands as she said—
11642: 
11643: “No, indeed! But I must not tell you anything about my husband. You
11644: would never think what he is—not at all like Nofri!”
11645: 
11646: She laughed again at the delightful incongruity between the name of
11647: Nofri—which was not separable from the idea of the cross-grained
11648: stepfather—and the idea of her husband.
11649: 
11650: “But I don’t see him very often,” she went on, more gravely. “And
11651: sometimes I pray to the Holy Madonna to send him oftener, and once she
11652: did. But I must go back to my bimbo now. I’ll bring it to show you
11653: to-morrow. You would like to see it. Sometimes it cries and makes a
11654: face, but only when it’s hungry, Monna Lisa says. You wouldn’t think
11655: it, but Monna Lisa had babies once, and they are all dead old men. My
11656: husband says she will never die now, because she’s so well dried. I’m
11657: glad of that, for I’m fond of her. You would like to stay here
11658: to-morrow, shouldn’t you?”
11659: 
11660: “I should like to have this place to come and rest in, that’s all,”
11661: said Baldassarre. “I would pay for it, and harm nobody.”
11662: 
11663: “No, indeed; I think you are not a bad old man. But you look sorry
11664: about something. Tell me, is there anything you shall cry about when I
11665: leave you by yourself? _I_ used to cry once.”
11666: 
11667: “No, child; I think I shall cry no more.”
11668: 
11669: “That’s right; and I’ll bring you some breakfast, and show you the
11670: bimbo. Good-night.”
11671: 
11672: Tessa took up her bowl and lantern, and closed the door behind her. The
11673: pretty loving apparition had been no more to Baldassarre than a faint
11674: rainbow on the blackness to the man who is wrestling in deep waters. He
11675: hardly thought of her again till his dreamy waking passed into the more
11676: vivid images of disturbed sleep.
11677: 
11678: But Tessa thought much of him. She had no sooner entered the house than
11679: she told Monna Lisa what she had done, and insisted that the stranger
11680: should be allowed to come and rest in the outhouse when he liked. The
11681: old woman, who had had her notions of making him a useful tenant, made
11682: a great show of reluctance, shook her head, and urged that Messer Naldo
11683: would be angry if she let any one come about the house. Tessa did not
11684: believe that. Naldo had said nothing against strangers who lived
11685: nowhere; and this old man knew nobody except one person, who was not
11686: Nofri.
11687: 
11688: “Well,” conceded Monna Lisa, at last, “if I let him stay for a while
11689: and carry things up the hill for me, thou must keep thy counsel and
11690: tell nobody.”
11691: 
11692: “No,” said Tessa, “I’ll only tell the bimbo.”
11693: 
11694: “And then,” Monna Lisa went on, in her thick undertone, “God may love
11695: us well enough not to let Messer Naldo find out anything about it. For
11696: he never comes here but at dark; and as he was here two days ago, it’s
11697: likely he’ll never come at all till the old man’s gone away again.”
11698: 
11699: “Oh me! Monna,” said Tessa, clasping her hands, “I wish Naldo had not
11700: to go such a long, long way sometimes before he comes back again.”
11701: 
11702: “Ah, child! the world’s big, they say. There are places behind the
11703: mountains, and if people go night and day, night and day, they get to
11704: Rome, and see the Holy Father.”
11705: 
11706: Tessa looked submissive in the presence of this mystery, and began to
11707: rock her baby, and sing syllables of vague loving meaning, in tones
11708: that imitated a triple chime.
11709: 
11710: The next morning she was unusually industrious in the prospect of more
11711: dialogue, and of the pleasure she should give the poor old stranger by
11712: showing him her baby. But before she could get ready to take
11713: Baldassarre his breakfast, she found that Monna Lisa had been employing
11714: him as a drawer of water. She deferred her paternosters, and hurried
11715: down to insist that Baldassarre should sit on his straw, so that she
11716: might come and sit by him again while he ate his breakfast. That
11717: attitude made the new companionship all the more delightful to Tessa,
11718: for she had been used to sitting on straw in old days along with her
11719: goats and mules.
11720: 
11721: “I will not let Monna Lisa give you too much work to do,” she said,
11722: bringing him some steaming broth and soft bread. “I don’t like much
11723: work, and I daresay you don’t. I like sitting in the sunshine and
11724: feeding things. Monna Lisa says, work is good, but she does it all
11725: herself, so I don’t mind. She’s not a cross old woman; you needn’t be
11726: afraid of her being cross. And now, you eat that, and I’ll go and fetch
11727: my baby and show it you.”
11728: 
11729: Presently she came back with the small mummy-case in her arms. The
11730: mummy looked very lively, having unusually large dark eyes, though no
11731: more than the usual indication of a future nose.
11732: 
11733: “This is my baby,” said Tessa, seating herself close to Baldassarre.
11734: “You didn’t think it was so pretty, did you? It is like the little
11735: Gesu, and I should think the Santa Madonna would be kinder to me now,
11736: is it not true? But I have not much to ask for, because I have
11737: everything now—only that I should see my husband oftener. You may hold
11738: the bambino a little if you like, but I think you must not kiss him,
11739: because you might hurt him.”
11740: 
11741: She spoke this prohibition in a tone of soothing excuse, and
11742: Baldassarre could not refuse to hold the small package. “Poor thing!
11743: poor thing!” he said, in a deep voice which had something strangely
11744: threatening in its apparent pity. It did not seem to him as if this
11745: guileless loving little woman could reconcile him to the world at all,
11746: but rather that she was with him against the world, that she was a
11747: creature who would need to be avenged.
11748: 
11749: “Oh, don’t you be sorry for me,” she said; “for though I don’t see him
11750: often, he is more beautiful and good than anybody else in the world. I
11751: say prayers to him when he’s away. You couldn’t think what he is!”
11752: 
11753: She looked at Baldassarre with a wide glance of mysterious meaning,
11754: taking the baby from him again, and almost wishing he would question
11755: her as if he wanted very much to know more.
11756: 
11757: “Yes, I could,” said Baldassarre, rather bitterly.
11758: 
11759: “No, I’m sure you never could,” said Tessa, earnestly. “You thought he
11760: might be Nofri,” she added, with a triumphant air of conclusiveness.
11761: “But never mind; you couldn’t know. What is your name?”
11762: 
11763: He rubbed his hand over his knitted brow, then looked at her blankly
11764: and said, “Ah, child, what is it?”
11765: 
11766: It was not that he did not often remember his name well enough; and if
11767: he had had presence of mind now to remember it, he would have chosen
11768: not to tell it. But a sudden question appealing to his memory, had a
11769: paralysing effect, and in that moment he was conscious of nothing but
11770: helplessness.
11771: 
11772: Ignorant as Tessa was, the pity stirred in her by his blank look taught
11773: her to say—
11774: 
11775: “_Never_ mind: you are a stranger, it is no matter about your having a
11776: name. Good-bye now, because I want my breakfast. You will come here and
11777: rest when you like; Monna Lisa says you may. And don’t you be unhappy,
11778: for we’ll be good to you.”
11779: 
11780: “Poor thing!” said Baldassarre again.
11781: 
11782: 
11783: 
11784: 
11785: CHAPTER XXXIV.
11786: No Place for Repentance.
11787: 
11788: 
11789: Messer Naldo came again sooner than was expected: he came on the
11790: evening of the twenty-eighth of November, only eleven days after his
11791: previous visit, proving that he had not gone far beyond the mountains;
11792: and a scene which we have witnessed as it took place that evening in
11793: the Via de’ Bardi may help to explain the impulse which turned his
11794: steps towards the hill of San Giorgio.
11795: 
11796: When Tito had first found this home for Tessa, on his return from Rome,
11797: more than a year and a half ago, he had acted, he persuaded himself,
11798: simply under the constraint imposed on him by his own kindliness after
11799: the unlucky incident which had made foolish little Tessa imagine him to
11800: be her husband. It was true that the kindness was manifested towards a
11801: pretty trusting thing whom it was impossible to be near without feeling
11802: inclined to caress and pet her; but it was not less true that Tito had
11803: movements of kindness towards her apart from any contemplated gain to
11804: himself. Otherwise, charming as her prettiness and prattle were in a
11805: lazy moment, he might have preferred to be free from her; for he was
11806: not in love with Tessa—he was in love for the first time in his life
11807: with an entirely different woman, whom he was not simply inclined to
11808: shower caresses on, but whose presence possessed him so that the simple
11809: sweep of her long tresses across his cheek seemed to vibrate through
11810: the hours. All the young ideal passion he had in him had been stirred
11811: by Romola, and his fibre was too fine, his intellect too bright, for
11812: him to be tempted into the habits of a gross pleasure-seeker. But he
11813: had spun a web about himself and Tessa, which he felt incapable of
11814: breaking: in the first moments after the mimic marriage he had been
11815: prompted to leave her under an illusion by a distinct calculation of
11816: his own possible need, but since that critical moment it seemed to him
11817: that the web had gone on spinning itself in spite of him, like a growth
11818: over which he had no power. The elements of kindness and
11819: self-indulgence are hard to distinguish in a soft nature like Tito’s;
11820: and the annoyance he had felt under Tessa’s pursuit of him on the day
11821: of his betrothal, the thorough intention of revealing the truth to her
11822: with which he set out to fulfil his promise of seeing her again, were a
11823: sufficiently strong argument to him that in ultimately leaving Tessa
11824: under her illusion and providing a home for her, he had been overcome
11825: by his own kindness. And in these days of his first devotion to Romola
11826: he needed a self-justifying argument. He had learned to be glad that
11827: she was deceived about some things. But every strong feeling makes to
11828: itself a conscience of its own—has its own piety; just as much as the
11829: feeling of the son towards the mother, which will sometimes survive
11830: amid the worst fumes of depravation; and Tito could not yet be easy in
11831: committing a secret offence against his wedded love.
11832: 
11833: But he was all the more careful in taking precautions to preserve the
11834: secrecy of the offence. Monna Lisa, who, like many of her class, never
11835: left her habitation except to go to one or two particular shops, and to
11836: confession once a year, knew nothing of his real name and whereabout:
11837: she only know that he paid her so as to make her very comfortable, and
11838: minded little about the rest, save that she got fond of Tessa, and
11839: found pleasure in the cares for which she was paid. There was some
11840: mystery behind, clearly, since Tessa was a contadina, and Messer Naldo
11841: was a signor; but, for aught Monna Lisa knew, he might be a real
11842: husband. For Tito had thoroughly frightened Tessa into silence about
11843: the circumstances of their marriage, by telling her that if she broke
11844: that silence she would never see him again; and Monna Lisa’s deafness,
11845: which made it impossible to say anything to her without some
11846: premeditation, had saved Tessa from any incautious revelation to her,
11847: such as had run off her tongue in talking with Baldassarre. For a long
11848: while Tito’s visits were so rare, that it seemed likely enough he took
11849: journeys between them. They were prompted chiefly by the desire to see
11850: that all things were going on well with Tessa; and though he always
11851: found his visit pleasanter than the prospect of it—always felt anew the
11852: charm of that pretty ignorant lovingness and trust—he had not yet any
11853: real need of it. But he was determined, if possible, to preserve the
11854: simplicity on which the charm depended; to keep Tessa a genuine
11855: contadina, and not place the small field-flower among conditions that
11856: would rob it of its grace. He would have been shocked to see her in the
11857: dress of any other rank than her own; the piquancy of her talk would be
11858: all gone, if things began to have new relations for her, if her world
11859: became wider, her pleasures less childish; and the squirrel-like
11860: enjoyment of nuts at discretion marked the standard of the luxuries he
11861: had provided for her. By this means, Tito saved Tessa’s charm from
11862: being sullied; and he also, by a convenient coincidence, saved himself
11863: from aggravating expenses that were already rather importunate to a man
11864: whose money was all required for his avowed habits of life.
11865: 
11866: This, in brief, had been the history of Tito’s relation to Tessa up to
11867: a very recent date. It is true that once or twice before Bardo’s death,
11868: the sense that there was Tessa up the hill, with whom it was possible
11869: to pass an hour agreeably, had been an inducement to him to escape from
11870: a little weariness of the old man, when, for lack of any positive
11871: engagement, he might otherwise have borne the weariness patiently and
11872: shared Romola’s burden. But the moment when he had first felt a real
11873: hunger for Tessa’s ignorant lovingness and belief in _him_ had not come
11874: till quite lately, and it was distinctly marked out by circumstances as
11875: little to be forgotten as the oncoming of a malady that has permanently
11876: vitiated the sight and hearing. It was the day when he had first seen
11877: Baldassarre, and had bought the armour. Returning across the bridge
11878: that night, with the coat of mail in his hands, he had felt an
11879: unconquerable shrinking from an immediate encounter with Romola. She,
11880: too, knew little of the actual world; she, too, trusted him; but he had
11881: an uneasy consciousness that behind her frank eyes there was a nature
11882: that could judge him, and that any ill-founded trust of hers sprang not
11883: from pretty brute-like incapacity, but from a nobleness which might
11884: prove an alarming touchstone. He wanted a little ease, a little repose
11885: from self-control, after the agitation and exertions of the day; he
11886: wanted to be where he could adjust his mind to the morrow, without
11887: caring how he behaved at the present moment. And there was a sweet
11888: adoring creature within reach whose presence was as safe and
11889: unconstraining as that of her own kids,—who would believe any fable,
11890: and remain quite unimpressed by public opinion. And so on that evening,
11891: when Romola was waiting and listening for him, he turned his steps up
11892: the hill.
11893: 
11894: No wonder, then, that the steps took the same course on this evening,
11895: eleven days later, when he had had to recoil under Romola’s first
11896: outburst of scorn. He could not wish Tessa in his wife’s place, or
11897: refrain from wishing that his wife should be thoroughly reconciled to
11898: him; for it was Romola, and not Tessa, that belonged to the world where
11899: all the larger desires of a man who had ambition and effective
11900: faculties must necessarily lie. But he wanted a refuge from a standard
11901: disagreeably rigorous, of which he could not make himself independent
11902: simply by thinking it folly; and Tessa’s little soul was that inviting
11903: refuge.
11904: 
11905: It was not much more than eight o’clock when he went up the stone steps
11906: to the door of Tessa’s room. Usually she heard his entrance into the
11907: house, and ran to meet him, but not to-night; and when he opened the
11908: door he saw the reason. A single dim light was burning above the dying
11909: fire, and showed Tessa in a kneeling attitude by the head of the bed
11910: where the baby lay. Her head had fallen aside on the pillow, and her
11911: brown rosary, which usually hung above the pillow over the picture of
11912: the Madonna and the golden palm-branches, lay in the loose grasp of her
11913: right-hand. She had gone fast asleep over her beads. Tito stepped
11914: lightly across the little room, and sat down close to her. She had
11915: probably heard the opening of the door as part of her dream, for he had
11916: not been looking at her two moments before she opened her eyes. She
11917: opened them without any start, and remained quite motionless looking at
11918: him, as if the sense that he was there smiling at her shut out any
11919: impulse which could disturb that happy passiveness. But when he put his
11920: hand under her chin, and stooped to kiss her, she said—
11921: 
11922: “I dreamed it, and then I said it was dreaming—and then I awoke, and it
11923: was true.”
11924: 
11925: “Little sinner!” said Tito, pinching her chin, “you have not said half
11926: your prayers. I will punish you by not looking at your baby; it is
11927: ugly.”
11928: 
11929: Tessa did not like those words, even though Tito was smiling. She had
11930: some pouting distress in her face, as she said, bending anxiously over
11931: the baby—
11932: 
11933: “Ah, it is not true! He is prettier than anything. You do not think he
11934: is ugly. You will look at him. He is even prettier than when you saw
11935: him before—only he’s asleep, and you can’t see his eyes or his tongue,
11936: and I can’t show you his hair—and it grows—isn’t that wonderful? Look
11937: at him! It’s true his face is very much all alike when he’s asleep,
11938: there is not so much to see as when he’s awake. If you kiss him very
11939: gently, he won’t wake: you want to kiss him, is it not true?”
11940: 
11941: He satisfied her by giving the small mummy a butterfly kiss, and then
11942: putting his hand on her shoulder and turning her face towards him,
11943: said, “You like looking at the baby better than looking at your
11944: husband, you false one!”
11945: 
11946: She was still kneeling, and now rested her hands on his knee, looking
11947: up at him like one of Fra Lippo Lippi’s round-cheeked adoring angels.
11948: 
11949: “No,” she said, shaking her head; “I love you always best, only I want
11950: you to look at the bambino and love him; I used only to want you to
11951: love me.”
11952: 
11953: “And did you expect me to come again so soon?” said Tito, inclined to
11954: make her prattle. He still felt the effects of the agitation he had
11955: undergone—still felt like a man who has been violently jarred; and this
11956: was the easiest relief from silence and solitude.
11957: 
11958: “Ah, no,” said Tessa, “I have counted the days—to-day I began at my
11959: right thumb again—since you put on the beautiful chain-coat, that
11960: Messer San Michele gave you to take care of you on your journey. And
11961: you have got it on now,” she said, peeping through the opening in the
11962: breast of his tunic. “Perhaps it made you come back sooner.”
11963: 
11964: “Perhaps it did, Tessa,” he said. “But don’t mind the coat now. Tell me
11965: what has happened since I was here. Did you see the tents in the Prato,
11966: and the soldiers and horsemen when they passed the bridges—did you hear
11967: the drums and trumpets?”
11968: 
11969: “Yes, and I was rather frightened, because I thought the soldiers might
11970: come up here. And Monna Lisa was a little afraid too, for she said they
11971: might carry our kids off; she said it was their business to do
11972: mischief. But the Holy Madonna took care of us, for we never saw one of
11973: them up here. But something has happened, only I hardly dare tell you,
11974: and that is what I was saying more Aves for.”
11975: 
11976: “What do you mean, Tessa?” said Tito, rather anxiously. “Make haste and
11977: tell me.”
11978: 
11979: “Yes, but will you let me sit on your knee? because then I think I
11980: shall not be so frightened.”
11981: 
11982: He took her on his knee, and put his arm round her, but looked grave:
11983: it seemed that something unpleasant must pursue him even here.
11984: 
11985: “At first I didn’t mean to tell you,” said Tessa, speaking almost in a
11986: whisper, as if that would mitigate the offence; “because we thought the
11987: old man would be gone away before you came again, and it would be as if
11988: it had not been. But now he is there, and you are come, and I never did
11989: anything you told me not to do before. And I want to tell you, and then
11990: you will perhaps forgive me, for it is a long while before I go to
11991: confession.”
11992: 
11993: “Yes, tell me everything, my Tessa.” He began to hope it was after all
11994: a trivial matter.
11995: 
11996: “Oh, you will be sorry for him: I’m afraid he cries about something
11997: when I don’t see him. But that was not the reason I went to him first;
11998: it was because I wanted to talk to him and show him my baby, and he was
11999: a stranger that lived nowhere, and I thought you wouldn’t care so much
12000: about my talking to him. And I think he is not a bad old man, and he
12001: wanted to come and sleep on the straw next to the goats, and I made
12002: Monna Lisa say, ‘Yes, he might,’ and he’s away all the day almost, but
12003: when he comes back I talk to him, and take him something to eat.”
12004: 
12005: “Some beggar, I suppose. It was naughty of you, Tessa, and I am angry
12006: with Monna Lisa. I must have him sent away.”
12007: 
12008: “No, I think he is not a beggar, for he wanted to pay Monna Lisa, only
12009: she asked him to do work for her instead. And he gets himself shaved,
12010: and his clothes are tidy: Monna Lisa says he is a decent man. But
12011: sometimes I think he is not in his right mind: Lupo, at Peretola, was
12012: not in his right mind, and he looks a little like Lupo sometimes, as if
12013: he didn’t know where he was.”
12014: 
12015: “What sort of face has he?” said Tito, his heart beginning to beat
12016: strangely. He was so haunted by the thought of Baldassarre, that it was
12017: already he whom he saw in imagination sitting on the straw not many
12018: yards from him. “Fetch your stool, my Tessa, and sit on it.”
12019: 
12020: “Shall you not forgive me?” she said, timidly, moving from his knee.
12021: 
12022: “Yes, I will not be angry—only sit down, and tell me what sort of old
12023: man this is.”
12024: 
12025: “I can’t think how to tell you: he is not like my stepfather Nofri, or
12026: anybody. His face is yellow, and he has deep marks in it; and his hair
12027: is white, but there is none on the top of his head: and his eyebrows
12028: are black, and he looks from under them at me, and says, ‘Poor thing!’
12029: to me, as if he thought I was beaten as I used to be; and that seems as
12030: if he couldn’t be in his right mind, doesn’t it? And I asked him his
12031: name once, but he couldn’t tell it me: yet everybody has a name—is it
12032: not true? And he has a book now, and keeps looking at it ever so long,
12033: as if he were a Padre. But I think he is not saying prayers, for his
12034: lips never move;—ah, you are angry with me, or is it because you are
12035: sorry for the old man?”
12036: 
12037: Tito’s eyes were still fixed on Tessa; but he had ceased to see her,
12038: and was only seeing the objects her words suggested. It was this absent
12039: glance which frightened her, and she could not help going to kneel at
12040: his side again. But he did not heed her, and she dared not touch him,
12041: or speak to him: she knelt, trembling and wondering; and this state of
12042: mind suggesting her beads to her, she took them from the floor, and
12043: began to tell them again, her pretty lips moving silently, and her blue
12044: eyes wide with anxiety and struggling tears.
12045: 
12046: Tito was quite unconscious of her movements—unconscious of his own
12047: attitude: he was in that wrapt state in which a man will grasp painful
12048: roughness, and press and press it closer, and never feel it. A new
12049: possibility had risen before him, which might dissolve at once the
12050: wretched conditions of fear and suppression that were marring his life.
12051: Destiny had brought within his reach an opportunity of retrieving that
12052: moment on the steps of the Duomo, when the Past had grasped him with
12053: living quivering hands, and he had disowned it. A few steps, and he
12054: might be face to face with his father, with no witness by; he might
12055: seek forgiveness and reconciliation; and there was money now, from the
12056: sale of the library, to enable them to leave Florence without
12057: disclosure, and go into Southern Italy, where under the probable French
12058: rule, he had already laid a foundation for patronage. Romola need never
12059: know the whole truth, for she could have no certain means of
12060: identifying that prisoner in the Duomo with Baldassarre, or of learning
12061: what had taken place on the steps, except from Baldassarre himself; and
12062: if his father forgave, he would also consent to bury, that offence.
12063: 
12064: But with this possibility of relief, by an easy spring, from present
12065: evil, there rose the other possibility, that the fierce-hearted man
12066: might refuse to be propitiated. Well—and if he did, things would only
12067: be as they had been before; for there would be _no witness by_. It was
12068: not repentance with a white sheet round it and taper in hand,
12069: confessing its hated sin in the eyes of men, that Tito was preparing
12070: for: it was a repentance that would make all things pleasant again, and
12071: keep all past unpleasant things secret. And Tito’s soft-heartedness,
12072: his indisposition to feel himself in harsh relations with any creature,
12073: was in strong activity towards his father, now his father was brought
12074: near to him. It would be a state of ease that his nature could not but
12075: desire, if the poisonous hatred in Baldassarre’s glance could be
12076: replaced by something of the old affection and complacency.
12077: 
12078: Tito longed to have his world once again completely cushioned with
12079: goodwill, and longed for it the more eagerly because of what he had
12080: just suffered from the collision with Romola. It was not difficult to
12081: him to smile pleadingly on those whom he had injured, and offer to do
12082: them much kindness: and no quickness of intellect could tell him
12083: exactly the taste of that honey on the lips of the injured. The
12084: opportunity was there, and it raised an inclination which hemmed in the
12085: calculating activity of his thought. He started up, and stepped towards
12086: the door; but Tessa’s cry, as she dropped her beads, roused him from
12087: his absorption. He turned and said—
12088: 
12089: “My Tessa, get me a lantern; and don’t cry, little pigeon, I am not
12090: angry.”
12091: 
12092: They went down the stairs, and Tessa was going to shout the need of the
12093: lantern in Monna Lisa’s ear, when Tito, who had opened the door, said,
12094: “Stay, Tessa—no, I want no lantern: go upstairs again, and keep quiet,
12095: and say nothing to Monna Lisa.”
12096: 
12097: In half a minute he stood before the closed door of the outhouse, where
12098: the moon was shining white on the old paintless wood.
12099: 
12100: In this last decisive moment, Tito felt a tremor upon him—a sudden
12101: instinctive shrinking from a possible tiger-glance, a possible
12102: tiger-leap. Yet why should he, a young man, be afraid of an old one? a
12103: young man with armour on, of an old man without a weapon? It was but a
12104: moment’s hesitation, and Tito laid his hand on the door. Was his father
12105: asleep? Was there nothing else but the door that screened him from the
12106: voice and the glance which no magic could turn into ease?
12107: 
12108: Baldassarre was not asleep. There was a square opening high in the wall
12109: of the hovel, through which the moonbeams sent in a stream of pale
12110: light; and if Tito could have looked through the opening, he would have
12111: seen his father seated on the straw, with something that shone like a
12112: white star in his hand. Baldassarre was feeling the edge of his
12113: poniard, taking refuge in that sensation from a hopeless blank of
12114: thought that seemed to lie like a great gulf between his passion and
12115: its aim.
12116: 
12117: He was in one of his most wretched moments of conscious helplessness:
12118: he had been poring, while it was light, over the book that lay open
12119: beside him; then he had been trying to recall the names of his jewels,
12120: and the symbols engraved on them; and though at certain other times he
12121: had recovered some of those names and symbols, to-night they were all
12122: gone into darkness. And this effort at inward seeing had seemed to end
12123: in utter paralysis of memory. He was reduced to a sort of mad
12124: consciousness that he was a solitary pulse of just rage in a world
12125: filled with defiant baseness. He had clutched and unsheathed his
12126: dagger, and for a long while had been feeling its edge, his mind
12127: narrowed to one image, and the dream of one sensation—the sensation of
12128: plunging that dagger into a base heart, which he was unable to pierce
12129: in any other way.
12130: 
12131: Tito had his hand on the door and was pulling it: it dragged against
12132: the ground as such old doors often do, and Baldassarre, startled out of
12133: his dreamlike state, rose from his sitting posture in vague amazement,
12134: not knowing where he was. He had not yet risen to his feet, and was
12135: still kneeling on one knee, when the door came wide open and he saw,
12136: dark against the moonlight, with the rays falling on one bright mass of
12137: curls and one rounded olive cheek, the image of his reverie—not
12138: shadowy—close and real like water at the lips after the thirsty dream
12139: of it. No thought could come athwart that eager thirst. In one moment,
12140: before Tito could start back, the old man, with the preternatural force
12141: of rage in his limbs, had sprung forward, and the dagger had flashed
12142: out. In the next moment the dagger had snapped in two, and Baldassarre,
12143: under the parrying force of Tito’s arm, had fallen back on the straw,
12144: clutching the hilt with its bit of broken blade. The pointed end lay
12145: shining against Tito’s feet.
12146: 
12147: Tito had felt one great heart-leap of terror as he had staggered under
12148: the weight of the thrust: he felt now the triumph of deliverance and
12149: safety. His armour had been proved, and vengeance lay helpless before
12150: him. But the triumph raised no devilish impulse; on the contrary, the
12151: sight of his father close to him and unable to injure him, made the
12152: effort at reconciliation easier. He was free from fear, but he had only
12153: the more unmixed and direct want to be free from the sense that he was
12154: hated. After they had looked at each other a little while, Baldassarre
12155: lying motionless in despairing rage, Tito said in his soft tones, just
12156: as they had sounded before the last parting on the shores of Greece—
12157: 
12158: “_Padre mio_!” There was a pause after those words, but no movement or
12159: sound till he said—
12160: 
12161: “I came to ask your forgiveness!”
12162: 
12163: Again he paused, that the healing balm of those words might have time
12164: to work. But there was no sign of change in Baldassarre: he lay as he
12165: had fallen, leaning on one arm: he was trembling, but it was from the
12166: shock that had thrown him down.
12167: 
12168: “I was taken by surprise that morning. I wish now to be a son to you
12169: again. I wish to make the rest of your life happy, that you may forget
12170: what you have suffered.”
12171: 
12172: He paused again. He had used the clearest and strongest words he could
12173: think of. It was useless to say more, until he had some sign that
12174: Baldassarre understood him. Perhaps his mind was too distempered or too
12175: imbecile even for that: perhaps the shock of his fall and his
12176: disappointed rage might have quite suspended the use of his faculties.
12177: 
12178: Presently Baldassarre began to move. He threw away the broken dagger,
12179: and slowly and gradually, still trembling, began to raise himself from
12180: the ground. Tito put out his hand to help him, and so strangely quick
12181: are men’s souls that in this moment, when he began to feel his
12182: atonement was accepted, he had a darting thought of the irksome efforts
12183: it entailed. Baldassarre clutched the hand that was held out, raised
12184: himself and clutched it still, going close up to Tito till their faces
12185: were not a foot off each other. Then he began to speak, in a deep
12186: trembling voice—
12187: 
12188: “I saved you—I nurtured you—I loved you. You forsook me—you robbed
12189: me—you denied me. What can you give me? You have made the world
12190: bitterness to me; but there is one draught of sweetness left—_that you
12191: shall know agony_.”
12192: 
12193: He let fall Tito’s hand, and going backwards a little, first rested his
12194: arm on a projecting stone in the wall, and then sank again in a sitting
12195: posture on the straw. The outleap of fury in the dagger-thrust had
12196: evidently exhausted him.
12197: 
12198: Tito stood silent. If it had been a deep yearning emotion which had
12199: brought him to ask his father’s forgiveness, the denial of it might
12200: have caused him a pang which would have excluded the rushing train of
12201: thought that followed those decisive words. As it was, though the
12202: sentence of unchangeable hatred grated on him and jarred him terribly,
12203: his mind glanced round with a self-preserving instinct to see how far
12204: those words could have the force of a substantial threat. When he had
12205: come down to speak to Baldassarre, he had said to himself that if his
12206: effort at reconciliation failed, things would only be as they had been
12207: before. The first glance of his mind was backward to that thought
12208: again, but the future possibilities of danger that were conjured up
12209: along with it brought the perception that things were _not_ as they had
12210: been before, and the perception came as a triumphant relief. There was
12211: not only the broken dagger, there was the certainty, from what Tessa
12212: had told him, that Baldassarre’s mind was broken too, and had no edge
12213: that could reach him. Tito felt he had no choice now: he must defy
12214: Baldassarre as a mad, imbecile old man; and the chances were so
12215: strongly on his side that there was hardly room for fear. No; except
12216: the fear of having to do many unpleasant things in order to save
12217: himself from what was yet more unpleasant. And one of those unpleasant
12218: things must be done immediately: it was very difficult.
12219: 
12220: “Do you mean to stay here?” he said.
12221: 
12222: “No,” said Baldassarre, bitterly, “you mean to turn me out.”
12223: 
12224: “Not so,” said Tito; “I only ask.”
12225: 
12226: “I tell you, you have turned me out. If it is your straw, you turned me
12227: off it three years ago.”
12228: 
12229: “Then you mean to leave this place?” said Tito, more anxious about this
12230: certainty than the ground of it.
12231: 
12232: “I have spoken,” said Baldassarre.
12233: 
12234: Tito turned and re-entered the house. Monna Lisa was nodding; he went
12235: up to Tessa, and found her crying by the side of her baby.
12236: 
12237: “Tessa,” he said, sitting down and taking her head between his hands;
12238: “leave off crying, little goose, and listen to me.”
12239: 
12240: He lifted her chin upward, that she might look at him, while he spoke
12241: very distinctly and emphatically.
12242: 
12243: “You must never speak to that old man again. He is a mad old man, and
12244: he wants to kill me. Never speak to him or listen to him again.”
12245: 
12246: Tessa’s tears had ceased, and her lips were pale with fright.
12247: 
12248: “Is he gone away?” she whispered.
12249: 
12250: “He will go away. Remember what I have said to you.”
12251: 
12252: “Yes; I will never speak to a stranger any more,” said Tessa, with a
12253: sense of guilt.
12254: 
12255: He told her, to comfort her, that he would come again to-morrow; and
12256: then went down to Monna Lisa to rebuke her severely for letting a
12257: dangerous man come about the house.
12258: 
12259: Tito felt that these were odious tasks; they were very evil-tasted
12260: morsels, but they were forced upon him. He heard Monna Lisa fasten the
12261: door behind him, and turned away, without looking towards the open door
12262: of the hovel. He felt secure that Baldassarre would go, and he could
12263: not wait to see him go. Even _his_ young frame and elastic spirit were
12264: shattered by the agitations that had been crowded into this single
12265: evening.
12266: 
12267: Baldassarre was still sitting on the straw when the shadow of Tito
12268: passed by. Before him lay the fragments of the broken dagger; beside
12269: him lay the open book, over which he had pored in vain. They looked
12270: like mocking symbols of his utter helplessness; and his body was still
12271: too trembling for him to rise and walk away.
12272: 
12273: But the next morning, very early, when Tessa peeped anxiously through
12274: the hole in her shutter, the door of the hovel was open, and the
12275: strange old man was gone.
12276: 
12277: 
12278: 
12279: 
12280: CHAPTER XXXV.
12281: What Florence was thinking of.
12282: 
12283: 
12284: For several days Tito saw little of Romola. He told her gently, the
12285: next morning, that it would be better for her to remove any small
12286: articles of her own from the library, as there would be agents coming
12287: to pack up the antiquities. Then, leaning to kiss her on the brow, he
12288: suggested that she should keep in her own room where the little painted
12289: tabernacle was, and where she was then sitting, so that she might be
12290: away from the noise of strange footsteps, Romola assented quietly,
12291: making no sign of emotion: the night had been one long waking to her,
12292: and, in spite of her healthy frame, sensation had become a dull
12293: continuous pain, as if she had been stunned and bruised. Tito divined
12294: that she felt ill, but he dared say no more; he only dared, perceiving
12295: that her hand and brow were stone cold, to fetch a furred mantle and
12296: throw it lightly round her. And in every brief interval that he
12297: returned to her, the scene was nearly the same: he tried to propitiate
12298: her by some unobtrusive act or word of tenderness, and she seemed to
12299: have lost the power of speaking to him, or of looking at him.
12300: “Patience!” he said to himself. “She will recover it, and forgive at
12301: last. The tie to me must still remain the strongest.” When the stricken
12302: person is slow to recover and look as if nothing had happened, the
12303: striker easily glides into the position of the aggrieved party; he
12304: feels no bruise himself, and is strongly conscious of his own amiable
12305: behaviour since he inflicted the blow. But Tito was not naturally
12306: disposed to feel himself aggrieved; the constant bent of his mind was
12307: towards propitiation, and he would have submitted to much for the sake
12308: of feeling Romola’s hand resting on his head again, as it did that
12309: morning when he first shrank from looking at her.
12310: 
12311: But he found it the less difficult to wait patiently for the return of
12312: his home happiness, because his life out of doors was more and more
12313: interesting to him. A course of action which is in strictness a
12314: slowly-prepared outgrowth of the entire character, is yet almost always
12315: traceable to a single impression as its point of apparent origin; and
12316: since that moment in the Piazza del Duomo, when Tito, mounted on the
12317: bales, had tasted a keen pleasure in the consciousness of his ability
12318: to tickle the ears of men with any phrases that pleased them, his
12319: imagination had glanced continually towards a sort of political
12320: activity which the troubled public life of Florence was likely enough
12321: to find occasion for. But the fresh dread of Baldassarre, waked in the
12322: same moment, had lain like an immovable rocky obstruction across that
12323: path, and had urged him into the sale of the library, as a preparation
12324: for the possible necessity of leaving Florence, at the very time when
12325: he was beginning to feel that it had a new attraction for him. That
12326: dread was nearly removed _now_: he must wear his armour still, he must
12327: prepare himself for possible demands on his coolness and ingenuity, but
12328: he did not feel obliged to take the inconvenient step of leaving
12329: Florence and seeking new fortunes. His father had refused the offered
12330: atonement—had forced him into defiance; and an old man in a strange
12331: place, with his memory gone, was weak enough to be defied.
12332: 
12333: Tito’s implicit desires were working themselves out now in very
12334: explicit thoughts. As the freshness of young passion faded, life was
12335: taking more and more decidedly for him the aspect of a game in which
12336: there was an agreeable mingling of skill and chance.
12337: 
12338: And the game that might be played in Florence promised to be rapid and
12339: exciting; it was a game of revolutionary and party struggle, sure to
12340: include plenty of that unavowed action in which brilliant ingenuity,
12341: able to get rid of all inconvenient beliefs except that “ginger is hot
12342: in the mouth,” is apt to see the path of superior wisdom.
12343: 
12344: No sooner were the French guests gone than Florence was as agitated as
12345: a colony of ants when an alarming shadow has been removed, and the camp
12346: has to be repaired. “How are we to raise the money for the French king?
12347: How are we to manage the war with those obstinate Pisan rebels? Above
12348: all, how are we to mend our plan of government, so as to hit on the
12349: best way of getting our magistrates chosen and our laws voted?” Till
12350: those questions were well answered trade was in danger of standing
12351: still, and that large body of the working men who were not counted as
12352: citizens and had not so much as a vote to serve as an anodyne to their
12353: stomachs were likely to get impatient. Something must be done.
12354: 
12355: And first the great bell was sounded, to call the citizens to a
12356: parliament in the Piazza de’ Signori; and when the crowd was wedged
12357: close, and hemmed in by armed men at all the outlets, the Signoria (or
12358: Gonfaloniere and eight Priors for the time being) came out and stood by
12359: the stone lion on the platform in front of the Old Palace, and proposed
12360: that twenty chief men of the city should have dictatorial authority
12361: given them, by force of which they should for one year choose all
12362: magistrates, and set the frame of government in order. And the people
12363: shouted their assent, and felt themselves the electors of the Twenty.
12364: This kind of “parliament” was a very old Florentine fashion, by which
12365: the will of the few was made to seem the choice of the many.
12366: 
12367: The shouting in the Piazza was soon at an end, but not so the debating
12368: inside the palace: was Florence to have a Great Council after the
12369: Venetian mode, where all the officers of government might be elected,
12370: and all laws voted by a wide number of citizens of a certain age and of
12371: ascertained qualifications, without question of rank or party? or, was
12372: it to be governed on a narrower and less popular scheme, in which the
12373: hereditary influence of good families would be less adulterated with
12374: the votes of shopkeepers. Doctors of law disputed day after day, and
12375: far on into the night. Messer Pagolantonio Soderini alleged excellent
12376: reasons on the side of the popular scheme; Messer Guidantonio Vespucci
12377: alleged reasons equally excellent on the side, of a more aristocratic
12378: form. It was a question of boiled or roast, which had been prejudged by
12379: the palates of the disputants, and the excellent arguing might have
12380: been protracted a long while without any other result than that of
12381: deferring the cooking. The majority of the men inside the palace,
12382: having power already in their hands, agreed with Vespucci, and thought
12383: change should be moderate; the majority outside the palace, conscious
12384: of little power and many grievances, were less afraid of change.
12385: 
12386: And there was a force outside the palace which was gradually tending to
12387: give the vague desires of that majority the character of a determinate
12388: will. That force was the preaching of Savonarola. Impelled partly by
12389: the spiritual necessity that was laid upon him to guide the people, and
12390: partly by the prompting of public-men who could get no measures carried
12391: without his aid, he was rapidly passing in his daily sermons from the
12392: general to the special—from telling his hearers that they must postpone
12393: their private passions and interests to the public good, to telling
12394: them precisely what sort of government they must have in order to
12395: promote that good—from “Choose whatever is best for all” to “Choose the
12396: Great Council,” and “the Great Council is the will of God.”
12397: 
12398: To Savonarola these were as good as identical propositions. The Great
12399: Council was the only practicable plan for giving an expression to the
12400: public will large enough to counteract the vitiating influence of party
12401: interests: it was a plan that would make honest impartial public action
12402: at least possible. And the purer the government of Florence would
12403: become—the more secure from the designs of men who saw their own
12404: advantage in the moral debasement of their fellows—the nearer would the
12405: Florentine people approach the character of a pure community, worthy to
12406: lead the way in the renovation of the Church and the world. And Fra
12407: Girolamo’s mind never stopped short of that sublimest end: the objects
12408: towards which he felt himself working had always the same moral
12409: magnificence. He had no private malice—he sought no petty
12410: gratification. Even in the last terrible days, when ignominy, torture,
12411: and the fear of torture, had laid bare every hidden weakness of his
12412: soul, he could say to his importunate judges: “Do not wonder if it
12413: seems to you that I have told but few things; for my purposes were few
12414: and great.”[1]
12415: 
12416:  [1] “Se vi pare che io abbia detto poche cose, non ve ne maravigliate,
12417:  perchè le mie cose erano poche e grandi.”
12418: 
12419: 
12420: 
12421: 
12422: CHAPTER XXXVI.
12423: Ariadne discrowns herself.
12424: 
12425: 
12426: It was more than three weeks before the contents of the library were
12427: all packed and carried away. And Romola, instead of shutting her eyes
12428: and ears, had watched the process. The exhaustion consequent on violent
12429: emotion is apt to bring a dreamy disbelief in the reality of its cause;
12430: and in the evening, when the workmen were gone, Romola took her
12431: hand-lamp and walked slowly round amongst the confusion of straw and
12432: wooden cases, pausing at every vacant pedestal, every well-known object
12433: laid prostrate, with a sort of bitter desire to assure herself that
12434: there was a sufficient reason why her love was gone and the world was
12435: barren for her. And still, as the evenings came, she went and went
12436: again; no longer to assure herself, but because this vivifying of pain
12437: and despair about her father’s memory was the strongest life left to
12438: her affections. On the 23rd of December, she knew that the last
12439: packages were going. She ran to the loggia at the top of the house that
12440: she might not lose the last pang of seeing the slow wheels move across
12441: the bridge.
12442: 
12443: It was a cloudy day, and nearing dusk. Arno ran dark and shivering; the
12444: hills were mournful; and Florence with its girdling stone towers had
12445: that silent, tomb-like look, which unbroken shadow gives to a city seen
12446: from above. Santa Croce, where her father lay, was dark amidst that
12447: darkness, and slowly crawling over the bridge, and slowly vanishing up
12448: the narrow street, was the white load, like a cruel, deliberate Fate
12449: carrying away her father’s lifelong hope to bury it in an unmarked
12450: grave. Romola felt less that she was seeing this herself than that her
12451: father was conscious of it as he lay helpless under the imprisoning
12452: stones, where her hand could not reach his to tell him that he was not
12453: alone.
12454: 
12455: She stood still even after the load had disappeared, heedless of the
12456: cold, and soothed by the gloom which seemed to cover her like a
12457: mourning garment and shut out the discord of joy. When suddenly the
12458: great bell in the palace-tower rang out a mighty peal: not the
12459: hammer-sound of alarm, but an agitated peal of triumph; and one after
12460: another every other bell in every other tower seemed to catch the
12461: vibration and join the chorus. And, as the chorus swelled and swelled
12462: till the air seemed made of sound—little flames, vibrating too, as if
12463: the sound had caught fire, burst out between the turrets of the palace
12464: and on the girdling towers.
12465: 
12466: That sudden clang, that leaping light, fell on Romola like sharp
12467: wounds. They were the triumph of demons at the success of her husband’s
12468: treachery, and the desolation of her life. Little more than three weeks
12469: ago she had been intoxicated with the sound of those very bells; and in
12470: the gladness of Florence, she had heard a prophecy of her own gladness.
12471: But now the general joy seemed cruel to her: she stood aloof from that
12472: common life—that Florence which was flinging out its loud exultation to
12473: stun the ears of sorrow and loneliness. She could never join hands with
12474: gladness again, but only with those whom it was in the hard nature of
12475: gladness to forget. And in her bitterness she felt that all rejoicing
12476: was mockery. Men shouted paeans with their souls full of heaviness, and
12477: then looked in their neighbours’ faces to see if there was really such
12478: a thing as joy. Romola had lost her belief in the happiness she had
12479: once thirsted for: it was a hateful, smiling, soft-handed thing, with a
12480: narrow, selfish heart.
12481: 
12482: She ran down from the loggia, with her hands pressed against her ears,
12483: and was hurrying across the antechamber, when she was startled by
12484: unexpectedly meeting her husband, who was coming to seek her.
12485: 
12486: His step was elastic, and there was a radiance of satisfaction about
12487: him not quite usual.
12488: 
12489: “What! the noise was a little too much for you?” he said; for Romola,
12490: as she started at the sight of him, had pressed her hands all the
12491: closer against her ears. He took her gently by the wrist, and drew her
12492: arm within his, leading her into the saloon surrounded with the dancing
12493: nymphs and fauns, and then went on speaking: “Florence is gone quite
12494: mad at getting its Great Council, which is to put an end to all the
12495: evils under the sun; especially to the vice of merriment. You may well
12496: look stunned, my Romola, and you are cold. You must not stay so late
12497: under that windy loggia without wrappings. I was coming to tell you
12498: that I am suddenly called to Rome about some learned business for
12499: Bernardo Rucellai. I am going away immediately, for I am to join my
12500: party at San Gaggio to-night, that we may start early in the morning. I
12501: need give you no trouble; I have had my packages made already. It will
12502: not be very long before I am back again.”
12503: 
12504: He knew he had nothing to expect from her but quiet endurance of what
12505: he said and did. He could not even venture to kiss her brow this
12506: evening, but just pressed her hand to his lips, and left her. Tito felt
12507: that Romola was a more unforgiving woman than he had imagined; her love
12508: was not that sweet clinging instinct, stronger than all judgments,
12509: which, he began to see now, made the great charm of a wife. Still, this
12510: petrified coldness was better than a passionate, futile opposition. Her
12511: pride and capability of seeing where resistance was useless had their
12512: convenience.
12513: 
12514: But when the door had closed on Tito, Romola lost the look of cold
12515: immobility which came over her like an inevitable frost whenever he
12516: approached her. Inwardly she was very far from being in a state of
12517: quiet endurance, and the days that had passed since the scene which had
12518: divided her from Tito had been days of active planning and preparation
12519: for the fulfilment of a purpose.
12520: 
12521: The first thing she did now was to call old Maso to her.
12522: 
12523: “Maso,” she said, in a decided tone, “we take our journey to-morrow
12524: morning. We shall be able now to overtake that first convoy of cloth,
12525: while they are waiting at San Piero. See about the two mules to-night,
12526: and be ready to set off with them at break of day, and wait for me at
12527: Trespiano.”
12528: 
12529: She meant to take Maso with her as far as Bologna, and then send him
12530: back with letters to her godfather and Tito, telling them that she was
12531: gone and never meant to return. She had planned her departure so that
12532: its secrecy might be perfect, and her broken love and life be hidden
12533: away unscanned by vulgar eyes. Bernardo del Nero had been absent at his
12534: villa, willing to escape from political suspicions to his favourite
12535: occupation of attending to his land, and she had paid him the debt
12536: without a personal interview. He did not even know that the library was
12537: sold, and was left to conjecture that some sudden piece of good fortune
12538: had enabled Tito to raise this sum of money. Maso had been taken into
12539: her confidence only so far that he knew her intended journey was a
12540: secret; and to do just what she told him was the thing he cared most
12541: for in his withered wintry age.
12542: 
12543: Romola did not mean to go to bed that night. When she had fastened the
12544: door she took her taper to the carved and painted chest which contained
12545: her wedding-clothes. The white silk and gold lay there, the long white
12546: veil and the circlet of pearls. A great sob rose as she looked at them:
12547: they seemed the shroud of her dead happiness. In a tiny gold loop of
12548: the circlet a sugar-plum had lodged—a pink hailstone from the shower of
12549: sweets: Tito had detected it first, and had said that it should always
12550: remain there. At certain moments—and this was one of them—Romola was
12551: carried, by a sudden wave of memory, back again into the time of
12552: perfect trust, and felt again the presence of the husband whose love
12553: made the world as fresh and wonderful to her as to a little child that
12554: sits in stillness among the sunny flowers: heard the gentle tones and
12555: saw the soft eyes without any lie in them, and breathed again that
12556: large freedom of the soul which comes from the faith that the being who
12557: is nearest to us is greater than ourselves. And in those brief moments
12558: the tears always rose: the woman’s lovingness felt something akin to
12559: what the bereaved mother feels when the tiny fingers seem to lie warm
12560: on her bosom, and yet are marble to her lips as she bends over the
12561: silent bed.
12562: 
12563: But there was something else lying in the chest besides the
12564: wedding-clothes: it was something dark and coarse, rolled up in a close
12565: bundle. She turned away her eyes from the white and gold to the dark
12566: bundle, and as her hands touched the serge, her tears began to be
12567: checked. That coarse roughness recalled her fully to the present, from
12568: which love and delight were gone. She unfastened the thick white cord
12569: and spread the bundle out on the table. It was the grey serge dress of
12570: a sister belonging to the third order of Saint Francis, living in the
12571: world but especially devoted to deeds of piety—a personage whom the
12572: Florentines were accustomed to call a Pinzochera. Romola was going to
12573: put on this dress as a disguise, and she determined to put it on at
12574: once, so that, if she needed sleep before the morning, she might wake
12575: up in perfect readiness to be gone. She put off her black garment, and
12576: as she thrust her soft white arms into the harsh sleeves of the serge
12577: mantle and felt the hard girdle of rope hurt her fingers as she tied
12578: it, she courted those rude sensations: they were in keeping with her
12579: new scorn of that thing called pleasure which made men base—that
12580: dexterous contrivance for selfish ease, that shrinking from endurance
12581: and strain, when others were bowing beneath burdens too heavy for them,
12582: which now made one image with her husband. Then she gathered her long
12583: hair together, drew it away tight from her face, bound it in a great
12584: hard knot at the back of her head, and taking a square piece of black
12585: silk, tied it in the fashion of a kerchief close across her head and
12586: under her chin; and over that she drew the cowl. She lifted the candle
12587: to the mirror. Surely her disguise would be complete to any one who had
12588: not lived very near to her. To herself she looked strangely like her
12589: brother Dino: the full oval of the cheek had only to be wasted; the
12590: eyes, already sad, had only to become a little sunken. Was she getting
12591: more like him in anything else? Only in this, that she understood now
12592: how men could be prompted to rush away for ever from earthly delights,
12593: how they could be prompted to dwell on images of sorrow rather than of
12594: beauty and joy.
12595: 
12596: But she did not linger at the mirror: she set about collecting and
12597: packing all the relics of her father and mother that were too large to
12598: be carried in her small travelling-wallet. They were all to be put in
12599: the chest along with her wedding-clothes, and the chest was to be
12600: committed to her godfather when she was safely gone. First she laid in
12601: the portraits; then one by one every little thing that had a sacred
12602: memory clinging to it was put into her wallet or into the chest.
12603: 
12604: She paused. There was still something else to be stript away from her,
12605: belonging to that past on which she was going to turn her back for
12606: ever. She put her thumb and her forefinger to her betrothal ring; but
12607: they rested there, without drawing it off. Romola’s mind had been
12608: rushing with an impetuous current towards this act, for which she was
12609: preparing: the act of quitting a husband who had disappointed all her
12610: trust, the act of breaking an outward tie that no longer represented
12611: the inward bond of love. But that force of outward symbols by which our
12612: active life is knit together so as to make an inexorable external
12613: identity for us, not to be shaken by our wavering consciousness, gave a
12614: strange effect to this simple movement towards taking off her ring—a
12615: movement which was but a small sequence of her energetic resolution. It
12616: brought a vague but arresting sense that she was somehow violently
12617: rending her life in two: a presentiment that the strong impulse which
12618: had seemed to exclude doubt and make her path clear might after all be
12619: blindness, and that there was something in human bonds which must
12620: prevent them from being broken with the breaking of illusions.
12621: 
12622: If that beloved Tito who had placed the betrothal ring on her finger
12623: was not in any valid sense the same Tito whom she had ceased to love,
12624: why should she return to him the sign of their union, and not rather
12625: retain it as a memorial? And this act, which came as a palpable
12626: demonstration of her own and his identity, had a power unexplained to
12627: herself, of shaking Romola. It is the way with half the truth amidst
12628: which we live, that it only haunts us and makes dull pulsations that
12629: are never born into sound. But there was a passionate voice speaking
12630: within her that presently nullified all such muffled murmurs.
12631: 
12632: “It cannot be! I cannot be subject to him. He is false. I shrink from
12633: him. I despise him!”
12634: 
12635: She snatched the ring from her finger and laid it on the table against
12636: the pen with which she meant to write. Again she felt that there could
12637: be no law for her but the law of her affections. That tenderness and
12638: keen fellow-feeling for the near and the loved which are the main
12639: outgrowth of the affections, had made the religion of her life: they
12640: had made her patient in spite of natural impetuosity: they would have
12641: sufficed to make her heroic. But now all that strength was gone, or,
12642: rather, it was converted into the strength of repulsion. She had
12643: recoiled from Tito in proportion to the energy of that young belief and
12644: love which he had disappointed, of that lifelong devotion to her father
12645: against which he had committed an irredeemable offence. And it seemed
12646: as if all motive had slipped away from her, except the indignation and
12647: scorn that made her tear herself asunder from him.
12648: 
12649: She was not acting after any precedent, or obeying any adopted maxims.
12650: The grand severity of the stoical philosophy in which her father had
12651: taken care to instruct her, was familiar enough to her ears and lips,
12652: and its lofty spirit had raised certain echoes within her; but she had
12653: never used it, never needed it as a rule of life. She had endured and
12654: forborne because she loved: maxims which told her to feel less, and not
12655: to cling close lest the onward course of great Nature should jar her,
12656: had been as powerless on her tenderness as they had been on her
12657: father’s yearning for just fame. She had appropriated no theories: she
12658: had simply felt strong in the strength of affection, and life without
12659: that energy came to her as an entirely new problem.
12660: 
12661: She was going to solve the problem in a way that seemed to her very
12662: simple. Her mind had never yet bowed to any obligation apart from
12663: personal love and reverence; she had no keen sense of any other human
12664: relations, and all she had to obey now was the instinct to sever
12665: herself from the man she loved no longer.
12666: 
12667: Yet the unswerving resolution was accompanied with continually varying
12668: phases of anguish. And now that the active preparation for her
12669: departure was almost finished, she lingered: she deferred writing the
12670: irrevocable words of parting from all her little world. The emotions of
12671: the past weeks seemed to rush in again with cruel hurry, and take
12672: possession even of her limbs. She was going to write, and her hand
12673: fell. Bitter tears came now at the delusion which had blighted her
12674: young years, tears very different from the sob of remembered happiness
12675: with which she had looked at the circlet of pearls and the pink
12676: hailstone. And now she felt a tingling shame at the words of ignominy
12677: she had cast, at Tito—“Have you robbed some one else who is _not_
12678: dead?” To have had such words wrung from her—to have uttered them to
12679: her husband seemed a degradation of her whole life. Hard speech between
12680: those who have loved is hideous in the memory, like the sight of
12681: greatness and beauty sunk into vice and rags.
12682: 
12683: That heart-cutting comparison of the present with the past urged itself
12684: upon Romola till it even transformed itself into wretched sensations:
12685: she seemed benumbed to everything but inward throbbings, and began to
12686: feel the need of some hard contact. She drew her hands tight along the
12687: harsh knotted cord that hung from her waist. She started to her feet
12688: and seized the rough lid of the chest: there was nothing else to go in?
12689: No. She closed the lid, pressing her hand upon the rough carving, and
12690: locked it.
12691: 
12692: Then she remembered that she had still to complete her equipment as a
12693: Pinzochera. The large leather purse or scarsella, with small coin in
12694: it, had to be hung on the cord at her waist (her florins and small
12695: jewels, presents from her godfather and cousin Brigida, were safely
12696: fastened within her serge mantle)—and on the other side must hang the
12697: rosary.
12698: 
12699: It did not occur to Romola, as she hung that rosary by her side, that
12700: something else besides the mere garb would perhaps be necessary to
12701: enable her to pass as a Pinzochera, and that her whole air and
12702: expression were as little as possible like those of a sister whose
12703: eyelids were used to be bent, and whose lips were used to move in
12704: silent iteration. Her inexperience prevented her from picturing distant
12705: details, and it helped her proud courage in shutting out any foreboding
12706: of danger and insult. She did not know that any Florentine woman had
12707: ever done exactly what she was going to do: unhappy wives often took
12708: refuge with their friends, or in the cloister, she knew, but both those
12709: courses were impossible to her; she had invented a lot for herself—to
12710: go to the most learned woman in the world, Cassandra Fedele, at Venice,
12711: and ask her how an instructed woman could support herself in a lonely
12712: life there.
12713: 
12714: She was not daunted by the practical difficulties in the way or the
12715: dark uncertainty at the end. Her life could never be happy any more,
12716: but it must not, could not, be ignoble. And by a pathetic mixture of
12717: childish romance with her woman’s trials, the philosophy which had
12718: nothing to do with this great decisive deed of hers had its place in
12719: her imagination of the future: so far as she conceived her solitary
12720: loveless life at all, she saw it animated by a proud stoical heroism,
12721: and by an indistinct but strong purpose of labour, that she might be
12722: wise enough to write something which would rescue her father’s name
12723: from oblivion. After all, she was only a young girl—this poor Romola,
12724: who had found herself at the end of her joys.
12725: 
12726: There were other things yet to be done. There was a small key in a
12727: casket on the table—but now Romola perceived that her taper was dying
12728: out, and she had forgotten to provide herself with any other light. In
12729: a few moments the room was in total darkness. Feeling her way to the
12730: nearest chair, she sat down to wait for the morning.
12731: 
12732: Her purpose in seeking the key had called up certain memories which had
12733: come back upon her during the past week with the new vividness that
12734: remembered words always have for us when we have learned to give them a
12735: new meaning. Since the shock of the revelation which had seemed to
12736: divide her for ever from Tito, that last interview with Dino had never
12737: been for many hours together out of her mind. And it solicited her all
12738: the more, because while its remembered images pressed upon her almost
12739: with the imperious force of sensations, they raised struggling thoughts
12740: which resisted their influence. She could not prevent herself from
12741: hearing inwardly the dying prophetic voice saying again and again,—“The
12742: man whose face was a blank loosed thy hand and departed; and as he
12743: went, I could see his face, and it was the face of the great Tempter...
12744: And thou, Romola, didst wring thy hands and seek for water, and there
12745: was none... and the plain was bare and stony again, and thou wast alone
12746: in the midst of it. And then it seemed that the night fell, and I saw
12747: no more.” She could not prevent herself from dwelling with a sort of
12748: agonised fascination on the wasted face; on the straining gaze at the
12749: crucifix; on the awe which had compelled her to kneel; on the last
12750: broken words and then the unbroken silence—on all the details of the
12751: death-scene, which had seemed like a sudden opening into a world apart
12752: from that of her lifelong knowledge.
12753: 
12754: But her mind was roused to resistance of impressions that, from being
12755: obvious phantoms, seemed to be getting solid in the daylight. As a
12756: strong body struggles against fumes with the more violence when they
12757: begin to be stifling, a strong soul struggles against phantasies with
12758: all the more alarmed energy when they threaten to govern in the place
12759: of thought.
12760: 
12761: What had the words of that vision to do with her real sorrows? That
12762: fitting of certain words was a mere chance; the rest was all vague—nay,
12763: those words themselves were vague; they were determined by nothing but
12764: her brother’s memories and beliefs. He believed there was something
12765: fatal in pagan learning; he believed that celibacy was more holy than
12766: marriage; he remembered their home, and all the objects in the library;
12767: and of these threads the vision was woven. What reasonable warrant
12768: could she have had for believing in such a vision and acting on it?
12769: None. True as the voice of foreboding had proved, Romola saw with
12770: unshaken conviction that to have renounced Tito in obedience to a
12771: warning like that, would have been meagre-hearted folly. Her trust had
12772: been delusive, but she would have chosen over again to have acted on it
12773: rather than be a creature led by phantoms and disjointed whispers in a
12774: world where there was the large music of reasonable speech, and the
12775: warm grasp of living hands.
12776: 
12777: But the persistent presence of these memories, linking themselves in
12778: her imagination with her actual lot, gave her a glimpse of
12779: understanding into the lives which had before lain utterly aloof from
12780: her sympathy—the lives of the men and women who were led by such inward
12781: images and voices.
12782: 
12783: “If they were only a little stronger in me,” she said to herself, “I
12784: should lose the sense of what that vision really was, and take it for a
12785: prophetic light. I might in time get to be a seer of visions myself,
12786: like the Suora Maddalena, and Camilla Rucellai, and the rest.”
12787: 
12788: Romola shuddered at the possibility. All the instruction, all the main
12789: influences of her life had gone to fortify her scorn of that sickly
12790: superstition which led men and women, with eyes too weak for the
12791: daylight, to sit in dark swamps and try to read human destiny by the
12792: chance flame of wandering vapours.
12793: 
12794: And yet she was conscious of something deeper than that coincidence of
12795: words which made the parting contact with her dying brother live anew
12796: in her mind, and gave a new sisterhood to the wasted face. If there
12797: were much more of such experience as his in the world, she would like
12798: to understand it—would even like to learn the thoughts of men who sank
12799: in ecstasy before the pictured agonies of martyrdom. There seemed to be
12800: something more than madness in that supreme fellowship with suffering.
12801: The springs were all dried up around her; she wondered what other
12802: waters there were at which men drank and found strength in the desert.
12803: And those moments in the Duomo when she had sobbed with a mysterious
12804: mingling of rapture and pain, while Fra Girolamo offered himself a
12805: willing sacrifice for the people, came back to her as if they had been
12806: a transient taste of some such far-off fountain. But again she shrank
12807: from impressions that were alluring her within the sphere of visions
12808: and narrow fears which compelled men to outrage natural affections as
12809: Dino had done.
12810: 
12811: This was the tangled web that Romola had in her mind as she sat weary
12812: in the darkness. No radiant angel came across the gloom with a clear
12813: message for her. In those times, as now, there were human beings who
12814: never saw angels or heard perfectly clear messages. Such truth as came
12815: to them was brought confusedly in the voices and deeds of men not at
12816: all like the seraphs of unfailing wing and piercing vision—men who
12817: believed falsities as well as truths, and did the wrong as well as the
12818: right. The helping hands stretched out to them were the hands of men
12819: who stumbled and often saw dimly, so that these beings unvisited by
12820: angels had no other choice than to grasp that stumbling guidance along
12821: the path of reliance and action which is the path of life, or else to
12822: pause in loneliness and disbelief, which is no path, but the arrest of
12823: inaction and death.
12824: 
12825: And so Romola, seeing no ray across the darkness, and heavy with
12826: conflict that changed nothing, sank at last to sleep.
12827: 
12828: 
12829: 
12830: 
12831: CHAPTER XXXVII.
12832: The Tabernacle Unlocked.
12833: 
12834: 
12835: Romola was waked by a tap at the door. The cold light of early morning
12836: was in the room, and Maso was come for the travelling-wallet. The old
12837: man could not help starting when she opened the door, and showed him,
12838: instead of the graceful outline he had been used to, crowned with the
12839: brightness of her hair, the thick folds of the grey mantle and the pale
12840: face shadowed by the dark cowl.
12841: 
12842: “It is well, Maso,” said Romola, trying to speak in the calmest voice,
12843: and make the old man easy. “Here is the wallet quite ready. You will go
12844: on quietly, and I shall not be far behind you. When you get out of the
12845: gates you may go more slowly, for I shall perhaps join you before you
12846: get to Trespiano.”
12847: 
12848: She closed the door behind him, and then put her hand on the key which
12849: she had taken from the casket the last thing in the night. It was the
12850: original key of the little painted tabernacle: Tito had forgotten to
12851: drown it in the Arno, and it had lodged, as such small things will, in
12852: the corner of the embroidered scarsella which he wore with the purple
12853: tunic. One day, long after their marriage, Romola had found it there,
12854: and had put it by, without using it, but with a sense of satisfaction
12855: that the key was within reach. The cabinet on which the tabernacle
12856: stood had been moved to the side of the room, close to one of the
12857: windows, where the pale morning light fell upon it so as to make the
12858: painted forms discernible enough to Romola, who knew them well,—the
12859: triumphant Bacchus, with his clusters and his vine-clad spear, clasping
12860: the crowned Ariadne; the Loves showering roses, the wreathed vessel,
12861: the cunning-eyed dolphins, and the rippled sea: all encircled by a
12862: flowery border, like a bower of paradise. Romola looked at the familiar
12863: images with new bitterness and repulsion: they seemed a more pitiable
12864: mockery than ever on this chill morning, when she had waked up to
12865: wander in loneliness. They had been no tomb of sorrow, but a lying
12866: screen. Foolish Ariadne! with her gaze of love, as if that bright face,
12867: with its hyacinthine curls like tendrils among the vines, held the deep
12868: secret of her life!
12869: 
12870: “Ariadne is wonderfully transformed,” thought Romola. “She would look
12871: strange among the vines and the roses now.”
12872: 
12873: She took up the mirror, and looked at herself once more. But the sight
12874: was so startling in this morning light that she laid it down again,
12875: with a sense of shrinking almost as strong as that with which she had
12876: turned from the joyous Ariadne. The recognition of her own face, with
12877: the cowl about it, brought back the dread lest she should be drawn at
12878: last into fellowship with some wretched superstition—into the company
12879: of the howling fanatics and weeping nuns who had been her contempt from
12880: childhood till now. She thrust the key into the tabernacle hurriedly:
12881: hurriedly she opened it, and took out the crucifix, without looking at
12882: it; then, with trembling fingers, she passed a cord through the little
12883: ring, hung the crucifix round her neck, and hid it in the bosom of her
12884: mantle. “For Dino’s sake,” she said to herself. Still there were the
12885: letters to be written which Maso was to carry back from Bologna. They
12886: were very brief. The first said—
12887: 
12888: “Tito, my love for you is dead; and therefore, so far as I was yours, I
12889: too am dead. Do not try to put in force any laws for the sake of
12890: fetching me back: that would bring you no happiness. The Romola you
12891: married can never return. I need explain nothing to you after the words
12892: I uttered to you the last time we spoke long together. If you supposed
12893: them to be words of transient anger, you will know now that they were
12894: the sign of an irreversible change.
12895: 
12896: “I think you will fulfil my wish that my bridal chest should be sent to
12897: my godfather, who gave it me. It contains my wedding-clothes and the
12898: portraits and other relics of my father and mother.”
12899: 
12900: She folded the ring inside this letter, and wrote Tito’s name outside.
12901: The next letter was to Bernardo del Nero:—
12902: 
12903: “Dearest Godfather,—If I could have been any good to your life by
12904: staying I would not have gone away to a distance. But now I am gone. Do
12905: not ask the reason; and if you love my father, try to prevent any one
12906: from seeking me. I could not bear my life at Florence. I cannot bear to
12907: tell any one why. Help to cover my lot in silence. I have asked that my
12908: bridal chest should be sent to you: when you open it, you will know the
12909: reason. Please to give all the things that were my mother’s to my
12910: cousin Brigida, and ask her to forgive me for not saying any words of
12911: parting to her.
12912: 
12913: “Farewell, my second father. The best thing I have in life is still to
12914: remember your goodness and be grateful to you.
12915: 
12916: “Romola.”
12917: 
12918: Romola put the letters, along with the crucifix, within the bosom of
12919: her mantle, and then felt that everything was done. She was ready now
12920: to depart.
12921: 
12922: No one was stirring in the house, and she went almost as quietly as a
12923: grey phantom down the stairs and into the silent street. Her heart was
12924: palpitating violently, yet she enjoyed the sense of her firm tread on
12925: the broad flags—of the swift movement, which was like a chained-up
12926: resolution set free at last. The anxiety to carry out her act, and the
12927: dread of any obstacle, averted sorrow; and as she reached the Ponte
12928: Rubaconte, she felt less that Santa Croce was in her sight than that
12929: the yellow streak of morning which parted the grey was getting broader
12930: and broader, and that, unless she hastened her steps, she should have
12931: to encounter faces.
12932: 
12933: Her simplest road was to go right on to the Borgo Pinti, and then along
12934: by the walls to the Porta San Gallo, from which she must leave the
12935: city, and this road carried her by the Piazza di Santa Croce. But she
12936: walked as steadily and rapidly as ever through the piazza, not trusting
12937: herself to look towards the church. The thought that any eyes might be
12938: turned on her with a look of curiosity and recognition, and that
12939: indifferent minds might be set speculating on her private sorrows, made
12940: Romola shrink physically as from the imagination of torture. She felt
12941: degraded even by that act of her husband from which she was helplessly
12942: suffering. But there was no sign that any eyes looked forth from
12943: windows to notice this tall grey sister, with the firm step, and proud
12944: attitude of the cowled head. Her road lay aloof from the stir of early
12945: traffic, and when she reached the Porta San Gallo, it was easy to pass
12946: while a dispute was going forward about the toll for panniers of eggs
12947: and market produce which were just entering.
12948: 
12949: Out! Once past the houses of the Borgo, she would be beyond the last
12950: fringe of Florence, the sky would be broad above her, and she would
12951: have entered on her new life—a life of loneliness and endurance, but of
12952: freedom. She had been strong enough to snap asunder the bonds she had
12953: accepted in blind faith: whatever befell her, she would no more feel
12954: the breath of soft hated lips warm upon her cheek, no longer feel the
12955: breath of an odious mind stifling her own. The bare wintry morning, the
12956: chill air, were welcome in their severity: the leafless trees, the
12957: sombre hills, were not haunted by the gods of beauty and joy, whose
12958: worship she had forsaken for ever.
12959: 
12960: But presently the light burst forth with sudden strength, and shadows
12961: were thrown across the road. It seemed that the sun was going to chase
12962: away the greyness. The light is perhaps never felt more strongly as a
12963: divine presence stirring all those inarticulate sensibilities which are
12964: our deepest life, than in these moments when it instantaneously awakens
12965: the shadows. A certain awe which inevitably accompanied this most
12966: momentous act of her life became a more conscious element in Romola’s
12967: feeling as she found herself in the sudden presence of the impalpable
12968: golden glory and the long shadow of herself that was not to be escaped.
12969: Hitherto she had met no one but an occasional contadino with mules, and
12970: the many turnings of the road on the level prevented her from seeing
12971: that Maso was not very far ahead of her. But when she had passed Pietra
12972: and was on rising ground, she lifted up the hanging roof of her cowl
12973: and looked eagerly before her.
12974: 
12975: The cowl was dropped again immediately. She had seen, not Maso, but—two
12976: monks, who were approaching within a few yards of her. The edge of her
12977: cowl making a pent-house on her brow had shut out the objects above the
12978: level of her eyes, and for the last few moments she had been looking at
12979: nothing but the brightness on the path and at her own shadow, tall and
12980: shrouded like a dread spectre.
12981: 
12982: She wished now that she had not looked up. Her disguise made her
12983: especially dislike to encounter monks: they might expect some pious
12984: passwords of which she knew nothing, and she walked along with a
12985: careful appearance of unconsciousness till she had seen the skirts of
12986: the black mantles pass by her. The encounter had made her heart beat
12987: disagreeably, for Romola had an uneasiness in her religious disguise, a
12988: shame at this studied concealment, which was made more distinct by a
12989: special effort to appear unconscious under actual glances.
12990: 
12991: But the black skirts would be gone the faster because they were going
12992: down-hill; and seeing a great flat stone against a cypress that rose
12993: from a projecting green bank, she yielded to the desire which the
12994: slight shock had given her, to sit down and rest.
12995: 
12996: She turned her back on Florence, not meaning to look at it till the
12997: monks were quite out of sight, and raising the edge of her cowl again
12998: when she had seated herself, she discerned Maso and the mules at a
12999: distance where it was not hopeless for her to overtake them, as the old
13000: man would probably linger in expectation of her.
13001: 
13002: Meanwhile she might pause a little. She was free and alone.
13003: 
13004: 
13005: 
13006: 
13007: CHAPTER XXXVIII.
13008: The Black Marks become Magical.
13009: 
13010: 
13011: That journey of Tito’s to Rome, which had removed many difficulties
13012: from Romola’s departure, had been resolved on quite suddenly, at a
13013: supper, only the evening before.
13014: 
13015: Tito had set out towards that supper with agreeable expectations. The
13016: meats were likely to be delicate, the wines choice, the company
13017: distinguished; for the place of entertainment was the Selva or Orto de’
13018: Rucellai, or, as we should say, the Rucellai Gardens; and the host,
13019: Bernardo Rucellai, was quite a typical Florentine grandee. Even his
13020: family name has a significance which is prettily symbolic: properly
13021: understood, it may bring before us a little lichen, popularly named
13022: _orcella_ or _roccella_, which grows on the rocks of Greek isles and in
13023: the Canaries; and having drunk a great deal of light into its little
13024: stems and button-heads, will, under certain circumstances, give it out
13025: again as a reddish purple dye, very grateful to the eyes of men. By
13026: bringing the excellent secret of this dye, called _oricello_, from the
13027: Levant to Florence, a certain merchant, who lived nearly a hundred
13028: years before our Bernardo’s time, won for himself and his descendants
13029: much wealth, and the pleasantly-suggestive surname of Oricellari, or
13030: Roccellari, which on Tuscan tongues speedily became Rucellai.
13031: 
13032: And our Bernardo, who stands out more prominently than the rest on this
13033: purple background, had added all sorts of distinction to the family
13034: name: he had married the sister of Lorenzo de’ Medici, and had had the
13035: most splendid wedding in the memory of Florentine upholstery; and for
13036: these and other virtues he had been sent on embassies to France and
13037: Venice, and had been chosen Gonfaloniere; he had not only built himself
13038: a fine palace, but had finished putting the black and white marble
13039: façade to the church of Santa Maria Novella; he had planted a garden
13040: with rare trees, and had made it classic ground by receiving within it
13041: the meetings of the Platonic Academy, orphaned by the death of Lorenzo;
13042: he had written an excellent, learned book, of a new topographical sort,
13043: about ancient Rome; he had collected antiquities; he had a pure
13044: Latinity. The simplest account of him, one sees, reads like a laudatory
13045: epitaph, at the end of which the Greek and Ausonian Muses might be
13046: confidently requested to tear their hair, and Nature to desist from any
13047: second attempt to combine so many virtues with one set of viscera.
13048: 
13049: His invitation had been conveyed to Tito through Lorenzo Tornabuoni,
13050: with an emphasis which would have suggested that the object of the
13051: gathering was political, even if the public questions of the time had
13052: been less absorbing. As it was, Tito felt sure that some party purposes
13053: were to be furthered by the excellent flavours of stewed fish and old
13054: Greek wine; for Bernardo Rucellai was not simply an influential
13055: personage, he was one of the elect Twenty who for three weeks had held
13056: the reins of Florence. This assurance put Tito in the best spirits as
13057: he made his way to the Via della Scala, where the classic garden was to
13058: be found: without it, he might have had some uneasy speculation as to
13059: whether the high company he would have the honour of meeting was likely
13060: to be dull as well as distinguished; for he had had experience of
13061: various dull suppers even in the Rucellai gardens, and especially of
13062: the dull philosophic sort, wherein he had not only been called upon to
13063: accept an entire scheme of the universe (which would have been easy to
13064: him), but to listen to an exposition of the same, from the origin of
13065: things to their complete ripeness in the tractate of the philosopher
13066: then speaking.
13067: 
13068: It was a dark evening, and it was only when Tito crossed the occasional
13069: light of a lamp suspended before an image of the Virgin, that the
13070: outline of his figure was discernible enough for recognition. At such
13071: moments any one caring to watch his passage from one of these lights to
13072: another might have observed that the tall and graceful personage with
13073: the mantle folded round him was followed constantly by a very different
13074: form, thickset and elderly, in a serge tunic and felt hat. The
13075: conjunction might have been taken for mere chance, since there were
13076: many passengers along the streets at this hour. But when Tito stopped
13077: at the gate of the Rucellai gardens, the figure behind stopped too. The
13078: _sportello_, or smaller door of the gate, was already being held open
13079: by the servant, who, in the distraction of attending to some question,
13080: had not yet closed it since the last arrival, and Tito turned in
13081: rapidly, giving his name to the servant, and passing on between the
13082: evergreen bushes that shone like metal in the torchlight. The follower
13083: turned in too.
13084: 
13085: “Your name?” said the servant.
13086: 
13087: “Baldassarre Calvo,” was the immediate answer.
13088: 
13089: “You are not a guest; the guests have all passed.”
13090: 
13091: “I belong to Tito Melema, who has just gone in. I am to wait in the
13092: gardens.”
13093: 
13094: The servant hesitated. “I had orders to admit only guests. Are you a
13095: servant of Messer Tito?”
13096: 
13097: “No, friend, I am not a servant; I am a scholar.”
13098: 
13099: There are men to whom you need only say, “I am a buffalo,” in a certain
13100: tone of quiet confidence, and they will let you pass. The porter gave
13101: way at once, Baldassarre entered, and heard the door closed and chained
13102: behind him, as he too disappeared among the shining bushes.
13103: 
13104: Those ready and firm answers argued a great change in Baldassarre since
13105: the last meeting face to face with Tito, when the dagger broke in two.
13106: 
13107: The change had declared itself in a startling way.
13108: 
13109: At the moment when the shadow of Tito passed in front of the hovel as
13110: he departed homeward, Baldassarre was sitting in that state of
13111: after-tremor known to every one who is liable to great outbursts of
13112: passion: a state in which physical powerlessness is sometimes
13113: accompanied by an exceptional lucidity of thought, as if that
13114: disengagement of excited passion had carried away a fire-mist and left
13115: clearness behind it. He felt unable to rise and walk away just yet; his
13116: limbs seemed benumbed; he was cold, and his hands shook. But in that
13117: bodily helplessness he sat surrounded, not by the habitual dimness and
13118: vanishing shadows, but by the clear images of the past; he was living
13119: again in an unbroken course through that life which seemed a long
13120: preparation for the taste of bitterness.
13121: 
13122: For some minutes he was too thoroughly absorbed by the images to
13123: reflect on the fact that he saw them, and note the fact as a change.
13124: But when that sudden clearness had travelled through the distance, and
13125: came at last to rest on the scene just gone by, he felt fully where he
13126: was: he remembered Monna Lisa and Tessa. Ah! _he_ then was the
13127: mysterious husband; he who had another wife in the Via de’ Bardi. It
13128: was time to pick up the broken dagger and go—go and leave no trace of
13129: himself; for to hide his feebleness seemed the thing most like power
13130: that was left to him. He leaned to take up the fragments of the dagger;
13131: then he turned towards the book which lay open at his side. It was a
13132: fine large manuscript, an odd volume of Pausanias. The moonlight was
13133: upon it, and he could see the large letters at the head of the page:
13134: 
13135: ΜΕΣΣΕΝΙΚΑ. ΚΒ′.
13136: 
13137: 
13138: In old days he had known Pausanias familiarly; yet an hour or two ago
13139: he had been looking hopelessly at that page, and it had suggested no
13140: more meaning to him than if the letters had been black weather-marks on
13141: a wall; but at this moment they were once more the magic signs that
13142: conjure up a world. That moonbeam falling on the letters had raised
13143: Messenia before him, and its struggle against the Spartan oppression.
13144: 
13145: He snatched up the book, but the light was too pale for him to read
13146: further by. No matter: he knew that chapter; he read inwardly. He saw
13147: the stoning of the traitor Aristocrates—stoned by a whole people, who
13148: cast him out from their borders to lie unburied, and set up a pillar
13149: with verses upon it telling how Time had brought home justice to the
13150: unjust. The words arose within him, and stirred innumerable vibrations
13151: of memory. He forgot that he was old: he could almost have shouted. The
13152: light was come again, mother of knowledge and joy! In that exultation
13153: his limbs recovered their strength: he started up with his broken
13154: dagger and book, and went out under the broad moonlight.
13155: 
13156: It was a nipping frosty air, but Baldassarre could feel no chill—he
13157: only felt the glow of conscious power. He walked about and paused on
13158: all the open spots of that high ground, and looked down on the domed
13159: and towered city, sleeping darkly under its sleeping guardians, the
13160: mountains; on the pale gleam of the river; on the valley vanishing
13161: towards the peaks of snow; and felt himself master of them all.
13162: 
13163: That sense of mental empire which belongs to us all in moments of
13164: exceptional clearness was intensified for him by the long days and
13165: nights in which memory had been little more than the consciousness of
13166: something gone. That city, which had been a weary labyrinth, was
13167: material that he could subdue to his purposes now: his mind glanced
13168: through its affairs with flashing conjecture; he was once more a man
13169: who knew cities, whose sense of vision was instructed with large
13170: experience, and who felt the keen delight of holding all things in the
13171: grasp of language. Names! Images!—his mind rushed through its wealth
13172: without pausing, like one who enters on a great inheritance.
13173: 
13174: But amidst all that rushing eagerness there was one End presiding in
13175: Baldassarre’s consciousness,—a dark deity in the inmost cell, who only
13176: seemed forgotten while his hecatomb was being prepared. And when the
13177: first triumph in the certainty of recovered power had had its way, his
13178: thoughts centred themselves on Tito. That fair slippery viper could not
13179: escape him now; thanks to struggling justice, the heart that never
13180: quivered with tenderness for another had its sensitive selfish fibres
13181: that could be reached by the sharp point of anguish. The soul that
13182: bowed to no right, bowed to the great lord of mortals, Pain.
13183: 
13184: He could search into every secret of Tito’s life now: he knew some of
13185: the secrets already, and the failure of the broken dagger, which seemed
13186: like frustration, had been the beginning of achievement. Doubtless that
13187: sudden rage had shaken away the obstruction which stifled his soul.
13188: Twice before, when his memory had partially returned, it had been in
13189: consequence of sudden excitation: once when he had had to defend
13190: himself from an enraged dog: once when he had been overtaken by the
13191: waves, and had had to scramble up a rock to save himself.
13192: 
13193: Yes, but if this time, as then, the light were to die out, and the
13194: dreary conscious blank come back again! This time the light was
13195: stronger and steadier; but what security was there that before the
13196: morrow the dark fog would not be round him again? Even the fear seemed
13197: like the beginning of feebleness: he thought with alarm that he might
13198: sink the faster for this excited vigil of his on the hill, which was
13199: expending his force; and after seeking anxiously for a sheltered corner
13200: where he might lie down, he nestled at last against a heap of warm
13201: garden straw, and so fell asleep.
13202: 
13203: When he opened his eyes again it was daylight. The first moments were
13204: filled with strange bewilderment: he was a man with a double identity;
13205: to which had he awaked? to the life of dim-sighted sensibilities like
13206: the sad heirship of some fallen greatness, or to the life of recovered
13207: power? Surely the last, for the events of the night all came back to
13208: him: the recognition of the page in Pausanias, the crowding resurgence
13209: of facts and names, the sudden wide prospect which had given him such a
13210: moment as that of the Maenad in the glorious amaze of her morning
13211: waking on the mountain top.
13212: 
13213: He took up the book again, he read, he remembered without reading. He
13214: saw a name, and the images of deeds rose with it: he saw the mention of
13215: a deed, and he linked it with a name. There were stories of inexpiable
13216: crimes, but stories also of guilt that seemed successful. There were
13217: sanctuaries for swift-footed miscreants: baseness had its armour, and
13218: the weapons of justice sometimes broke against it. What then? If
13219: baseness triumphed everywhere else, if it could heap to itself all the
13220: goods of the world and even hold the keys of hell, it would never
13221: triumph over the hatred which it had itself awakened. It could devise
13222: no torture that would seem greater than the torture of submitting to
13223: its smile. Baldassarre felt the indestructible independent force of a
13224: supreme emotion, which knows no terror, and asks for no motive, which
13225: is itself an ever-burning motive, consuming all other desire. And now
13226: in this morning light, when the assurance came again that the fine
13227: fibres of association were active still, and that his recovered self
13228: had not departed, all his gladness was but the hope of vengeance.
13229: 
13230: From that time till the evening on which we have seen him enter the
13231: Rucellai gardens, he had been incessantly, but cautiously, inquiring
13232: into Tito’s position and all his circumstances, and there was hardly a
13233: day on which he did not contrive to follow his movements. But he wished
13234: not to arouse any alarm in Tito: he wished to secure a moment when the
13235: hated favourite of blind fortune was at the summit of confident ease,
13236: surrounded by chief men on whose favour he depended. It was not any
13237: retributive payment or recognition of himself for his own behoof, on
13238: which Baldassarre’s whole soul was bent: it was to find the sharpest
13239: edge of disgrace and shame by which a selfish smiler could be pierced;
13240: it was to send through his marrow the most sudden shock of dread. He
13241: was content to lie hard, and live stintedly—he had spent the greater
13242: part of his remaining money in buying another poniard: his hunger and
13243: his thirst were after nothing exquisite but an exquisite vengeance. He
13244: had avoided addressing himself to any one whom he suspected of intimacy
13245: with Tito, lest an alarm raised in Tito’s mind should urge him either
13246: to flight or to some other counteracting measure which hard-pressed
13247: ingenuity might devise. For this reason he had never entered Nello’s
13248: shop, which he observed that Tito frequented, and he had turned aside
13249: to avoid meeting Piero di Cosimo.
13250: 
13251: The possibility of frustration gave added eagerness to his desire that
13252: the great opportunity he sought should not be deferred. The desire was
13253: eager in him on another ground; he trembled lest his memory should go
13254: again. Whether from the agitating presence of that fear, or from some
13255: other causes, he had twice felt a sort of mental dizziness, in which
13256: the inward sense or imagination seemed to be losing the distinct forms
13257: of things. Once he had attempted to enter the Palazzo Vecchio and make
13258: his way into a council-chamber where Tito was, and had failed. But now,
13259: on this evening, he felt that his occasion was come.
13260: 
13261: 
13262: 
13263: 
13264: CHAPTER XXXIX.
13265: A Supper in the Rucellai Gardens.
13266: 
13267: 
13268: On entering the handsome pavilion, Tito’s quick glance soon discerned
13269: in the selection of the guests the confirmation of his conjecture that
13270: the object of the gathering was political, though, perhaps, nothing
13271: more distinct than that strengthening of party which comes from
13272: good-fellowship. Good dishes and good wine were at that time believed
13273: to heighten the consciousness of political preferences, and in the
13274: inspired ease of after-supper talk it was supposed that people
13275: ascertained their own opinions with a clearness quite inaccessible to
13276: uninvited stomachs. The Florentines were a sober and frugal people; but
13277: wherever men have gathered wealth, Madonna della Gozzoviglia and San
13278: Buonvino have had their worshippers; and the Rucellai were among the
13279: few Florentine families who kept a great table and lived splendidly. It
13280: was not probable that on this evening there would be any attempt to
13281: apply high philosophic theories; and there could be no objection to the
13282: bust of Plato looking on, or even to the modest presence of the
13283: cardinal virtues in fresco on the walls.
13284: 
13285: That bust of Plato had been long used to look down on conviviality of a
13286: more transcendental sort, for it had been brought from Lorenzo’s villa
13287: after his death, when the meetings of the Platonic Academy had been
13288: transferred to these gardens. Especially on every thirteenth of
13289: November, reputed anniversary of Plato’s death, it had looked down from
13290: under laurel leaves on a picked company of scholars and philosophers,
13291: who met to eat and drink with moderation, and to discuss and admire,
13292: perhaps with less moderation, the doctrines of the great master:—on
13293: Pico della Mirandola, once a Quixotic young genius with long curls,
13294: astonished at his own powers and astonishing Rome with heterodox
13295: theses; afterwards a more humble student with a consuming passion for
13296: inward perfection, having come to find the universe more astonishing
13297: than his own cleverness:—on innocent, laborious Marsilio Ficino, picked
13298: out young to be reared as a Platonic philosopher, and fed on Platonism
13299: in all its stages till his mind was perhaps a little pulpy from that
13300: too exclusive diet:—on Angelo Poliziano, chief literary genius of that
13301: age, a born poet, and a scholar without dulness, whose phrases had
13302: blood in them and are alive still:—or, further back, on Leon Battista
13303: Alberti, a reverend senior when those three were young, and of a much
13304: grander type than they, a robust, universal mind, at once practical and
13305: theoretic, artist, man of science, inventor, poet:—and on many more
13306: valiant workers whose names are not registered where every day we turn
13307: the leaf to read them, but whose labours make a part, though an
13308: unrecognised part, of our inheritance, like the ploughing and sowing of
13309: past generations.
13310: 
13311: Bernardo Rucellai was a man to hold a distinguished place in that
13312: Academy even before he became its host and patron. He was still in the
13313: prime of life, not more than four and forty, with a somewhat haughty,
13314: cautiously dignified presence; conscious of an amazingly pure Latinity,
13315: but, says Erasmus, not to be caught speaking Latin—no word of Latin to
13316: be sheared off him by the sharpest of Teutons. He welcomed Tito with
13317: more marked favour than usual and gave him a place between Lorenzo
13318: Tornabuoni and Giannozzo Pucci, both of them accomplished young members
13319: of the Medicean party.
13320: 
13321: Of course the talk was the lightest in the world while the brass bowl
13322: filled with scented water was passing round, that the company might
13323: wash their hands, and rings flashed on white fingers under the
13324: wax-lights, and there was the pleasant fragrance of fresh white damask
13325: newly come from France. The tone of remark was a very common one in
13326: those times. Some one asked what Dante’s pattern old Florentine would
13327: think if the life could come into him again under his leathern belt and
13328: bone clasp, and he could see silver forks on the table? And it was
13329: agreed on all hands that the habits of posterity would be very
13330: surprising to ancestors, if ancestors could only know them.
13331: 
13332: And while the silver forks were just dallying with the appetising
13333: delicacies that introduced the more serious business of the supper—such
13334: as morsels of liver, cooked to that exquisite point that they would
13335: melt in the mouth—there was time to admire the designs on the enamelled
13336: silver centres of the brass service, and to say something, as usual,
13337: about the silver dish for confetti, a masterpiece of Antonio
13338: Pollajuolo, whom patronising Popes had seduced from his native Florence
13339: to more gorgeous Rome.
13340: 
13341: “Ah, I remember,” said Niccolò Ridolfi, a middle-aged man, with that
13342: negligent ease of manner which, seeming to claim nothing, is really
13343: based on the lifelong consciousness of commanding rank—“I remember our
13344: Antonio getting bitter about his chiselling and enamelling of these
13345: metal things, and taking in a fury to painting, because, said he, ‘the
13346: artist who puts his work into gold and silver, puts his brains into the
13347: melting-pot.’”
13348: 
13349: “And that is not unlikely to be a true foreboding of Antonio’s,” said
13350: Giannozzo Pucci. “If this pretty war with Pisa goes on, and the revolt
13351: only spreads a little to our other towns, it is not only our silver
13352: dishes that are likely to go; I doubt whether Antonio’s silver saints
13353: round the altar of San Giovanni will not some day vanish from the eyes
13354: of the faithful to be worshipped more devoutly in the form of coin.”
13355: 
13356: “The Frate is preparing us for that already,” said Tornabuoni. “He is
13357: telling the people that God will not have silver crucifixes and
13358: starving stomachs; and that the church is best adorned with the gems of
13359: holiness and the fine gold of brotherly love.”
13360: 
13361: “A very useful doctrine of war-finance, as many a Condottiere has
13362: found,” said Bernardo Rucellai, drily. “But politics come on after the
13363: confetti, Lorenzo, when we can drink wine enough to wash them down;
13364: they are too solid to be taken with roast and boiled.”
13365: 
13366: “Yes, indeed,” said Niccolò Ridolfi. “Our Luigi Pulci would have said
13367: this delicate boiled kid must be eaten with an impartial mind. I
13368: remember one day at Careggi, when Luigi was in his rattling vein, he
13369: was maintaining that nothing perverted the palate like opinion.
13370: ‘Opinion,’ said he, ‘corrupts the saliva—that’s why men took to pepper.
13371: Scepticism is the only philosophy that doesn’t bring a taste in the
13372: mouth.’ ‘Nay,’ says poor Lorenzo de’ Medici, ‘you must be out there,
13373: Luigi. Here is this untainted sceptic, Matteo Franco, who wants hotter
13374: sauce than any of us.’ ‘Because he has a strong opinion of himself,’
13375: flashes out Luigi, which is the original egg of all other opinion. _He_
13376: a sceptic? He believes in the immortality of his own verses. He is such
13377: a logician as that preaching friar who described the pavement of the
13378: bottomless pit. Poor Luigi! his mind was like sharpest steel that can
13379: touch nothing without cutting.”
13380: 
13381: “And yet a very gentle-hearted creature,” said Giannozzo Pucci. “It
13382: seemed to me his talk was a mere blowing of soap-bubbles. What
13383: dithyrambs he went into about eating and drinking! and yet he was as
13384: temperate as a butterfly.”
13385: 
13386: The light talk and the solid eatables were not soon at an end, for
13387: after the roast and boiled meats came the indispensable capon and game,
13388: and, crowning glory of a well-spread table, a peacock cooked according
13389: to the receipt of Apicius for cooking partridges, namely, with the
13390: feathers on, but not plucked afterwards, as that great authority
13391: ordered concerning his partridges; on the contrary, so disposed on the
13392: dish that it might look as much as possible like a live peacock taking
13393: its unboiled repose. Great was the skill required in that confidential
13394: servant who was the official carver, respectfully to turn the classical
13395: though insipid bird on its back, and expose the plucked breast from
13396: which he was to dispense a delicate slice to each of the honourable
13397: company, unless any one should be of so independent a mind as to
13398: decline that expensive toughness and prefer the vulgar digestibility of
13399: capon.
13400: 
13401: Hardly any one was so bold. Tito quoted Horace and dispersed his slice
13402: in small particles over his plate; Bernardo Rucellai made a learned
13403: observation about the ancient price of peacocks’ eggs, but did not
13404: pretend to eat his slice; and Niccolò Ridolfi held a mouthful on his
13405: fork while he told a favourite story of Luigi Pulci’s, about a man of
13406: Siena, who, wanting to give a splendid entertainment at moderate
13407: expense, bought a wild goose, cut off its beak and webbed feet, and
13408: boiled it in its feathers, to pass for a pea-hen.
13409: 
13410: In fact, very little peacock was eaten; but there was the satisfaction
13411: of sitting at a table where peacock was served up in a remarkable
13412: manner, and of knowing that such caprices were not within reach of any
13413: but those who supped with the very wealthiest men. And it would have
13414: been rashness to speak slightingly of peacock’s flesh, or any other
13415: venerable institution, at a time when Fra Girolamo was teaching the
13416: disturbing doctrine that it was not the duty of the rich to be
13417: luxurious for the sake of the poor.
13418: 
13419: Meanwhile, in the chill obscurity that surrounded this centre of
13420: warmth, and light, and savoury odours, the lonely disowned man was
13421: walking in gradually narrowing circuits. He paused among the trees, and
13422: looked in at the windows, which made brilliant pictures against the
13423: gloom. He could hear the laughter; he could see Tito gesticulating with
13424: careless grace, and hear his voice, now alone, now mingling in the
13425: merry confusion of interlacing speeches. Baldassarre’s mind was highly
13426: strung. He was preparing himself for the moment when he could win his
13427: entrance into this brilliant company; and he had a savage satisfaction
13428: in the sight of Tito’s easy gaiety, which seemed to be preparing the
13429: unconscious victim for more effective torture.
13430: 
13431: But the men seated among the branching tapers and the flashing cups
13432: could know nothing of the pale fierce face that watched them from
13433: without. The light can be a curtain as well as the darkness.
13434: 
13435: And the talk went on with more eagerness as it became less disconnected
13436: and trivial. The sense of citizenship was just then strongly forced
13437: even on the most indifferent minds. What the overmastering Fra Girolamo
13438: was saying and prompting was really uppermost in the thoughts of every
13439: one at table; and before the stewed fish was removed, and while the
13440: favourite sweets were yet to come, his name rose to the surface of the
13441: conversation, and, in spite of Rucellai’s previous prohibition, the
13442: talk again became political. At first, while the servants remained
13443: present, it was mere gossip: what had been done in the Palazzo on the
13444: first day’s voting for the Great Council; how hot-tempered and
13445: domineering Francesco Valori was, as if he were to have everything his
13446: own way by right of his austere virtue, and how it was clear to
13447: everybody who heard Soderini’s speeches in favour of the Great Council
13448: and also heard the Frate’s sermons, that they were both kneaded in the
13449: same trough.
13450: 
13451: “My opinion is,” said Niccolò Ridolfi, “that the Frate has a longer
13452: head for public matters than Soderini or any Piagnone among them: you
13453: may depend on it that Soderini is his mouthpiece more than he is
13454: Soderini’s.”
13455: 
13456: “No, Niccolò; there I differ from you,” said Bernardo Ruccellai: “the
13457: Frate has an acute mind, and readily sees what will serve his own ends;
13458: but it is not likely that Pagolantonio Soderini, who has had long
13459: experience of affairs, and has specially studied the Venetian Council,
13460: should be much indebted to a monk for ideas on that subject. No, no;
13461: Soderini loads the cannon; though, I grant you, Fra Girolamo brings the
13462: powder and lights the match. He is master of the people, and the people
13463: are getting master of us. Ecco!”
13464: 
13465: “Well,” said Lorenzo Tornabuoni, presently, when the room was clear of
13466: servants, and nothing but wine was passing round, “whether Soderini is
13467: indebted or not, _we_ are indebted to the Frate for the general amnesty
13468: which has gone along with the scheme of the Council. We might have done
13469: without the fear of God and the reform of morals being passed by a
13470: majority of black beans; but that excellent proposition, that our
13471: Medicean heads should be allowed to remain comfortably on our
13472: shoulders, and that we should not be obliged to hand over our property
13473: in fines, has my warm approval, and it is my belief that nothing but
13474: the Frate’s predominance could have procured that for us. And you may
13475: rely on it that Fra Girolamo is as firm as a rock on that point of
13476: promoting peace. I have had an interview with him.”
13477: 
13478: There was a murmur of surprise and curiosity at the farther end of the
13479: table; but Bernardo Rucellai simply nodded, as if he knew what
13480: Tornabuoni had to say, and wished him to go on.
13481: 
13482: “Yes,” proceeded Tornabuoni, “I have been favoured with an interview in
13483: the Frate’s own cell, which, let me tell you, is not a common favour;
13484: for I have reason to believe that even Francesco Valori very seldom
13485: sees him in private. However, I think he saw me the more willingly
13486: because I was not a ready-made follower, but had to be converted. And,
13487: for my part, I see clearly enough that the only safe and wise policy
13488: for us Mediceans to pursue is to throw our strength into the scale of
13489: the Frate’s party. We are not strong enough to make head on our own
13490: behalf; and if the Frate and the popular party were upset, every one
13491: who hears me knows perfectly well what other party would be uppermost
13492: just now: Nerli, Alberti, Pazzi, and the rest—_Arrabbiati_, as somebody
13493: christened them the other day—who, instead of giving us an amnesty,
13494: would be inclined to fly at our throats like mad dogs, and not be
13495: satisfied till they had banished half of us.”
13496: 
13497: There were strong interjections of assent to this last sentence of
13498: Tornabuoni’s, as he paused and looked round a moment.
13499: 
13500: “A wise dissimulation,” he went on, “is the only course for moderate
13501: rational men in times of violent party feeling. I need hardly tell this
13502: company what are my real political attachments: I am not the only man
13503: here who has strong personal ties to the banished family; but, apart
13504: from any such ties, I agree with my more experienced friends, who are
13505: allowing me to speak for them in their presence, that the only lasting
13506: and peaceful state of things for Florence is the predominance of some
13507: single family interest. This theory of the Frate’s, that we are to have
13508: a popular government, in which every man is to strive only for the
13509: general good, and know no party names, is a theory that may do for some
13510: isle of Cristoforo Colombo’s finding, but will never do for our fine
13511: old quarrelsome Florence. A change must come before long, and with
13512: patience and caution we have every chance of determining the change in
13513: our favour. Meanwhile, the best thing we can do will be to keep the
13514: Frate’s flag flying, for if any other were to be hoisted just now it
13515: would be a black flag for us.”
13516: 
13517: “It’s true,” said Niccolò Ridolfi, in a curt decisive way. “What you
13518: say is true, Lorenzo. For my own part, I am too old for anybody to
13519: believe that I’ve changed my feathers. And there are certain of us—our
13520: old Bernardo del Nero for one—whom you would never persuade to borrow
13521: another man’s shield. But we can lie still, like sleepy old dogs; and
13522: it’s clear enough that barking would be of no use just now. As for this
13523: psalm-singing party, who vote for nothing but the glory of God, and
13524: want to make believe we can all love each other, and talk as if vice
13525: could be swept out with a besom by the Magnificent Eight, their day
13526: will not be a long one. After all the talk of scholars, there are but
13527: two sorts of government: one where men show their teeth at each other,
13528: and one where men show their tongues and lick the feet of the
13529: strongest. They’ll get their Great Council finally voted
13530: to-morrow—that’s certain enough—and they’ll think they’ve found out a
13531: new plan of government; but as sure as there’s a human skin under every
13532: lucco in the Council, their new plan will end like every other, in
13533: snarling or in licking. That’s my view of things as a plain man. Not
13534: that I consider it becoming in men of family and following, who have
13535: got others depending on their constancy and on their sticking to their
13536: colours, to go a-hunting with a fine net to catch reasons in the air,
13537: like doctors of law. I say frankly that, as the head of my family, I
13538: shall be true to my old alliances; and I have never yet seen any
13539: chalk-mark on political reasons to tell me which is true and which is
13540: false. My friend Bernardo Rucellai here is a man of reasons, I know,
13541: and I have no objection to anybody’s finding fine-spun reasons for me,
13542: so that they don’t interfere with my actions as a man of family who has
13543: faith to keep with his connections.”
13544: 
13545: “If that is an appeal to me, Niccolò,” said Bernardo Rucellai, with a
13546: formal dignity, in amusing contrast with Ridolfi’s curt and pithy ease,
13547: “I may take this opportunity of saying, that while my wishes are partly
13548: determined by long-standing personal relations, I cannot enter into any
13549: positive schemes with persons over whose actions I have no control. I
13550: myself might be content with a restoration of the old order of things;
13551: but with modifications—with important modifications. And the one point
13552: on which I wish to declare my concurrence with Lorenzo Tornabuoni is,
13553: that the best policy to be pursued by our friends is, to throw the
13554: weight of their interest into the scale of the popular party. For
13555: myself, I condescend to no dissimulation; nor do I at present see the
13556: party or the scheme that commands my full assent. In all alike there is
13557: crudity and confusion of ideas, and of all the twenty men who are my
13558: colleagues in the present crisis, there is not one with whom I do not
13559: find myself in wide disagreement.”
13560: 
13561: Niccolò Ridolfi shrugged his shoulders, and left it to some one else to
13562: take up the ball. As the wine went round the talk became more and more
13563: frank and lively, and the desire of several at once to be the chief
13564: speaker, as usual caused the company to break up into small knots of
13565: two and three.
13566: 
13567: It was a result which had been foreseen by Lorenzo Tornabuoni and
13568: Giannozzo Pucci, and they were among the first to turn aside from the
13569: highroad of general talk and enter into a special conversation with
13570: Tito, who sat between them; gradually pushing away their seats, and
13571: turning their backs on the table and wine.
13572: 
13573: “In truth, Melema,” Tornabuoni was saying at this stage, laying one
13574: hose-clad leg across the knee of the other, and caressing his ankle, “I
13575: know of no man in Florence who can serve our party better than you. You
13576: see what most of our friends are: men who can no more hide their
13577: prejudices than a dog can hide the natural tone of his bark, or else
13578: men whose political ties are so notorious, that they must always be
13579: objects of suspicion. Giannozzo here, and I, I flatter myself, are able
13580: to overcome that suspicion; we have that power of concealment and
13581: finesse, without which a rational cultivated man, instead of having any
13582: prerogative, is really at a disadvantage compared with a wild bull or a
13583: savage. But, except yourself, I know of no one else on whom we could
13584: rely for the necessary discretion.”
13585: 
13586: “Yes,” said Giannozzo Pucci, laying his hand on Tito’s shoulder, “the
13587: fact is, Tito mio, you can help us better than if you were Ulysses
13588: himself, for I am convinced that Ulysses often made himself
13589: disagreeable. To manage men one ought to have a sharp mind in a velvet
13590: sheath. And there is not a soul in Florence who could undertake a
13591: business like this journey to Rome, for example, with the same safety
13592: that you can. There is your scholarship, which may always be a pretext
13593: for such journeys; and what is better, there is your talent, which it
13594: would be harder to match than your scholarship. Niccolò Macchiavelli
13595: might have done for us if he had been on our side, but hardly so well.
13596: He is too much bitten with notions, and has not your power of
13597: fascination. All the worse for him. He has lost a great chance in life,
13598: and you have got it.”
13599: 
13600: “Yes,” said Tornabuoni, lowering his voice in a significant manner,
13601: “you have only to play your game well, Melema, and the future belongs
13602: to you. For the Medici, you may rely upon it, will keep a foot in Rome
13603: as well as in Florence, and the time may not be far-off when they will
13604: be able to make a finer career for their adherents even than they did
13605: in old days. Why shouldn’t you take orders some day? There’s a
13606: cardinal’s hat at the end of that road, and you would not be the first
13607: Greek who has worn that ornament.”
13608: 
13609: Tito laughed gaily. He was too acute not to measure Tornabuoni’s
13610: exaggerated flattery, but still the flattery had a pleasant flavour.
13611: 
13612: “My joints are not so stiff yet,” he said, “that I can’t be induced to
13613: run without such a high prize as that. I think the income of an abbey
13614: or two held ‘in commendam,’ without the trouble of getting my head
13615: shaved, would satisfy me at present.”
13616: 
13617: “I was not joking,” said Tornabuoni, with grave suavity; “I think a
13618: scholar would always be the better off for taking orders. But we’ll
13619: talk of that another time. One of the objects to be first borne in
13620: mind, is that you should win the confidence of the men who hang about
13621: San Marco; that is what Giannozzo and I shall do, but you may carry it
13622: farther than we can, because you are less observed. In that way you can
13623: get a thorough knowledge of their doings, and you will make a broader
13624: screen for your agency on our side. Nothing of course can be done
13625: before you start for Rome, because this bit of business between Piero
13626: de’ Medici and the French nobles must be effected at once. I mean when
13627: you come back, of course; I need say no more. I believe you could make
13628: yourself the pet votary of San Marco, if you liked; but you are wise
13629: enough to know that effective dissimulation is never immoderate.”
13630: 
13631: “If it were not that an adhesion to the popular side is necessary to
13632: your safety as an agent of our party, Tito mio,” said Giannozzo Pucci,
13633: who was more fraternal and less patronising in his manner than
13634: Tornabuoni, “I could have wished your skill to have been employed in
13635: another way, for which it is still better fitted. But now we must look
13636: out for some other man among us who will manage to get into the
13637: confidence of our sworn enemies, the Arrabbiati; we need to know their
13638: movements more than those of the Frate’s party, who are strong enough
13639: to play above-board. Still, it would have been a difficult thing for
13640: you, from your known relations with the Medici a little while back, and
13641: that sort of kinship your wife has with Bernardo del Nero. We must find
13642: a man who has no distinguished connections, and who has not yet taken
13643: any side.”
13644: 
13645: Tito was pushing his hair backward automatically, as his manner was,
13646: and looking straight at Pucci with a scarcely perceptible smile on his
13647: lip.
13648: 
13649: “No need to look out for any one else,” he said, promptly. “I can
13650: manage the whole business with perfect ease. I will engage to make
13651: myself the special confidant of that thick-headed Dolfo Spini, and know
13652: his projects before he knows them himself.”
13653: 
13654: Tito seldom spoke so confidently of his own powers, but he was in a
13655: state of exaltation at the sudden opening of a new path before him,
13656: where fortune seemed to have hung higher prizes than any he had thought
13657: of hitherto. Hitherto he had seen success only in the form of favour;
13658: it now flashed on him in the shape of power—of such power as is
13659: possible to talent without traditional ties, and without beliefs. Each
13660: party that thought of him as a tool might become dependent on him. His
13661: position as an alien, his indifference to the ideas or prejudices of
13662: the men amongst whom he moved, were suddenly transformed into
13663: advantages; he became newly conscious of his own adroitness in the
13664: presence of a game that he was called on to play. And all the motives
13665: which might have made Tito shrink from the triple deceit that came
13666: before him as a tempting game, had been slowly strangled in him by the
13667: successive falsities of his life.
13668: 
13669: Our lives make a moral tradition for our individual selves, as the life
13670: of mankind at large makes a moral tradition for the race; and to have
13671: once acted nobly seems a reason why we should always be noble. But Tito
13672: was feeling the effect of an opposite tradition: he had won no memories
13673: of self-conquest and perfect faithfulness from which he could have a
13674: sense of falling.
13675: 
13676: The triple colloquy went on with growing spirit till it was interrupted
13677: by a call from the table. Probably the movement came from the listeners
13678: in the party, who were afraid lest the talkers should tire themselves.
13679: At all events it was agreed that there had been enough of gravity, and
13680: Rucellai had just ordered new flasks of Montepulciano.
13681: 
13682: “How many minstrels are there among us?” he said, when there had been a
13683: general rallying round the table. “Melema, I think you are the chief:
13684: Matteo will give you the lute.”
13685: 
13686: “Ah, yes!” said Giannozzo Pucci, “lead the last chorus from Poliziano’s
13687: ‘Orfeo,’ that you have found such an excellent measure for, and we will
13688: all fall in:—
13689: 
13690: 
13691: “‘Ciascum segua, o Bacco, te:
13692: Bacco, Bacco, evoe, evoe!’”
13693: 
13694: 
13695: The servant put the lute into Tito’s hands, and then said something in
13696: an undertone to his master. A little subdued questioning and answering
13697: went on between them, while Tito touched the lute in a preluding way to
13698: the strain of the chorus, and there was a confusion of speech and
13699: musical humming all round the table. Bernardo Rucellai had said, “Wait
13700: a moment, Melema;” but the words had been unheard by Tito, who was
13701: leaning towards Pucci, and singing low to him the phrases of the
13702: Maenad-chorus. He noticed nothing until the buzz round the table
13703: suddenly ceased, and the notes of his own voice, with its soft
13704: low-toned triumph, “Evoe, evoe!” fell in startling isolation.
13705: 
13706: It was a strange moment. Baldassarre had moved round the table till he
13707: was opposite Tito, and as the hum ceased there might be seen for an
13708: instant Baldassarre’s fierce dark eyes bent on Tito’s bright smiling
13709: unconsciousness, while the low notes of triumph dropped from his lips
13710: into the silence.
13711: 
13712: Tito looked up with a slight start, and his lips turned pale, but he
13713: seemed hardly more moved than Giannozzo Pucci, who had looked up at the
13714: same moment—or even than several others round the table; for that
13715: sallow deep-lined face with the hatred in its eyes seemed a terrible
13716: apparition across the wax-lit ease and gaiety. And Tito quickly
13717: recovered some self-command. “A mad old man—he looks like it—he _is_
13718: mad!” was the instantaneous thought that brought some courage with it;
13719: for he could conjecture no inward change in Baldassarre since they had
13720: met before. He just let his eyes fall and laid the lute on the table
13721: with apparent ease; but his fingers pinched the neck of the lute hard
13722: while he governed his head and his glance sufficiently to look with an
13723: air of quiet appeal towards Bernardo Rucellai, who said at once—
13724: 
13725: “Good man, what is your business? What is the important declaration
13726: that you have to make?”
13727: 
13728: “Messer Bernardo Rucellai, I wish you and your honourable friends to
13729: know in what sort of company you are sitting. There is a traitor among
13730: you.”
13731: 
13732: There was a general movement of alarm. Every one present, except Tito,
13733: thought of political danger and not of private injury.
13734: 
13735: Baldassarre began to speak as if he were thoroughly assured of what he
13736: had to say; but, in spite of his long preparation for this moment,
13737: there was the tremor of overmastering excitement in his voice. His
13738: passion shook him. He went on, but he did not say what he had meant to
13739: say. As he fixed his eyes on Tito again the passionate words were like
13740: blows—they defied premeditation.
13741: 
13742: “There is a man among you who is a scoundrel, a liar, a robber. I was a
13743: father to him. I took him from beggary when he was a child. I reared
13744: him, I cherished him, I taught him, I made him a scholar. My head has
13745: lain hard that his might have a pillow. And he left me in slavery; he
13746: sold the gems that were mine, and when I came again, he denied me.”
13747: 
13748: The last words had been uttered with almost convulsed agitation, and
13749: Baldassarre paused, trembling. All glances were turned on Tito, who was
13750: now looking straight at Baldassarre. It was a moment of desperation
13751: that annihilated all feeling in him, except the determination to risk
13752: anything for the chance of escape. And he gathered confidence from the
13753: agitation by which Baldassarre was evidently shaken. He had ceased to
13754: pinch the neck of the lute, and had thrust his thumbs into his belt,
13755: while his lips had begun to assume a slight curl. He had never yet done
13756: an act of murderous cruelty even to the smallest animal that could
13757: utter a cry, but at that moment he would have been capable of treading
13758: the breath from a smiling child for the sake of his own safety.
13759: 
13760: “What does this mean, Melema?” said Bernardo Rucellai, in a tone of
13761: cautious surprise. He, as well as the rest of the company, felt
13762: relieved that the tenor of the accusation was not political.
13763: 
13764: “Messer Bernardo,” said Tito, “I believe this man is mad. I did not
13765: recognise him the first time he encountered me in Florence, but I know
13766: now that he is the servant who years ago accompanied me and my adoptive
13767: father to Greece, and was dismissed on account of misdemeanours. His
13768: name is Jacopo di Nola. Even at that time I believe his mind was
13769: unhinged, for, without any reason, he had conceived a strange hatred
13770: towards me; and now I am convinced that he is labouring under a mania
13771: which causes him to mistake his identity. He has already attempted my
13772: life since he has been in Florence; and I am in constant danger from
13773: him. But he is an object of pity rather than of indignation. It is too
13774: certain that my father is dead. You have only my word for it; but I
13775: must leave it to your judgment how far it is probable that a man of
13776: intellect and learning would have been lurking about in dark corners
13777: for the last month with the purpose of assassinating me; or how far it
13778: is probable that, if this man were my second father, I could have any
13779: motive for denying him. That story about my being rescued from beggary
13780: is the vision of a diseased brain. But it will be a satisfaction to me
13781: at least if you will demand from him proofs of his identity, lest any
13782: malignant person should choose to make this mad impeachment a reproach
13783: to me.”
13784: 
13785: Tito had felt more and more confidence as he went on; the lie was not
13786: so difficult when it was once begun; and as the words fell easily from
13787: his lips, they gave him a sense of power such as men feel when they
13788: have begun a muscular feat successfully. In this way he acquired
13789: boldness enough to end with a challenge for proofs.
13790: 
13791: Baldassarre, while he had been walking in the gardens and afterwards
13792: waiting in an outer room of the pavilion with the servants, had been
13793: making anew the digest of the evidence he would bring to prove his
13794: identity and Tito’s baseness, recalling the description and history of
13795: his gems, and assuring himself by rapid mental glances that he could
13796: attest his learning and his travels. It might be partly owing to this
13797: nervous strain that the new shock of rage he felt as Tito’s lie fell on
13798: his ears brought a strange bodily effect with it: a cold stream seemed
13799: to rush over him, and the last words of the speech seemed to be drowned
13800: by ringing chimes. Thought gave way to a dizzy horror, as if the earth
13801: were slipping away from under him. Every one in the room was looking at
13802: him as Tito ended, and saw that the eyes which had had such fierce
13803: intensity only a few minutes before had now a vague fear in them. He
13804: clutched the back of a seat, and was silent.
13805: 
13806: Hardly any evidence could have been more in favour of Tito’s assertion.
13807: 
13808: “Surely I have seen this man before, somewhere,” said Tornabuoni.
13809: 
13810: “Certainly you have,” said Tito, readily, in a low tone. “He is the
13811: escaped prisoner who clutched me on the steps of the Duomo. I did not
13812: recognise him then; he looks now more as he used to do, except that he
13813: has a more unmistakable air of mad imbecility.”
13814: 
13815: “I cast no doubt on your word, Melema,” said Bernardo Rucellai, with
13816: cautious gravity, “but you are right to desire some positive test of
13817: the fact.” Then turning to Baldassarre, he said, “If you are the person
13818: you claim to be, you can doubtless give some description of the gems
13819: which were your property. I myself was the purchaser of more than one
13820: gem from Messer Tito—the chief rings, I believe, in his collection. One
13821: of them is a fine sard, engraved with a subject from Homer. If, as you
13822: allege, you are a scholar, and the rightful owner of that ring, you can
13823: doubtless turn to the noted passage in Homer from which that subject is
13824: taken. Do you accept this test, Melema? or have you anything to allege
13825: against its validity? The Jacopo you speak of, was he a scholar?”
13826: 
13827: It was a fearful crisis for Tito. If he said “Yes,” his quick mind told
13828: him that he would shake the credibility of his story: if he said “No,”
13829: he risked everything on the uncertain extent of Baldassarre’s
13830: imbecility. But there was no noticeable pause before he said, “No. I
13831: accept the test.”
13832: 
13833: There was a dead silence while Rucellai moved towards the recess where
13834: the books were, and came back with the fine Florentine Homer in his
13835: hand. Baldassarre, when he was addressed, had turned his head towards
13836: the speaker, and Rucellai believed that he had understood him. But he
13837: chose to repeat what he had said, that there might be no mistake as to
13838: the test.
13839: 
13840: “The ring I possess,” he said, “is a fine sard, engraved with a subject
13841: from Homer. There was no other at all resembling it in Messer Tito’s
13842: collection. Will you turn to the passage in Homer from which that
13843: subject is taken? Seat yourself here,” he added, laying the book on the
13844: table, and pointing to his own seat while he stood beside it.
13845: 
13846: Baldassarre had so far recovered from the first confused horror
13847: produced by the sensation of rushing coldness and chiming din in the
13848: ears as to be partly aware of what was said to him: he was aware that
13849: something was being demanded from him to prove his identity, but he
13850: formed no distinct idea of the details. The sight of the book recalled
13851: the habitual longing and faint hope that he could read and understand,
13852: and he moved towards the chair immediately.
13853: 
13854: The book was open before him, and he bent his head a little towards it,
13855: while everybody watched him eagerly. He turned no leaf. His eyes
13856: wandered over the pages that lay before him, and then fixed on them a
13857: straining gaze. This lasted for two or three minutes in dead silence.
13858: Then he lifted his hands to each side of his head, and said, in a low
13859: tone of despair, “Lost, lost!”
13860: 
13861: There was something so piteous in the wandering look and the low cry,
13862: that while they confirmed the belief in his madness they raised
13863: compassion. Nay, so distinct sometimes is the working of a double
13864: consciousness within us, that Tito himself, while he triumphed in the
13865: apparent verification of his lie, wished that he had never made the lie
13866: necessary to himself—wished he had recognised his father on the
13867: steps—wished he had gone to seek him—wished everything had been
13868: different. But he had borrowed from the terrible usurer Falsehood, and
13869: the loan had mounted and mounted with the years, till he belonged to
13870: the usurer, body and soul.
13871: 
13872: The compassion excited in all the witnesses was not without its danger
13873: to Tito; for conjecture is constantly guided by feeling, and more than
13874: one person suddenly conceived that this man might have been a scholar
13875: and have lost his faculties. On the other hand, they had not present to
13876: their minds the motives which could have led Tito to the denial of his
13877: benefactor, and having no ill-will towards him, it would have been
13878: difficult to them to believe that he had been uttering the basest of
13879: lies. And the originally common type of Baldassarre’s person, coarsened
13880: by years of hardship, told as a confirmation of Tito’s lie. If
13881: Baldassarre, to begin with, could have uttered precisely the words he
13882: had premeditated, there might have been something in the form of his
13883: accusation which would have given it the stamp not only of true
13884: experience but of mental refinement. But there had been no such
13885: testimony in his impulsive agitated words: and there seemed the very
13886: opposite testimony in the rugged face and the coarse hands that
13887: trembled beside it, standing out in strong contrast in the midst of
13888: that velvet-clad, fair-handed company.
13889: 
13890: His next movement, while he was being watched in silence, told against
13891: him too. He took his hands from his head, and felt for something under
13892: his tunic. Every one guessed what that movement meant—guessed that
13893: there was a weapon at his side. Glances were interchanged; and Bernardo
13894: Rucellai said, in a quiet tone, touching Baldassarre’s shoulder—
13895: 
13896: “My friend, this is an important business of yours. You shall have all
13897: justice. Follow me into a private room.”
13898: 
13899: Baldassarre was still in that half-stunned state in which he was
13900: susceptible to any prompting, in the same way as an insect that forms
13901: no conception of what the prompting leads to. He rose from his seat,
13902: and followed Rucellai out of the room.
13903: 
13904: In two or three minutes Rucellai came back again, and said—
13905: 
13906: “He is safe under lock and key. Piero Pitti, you are one of the
13907: Magnificent Eight, what do you think of our sending Matteo to the
13908: palace for a couple of sbirri, who may escort him to the Stinche? (The
13909: largest prison in Florence.) If there is any danger in him, as I think
13910: there is, he will be safe there; and we can inquire about him
13911: to-morrow.”
13912: 
13913: Pitti assented, and the order was given.
13914: 
13915: “He is certainly an ill-looking fellow,” said Tornabuoni. “And you say
13916: he has attempted your life already, Melema?”
13917: 
13918: And the talk turned on the various forms of madness, and the fierceness
13919: of the southern blood. If the seeds of conjecture unfavourable to Tito
13920: had been planted in the mind of any one present, they were hardly
13921: strong enough to grow without the aid of much daylight and ill-will.
13922: The common-looking, wild-eyed old man, clad in serge, might have won
13923: belief without very strong evidence, if he had accused a man who was
13924: envied and disliked. As it was, the only congruous and probable view of
13925: the case seemed to be the one that sent the unpleasant accuser safely
13926: out of sight, and left the pleasant serviceable Tito just where he was
13927: before.
13928: 
13929: The subject gradually floated away, and gave place to others, till a
13930: heavy tramp, and something like the struggling of a man who was being
13931: dragged away, were heard outside. The sounds soon died out, and the
13932: interruption seemed to make the last hour’s conviviality more resolute
13933: and vigorous. Every one was willing to forget a disagreeable incident.
13934: 
13935: Tito’s heart was palpitating, and the wine tasted no better to him than
13936: if it had been blood.
13937: 
13938: To-night he had paid a heavier price than ever to make himself safe. He
13939: did not like the price, and yet it was inevitable that he should be
13940: glad of the purchase.
13941: 
13942: And after all he led the chorus. He was in a state of excitement in
13943: which oppressive sensations, and the wretched consciousness of
13944: something hateful but irrevocable, were mingled with a feeling of
13945: triumph which seemed to assert itself as the feeling that would subsist
13946: and be master of the morrow.
13947: 
13948: And it _was_ master. For on the morrow, as we saw, when he was about to
13949: start on his mission to Rome, he had the air of a man well satisfied
13950: with the world.
13951: 
13952: 
13953: 
13954: 
13955: CHAPTER XL.
13956: An Arresting Voice.
13957: 
13958: 
13959: When Romola sat down on the stone under the cypress, all things
13960: conspired to give her the sense of freedom and solitude: her escape
13961: from the accustomed walls and streets; the widening distance from her
13962: husband, who was by this time riding towards Siena, while every hour
13963: would take her farther on the opposite way; the morning stillness; the
13964: great dip of ground on the roadside making a gulf between her and the
13965: sombre calm of the mountains. For the first time in her life she felt
13966: alone in the presence of the earth and sky, with no human presence
13967: interposing and making a law for her.
13968: 
13969: Suddenly a voice close to her said—
13970: 
13971: “You are Romola de’ Bardi, the wife of Tito Melema.”
13972: 
13973: She knew the voice: it had vibrated through her more than once before;
13974: and because she knew it, she did not turn round or look up. She sat
13975: shaken by awe, and yet inwardly rebelling against the awe. It was one
13976: of those black-skirted monks who was daring to speak to her, and
13977: interfere with her privacy: that was all. And yet she was shaken, as if
13978: that destiny which men thought of as a sceptred deity had come to her,
13979: and grasped her with fingers of flesh.
13980: 
13981: “You are fleeing from Florence in disguise. I have a command from God
13982: to stop you. You are not permitted to flee.”
13983: 
13984: Romola’s anger at the intrusion mounted higher at these imperative
13985: words. She would not turn round to look at the speaker, whose examining
13986: gaze she resented. Sitting quite motionless, she said—
13987: 
13988: “What right have you to speak to me, or to hinder me?”
13989: 
13990: “The right of a messenger. You have put on a religious garb, and you
13991: have no religious purpose. You have sought the garb as a disguise. But
13992: you were not suffered to pass me without being discerned. It was
13993: declared to me who you were: it is declared to me that you are seeking
13994: to escape from the lot God has laid upon you. You wish your true name
13995: and your true place in life to be hidden, that you may choose for
13996: yourself a new name and a new place, and have no rule but your own
13997: will. And I have a command to call you back. My daughter, you must
13998: return to your place.”
13999: 
14000: Romola’s mind rose in stronger rebellion with every sentence. She was
14001: the more determined not to show any sign of submission, because the
14002: consciousness of being inwardly shaken made her dread lest she should
14003: fall into irresolution. She spoke with more irritation than before.
14004: 
14005: “I will not return. I acknowledge no right of priests and monks to
14006: interfere with my actions. You have no power over me.”
14007: 
14008: “I know—I know you have been brought up in scorn of obedience. But it
14009: is not the poor monk who claims to interfere with you: it is the truth
14010: that commands you. And you cannot escape it. Either you must obey it,
14011: and it will lead you; or you must disobey it, and it will hang on you
14012: with the weight of a chain which you will drag for ever. But you will
14013: obey it, my daughter. Your old servant will return to you with the
14014: mules; my companion is gone to fetch him; and you will go back to
14015: Florence.”
14016: 
14017: She started up with anger in her eyes, and faced the speaker. It was
14018: Fra Girolamo: she knew that well enough before. She was nearly as tall
14019: as he was, and their faces were almost on a level. She had started up
14020: with defiant words ready to burst from her lips, but they fell back
14021: again without utterance. She had met Fra Girolamo’s calm glance, and
14022: the impression from it was so new to her, that her anger sank ashamed
14023: as something irrelevant.
14024: 
14025: There was nothing transcendent in Savonarola’s face. It was not
14026: beautiful. It was strong-featured, and owed all its refinement to
14027: habits of mind and rigid discipline of the body. The source of the
14028: impression his glance produced on Romola was the sense it conveyed to
14029: her of interest in her and care for her apart from any personal
14030: feeling. It was the first time she had encountered a gaze in which
14031: simple human fellowship expressed itself as a strongly-felt bond. Such
14032: a glance is half the vocation of the priest or spiritual guide of men,
14033: and Romola felt it impossible again to question his authority to speak
14034: to her. She stood silent, looking at him. And he spoke again.
14035: 
14036: “You assert your freedom proudly, my daughter. But who is so base as
14037: the debtor that thinks himself free?”
14038: 
14039: There was a sting in those words, and Romola’s countenance changed as
14040: if a subtle pale flash had gone over it.
14041: 
14042: “And you are flying from your debts: the debt of a Florentine woman;
14043: the debt of a wife. You are turning your back on the lot that has been
14044: appointed for you—you are going to choose another. But can man or woman
14045: choose duties? No more than they can choose their birthplace or their
14046: father and mother. My daughter, you are fleeing from the presence of
14047: God into the wilderness.”
14048: 
14049: As the anger melted from Romola’s mind, it had given place to a new
14050: presentiment of the strength there might be in submission, if this man,
14051: at whom she was beginning to look with a vague reverence, had some
14052: valid law to show her. But no—it was impossible; he could not know what
14053: determined her. Yet she could not again simply refuse to be guided; she
14054: was constrained to plead; and in her new need to be reverent while she
14055: resisted, the title which she had never given him before came to her
14056: lips without forethought, “My father, you cannot know the reasons which
14057: compel me to go. None can know them but myself. None can judge for me.
14058: I have been driven by great sorrow. I am resolved to go.”
14059: 
14060: “I know enough, my daughter: my mind has been so far illuminated
14061: concerning you, that I know enough. You are not happy in your married
14062: life; but I am not a confessor, and I seek to know nothing that should
14063: be reserved for the seal of confession. I have a divine warrant to stop
14064: you, which does not depend on such knowledge. You were warned by a
14065: message from heaven, delivered in my presence—you were warned before
14066: marriage, when you might still have lawfully chosen to be free from the
14067: marriage-bond. But you chose the bond; and in wilfully breaking it—I
14068: speak to you as a pagan, if the holy mystery of matrimony is not sacred
14069: to you—you are breaking a pledge. Of what wrongs will you complain, my
14070: daughter, when you yourself are committing one of the greatest wrongs a
14071: woman and a citizen can be guilty of—withdrawing in secrecy and
14072: disguise from a pledge which you have given in the face of God and your
14073: fellow-men? Of what wrongs will you complain, when you yourself are
14074: breaking the simplest law that lies at the foundation of the trust
14075: which binds man to man—faithfulness to the spoken word? This, then, is
14076: the wisdom you have gained by scorning the mysteries of the Church?—not
14077: to see the bare duty of integrity, where the Church would have taught
14078: you to see, not integrity only, but religion.”
14079: 
14080: The blood had rushed to Romola’s face, and she shrank as if she had
14081: been stricken. “I would not have put on a disguise,” she began; but she
14082: could not go on,—she was too much shaken by the suggestion in the
14083: Frate’s words of a possible affinity between her own conduct and
14084: Tito’s.
14085: 
14086: “And to break that pledge you fly from Florence: Florence, where there
14087: are the only men and women in the world to whom you owe the debt of a
14088: fellow-citizen.”
14089: 
14090: “I should never have quitted Florence,” said Romola, tremulously, “as
14091: long as there was any hope of my fulfilling a duty to my father there.”
14092: 
14093: “And do you own no tie but that of a child to her father in the flesh?
14094: Your life has been spent in blindness, my daughter. You have lived with
14095: those who sit on a hill aloof, and look down on the life of their
14096: fellow-men. I know their vain discourse. It is of what has been in the
14097: times which they fill with their own fancied wisdom, while they scorn
14098: God’s work in the present. And doubtless you were taught how there were
14099: pagan women who felt what it was to live for the Republic; yet you have
14100: never felt that you, a Florentine woman, should live for Florence. If
14101: your own people are wearing a yoke, will you slip from under it,
14102: instead of struggling with them to lighten it? There is hunger and
14103: misery in our streets, yet you say, ‘I care not; I have my own sorrows;
14104: I will go away, if peradventure I can ease them.’ The servants of God
14105: are struggling after a law of justice, peace, and charity, that the
14106: hundred thousand citizens among whom you were born may be governed
14107: righteously; but you think no more of this than if you were a bird,
14108: that may spread its wings and fly whither it will in search of food to
14109: its liking. And yet you have scorned the teaching of the Church, my
14110: daughter. As if you, a wilful wanderer, following your own blind
14111: choice, were not below the humblest Florentine woman who stretches
14112: forth her hands with her own people, and craves a blessing for them;
14113: and feels a close sisterhood with the neighbour who kneels beside her
14114: and is not of her own blood; and thinks of the mighty purpose that God
14115: has for Florence; and waits and endures because the promised work is
14116: great, and she feels herself little.”
14117: 
14118: “I was not going away to ease and self-indulgence,” said Romola,
14119: raising her head again, with a prompting to vindicate herself. “I was
14120: going away to hardship. I expect no joy: it is gone from my life.”
14121: 
14122: “You are seeking your own will, my daughter. You are seeking some good
14123: other than the law you are bound to obey. But how will you find good?
14124: It is not a thing of choice: it is a river that flows from the foot of
14125: the Invisible Throne, and flows by the path of obedience. I say again,
14126: man cannot choose his duties. You may choose to forsake your duties,
14127: and choose not to have the sorrow they bring. But you will go forth;
14128: and what will you find, my daughter? Sorrow without duty—bitter herbs,
14129: and no bread with them.”
14130: 
14131: “But if you knew,” said Romola, clasping her hands and pressing them
14132: tight, as she looked pleadingly at Fra Girolamo; “if you knew what it
14133: was to me—how impossible it seemed to me to bear it.”
14134: 
14135: “My daughter,” he said, pointing to the cord round Romola’s neck, “you
14136: carry something within your mantle; draw it forth, and look at it.”
14137: 
14138: Romola gave a slight start, but her impulse now was to do just what
14139: Savonarola told her. Her self-doubt was grappled by a stronger will and
14140: a stronger conviction than her own. She drew forth the crucifix. Still
14141: pointing towards it, he said—
14142: 
14143: “There, my daughter, is the image of a Supreme Offering, made by
14144: Supreme Love, because the need of man was great.”
14145: 
14146: He paused, and she held the crucifix trembling—trembling under a sudden
14147: impression of the wide distance between her present and her past self.
14148: What a length of road she had travelled through since she first took
14149: that crucifix from the Frate’s hands! Had life as many secrets before
14150: her still as it had for her then, in her young blindness? It was a
14151: thought that helped all other subduing influences; and at the sound of
14152: Fra Girolamo’s voice again, Romola, with a quick involuntary movement,
14153: pressed the crucifix against her mantle and looked at him with more
14154: submission than before.
14155: 
14156: “Conform your life to that image, my daughter; make your sorrow an
14157: offering: and when the fire of Divine charity burns within you, and you
14158: behold the need of your fellow-men by the light of that flame, you will
14159: not call your offering great. You have carried yourself proudly, as one
14160: who held herself not of common blood or of common thoughts; but you
14161: have been as one unborn to the true life of man. What! you say your
14162: love for your father no longer tells you to stay in Florence? Then,
14163: since that tie is snapped, you are without a law, without religion: you
14164: are no better than a beast of the field when she is robbed of her
14165: young. If the yearning of a fleshly love is gone, you are without love,
14166: without obligation. See, then, my daughter, how you are below the life
14167: of the believer who worships that image of the Supreme Offering, and
14168: feels the glow of a common life with the lost multitude for whom that
14169: offering was made, and beholds the history of the world as the history
14170: of a great redemption in which he is himself a fellow-worker, in his
14171: own place and among his own people! If you held that faith, my beloved
14172: daughter, you would not be a wanderer flying from suffering, and
14173: blindly seeking the good of a freedom which is lawlessness. You would
14174: feel that Florence was the home of your soul as well as your
14175: birthplace, because you would see the work that was given you to do
14176: there. If you forsake your place, who will fill it? You ought to be in
14177: your place now, helping in the great work by which God will purify
14178: Florence, and raise it to be the guide of the nations. What! the earth
14179: is full of iniquity—full of groans—the light is still struggling with a
14180: mighty darkness, and you say, ‘I cannot bear my bonds; I will burst
14181: them asunder; I will go where no man claims me’? My daughter, every
14182: bond of your life is a debt: the right lies in the payment of that
14183: debt; it can lie nowhere else. In vain will you wander over the earth;
14184: you will be wandering for ever away from the right.”
14185: 
14186: Romola was inwardly struggling with strong forces: that immense
14187: personal influence of Savonarola, which came from the energy of his
14188: emotions and beliefs: and her consciousness, surmounting all prejudice,
14189: that his words implied a higher law than any she had yet obeyed. But
14190: the resisting thoughts were not yet overborne.
14191: 
14192: “How, then, could Dino be right? He broke ties. He forsook his place.”
14193: 
14194: “That was a special vocation. He was constrained to depart, else he
14195: could not have attained the higher life. It would have been stifled
14196: within him.”
14197: 
14198: “And I too,” said Romola, raising her hands to her brow, and speaking
14199: in a tone of anguish, as if she were being dragged to some torture.
14200: “Father, you may be wrong.”
14201: 
14202: “Ask your conscience, my daughter. You have no vocation such as your
14203: brother had. You are a wife. You seek to break your ties in self-will
14204: and anger, not because the higher life calls upon you to renounce them.
14205: The higher life begins for us, my daughter, when we renounce our own
14206: will to bow before a Divine law. That seems hard to you. It is the
14207: portal of wisdom, and freedom, and blessedness. And the symbol of it
14208: hangs before you. That wisdom is the religion of the Cross. And you
14209: stand aloof from it: you are a pagan; you have been taught to say, ‘I
14210: am as the wise men who lived before the time when the Jew of Nazareth
14211: was crucified.’ And that is your wisdom! To be as the dead whose eyes
14212: are closed, and whose ear is deaf to the work of God that has been
14213: since their time. What has your dead wisdom done for you, my daughter?
14214: It has left you without a heart for the neighbours among whom you
14215: dwell, without care for the great work by which Florence is to be
14216: regenerated and the world made holy; it has left you without a share in
14217: the Divine life which quenches the sense of suffering Self in the
14218: ardours of an ever-growing love. And now, when the sword has pierced
14219: your soul, you say, ‘I will go away; I cannot bear my sorrow.’ And you
14220: think nothing of the sorrow and the wrong that are within the walls of
14221: the city where you dwell: you would leave your place empty, when it
14222: ought to be filled with your pity and your labour. If there is
14223: wickedness in the streets, your steps should shine with the light of
14224: purity; if there is a cry of anguish, you, my daughter, because you
14225: know the meaning of the cry, should be there to still it. My beloved
14226: daughter, sorrow has come to teach you a new worship: the sign of it
14227: hangs before you.”
14228: 
14229: Romola’s mind was still torn by conflict. She foresaw that she should
14230: obey Savonarola and go back: his words had come to her as if they were
14231: an interpretation of that revulsion from self-satisfied ease, and of
14232: that new fellowship with suffering, which had already been awakened in
14233: her. His arresting voice had brought a new condition into her life,
14234: which made it seem impossible to her that she could go on her way as if
14235: she had not heard it; yet she shrank as one who sees the path she must
14236: take, but sees, too, that the hot lava lies there. And the instinctive
14237: shrinking from a return to her husband brought doubts. She turned away
14238: her eyes from Fra Girolamo, and stood for a minute or two with her
14239: hands hanging clasped before her, like a statue. At last she spoke, as
14240: if the words were being wrung from her, still looking on the ground.
14241: 
14242: “My husband... he is not... my love is gone!”
14243: 
14244: “My daughter, there is the bond of a higher love. Marriage is not
14245: carnal only, made for selfish delight. See what that thought leads you
14246: to! It leads you to wander away in a false garb from all the
14247: obligations of your place and name. That would not have been, if you
14248: had learned that it is a sacramental vow, from which none but God can
14249: release you. My daughter, your life is not as a grain of sand, to be
14250: blown by the winds; it is a thing of flesh and blood, that dies if it
14251: be sundered. Your husband is not a malefactor?”
14252: 
14253: Romola started. “Heaven forbid! No; I accuse him of nothing.”
14254: 
14255: “I did not suppose he was a malefactor. I meant, that if he were a
14256: malefactor, your place would be in the prison beside him. My daughter,
14257: if the cross comes to you as a wife, you must carry it as a wife. You
14258: may say, ‘I will forsake my husband,’ but you cannot cease to be a
14259: wife.”
14260: 
14261: “Yet if—oh, how could I bear—” Romola had involuntarily begun to say
14262: something which she sought to banish from her mind again.
14263: 
14264: “Make your marriage-sorrows an offering too, my daughter: an offering
14265: to the great work by which sin and sorrow are being made to cease. The
14266: end is sure, and is already beginning. Here in Florence it is
14267: beginning, and the eyes of faith behold it. And it may be our
14268: blessedness to die for it: to die daily by the crucifixion of our
14269: selfish will—to die at last by laying our bodies on the altar. My
14270: daughter, you are a child of Florence; fulfil the duties of that great
14271: inheritance. Live for Florence—for your own people, whom God is
14272: preparing to bless the earth. Bear the anguish and the smart. The iron
14273: is sharp—I know, I know—it rends the tender flesh. The draught is
14274: bitterness on the lips. But there is rapture in the cup—there is the
14275: vision which makes all life below it dross for ever. Come, my daughter,
14276: come back to your place!”
14277: 
14278: While Savonarola spoke with growing intensity, his arms tightly folded
14279: before him still, as they had been from the first, but his face alight
14280: as from an inward flame, Romola felt herself surrounded and possessed
14281: by the glow of his passionate faith. The chill doubts all melted away;
14282: she was subdued by the sense of something unspeakably great to which
14283: she was being called by a strong being who roused a new strength within
14284: herself. In a voice that was like a low, prayerful cry, she said—
14285: 
14286: “Father, I will be guided. Teach me! I will go back.”
14287: 
14288: Almost unconsciously she sank on her knees. Savonarola stretched out
14289: his hands over her; but feeling would no longer pass through the
14290: channel of speech, and he was silent.
14291: 
14292: 
14293: 
14294: 
14295: CHAPTER XLI.
14296: Coming Back.
14297: 
14298: 
14299: “Rise, my daughter,” said Fra Girolamo at last. “Your servant is
14300: waiting not far off with the mules. It is time that I should go onward
14301: to Florence.”
14302: 
14303: Romola arose from her knees. That silent attitude had been a sort of
14304: sacrament to her, confirming the state of yearning passivity on which
14305: she had newly entered. By the one act of renouncing her resolve to quit
14306: her husband, her will seemed so utterly bruised that she felt the need
14307: of direction even in small things. She lifted up the edge of her cowl,
14308: and saw Maso and the second Dominican standing with their backs towards
14309: her on the edge of the hill about ten yards from her; but she looked at
14310: Savonarola again without speaking, as if the order to Maso to turn back
14311: must come from him and not from her.
14312: 
14313: “I will go and call them,” he said, answering her glance of appeal;
14314: “and I will recommend you, my daughter, to the Brother who is with me.
14315: You desire to put yourself under guidance, and to learn that wisdom
14316: which has been hitherto as foolishness to you. A chief gate of that
14317: wisdom is the sacrament of confession. You will need a confessor, my
14318: daughter, and I desire to put you under the care of Fra Salvestro, one
14319: of the brethren of San Marco, in whom I most confide.”
14320: 
14321: “I would rather have no guidance but yours, father,” said Romola,
14322: looking anxious.
14323: 
14324: “My daughter, I do not act as a confessor. The vocation I have
14325: withdraws me from offices that would force me into frequent contact
14326: with the laity, and interfere with my special duties.”
14327: 
14328: “Then shall I not be able to speak to you in private? if I waver, if—”
14329: Romola broke off from rising agitation. She felt a sudden alarm lest
14330: her new strength in renunciation should vanish if the immediate
14331: personal influence of Savonarola vanished.
14332: 
14333: “My daughter, if your soul has need of the word in private from my
14334: lips, you will let me know it through Fra Salvestro, and I will see you
14335: in the sacristy or in the choir of San Marco. And I will not cease to
14336: watch over you. I will instruct my brother concerning you, that he may
14337: guide you into that path of labour for the suffering and the hungry to
14338: which you are called as a daughter of Florence in these times of hard
14339: need. I desire to behold you among the feebler and more ignorant
14340: sisters as the apple-tree among the trees of the forest, so that your
14341: fairness and all natural gifts may be but as a lamp through which the
14342: Divine light shines the more purely. I will go now and call your
14343: servant.”
14344: 
14345: When Maso had been sent a little way in advance, Fra Salvestro came
14346: forward, and Savonarola led Romola towards him. She had beforehand felt
14347: an inward shrinking from a new guide who was a total stranger to her:
14348: but to have resisted Savonarola’s advice would have been to assume an
14349: attitude of independence at a moment when all her strength must be
14350: drawn from the renunciation of independence. And the whole bent of her
14351: mind now was towards doing what was painful rather than what was easy.
14352: She bowed reverently to Fra Salvestro before looking directly at him;
14353: but when she raised her head and saw him fully, her reluctance became a
14354: palpitating doubt. There are men whose presence infuses trust and
14355: reverence; there are others to whom we have need to carry our trust and
14356: reverence ready-made; and that difference flashed on Romola as she
14357: ceased to have Savonarola before her, and saw in his stead Fra
14358: Salvestro Maruffi. It was not that there was anything manifestly
14359: repulsive in Fra Salvestro’s face and manner, any air of hypocrisy, any
14360: tinge of coarseness; his face was handsomer than Fra Girolamo’s, his
14361: person a little taller. He was the long-accepted confessor of many
14362: among the chief personages in Florence, and had therefore had large
14363: experience as a spiritual director. But his face had the vacillating
14364: expression of a mind unable to concentrate itself strongly in the
14365: channel of one great emotion or belief—an expression which is fatal to
14366: influence over an ardent nature like Romola’s. Such an expression is
14367: not the stamp of insincerity; it is the stamp simply of a shallow soul,
14368: which will often be found sincerely striving to fill a high vocation,
14369: sincerely composing its countenance to the utterance of sublime
14370: formulas, but finding the muscles twitch or relax in spite of belief,
14371: as prose insists on coming instead of poetry to the man who has not the
14372: divine frenzy. Fra Salvestro had a peculiar liability to visions,
14373: dependent apparently on a constitution given to somnambulism.
14374: Savonarola believed in the supernatural character of these visions,
14375: while Fra Salvestro himself had originally resisted such an
14376: interpretation of them, and had even rebuked Savonarola for his
14377: prophetic preaching: another proof, if one were wanted, that the
14378: relative greatness of men is not to be gauged by their tendency to
14379: disbelieve the superstitions of their age. For of these two there can
14380: be no question which was the great man and which the small.
14381: 
14382: The difference between them was measured very accurately by the change
14383: in Romola’s feeling as Fra Salvestro began to address her in words of
14384: exhortation and encouragement. After her first angry resistance of
14385: Savonarola had passed away, she had lost all remembrance of the old
14386: dread lest any influence should drag her within the circle of
14387: fanaticism and sour monkish piety. But now again, the chill breath of
14388: that dread stole over her. It could have no decisive effect against the
14389: impetus her mind had just received; it was only like the closing of the
14390: grey clouds over the sunrise, which made her returning path monotonous
14391: and sombre.
14392: 
14393: And perhaps of all sombre paths that on which we go back after treading
14394: it with a strong resolution is the one that most severely tests the
14395: fervour of renunciation. As they re-entered the city gates the light
14396: snow-flakes fell about them; and as the grey sister walked hastily
14397: homeward from the Piazza di San Marco, and trod the bridge again, and
14398: turned in at the large door in the Via de’ Bardi, her footsteps were
14399: marked darkly on the thin carpet of snow, and her cowl fell laden and
14400: damp about her face.
14401: 
14402: She went up to her room, threw off her serge, destroyed the parting
14403: letters, replaced all her precious trifles, unbound her hair, and put
14404: on her usual black dress. Instead of taking a long exciting journey,
14405: she was to sit down in her usual place. The snow fell against the
14406: windows, and she was alone.
14407: 
14408: She felt the dreariness, yet her courage was high, like that of a
14409: seeker who has come on new signs of gold. She was going to thread life
14410: by a fresh clue. She had thrown all the energy of her will into
14411: renunciation. The empty tabernacle remained locked, and she placed
14412: Dino’s crucifix outside it.
14413: 
14414: Nothing broke the outward monotony of her solitary home, till the night
14415: came like a white ghost at the windows. Yet it was the most memorable
14416: Christmas-eve in her life to Romola, this of 1494.
14417: 
14418: 
14419: 
14420: 
14421: CHAPTER XLII.
14422: Romola in her Place.
14423: 
14424: 
14425: It was the thirtieth of October 1496. The sky that morning was clear
14426: enough, and there was a pleasant autumnal breeze. But the Florentines
14427: just then thought very little about the land breezes: they were
14428: thinking of the gales at sea, which seemed to be uniting with all other
14429: powers to disprove the Frate’s declaration that Heaven took special
14430: care of Florence.
14431: 
14432: For those terrible gales had driven away from the coast of Leghorn
14433: certain ships from Marseilles, freighted with soldiery and corn; and
14434: Florence was in the direst need, first of food, and secondly of
14435: fighting men. Pale Famine was in her streets, and her territory was
14436: threatened on all its borders.
14437: 
14438: For the French king, that new Charlemagne, who had entered Italy in
14439: anticipatory triumph, and had conquered Naples without the least
14440: trouble, had gone away again fifteen months ago, and was even, it was
14441: feared, in his grief for the loss of a new-born son, losing the languid
14442: intention of coming back again to redress grievances and set the Church
14443: in order. A league had been formed against him—a Holy League, with Pope
14444: Borgia at its head—to “drive out the barbarians,” who still garrisoned
14445: the fortress of Naples. That had a patriotic sound; but, looked at more
14446: closely, the Holy League seemed very much like an agreement among
14447: certain wolves to drive away all other wolves, and then to see which
14448: among themselves could snatch the largest share of the prey. And there
14449: was a general disposition to regard Florence not as a fellow-wolf, but
14450: rather as a desirable carcass. Florence, therefore, of all the chief
14451: Italian States, had alone declined to join the League, adhering still
14452: to the French alliance.
14453: 
14454: She had declined at her peril. At this moment Pisa, still fighting
14455: savagely for liberty, was being encouraged not only by strong forces
14456: from Venice and Milan, but by the presence of the German Emperor
14457: Maximilian, who had been invited by the League, and was joining the
14458: Pisans with such troops as he had in the attempt to get possession of
14459: Leghorn, while the coast was invested by Venetian and Genoese ships.
14460: And if Leghorn should fall into the hands of the enemy, woe to
14461: Florence! For if that one outlet towards the sea were closed, hedged in
14462: as she was on the land by the bitter ill-will of the Pope and the
14463: jealousy of smaller States, how could succours reach her?
14464: 
14465: The government of Florence had shown a great heart in this urgent need,
14466: meeting losses and defeats with vigorous effort, raising fresh money,
14467: raising fresh soldiers, but not neglecting the good old method of
14468: Italian defence—conciliatory embassies. And while the scarcity of food
14469: was every day becoming greater, they had resolved, in opposition to old
14470: precedent, not to shut out the starving country people, and the
14471: mendicants driven from the gates of other cities, who came flocking to
14472: Florence like birds from a land of snow.
14473: 
14474: These acts of a government in which the disciples of Savonarola made
14475: the strongest element were not allowed to pass without criticism. The
14476: disaffected were plentiful, and they saw clearly that the government
14477: took the worst course for the public welfare. Florence ought to join
14478: the League and make common cause with the other great Italian States,
14479: instead of drawing down their hostility by a futile adherence to a
14480: foreign ally. Florence ought to take care of her own citizens, instead
14481: of opening her gates to famine and pestilence in the shape of starving
14482: contadini and alien mendicants.
14483: 
14484: Every day the distress became sharper: every day the murmurs became
14485: louder. And, to crown the difficulties of the government, for a month
14486: and more—in obedience to a mandate from Rome—Fra Girolamo had ceased to
14487: preach. But on the arrival of the terrible news that the ships from
14488: Marseilles had been driven back, and that no corn was coming, the need
14489: for the voice that could infuse faith and patience into the people
14490: became too imperative to be resisted. In defiance of the Papal mandate
14491: the Signoria requested Savonarola to preach. And two days ago he had
14492: mounted again the pulpit of the Duomo, and had told the people only to
14493: wait and be steadfast and the divine help would certainly come.
14494: 
14495: It was a bold sermon: he consented to have his frock stripped off him
14496: if, when Florence persevered in fulfilling the duties of piety and
14497: citizenship, God did not come to her rescue.
14498: 
14499: Yet at present, on this morning of the thirtieth, there were no signs
14500: of rescue. Perhaps if the precious Tabernacle of the Madonna dell’
14501: Impruneta were brought into Florence and carried in devout procession
14502: to the Duomo, that Mother, rich in sorrows and therefore in mercy,
14503: would plead for the suffering city? For a century and a half there were
14504: records how the Florentines, suffering from drought, or flood, or
14505: famine, or pestilence, or the threat of wars, had fetched the potent
14506: image within their walls, and had found deliverance. And grateful
14507: honour had been done to her and her ancient church of L’Impruneta; the
14508: high house of Buondelmonti, patrons of the church, had to guard her
14509: hidden image with bare sword; wealth had been poured out for prayers at
14510: her shrine, for chantings, and chapels, and ever-burning lights; and
14511: lands had been added, till there was much quarrelling for the privilege
14512: of serving her. The Florentines were deeply convinced of her
14513: graciousness to them, so that the sight of her tabernacle within their
14514: walls was like the parting of the cloud, and the proverb ran, that the
14515: Florentines had a Madonna who would do what they pleased.
14516: 
14517: When were they in more need of her pleading pity than now? And already,
14518: the evening before, the tabernacle containing the miraculous hidden
14519: image had been brought with high and reverend escort from L’Impruneta,
14520: the privileged spot six miles beyond the gate of San Piero that looks
14521: towards Rome, and had been deposited in the church of San Gaggio,
14522: outside the gate, whence it was to be fetched in solemn procession by
14523: all the fraternities, trades, and authorities of Florence.
14524: 
14525: But the Pitying Mother had not yet entered within the walls, and the
14526: morning arose on unchanged misery and despondency. Pestilence was
14527: hovering in the track of famine. Not only the hospitals were full, but
14528: the courtyards of private houses had been turned into refuges and
14529: infirmaries; and still there was unsheltered want. And early this
14530: morning, as usual, members of the various fraternities who made it part
14531: of their duty to bury the unfriended dead, were bearing away the
14532: corpses that had sunk by the wayside. As usual, sweet womanly forms,
14533: with the refined air and carriage of the well-born, but in the plainest
14534: garb, were moving about the streets on their daily errands of tending
14535: the sick and relieving the hungry.
14536: 
14537: One of these forms was easily distinguishable as Romola de’ Bardi. Clad
14538: in the simplest garment of black serge, with a plain piece of black
14539: drapery drawn over her head, so as to hide all her hair, except the
14540: bands of gold that rippled apart on her brow, she was advancing from
14541: the Ponte Vecchio towards the Por’ Santa Maria—the street in a direct
14542: line with the bridge—when she found her way obstructed by the pausing
14543: of a bier, which was being carried by members of the company of San
14544: Jacopo del Popolo, in search for the unburied dead. The brethren at the
14545: head of the bier were stooping to examine something, while a group of
14546: idle workmen, with features paled and sharpened by hunger, were
14547: clustering around and all talking at once.
14548: 
14549: “He’s dead, I tell you! Messer Domeneddio has loved him well enough to
14550: take him.”
14551: 
14552: “Ah, and it would be well for us all if we could have our legs
14553: stretched out and go with our heads two or three _bracci_ foremost!
14554: It’s ill standing upright with hunger to prop you.”
14555: 
14556: “Well, well, he’s an old fellow. Death has got a poor bargain. Life’s
14557: had the best of him.”
14558: 
14559: “And no Florentine, ten to one! A beggar turned out of Siena. San
14560: Giovanni defend us! They’ve no need of soldiers to fight us. They send
14561: us an army of starving men.”
14562: 
14563: “No, no! This man is one of the prisoners turned out of the Stinche. I
14564: know by the grey patch where the prison badge was.”
14565: 
14566: “Keep quiet! Lend a hand! Don’t you see the brethren are going to lift
14567: him on the bier?”
14568: 
14569: “It’s likely he’s alive enough if he could only look it. The soul may
14570: be inside him if it had only a drop of _vernaccia_ to warm it.”
14571: 
14572: “In truth, I think he is not dead,” said one of the brethren, when they
14573: had lifted him on the bier. “He has perhaps only sunk down for want of
14574: food.”
14575: 
14576: “Let me try to give him some wine,” said Romola, coming forward. She
14577: loosened the small flask which she carried at her belt, and, leaning
14578: towards the prostrate body, with a deft hand she applied a small ivory
14579: implement between the teeth, and poured into the mouth a few drops of
14580: wine. The stimulus acted: the wine was evidently swallowed. She poured
14581: more, till the head was moved a little towards her, and the eyes of the
14582: old man opened full upon her with the vague look of returning
14583: consciousness.
14584: 
14585: Then for the first time a sense of complete recognition came over
14586: Romola. Those wild dark eyes opening in the sallow deep-lined face,
14587: with the white beard, which was now long again, were like an
14588: unmistakable signature to a remembered handwriting. The light of two
14589: summers had not made that image any fainter in Romola’s memory: the
14590: image of the escaped prisoner, whom she had seen in the Duomo the day
14591: when Tito first wore the armour—at whose grasp Tito was paled with
14592: terror in the strange sketch she had seen in Piero’s studio. A wretched
14593: tremor and palpitation seized her. Now at last, perhaps, she was going
14594: to know some secret which might be more bitter than all that had gone
14595: before. She felt an impulse to dart away as from a sight of horror; and
14596: again, a more imperious need to keep close by the side of this old man
14597: whom, the divination of keen feeling told her, her husband had injured.
14598: In the very instant of this conflict she still leaned towards him and
14599: kept her right-hand ready to administer more wine, while her left was
14600: passed under his neck. Her hands trembled, but their habit of soothing
14601: helpfulness would have served to guide them without the direction of
14602: her thought.
14603: 
14604: Baldassarre was looking at _her_ for the first time. The close
14605: seclusion in which Romola’s trouble had kept her in the weeks preceding
14606: her flight and his arrest, had denied him the opportunity he had sought
14607: of seeing the Wife who lived in the Via de’ Bardi: and at this moment
14608: the descriptions he had heard of the fair golden-haired woman were all
14609: gone, like yesterday’s waves.
14610: 
14611: “Will it not be well to carry him to the steps of San Stefano?” said
14612: Romola. “We shall cease then to stop up the street, and you can go on
14613: your way with your bier.”
14614: 
14615: They had only to move onward for about thirty yards before reaching the
14616: steps of San Stefano, and by this time Baldassarre was able himself to
14617: make some efforts towards getting off the bier, and propping himself on
14618: the steps against the church-doorway. The charitable brethren passed
14619: on, but the group of interested spectators, who had nothing to do and
14620: much to say, had considerably increased. The feeling towards the old
14621: man was not so entirely friendly now it was quite certain that he was
14622: alive, but the respect inspired by Romola’s presence caused the passing
14623: remarks to be made in a rather more subdued tone than before.
14624: 
14625: “Ah, they gave him his morsel every day in the Stinche—that’s why he
14626: can’t do so well without it. You and I, Cecco, know better what it is
14627: to go to bed fasting.”
14628: 
14629: “_Gnaffè_! that’s why the Magnificent Eight have turned out some of the
14630: prisoners, that they may shelter honest people instead. But if every
14631: thief is to be brought to life with good wine and wheaten bread, we
14632: Ciompi had better go and fill ourselves in Arno while the water’s
14633: plenty.”
14634: 
14635: Romola had seated herself on the steps by Baldassarre, and was saying,
14636: “Can you eat a little bread now? perhaps by-and-by you will be able, if
14637: I leave it with you. I must go on, because I have promised to be at the
14638: hospital. But I will come back if you will wait here, and then I will
14639: take you to some shelter. Do you understand? Will you wait? I will come
14640: back.”
14641: 
14642: He looked dreamily at her, and repeated her words, “come back.” It was
14643: no wonder that his mind was enfeebled by his bodily exhaustion, but she
14644: hoped that he apprehended her meaning. She opened her basket, which was
14645: filled with pieces of soft bread, and put one of the pieces into his
14646: hand.
14647: 
14648: “Do you keep your bread for those that can’t swallow, madonna?” said a
14649: rough-looking fellow, in a red night-cap, who had elbowed his way into
14650: the inmost circle of spectators—a circle that was pressing rather
14651: closely on Romola.
14652: 
14653: “If anybody isn’t hungry,” said another, “I say, let him alone. He’s
14654: better off than people who’ve got craving stomachs and no breakfast.”
14655: 
14656: “Yes, indeed; if a man’s a mind to die, it’s a time to encourage him,
14657: instead of making him come back to life against his will. Dead men want
14658: no trencher.”
14659: 
14660: “Oh, you don’t understand the Frate’s charity,” said a young man in an
14661: excellent cloth tunic, whose face showed no signs of want. “The Frate
14662: has been preaching to the birds, like Saint Anthony, and he’s been
14663: telling the hawks they were made to feed the sparrows, as every good
14664: Florentine citizen was made to feed six starving beggar-men from Arezzo
14665: or Bologna. Madonna, there, is a pious Piagnone: she’s not going to
14666: throw away her good bread on honest citizens who’ve got all the Frate’s
14667: prophecies to swallow.”
14668: 
14669: “Come, madonna,” said he of the red cap, “the old thief doesn’t eat the
14670: bread, you see: you’d better try _us_. We fast so much, we’re half
14671: saints already.”
14672: 
14673: The circle had narrowed till the coarse men—most of them gaunt from
14674: privation—had left hardly any margin round Romola. She had been taking
14675: from her basket a small horn-cup, into which she put the piece of bread
14676: and just moistened it with wine; and hitherto she had not appeared to
14677: heed them. But now she rose to her feet, and looked round at them.
14678: Instinctively the men who were nearest to her pushed backward a little,
14679: as if their rude nearness were the fault of those behind. Romola held
14680: out the basket of bread to the man in the night-cap, looking at him
14681: without any reproach in her glance, as she said—
14682: 
14683: “Hunger is hard to bear, I know, and you have the power to take this
14684: bread if you will. It was saved for sick women and children. You are
14685: strong men; but if you do not choose to suffer because you are strong,
14686: you have the power to take everything from the weak. You can take the
14687: bread from this basket; but I shall watch by this old man; I shall
14688: resist your taking the bread from _him_.”
14689: 
14690: For a few moments there was perfect silence, while Romola looked at the
14691: faces before her, and held out the basket of bread. Her own pale face
14692: had the slightly pinched look and the deepening of the eye-socket which
14693: indicate unusual fasting in the habitually temperate, and the large
14694: direct gaze of her hazel eyes was all the more impressive.
14695: 
14696: The man in the night-cap looked rather silly, and backed, thrusting his
14697: elbow into his neighbour’s ribs with an air of moral rebuke. The
14698: backing was general, every one wishing to imply that he had been pushed
14699: forward against his will; and the young man in the fine cloth tunic had
14700: disappeared.
14701: 
14702: But at this moment the armed servitors of the Signoria, who had begun
14703: to patrol the line of streets through which the procession was to pass,
14704: came up to disperse the group which was obstructing the narrow street.
14705: The man addressed as Cecco retreated from a threatening mace up the
14706: church-steps, and said to Romola, in a respectful tone—
14707: 
14708: “Madonna, if you want to go on your errands, I’ll take care of the old
14709: man.”
14710: 
14711: Cecco was a wild-looking figure: a very ragged tunic, made shaggy and
14712: variegated by cloth-dust and clinging fragments of wool, gave relief to
14713: a pair of bare bony arms and a long sinewy neck; his square jaw shaded
14714: by a bristly black beard, his bridgeless nose and low forehead, made
14715: his face look as if it had been crushed down for purposes of packing,
14716: and a narrow piece of red rag tied over his ears seemed to assist in
14717: the compression. Romola looked at him with some hesitation.
14718: 
14719: “Don’t distrust me, madonna,” said Cecco, who understood her look
14720: perfectly; “I am not so pretty as you, but I’ve got an old mother who
14721: eats my porridge for me. What! there’s a heart inside me, and I’ve
14722: bought a candle for the most Holy Virgin before now. Besides, see
14723: there, the old fellow is eating his sop. He’s hale enough: he’ll be on
14724: his legs as well as the best of us by-and-by.”
14725: 
14726: “Thank you for offering to take care of him, friend,” said Romola,
14727: rather penitent for her doubting glance. Then leaning to Baldassarre,
14728: she said, “Pray wait for me till I come again.”
14729: 
14730: He assented with a slight movement of the head and hand, and Romola
14731: went on her way towards the hospital of San Matteo, in the Piazza di
14732: San Marco.
14733: 
14734: 
14735: 
14736: 
14737: CHAPTER XLIII.
14738: The Unseen Madonna.
14739: 
14740: 
14741: In returning from the hospital, more than an hour later, Romola took a
14742: different road, making a wider circuit towards the river, which she
14743: reached at some distance from the Ponte Vecchio. She turned her steps
14744: towards that bridge, intending to hasten to San Stefano in search of
14745: Baldassarre. She dreaded to know more about him, yet she felt as if, in
14746: forsaking him, she would be forsaking some near claim upon her.
14747: 
14748: But when she approached the meeting of the roads where the Por’ Santa
14749: Maria would be on her right-hand and the Ponte Vecchio on her left, she
14750: found herself involved in a crowd who suddenly fell on their knees; and
14751: she immediately knelt with them. The Cross was passing—the Great Cross
14752: of the Duomo—which headed the procession. Romola was later than she had
14753: expected to be, and now she must wait till the procession had passed.
14754: As she rose from her knees, when the Cross had disappeared, the return
14755: to a standing posture, with nothing to do but gaze, made her more
14756: conscious of her fatigue than she had been while she had been walking
14757: and occupied. A shopkeeper by her side said—
14758: 
14759: “Madonna Romola, you will be weary of standing: Gian Fantoni will be
14760: glad to give you a seat in his house. Here is his door close at hand.
14761: Let me open it for you. What! he loves God and the Frate as we do. His
14762: house is yours.”
14763: 
14764: Romola was accustomed now to be addressed in this fraternal way by
14765: ordinary citizens, whose faces were familiar to her from her having
14766: seen them constantly in the Duomo. The idea of home had come to be
14767: identified for her less with the house in the Via de’ Bardi, where she
14768: sat in frequent loneliness, than with the towered circuit of Florence,
14769: where there was hardly a turn of the streets at which she was not
14770: greeted with looks of appeal or of friendliness. She was glad enough to
14771: pass through the open door on her right-hand and be led by the
14772: fraternal hose-vendor to an upstairs-window, where a stout woman with
14773: three children, all in the plain garb of Piagnoni, made a place for her
14774: with much reverence above the bright hanging draperies. From this
14775: corner station she could see, not only the procession pouring in solemn
14776: slowness between the lines of houses on the Ponte Vecchio, but also the
14777: river and the Lung’ Arno on towards the bridge of the Santa Trinita.
14778: 
14779: In sadness and in stillness came the slow procession. Not even a
14780: wailing chant broke the silent appeal for mercy: there was only the
14781: tramp of footsteps, and the faint sweep of woollen garments. They were
14782: young footsteps that were passing when Romola first looked from the
14783: window—a long train of the Florentine youth, bearing high in the midst
14784: of them the white image of the youthful Jesus, with a golden glory
14785: above his head, standing by the tall cross where the thorns and the
14786: nails lay ready.
14787: 
14788: After that train of fresh beardless faces came the mysterious-looking
14789: Companies of Discipline, bound by secret rules to self-chastisement,
14790: and devout praise, and special acts of piety; all wearing a garb which
14791: concealed the whole head and face except the eyes. Every one knew that
14792: these mysterious forms were Florentine citizens of various ranks, who
14793: might be seen at ordinary times going about the business of the shop,
14794: the counting-house, or the State; but no member now was discernible as
14795: son, husband, or father. They had dropped their personality, and walked
14796: as symbols of a common vow. Each company had its colour and its badge,
14797: but the garb of all was a complete shroud, and left no expression but
14798: that of fellowship.
14799: 
14800: In comparison with them, the multitude of monks seemed to be strongly
14801: distinguished individuals, in spite of the common tonsure and the
14802: common frock. First came a white stream of reformed Benedictines; and
14803: then a much longer stream of the Frati Minori, or Franciscans, in that
14804: age all clad in grey, with the knotted cord round their waists, and
14805: some of them with the _zoccoli_, or wooden sandals, below their bare
14806: feet;—perhaps the most numerous order in Florence, owning many zealous
14807: members who loved mankind and hated the Dominicans. And after the grey
14808: came the black of the Augustinians of San Spirito with more cultured
14809: human faces above it—men who had inherited the library of Boccaccio,
14810: and had made the most learned company in Florence when learning was
14811: rarer; then the white over dark of the Carmelites; and then again the
14812: unmixed black of the Servites, that famous Florentine order founded by
14813: seven merchants who forsook their gains to adore the Divine Mother.
14814: 
14815: And now the hearts of all onlookers began to beat a little faster,
14816: either with hatred or with love, for there was a stream of black and
14817: white coming over the bridge—of black mantles over white scapularies;
14818: and every one knew that the Dominicans were coming. Those of Fiesole
14819: passed first. One black mantle parted by white after another, one
14820: tonsured head after another, and still expectation was suspended. They
14821: were very coarse mantles, all of them, and many were threadbare, if not
14822: ragged; for the Prior of San Marco had reduced the fraternities under
14823: his rule to the strictest poverty and discipline. But in the long line
14824: of black and white there was at last singled out a mantle only a little
14825: more worn than the rest, with a tonsured head above it which might not
14826: have appeared supremely remarkable to a stranger who had not seen it on
14827: bronze medals, with the sword of God as its obverse; or surrounded by
14828: an armed guard on the way to the Duomo; or transfigured by the inward
14829: flame of the orator as it looked round on a rapt multitude.
14830: 
14831: As the approach of Savonarola was discerned, none dared conspicuously
14832: to break the stillness by a sound which would rise above the solemn
14833: tramp of footsteps and the faint sweep of garments; nevertheless his
14834: ear, as well as other ears, caught a mingled sound of slow hissing that
14835: longed to be curses, and murmurs that longed to be blessings. Perhaps
14836: it was the sense that the hissing predominated which made two or three
14837: of his disciples in the foreground of the crowd, at the meeting of the
14838: roads, fall on their knees as if something divine were passing. The
14839: movement of silent homage spread: it went along the sides of the
14840: streets like a subtle shock, leaving some unmoved, while it made the
14841: most bend the knee and bow the head. But the hatred, too, gathered a
14842: more intense expression; and as Savonarola passed up the Por’ Santa
14843: Maria, Romola could see that some one at an upper window spat upon him.
14844: 
14845: Monks again—Frati Umiliati, or Humbled Brethren, from Ognissanti, with
14846: a glorious tradition of being the earliest workers in the wool-trade;
14847: and again more monks—Vallombrosan and other varieties of Benedictines,
14848: reminding the instructed eye by niceties of form and colour that in
14849: ages of abuse, long ago, reformers had arisen who had marked a change
14850: of spirit by a change of garb; till at last the shaven crowns were at
14851: an end, and there came the train of untonsured secular priests.
14852: 
14853: Then followed the twenty-one incorporated Arts of Florence in long
14854: array, with their banners floating above them in proud declaration that
14855: the bearers had their distinct functions, from the bakers of bread to
14856: the judges and notaries. And then all the secondary officers of State,
14857: beginning with the less and going on to the greater, till the line of
14858: secularities was broken by the Canons of the Duomo, carrying a sacred
14859: relic—the very head, enclosed in silver, of San Zenobio, immortal
14860: bishop of Florence, whose virtues were held to have saved the city
14861: perhaps a thousand years before.
14862: 
14863: Here was the nucleus of the procession. Behind the relic came the
14864: archbishop in gorgeous cope, with canopy held above him; and after him
14865: the mysterious hidden Image—hidden first by rich curtains of brocade
14866: enclosing an outer painted tabernacle, but within this, by the more
14867: ancient tabernacle which had never been opened in the memory of living
14868: men, or the fathers of living men. In that inner shrine was the image
14869: of the Pitying Mother, found ages ago in the soil of L’Impruneta,
14870: uttering a cry as the spade struck it. Hitherto the unseen Image had
14871: hardly ever been carried to the Duomo without having rich gifts borne
14872: before it. There was no reciting the list of precious offerings made by
14873: emulous men and communities, especially of veils and curtains and
14874: mantles. But the richest of all these, it was said, had been given by a
14875: poor abbess and her nuns, who, having no money to buy materials, wove a
14876: mantle of gold brocade with their prayers, embroidered it and adorned
14877: it with their prayers, and, finally, saw their work presented to the
14878: Blessed Virgin in the great Piazza by two beautiful youths who spread
14879: out white wings and vanished in the blue.
14880: 
14881: But to-day there were no gifts carried before the tabernacle: no
14882: donations were to be given to-day except to the poor. That had been the
14883: advice of Fra Girolamo, whose preaching never insisted on gifts to the
14884: invisible powers, but only on help to visible need; and altars had been
14885: raised at various points in front of the churches, on which the
14886: oblations for the poor were deposited. Not even a torch was carried.
14887: Surely the hidden Mother cared less for torches and brocade than for
14888: the wail of the hungry people. Florence was in extremity: she had done
14889: her utmost, and could only wait for something divine that was not in
14890: her own power.
14891: 
14892: The Frate in the torn mantle had said that help would certainly come,
14893: and many of the faint-hearted were clinging more to their faith in the
14894: Frate’s word, than to their faith in the virtues of the unseen Image.
14895: But there were not a few of the fierce-hearted who thought with secret
14896: rejoicing that the Frate’s word might be proved false.
14897: 
14898: Slowly the tabernacle moved forward, and knees were bent. There was
14899: profound stillness; for the train of priests and chaplains from
14900: L’Impruneta stirred no passion in the onlookers. The procession was
14901: about to close with the Priors and the Gonfaloniere: the long train of
14902: companies and symbols, which have their silent music and stir the mind
14903: as a chorus stirs it, was passing out of sight, and now a faint
14904: yearning hope was all that struggled with the accustomed despondency.
14905: 
14906: Romola, whose heart had been swelling, half with foreboding, half with
14907: that enthusiasm of fellowship which the life of the last two years had
14908: made as habitual to her as the consciousness of costume to a vain and
14909: idle woman, gave a deep sigh, as at the end of some long mental
14910: tension, and remained on her knees for very languor; when suddenly
14911: there flashed from between the houses on to the distant bridge
14912: something bright-coloured. In the instant, Romola started up and
14913: stretched out her arms, leaning from the window, while the black
14914: drapery fell from her head, and the golden gleam of her hair and the
14915: flush in her face seemed the effect of one illumination. A shout arose
14916: in the same instant; the last troops of the procession paused, and all
14917: faces were turned towards the distant bridge.
14918: 
14919: But the bridge was passed now: the horseman was pressing at full gallop
14920: along by the Arno; the sides of his bay horse, just streaked with foam,
14921: looked all white from swiftness; his cap was flying loose by his red
14922: becchetto, and he waved an olive-branch in his hand. It was a
14923: messenger—a messenger of good tidings! The blessed olive-branch spoke
14924: afar off. But the impatient people could not wait. They rushed to meet
14925: the on-comer, and seized his horse’s rein, pushing and trampling.
14926: 
14927: And now Romola could see that the horseman was her husband, who had
14928: been sent to Pisa a few days before on a private embassy. The
14929: recognition brought no new flash of joy into her eyes. She had checked
14930: her first impulsive attitude of expectation; but her governing anxiety
14931: was still to know what news of relief had come for Florence.
14932: 
14933: “Good news!”
14934: 
14935: “Best news!”
14936: 
14937: “News to be paid with hose!” (_novelle da calze_) were the vague
14938: answers with which Tito met the importunities of the crowd, until he
14939: had succeeded in pushing on his horse to the spot at the meeting of the
14940: ways where the Gonfaloniere and the Priors were awaiting him. There he
14941: paused, and, bowing low, said—
14942: 
14943: “Magnificent Signori! I have to deliver to you the joyful news that the
14944: galleys from France, laden with corn and men, have arrived safely in
14945: the port of Leghorn, by favour of a strong wind, which kept the enemy’s
14946: fleet at a distance.”
14947: 
14948: The words had no sooner left Tito’s lips than they seemed to vibrate up
14949: the streets. A great shout rang through the air, and rushed along the
14950: river; and then another, and another; and the shouts were heard
14951: spreading along the line of the procession towards the Duomo; and then
14952: there were fainter answering shouts, like the intermediate plash of
14953: distant waves in a great lake whose waters obey one impulse.
14954: 
14955: For some minutes there was no attempt to speak further: the Signoria
14956: themselves lifted up their caps, and stood bare-headed in the presence
14957: of a rescue which had come from outside the limit of their own
14958: power—from that region of trust and resignation which has been in all
14959: ages called divine.
14960: 
14961: At last, as the signal was given to move forward, Tito said, with a
14962: smile—
14963: 
14964: “I ought to say, that any hose to be bestowed by the Magnificent
14965: Signoria in reward of these tidings are due, not to me, but to another
14966: man who had ridden hard to bring them, and would have been here in my
14967: place if his horse had not broken down just before he reached Signa.
14968: Meo di Sasso will doubtless be here in an hour or two, and may all the
14969: more justly claim the glory of the messenger, because he has had the
14970: chief labour and has lost the chief delight.”
14971: 
14972: It was a graceful way of putting a necessary statement, and after a
14973: word of reply from the _Proposto_, or spokesman of the Signoria, this
14974: dignified extremity of the procession passed on, and Tito turned his
14975: horse’s head to follow in its train, while the great bell of the
14976: Palazzo Vecchio was already beginning to swing, and give a louder voice
14977: to the people’s joy in that moment, when Tito’s attention had ceased to
14978: be imperatively directed, it might have been expected that he would
14979: look round and recognise Romola; but he was apparently engaged with his
14980: cap, which, now the eager people were leading his horse, he was able to
14981: seize and place on his head, while his right-hand was still encumbered
14982: by the olive-branch. He had a becoming air of lassitude after his
14983: exertions; and Romola, instead of making any effort to be recognised by
14984: him, threw her black drapery over her head again, and remained
14985: perfectly quiet. Yet she felt almost sure that Tito had seen her; he
14986: had the power of seeing everything without seeming to see it.
14987: 
14988: 
14989: 
14990: 
14991: CHAPTER XLIV.
14992: The Visible Madonna.
14993: 
14994: 
14995: The crowd had no sooner passed onward than Romola descended to the
14996: street, and hastened to the steps of San Stefano. Cecco had been
14997: attracted with the rest towards the Piazza, and she found Baldassarre
14998: standing alone against the church-door, with the horn-cup in his hand,
14999: waiting for her. There was a striking change in him: the blank, dreamy
15000: glance of a half-returned consciousness had given place to a fierceness
15001: which, as she advanced and spoke to him, flashed upon her as if she had
15002: been its object. It was the glance of caged fury that sees its prey
15003: passing safe beyond the bars.
15004: 
15005: Romola started as the glance was turned on her, but her immediate
15006: thought was that he had seen Tito. And as she felt the look of hatred
15007: grating on her, something like a hope arose that this man might be the
15008: criminal, and that her husband might not have been guilty towards him.
15009: If she could learn that now, by bringing Tito face to face with him,
15010: and have her mind set at rest!
15011: 
15012: “If you will come with me,” she said, “I can give you shelter and food
15013: until you are quite rested and strong. Will you come?”
15014: 
15015: “Yes,” said Baldassarre, “I shall be glad to get my strength. I want to
15016: get my strength,” he repeated, as if he were muttering to himself,
15017: rather than speaking to her.
15018: 
15019: “Come!” she said, inviting him to walk by her side, and taking the way
15020: by the Arno towards the Ponte Rubaconte as the more private road.
15021: 
15022: “I think you are not a Florentine,” she said, presently, as they turned
15023: on to the bridge.
15024: 
15025: He looked round at her without speaking. His suspicious caution was
15026: more strongly upon him than usual, just now that the fog of confusion
15027: and oblivion was made denser by bodily feebleness. But she was looking
15028: at him too, and there was something in her gentle eyes which at last
15029: compelled him to answer her. But he answered cautiously—
15030: 
15031: “No, I am no Florentine; I am a lonely man.”
15032: 
15033: She observed his reluctance to speak to her, and dared not question him
15034: further, lest he should desire to quit her. As she glanced at him from
15035: time to time, her mind was busy with thoughts which quenched the faint
15036: hope that there was nothing painful to be revealed about her husband.
15037: If this old man had been in the wrong, where was the cause for dread
15038: and secrecy!
15039: 
15040: They walked on in silence till they reached the entrance into the Via
15041: de’ Bardi, and Romola noticed that he turned and looked at her with a
15042: sudden movement as if some shock had passed through him. A few moments
15043: after, she paused at the half-open door of the court and turned towards
15044: him.
15045: 
15046: “Ah!” he said, not waiting for her to speak, “you are his wife.”
15047: 
15048: “Whose wife?” said Romola.
15049: 
15050: It would have been impossible for Baldassarre to recall any name at
15051: that moment. The very force with which the image of Tito pressed upon
15052: him seemed to expel any verbal sign. He made no answer, but looked at
15053: her with strange fixedness.
15054: 
15055: She opened the door wide and showed the court covered with straw, on
15056: which lay four or five sick people, while some little children crawled
15057: or sat on it at their ease—tiny pale creatures, biting straws and
15058: gurgling.
15059: 
15060: “If you will come in,” said Romola, tremulously, “I will find you a
15061: comfortable place, and bring you some more food.”
15062: 
15063: “No, I will not come in,” said Baldassarre. But he stood still,
15064: arrested by the burden of impressions under which his mind was too
15065: confused to choose a course.
15066: 
15067: “Can I do nothing for you?” said Romola. “Let me give you some money
15068: that you may buy food. It will be more plentiful soon.”
15069: 
15070: She had put her hand into her scarsella as she spoke, and held out her
15071: palm with several _grossi_ in it. She purposely offered him more than
15072: she would have given to any other man in the same circumstances. He
15073: looked at the coins a little while, and then said—
15074: 
15075: “Yes, I will take them.”
15076: 
15077: She poured the coins into his palm, and he grasped them tightly.
15078: 
15079: “Tell me,” said Romola, almost beseechingly. “What shall you—”
15080: 
15081: But Baldassarre had turned away from her, and was walking again towards
15082: the bridge. Passing from it, straight on up the Via del Fosso, he came
15083: upon the shop of Niccolò Caparra, and turned towards it without a
15084: pause, as if it had been the very object of his search. Niccolò was at
15085: that moment in procession with the armourers of Florence, and there was
15086: only one apprentice in the shop. But there were all sorts of weapons in
15087: abundance hanging there, and Baldassarre’s eyes discerned what he was
15088: more hungry for than for bread. Niccolò himself would probably have
15089: refused to sell anything that might serve as a weapon to this man with
15090: signs of the prison on him; but the apprentice, less observant and
15091: scrupulous, took three _grossi_ for a sharp hunting-knife without any
15092: hesitation. It was a conveniently small weapon, which Baldassarre could
15093: easily thrust within the breast of his tunic, and he walked on, feeling
15094: stronger. That sharp edge might give deadliness to the thrust of an
15095: aged arm: at least it was a companion, it was a power in league with
15096: him, even if it failed. It would break against armour, but was the
15097: armour sure to be always there? In those long months while vengeance
15098: had lain in prison, baseness had perhaps become forgetful and secure.
15099: The knife had been bought with the traitor’s own money. That was just.
15100: Before he took the money, he had felt what he should do with it—buy a
15101: weapon. Yes, and if possible, food too; food to nourish the arm that
15102: would grasp the weapon, food to nourish the body which was the temple
15103: of vengeance. When he had had enough bread, he should be able to think
15104: and act—to think first how he could hide himself, lest Tito should have
15105: him dragged away again.
15106: 
15107: With that idea of hiding in his mind, Baldassarre turned up the
15108: narrowest streets, bought himself some meat and bread, and sat down
15109: under the first loggia to eat. The bells that swung out louder and
15110: louder peals of joy, laying hold of him and making him vibrate along
15111: with all the air, seemed to him simply part of that strong world which
15112: was against him.
15113: 
15114: Romola had watched Baldassarre until he had disappeared round the
15115: turning into the Piazza de’ Mozzi, half feeling that his departure was
15116: a relief, half reproaching herself for not seeking with more decision
15117: to know the truth about him, for not assuring herself whether there
15118: were any guiltless misery in his lot which she was not helpless to
15119: relieve. Yet what could she have done if the truth had proved to be the
15120: burden of some painful secret about her husband, in addition to the
15121: anxieties that already weighed upon her? Surely a wife was permitted to
15122: desire ignorance of a husband’s wrong-doing, since she alone must not
15123: protest and warn men against him. But that thought stirred too many
15124: intricate fibres of feeling to be pursued now in her weariness. It was
15125: a time to rejoice, since help had come to Florence; and she turned into
15126: the court to tell the good news to her patients on their straw beds.
15127: 
15128: She closed the door after her, lest the bells should drown her voice,
15129: and then throwing the black drapery from her head, that the women might
15130: see her better, she stood in the midst and told them that corn was
15131: coming, and that the bells were ringing for gladness at the news. They
15132: all sat up to listen, while the children trotted or crawled towards
15133: her, and pulled her black skirts, as if they were impatient at being
15134: all that long way off her face. She yielded to them, weary as she was,
15135: and sat down on the straw, while the little pale things peeped into her
15136: basket and pulled her hair down, and the feeble voices around her said,
15137: “The Holy Virgin be praised!”
15138: 
15139: “It was the procession!”
15140: 
15141: “The Mother of God has had pity on us!”
15142: 
15143: At last Romola rose from the heap of straw, too tired to try and smile
15144: any longer, saying as she turned up the stone steps—
15145: 
15146: “I will come by-and-by, to bring you your dinner.”
15147: 
15148: “Bless you, madonna! bless you!” said the faint chorus, in much the
15149: same tone as that in which they had a few minutes before praised and
15150: thanked the unseen Madonna.
15151: 
15152: Romola cared a great deal for that music. She had no innate taste for
15153: tending the sick and clothing the ragged, like some women to whom the
15154: details of such work are welcome in themselves, simply as an
15155: occupation. Her early training had kept her aloof from such womanly
15156: labours; and if she had not brought to them the inspiration of her
15157: deepest feelings, they would have been irksome to her. But they had
15158: come to be the one unshaken resting-place of her mind, the one narrow
15159: pathway on which the light fell clear. If the gulf between herself and
15160: Tito which only gathered a more perceptible wideness from her attempts
15161: to bridge it by submission, brought a doubt whether, after all, the
15162: bond to which she had laboured to be true might not itself be false—if
15163: she came away from her confessor, Fra Salvestro, or from some contact
15164: with the disciples of Savonarola amongst whom she worshipped, with a
15165: sickening sense that these people were miserably narrow, and with an
15166: almost impetuous reaction towards her old contempt for their
15167: superstition—she found herself recovering a firm footing in her works
15168: of womanly sympathy. Whatever else made her doubt, the help she gave to
15169: her fellow-citizens made her sure that Fra Girolamo had been right to
15170: call her back. According to his unforgotten words, her place had not
15171: been empty: it had been filled with her love and her labour. Florence
15172: had had need of her, and the more her own sorrow pressed upon her, the
15173: more gladness she felt in the memories, stretching through the two long
15174: years, of hours and moments in which she had lightened the burden of
15175: life to others. All that ardour of her nature which could no longer
15176: spend itself in the woman’s tenderness for father and husband, had
15177: transformed itself into an enthusiasm of sympathy with the general
15178: life. She had ceased to think that her own lot could be happy—had
15179: ceased to think of happiness at all: the one end of her life seemed to
15180: her to be the diminishing of sorrow.
15181: 
15182: Her enthusiasm was continually stirred to fresh vigour by the influence
15183: of Savonarola. In spite of the wearisome visions and allegories from
15184: which she recoiled in disgust when they came as stale repetitions from
15185: other lips than his, her strong affinity for his passionate sympathy
15186: and the splendour of his aims had lost none of its power. His burning
15187: indignation against the abuses and oppression that made the daily story
15188: of the Church and of States had kindled the ready fire in her too. His
15189: special care for liberty and purity of government in Florence, with his
15190: constant reference of this immediate object to the wider end of a
15191: universal regeneration, had created in her a new consciousness of the
15192: great drama of human existence in which her life was a part; and
15193: through her daily helpful contact with the less fortunate of her
15194: fellow-citizens this new consciousness became something stronger than a
15195: vague sentiment; it grew into a more and more definite motive of
15196: self-denying practice. She thought little about dogmas, and shrank from
15197: reflecting closely on the Frate’s prophecies of the immediate scourge
15198: and closely following regeneration. She had submitted her mind to his
15199: and had entered into communion with the Church, because in this way she
15200: had found an immediate satisfaction for moral needs which all the
15201: previous culture and experience of her life had left hungering. Fra
15202: Girolamo’s voice had waked in her mind a reason for living, apart from
15203: personal enjoyment and personal affection; but it was a reason that
15204: seemed to need feeding with greater forces than she possessed within
15205: herself, and her submissive use of all offices of the Church was simply
15206: a watching and waiting if by any means fresh strength might come. The
15207: pressing problem for Romola just then was not to settle questions of
15208: controversy, but to keep alive that flame of unselfish emotion by which
15209: a life of sadness might still be a life of active love.
15210: 
15211: Her trust in Savonarola’s nature as greater than her own made a large
15212: part of the strength she had found. And the trust was not to be lightly
15213: shaken. It is not force of intellect which causes ready repulsion from
15214: the aberration and eccentricities of greatness, any more than it is
15215: force of vision that causes the eye to explore the warts on a face
15216: bright with human expression; it is simply the negation of high
15217: sensibilities. Romola was so deeply moved by the grand energies of
15218: Savonarola’s nature, that she found herself listening patiently to all
15219: dogmas and prophecies, when they came in the vehicle of his ardent
15220: faith and believing utterance.[1]
15221: 
15222: No soul is desolate as long as there is a human being for whom it can
15223: feel trust and reverence. Romola’s trust in Savonarola was something
15224: like a rope suspended securely by her path, making her step elastic
15225: while she grasped it; if it were suddenly removed, no firmness of the
15226: ground she trod could save her from staggering, or perhaps from
15227: falling.
15228: 
15229:  [1] He himself had had occasion enough to note the efficacy of that
15230:  vehicle. “If,” he says in the _Compendium Revelationum_, “you speak of
15231:  such as have not heard these things from me, I admit that they who
15232:  disbelieve are more than they who believe, because it is one thing to
15233:  hear him who inwardly feels these things, and another to hear him who
15234:  feels them not; ... and, therefore, it is well said by Saint Jerome,
15235:  ‘Habet nescio quid latentis energiae vivae vocis actus, et in aures
15236:  discipuli de auctoris ore transfusa fortis sonat.’”
15237: 
15238: 
15239: 
15240: 
15241: CHAPTER XLV.
15242: At the Barber’s Shop.
15243: 
15244: 
15245: After that welcome appearance as the messenger with the olive-branch,
15246: which was an unpromised favour of fortune, Tito had other commissions
15247: to fulfil of a more premeditated character. He paused at the Palazzo
15248: Vecchio, and awaited there the return of the Ten, who managed external
15249: and war affairs, that he might duly deliver to them the results of his
15250: private mission to Pisa, intended as a preliminary to an avowed embassy
15251: of which Bernardo Rucellai was to be the head, with the object of
15252: coming, if possible, to a pacific understanding with the Emperor
15253: Maximilian and the League.
15254: 
15255: Tito’s talents for diplomatic work had been well ascertained, and as he
15256: gave with fulness and precision the results of his inquiries and
15257: interviews, Bernardo del Nero, who was at that time one of the Ten,
15258: could not withhold his admiration. He would have withheld it if he
15259: could; for his original dislike of Tito had returned, and become
15260: stronger, since the sale of the library. Romola had never uttered a
15261: word to her godfather on the circumstances of the sale, and Bernardo
15262: had understood her silence as a prohibition to him to enter on the
15263: subject, but he felt sure that the breach of her father’s wish had been
15264: a blighting grief to her, and the old man’s observant eyes discerned
15265: other indications that her married life was not happy.
15266: 
15267: “Ah,” he said, inwardly, “that doubtless is the reason she has taken to
15268: listening to Fra Girolamo, and going amongst the Piagnoni, which I
15269: never expected from her. These women, if they are not happy, and have
15270: no children, must either take to folly or to some overstrained religion
15271: that makes them think they’ve got all heaven’s work on their shoulders.
15272: And as for my poor child Romola, it is as I always said—the cramming
15273: with Latin and Greek has left her as much a woman as if she had done
15274: nothing all day but prick her fingers with the needle. And this husband
15275: of hers, who gets employed everywhere, because he’s a tool with a
15276: smooth handle, I wish Tornabuoni and the rest may not find their
15277: fingers cut. Well, well, _solco torto, sacco dritto_—many a full sack
15278: comes from a crooked furrow; and he who will be captain of none but
15279: honest men will have small hire to pay.”
15280: 
15281: With this long-established conviction that there could be no moral
15282: sifting of political agents, the old Florentine abstained from all
15283: interference in Tito’s disfavour. Apart from what must be kept sacred
15284: and private for Romola’s sake, Bernardo had nothing direct to allege
15285: against the useful Greek, except that he was a Greek, and that he,
15286: Bernardo, did not like him; for the doubleness of feigning attachment
15287: to the popular government, while at heart a Medicean, was common to
15288: Tito with more than half the Medicean party. He only feigned with more
15289: skill than the rest: that was all. So Bernardo was simply cold to Tito,
15290: who returned the coldness with a scrupulous, distant respect. And it
15291: was still the notion in Florence that the old tie between Bernardo and
15292: Bardo made any service done to Romola’s husband an acceptable homage to
15293: her godfather.
15294: 
15295: After delivering himself of his charge at the Old Palace, Tito felt
15296: that the avowed official work of the day was done. He was tired and
15297: adust with long riding; but he did not go home. There were certain
15298: things in his scarsella and on his mind, from which he wished to free
15299: himself as soon as possible, but the opportunities must be found so
15300: skilfully that they must not seem to be sought. He walked from the
15301: Palazzo in a sauntering fashion towards the Piazza del Duomo. The
15302: procession was at an end now, but the bells were still ringing, and the
15303: people were moving about the streets restlessly, longing for some more
15304: definite vent to their joy. If the Frate could have stood up in the
15305: great Piazza and preached to them, they might have been satisfied, but
15306: now, in spite of the new discipline which declared Christ to be the
15307: special King of the Florentines and required all pleasures to be of a
15308: Christian sort, there was a secret longing in many of the youngsters
15309: who shouted “Viva Gesu!” for a little vigorous stone throwing in sign
15310: of thankfulness.
15311: 
15312: Tito, as he passed along, could not escape being recognised by some as
15313: the welcome bearer of the olive-branch, and could only rid himself of
15314: an inconvenient ovation, chiefly in the form of eager questions, by
15315: telling those who pressed on him that Meo di Sasso, the true messenger
15316: from Leghorn, must now be entering, and might certainly be met towards
15317: the Porta San Frediano. He could tell much more than Tito knew.
15318: 
15319: Freeing himself from importunities in this adroit manner, he made his
15320: way to the Piazza del Duomo, casting his long eyes round the space with
15321: an air of the utmost carelessness, but really seeking to detect some
15322: presence which might furnish him with one of his desired opportunities.
15323: The fact of the procession having terminated at the Duomo made it
15324: probable that there would be more than the usual concentration of
15325: loungers and talkers in the Piazza and round Nello’s shop. It was as he
15326: expected. There was a group leaning against the rails near the north
15327: gates of the Baptistery, so exactly what he sought, that he looked more
15328: indifferent than ever, and seemed to recognise the tallest member of
15329: the group entirely by chance as he had half passed him, just turning
15330: his head to give him a slight greeting, while he tossed the end of his
15331: _becchetto_ over his left shoulder.
15332: 
15333: Yet the tall, broad-shouldered personage greeted in that slight way
15334: looked like one who had considerable claims. He wore a
15335: richly-embroidered tunic, with a great show of linen, after the newest
15336: French mode, and at his belt there hung a sword and poniard of fine
15337: workmanship. His hat, with a red plume in it, seemed a scornful protest
15338: against the gravity of Florentine costume, which had been exaggerated
15339: to the utmost under the influence of the Piagnoni. Certain undefinable
15340: indications of youth made the breadth of his face and the large
15341: diameter of his waist appear the more emphatically a stamp of
15342: coarseness, and his eyes had that rude desecrating stare at all men and
15343: things which to a refined mind is as intolerable as a bad odour or a
15344: flaring light.
15345: 
15346: He and his companions, also young men dressed expensively and wearing
15347: arms, were exchanging jokes with that sort of ostentatious laughter
15348: which implies a desire to prove that the laughter is not mortified
15349: though some people might suspect it. There were good reasons for such a
15350: suspicion; for this broad-shouldered man with the red feather was Dolfo
15351: Spini, leader of the Compagnacci, or Evil Companions—that is to say, of
15352: all the dissolute young men belonging to the old aristocratic party,
15353: enemies of the Mediceans, enemies of the popular government, but still
15354: more bitter enemies of Savonarola. Dolfo Spini, heir of the great house
15355: with the loggia, over the bridge of the Santa Trinita, had organised
15356: these young men into an armed band, as sworn champions of extravagant
15357: suppers and all the pleasant sins of the flesh, against reforming
15358: pietists who threatened to make the world chaste and temperate to so
15359: intolerable a degree that there would soon be no reason for living,
15360: except the extreme unpleasantness of the alternative. Up to this very
15361: morning he had been loudly declaring that Florence was given up to
15362: famine and ruin entirely through its blind adherence to the advice of
15363: the Frate, and that there could be no salvation for Florence but in
15364: joining the League and driving the Frate out of the city—sending him to
15365: Rome, in fact, whither he ought to have gone long ago in obedience to
15366: the summons of the Pope. It was suspected, therefore, that Messer Dolfo
15367: Spini’s heart was not aglow with pure joy at the unexpected succours
15368: which had come in apparent fulfilment of the Frate’s prediction, and
15369: the laughter, which was ringing out afresh as Tito joined the group at
15370: Nello’s door, did not serve to dissipate the suspicion. For leaning
15371: against the door-post in the centre of the group was a close-shaven,
15372: keen-eyed personage, named Niccolò Macchiavelli, who, young as he was,
15373: had penetrated all the small secrets of egoism.
15374: 
15375: “Messer Dolfo’s head,” he was saying, “is more of a pumpkin than I
15376: thought. I measure men’s dulness by the devices they trust in for
15377: deceiving others. Your dullest animal of all is he who grins and says
15378: he doesn’t mind just after he has had his shins kicked. If I were a
15379: trifle duller, now,” he went on, smiling as the circle opened to admit
15380: Tito, “I should pretend to be fond of this Melema, who has got a
15381: secretaryship that would exactly suit me—as if Latin ill-paid could
15382: love better Latin that’s better paid! Melema, you are a pestiferously
15383: clever fellow, very much in my way, and I’m sorry to hear you’ve had
15384: another piece of good-luck to-day.”
15385: 
15386: “Questionable luck, Niccolò,” said Tito, touching him on the shoulder
15387: in a friendly way; “I have got nothing by it yet but being laid hold of
15388: and breathed upon by wool-beaters, when I am as soiled and battered
15389: with riding as a _tabellario_ (letter-carrier) from Bologna.”
15390: 
15391: “Ah! you want a touch of my art, Messer Oratore,” said Nello, who had
15392: come forward at the sound of Tito’s voice; “your chin, I perceive, has
15393: yesterday’s crop upon it. Come, come—consign yourself to the priest of
15394: all the Muses. Sandro, quick with the lather!”
15395: 
15396: “In truth, Nello, that is just what I most desire at this moment,” said
15397: Tito, seating himself; “and that was why I turned my steps towards thy
15398: shop, instead of going home at once, when I had done my business at the
15399: Palazzo.”
15400: 
15401: “Yes, indeed, it is not fitting that you should present yourself to
15402: Madonna Romola with a rusty chin and a tangled _zazzera_. Nothing that
15403: is not dainty ought to approach the Florentine lily; though I see her
15404: constantly going about like a sunbeam amongst the rags that line our
15405: corners—if indeed she is not more like a moonbeam now, for I thought
15406: yesterday, when I met her, that she looked as pale and worn as that
15407: fainting Madonna of Fra Giovanni’s. You must see to it, my bel erudito:
15408: she keeps too many fasts and vigils in your absence.”
15409: 
15410: Tito gave a melancholy shrug. “It is too true, Nello. She has been
15411: depriving herself of half her proper food _every_ day during this
15412: famine. But what can I do? Her mind has been set all aflame. A
15413: husband’s influence is powerless against the Frate’s.”
15414: 
15415: “As every other influence is likely to be, that of the Holy Father
15416: included,” said Domenico Cennini, one of the group at the door, who had
15417: turned in with Tito. “I don’t know whether you have gathered anything
15418: at Pisa about the way the wind sits at Rome, Melema?”
15419: 
15420: “Secrets of the council-chamber, Messer Domenico!” said Tito, smiling
15421: and opening his palms in a deprecatory manner. “An envoy must be as
15422: dumb as a father confessor.”
15423: 
15424: “Certainly, certainly,” said Cennini. “I ask for no breach of that
15425: rule. Well, my belief is, that if his Holiness were to drive Fra
15426: Girolamo to extremity, the Frate would move heaven and earth to get a
15427: General Council of the Church—ay, and would get it too; and I, for one,
15428: should not be sorry, though I’m no Piagnone.”
15429: 
15430: “With leave of your greater experience, Messer Domenico,” said
15431: Macchiavelli, “I must differ from you—not in your wish to see a General
15432: Council which might reform the Church, but in your belief that the
15433: Frate will checkmate his Holiness. The Frate’s game is an impossible
15434: one. If he had contented himself with preaching against the vices of
15435: Rome, and with prophesying that in some way, not mentioned, Italy would
15436: be scourged, depend upon it Pope Alexander would have allowed him to
15437: spend his breath in that way as long as he could find hearers. Such
15438: spiritual blasts as those knock no walls down. But the Frate wants to
15439: be something more than a spiritual trumpet: he wants to be a lever, and
15440: what is more, he _is_ a lever. He wants to spread the doctrine of
15441: Christ by maintaining a popular government in Florence, and the Pope,
15442: as I know, on the best authority, has private views to the contrary.”
15443: 
15444: “Then Florence will stand by the Frate,” Cennini broke in, with some
15445: fervour. “I myself should prefer that he would let his prophesying
15446: alone, but if our freedom to choose our own government is to be
15447: attacked—I am an obedient son of the Church, but I would vote for
15448: resisting Pope Alexander the Sixth, as our forefathers resisted Pope
15449: Gregory the Eleventh.”
15450: 
15451: “But pardon me, Messer Domenico,” said Macchiavelli, sticking his
15452: thumbs into his belt, and speaking with that cool enjoyment of
15453: exposition which surmounts every other force in discussion. “Have you
15454: correctly seized the Frate’s position? How is it that he has become a
15455: lever, and made himself worth attacking by an acute man like his
15456: Holiness? Because he has got the ear of the people: because he gives
15457: them threats and promises, which they believe come straight from God,
15458: not only about hell, purgatory, and paradise, but about Pisa and our
15459: Great Council. But let events go against him, so as to shake the
15460: people’s faith, and the cause of his power will be the cause of his
15461: fall. He is accumulating three sorts of hatred on his head—the hatred
15462: of average mankind against every one who wants to lay on them a strict
15463: yoke of virtue; the hatred of the stronger powers in Italy who want to
15464: farm Florence for their own purposes; and the hatred of the people, to
15465: whom he has ventured to promise good in this world, instead of
15466: confining his promises to the next. If a prophet is to keep his power,
15467: he must be a prophet like Mahomet, with an army at his back, that when
15468: the people’s faith is fainting it may be frightened into life again.”
15469: 
15470: “Rather sum up the three sorts of hatred in one,” said Francesco Cei,
15471: impetuously, “and say he has won the hatred of all men who have sense
15472: and honesty, by inventing hypocritical lies. His proper place is among
15473: the false prophets in the Inferno, who walk with their heads turned
15474: hind-foremost.”
15475: 
15476: “You are too angry, my Francesco,” said Macchiavelli, smiling; “you
15477: poets are apt to cut the clouds in your wrath. I am no votary of the
15478: Frate’s, and would not lay down my little finger for his veracity. But
15479: veracity is a plant of paradise, and the seeds have never flourished
15480: beyond the walls. You, yourself, my Francesco, tell poetical lies only;
15481: partly compelled by the poet’s fervour, partly to please your audience;
15482: but _you_ object to lies in prose. Well, the Frate differs from you as
15483: to the boundary of poetry, that’s all. When he gets into the pulpit of
15484: the Duomo, he has the fervour within him, and without him he has the
15485: audience to please. Ecco!”
15486: 
15487: “You are somewhat lax there, Niccolò,” said Cennini, gravely. “I myself
15488: believe in the Frate’s integrity, though I don’t believe in his
15489: prophecies, and as long as his integrity is not disproved, we have a
15490: popular party strong enough to protect him and resist foreign
15491: interference.”
15492: 
15493: “A party that seems strong enough,” said Macchiavelli, with a shrug,
15494: and an almost imperceptible glance towards Tito, who was abandoning
15495: himself with much enjoyment to Nello’s combing and scenting. “But how
15496: many Mediceans are there among you? How many who will not be turned
15497: round by a private grudge?”
15498: 
15499: “As to the Mediceans,” said Cennini, “I believe there is very little
15500: genuine feeling left on behalf of the Medici. Who would risk much for
15501: Piero de’ Medici? A few old staunch friends, perhaps, like Bernardo del
15502: Nero; but even some of those most connected with the family are hearty
15503: friends of the popular government, and would exert themselves for the
15504: Frate. I was talking to Giannozzo Pucci only a little while ago, and I
15505: am convinced there’s nothing he would set his face against more than
15506: against any attempt to alter the new order of things.”
15507: 
15508: “You are right there, Messer Domenico,” said Tito, with a laughing
15509: meaning in his eyes, as he rose from the shaving-chair; “and I fancy
15510: the tender passion came in aid of hard theory there. I am persuaded
15511: there was some jealousy at the bottom of Giannozzo’s alienation from
15512: Piero de’ Medici; else so amiable a creature as he would never feel the
15513: bitterness he sometimes allows to escape him in that quarter. He was in
15514: the procession with you, I suppose?”
15515: 
15516: “No,” said Cennini; “he is at his villa—went there three days ago.”
15517: 
15518: Tito was settling his cap and glancing down at his splashed hose as if
15519: he hardly heeded the answer. In reality he had obtained a much-desired
15520: piece of information. He had at that moment in his scarsella a crushed
15521: gold ring which he had engaged to deliver to Giannozzo Pucci. He had
15522: received it from an envoy of Piero de’ Medici, whom he had ridden out
15523: of his way to meet at Certaldo on the Siena road. Since Pucci was not
15524: in the town, he would send the ring by Fra Michele, a Carthusian lay
15525: Brother in the service of the Mediceans, and the receipt of that sign
15526: would bring Pucci back to hear the verbal part of Tito’s mission.
15527: 
15528: “Behold him!” said Nello, flourishing his comb and pointing it at Tito,
15529: “the handsomest scholar in the world or in the wolds, (‘Del mondo o di
15530: maremma’) now he has passed through my hands! A trifle thinner in the
15531: face, though, than when he came in his first bloom to Florence—eh? and,
15532: I vow, there are some lines just faintly hinting themselves about your
15533: mouth, Messer Oratore! Ah, mind is an enemy to beauty! I myself was
15534: thought beautiful by the women at one time—when I was in my
15535: swaddling-bands. But now—oimè! I carry my unwritten poems in cipher on
15536: my face!”
15537: 
15538: Tito, laughing with the rest as Nello looked at himself tragically in
15539: the hand-mirror, made a sign of farewell to the company generally, and
15540: took his departure.
15541: 
15542: “I’m of our old Piero di Cosimo’s mind,” said Francesco Cei. “I don’t
15543: half like Melema. That trick of smiling gets stronger than ever—no
15544: wonder he has lines about the mouth.”
15545: 
15546: “He’s too successful,” said Macchiavelli, playfully. “I’m sure there’s
15547: something wrong about him, else he wouldn’t have that secretaryship.”
15548: 
15549: “He’s an able man,” said Cennini, in a tone of judicial fairness. “I
15550: and my brother have always found him useful with our Greek sheets, and
15551: he gives great satisfaction to the Ten. I like to see a young man work
15552: his way upward by merit. And the secretary Scala, who befriended him
15553: from the first, thinks highly of him still, I know.”
15554: 
15555: “Doubtless,” said a notary in the background. “He writes Scala’s
15556: official letters for him, or corrects them, and gets well paid for it
15557: too.”
15558: 
15559: “I wish Messer Bartolommeo would pay _me_ to doctor his gouty Latin,”
15560: said Macchiavelli, with a shrug. “Did _he_ tell you about the pay, Ser
15561: Ceccone, or was it Melema himself?” he added, looking at the notary
15562: with a face ironically innocent.
15563: 
15564: “Melema? no, indeed,” answered Ser Ceccone. “He is as close as a nut.
15565: He never brags. That’s why he’s employed everywhere. They say he’s
15566: getting rich with doing all sorts of underhand work.”
15567: 
15568: “It _is_ a little too bad,” said Macchiavelli, “and so many able
15569: notaries out of employment!”
15570: 
15571: “Well, I must say I thought that was a nasty story a year or two ago
15572: about the man who said he had stolen jewels,” said Cei. “It got hushed
15573: up somehow; but I remember Piero di Cosimo said, at the time, he
15574: believed there was something in it, for he saw Melema’s face when the
15575: man laid hold of him, and he never saw a visage so ‘painted with fear,’
15576: as our sour old Dante says.”
15577: 
15578: “Come, spit no more of that venom, Francesco,” said Nello, getting
15579: indignant, “else I shall consider it a public duty to cut your hair
15580: awry the next time I get you under my scissors. That story of the
15581: stolen jewels was a lie. Bernardo Rucellai and the Magnificent Eight
15582: knew all about it. The man was a dangerous madman, and he was very
15583: properly kept out of mischief in prison. As for our Piero di Cosimo,
15584: his wits are running after the wind of Mongibello: he has such an
15585: extravagant fancy that he would take a lizard for a crocodile. No: that
15586: story has been dead and buried too long—our noses object to it.”
15587: 
15588: “It is true,” said Macchiavelli. “You forget the danger of the
15589: precedent, Francesco. The next mad beggarman may accuse you of stealing
15590: his verses, or me, God help me! of stealing his coppers. Ah!” he went
15591: on, turning towards the door, “Dolfo Spini has carried his red feather
15592: out of the Piazza. That captain of swaggerers would like the Republic
15593: to lose Pisa just for the chance of seeing the people tear the frock
15594: off the Frate’s back. With your pardon, Francesco—I know he is a friend
15595: of yours—there are few things I should like better than to see him play
15596: the part of Capo d’Oca, who went out to the tournament blowing his
15597: trumpets and returned with them in a bag.”
15598: 
15599: 
15600: 
15601: 
15602: CHAPTER XLVI.
15603: By a Street Lamp.
15604: 
15605: 
15606: That evening, when it was dark and threatening rain, Romola, returning
15607: with Maso and the lantern by her side, from the hospital of San Matteo,
15608: which she had visited after vespers, encountered her husband just
15609: issuing from the monastery of San Marco. Tito, who had gone out again
15610: shortly after his arrival in the Via de’ Bardi, and had seen little of
15611: Romola during the day, immediately proposed to accompany her home,
15612: dismissing Maso, whose short steps annoyed him. It was only usual for
15613: him to pay her such an official attention when it was obviously
15614: demanded from him. Tito and Romola never jarred, never remonstrated
15615: with each other. They were too hopelessly alienated in their inner life
15616: ever to have that contest which is an effort towards agreement. They
15617: talked of all affairs, public and private, with careful adherence to an
15618: adopted course. If Tito wanted a supper prepared in the old library,
15619: now pleasantly furnished as a banqueting-room, Romola assented, and saw
15620: that everything needful was done: and Tito, on his side, left her
15621: entirely uncontrolled in her daily habits, accepting the help she
15622: offered him in transcribing or making digests, and in return meeting
15623: her conjectured want of supplies for her charities. Yet he constantly,
15624: as on this very morning, avoided exchanging glances with her; affected
15625: to believe that she was out of the house, in order to avoid seeking her
15626: in her own room; and playfully attributed to her a perpetual preference
15627: of solitude to his society.
15628: 
15629: In the first ardour of her self-conquest, after she had renounced her
15630: resolution of flight, Romola had made many timid efforts towards the
15631: return of a frank relation between them. But to her such a relation
15632: could only come by open speech about their differences, and the attempt
15633: to arrive at a moral understanding; while Tito could only be saved from
15634: alienation from her by such a recovery of her effusive tenderness as
15635: would have presupposed oblivion of their differences. He cared for no
15636: explanation between them; he felt any thorough explanation impossible:
15637: he would have cared to have Romola fond again, and to her, fondness was
15638: impossible. She could be submissive and gentle, she could repress any
15639: sign of repulsion; but tenderness was not to be feigned. She was
15640: helplessly conscious of the result: her husband was alienated from her.
15641: 
15642: It was an additional reason why she should be carefully kept outside of
15643: secrets which he would in no case have chosen to communicate to her.
15644: With regard to his political action he sought to convince her that he
15645: considered the cause of the Medici hopeless; and that on that practical
15646: ground, as well as in theory, he heartily served the popular
15647: government, in which she had now a warm interest. But impressions
15648: subtle as odours made her uneasy about his relations with San Marco.
15649: She was painfully divided between the dread of seeing any evidence to
15650: arouse her suspicions, and the impulse to watch lest any harm should
15651: come that she might have arrested.
15652: 
15653: As they walked together this evening, Tito said—“The business of the
15654: day is not yet quite ended for me. I shall conduct you to our door, my
15655: Romola, and then I must fulfil another commission, which will take me
15656: an hour, perhaps, before I can return and rest, as I very much need to
15657: do.”
15658: 
15659: And then he talked amusingly of what he had seen at Pisa, until they
15660: were close upon a loggia, near which there hung a lamp before a picture
15661: of the Virgin. The street was a quiet one, and hitherto they had passed
15662: few people; but now there was a sound of many approaching footsteps and
15663: confused voices.
15664: 
15665: “We shall not get home without a wetting, unless we take shelter under
15666: this convenient loggia,” Tito said, hastily, hurrying Romola, with a
15667: slightly startled movement, up the step of the loggia.
15668: 
15669: “Surely it is useless to wait for this small drizzling rain,” said
15670: Romola, in surprise.
15671: 
15672: “No: I felt it becoming heavier. Let us wait a little.” With that
15673: wakefulness to the faintest indication which belongs to a mind
15674: habitually in a state of caution, Tito had detected by the glimmer of
15675: the lamp that the leader of the advancing group wore a red feather and
15676: a glittering sword-hilt—in fact, was almost the last person in the
15677: world he would have chosen to meet at this hour with Romola by his
15678: side. He had already during the day had one momentous interview with
15679: Dolfo Spini, and the business he had spoken of to Romola as yet to be
15680: done was a second interview with that personage, a sequence of the
15681: visit he had paid at San Marco. Tito, by a long-preconcerted plan, had
15682: been the bearer of letters to Savonarola—carefully-forged letters; one
15683: of them, by a stratagem, bearing the very signature and seal of the
15684: Cardinal of Naples, who of all the Sacred College had most exerted his
15685: influence at Rome in favour of the Frate. The purport of the letters
15686: was to state that the Cardinal was on his progress from Pisa, and,
15687: unwilling for strong reasons to enter Florence, yet desirous of taking
15688: counsel with Savonarola at this difficult juncture, intended to pause
15689: this very day at San Casciano, about ten miles from the city, whence he
15690: would ride out the next morning in the plain garb of a priest, and meet
15691: Savonarola, as if casually, five miles on the Florence road, two hours
15692: after sunrise. The plot, of which these forged letters were the initial
15693: step, was that Dolfo Spini with a band of his Compagnacci was to be
15694: posted in ambush on the road, at a lonely spot about five miles from
15695: the gates; that he was to seize Savonarola with the Dominican brother
15696: who would accompany him according to rule, and deliver him over to a
15697: small detachment of Milanese horse in readiness near San Casciano, by
15698: whom he was to be carried into the Roman territory.
15699: 
15700: There was a strong chance that the penetrating Frate would suspect a
15701: trap, and decline to incur the risk, which he had for some time
15702: avoided, of going beyond the city walls. Even when he preached, his
15703: friends held it necessary that he should be attended by an armed guard;
15704: and here he was called on to commit himself to a solitary road, with no
15705: other attendant than a fellow-monk. On this ground the minimum of time
15706: had been given him for decision, and the chance in favour of his acting
15707: on the letters was, that the eagerness with which his mind was set on
15708: the combining of interests within and without the Church towards the
15709: procuring of a General Council, and also the expectation of immediate
15710: service from the Cardinal in the actual juncture of his contest with
15711: the Pope, would triumph over his shrewdness and caution in the brief
15712: space allowed for deliberation.
15713: 
15714: Tito had had an audience of Savonarola, having declined to put the
15715: letters into any hands but his, and with consummate art had admitted
15716: that incidentally, and by inference, he was able so far to conjecture
15717: their purport as to believe they referred to a rendezvous outside the
15718: gates, in which case he urged that the Frate should seek an armed guard
15719: from the Signoria, and offered his services in carrying the request
15720: with the utmost privacy. Savonarola had replied briefly that this was
15721: impossible: an armed guard was incompatible with privacy. He spoke with
15722: a flashing eye, and Tito felt convinced that he meant to incur the
15723: risk.
15724: 
15725: Tito himself did not much care for the result. He managed his affairs
15726: so cleverly, that all results, he considered, must turn to his
15727: advantage. Whichever party came uppermost, he was secure of favour and
15728: money. That is an indecorously naked statement; the fact, clothed as
15729: Tito habitually clothed it, was that his acute mind, discerning the
15730: equal hollowness of all parties, took the only rational course in
15731: making them subservient to his own interest.
15732: 
15733: If Savonarola fell into the snare, there were diamonds in question and
15734: papal patronage; if not, Tito’s adroit agency had strengthened his
15735: position with Savonarola and with Spini, while any confidences he
15736: obtained from them made him the more valuable as an agent of the
15737: Mediceans.
15738: 
15739: But Spini was an inconvenient colleague. He had cunning enough to
15740: delight in plots, but not the ability or self-command necessary to so
15741: complex an effect as secrecy. He frequently got excited with drinking,
15742: for even sober Florence had its “Beoni,” or topers, both lay and
15743: clerical, who became loud at taverns and private banquets; and in spite
15744: of the agreement between him and Tito, that their public recognition of
15745: each other should invariably be of the coolest sort, there was always
15746: the possibility that on an evening encounter he would be suddenly
15747: blurting and affectionate. The delicate sign of casting the becchetto
15748: over the left shoulder was understood in the morning, but the strongest
15749: hint short of a threat might not suffice to keep off a fraternal grasp
15750: of the shoulder in the evening.
15751: 
15752: Tito’s chief hope now was that Dolfo Spini had not caught sight of him,
15753: and the hope would have been well founded if Spini had had no clearer
15754: view of him than he had caught of Spini. But, himself in shadow, he had
15755: seen Tito illuminated for an instant by the direct rays of the lamp,
15756: and Tito in his way was as strongly marked a personage as the captain
15757: of the Compagnacci. Romola’s black-shrouded figure had escaped notice,
15758: and she now stood behind her husband’s shoulder in the corner of the
15759: loggia. Tito was not left to hope long.
15760: 
15761: “Ha! my carrier-pigeon!” grated Spini’s harsh voice, in what he meant
15762: to be an undertone, while his hand grasped Tito’s shoulder; “what did
15763: you run into hiding for? You didn’t know it was comrades who were
15764: coming. It’s well I caught sight of you; it saves time. What of the
15765: chase to-morrow morning? Will the bald-headed game rise? Are the
15766: falcons to be got ready?”
15767: 
15768: If it had been in Tito’s nature to feel an access of rage, he would
15769: have felt it against this bull-faced accomplice, unfit either for a
15770: leader or a tool. His lips turned white, but his excitement came from
15771: the pressing difficulty of choosing a safe device. If he attempted to
15772: hush Spini, that would only deepen Romola’s suspicion, and he knew her
15773: well enough to know that if some strong alarm were roused in her, she
15774: was neither to be silenced nor hoodwinked: on the other hand, if he
15775: repelled Spini angrily the wine-breathing Compagnaccio might become
15776: savage, being more ready at resentment than at the divination of
15777: motives. He adopted a third course, which proved that Romola retained
15778: one sort of power over him—the power of dread.
15779: 
15780: He pressed her hand, as if intending a hint to her, and said in a
15781: good-humoured tone of comradeship—
15782: 
15783: “Yes, my Dolfo, you may prepare in all security. But take no trumpets
15784: with you.”
15785: 
15786: “Don’t be afraid,” said Spini, a little piqued. “No need to play Ser
15787: Saccente with me. I know where the devil keeps his tail as well as you
15788: do. What! he swallowed the bait whole? The prophetic nose didn’t scent
15789: the hook at all?” he went on, lowering his tone a little, with a
15790: blundering sense of secrecy.
15791: 
15792: “The brute will not be satisfied till he has emptied the bag,” thought
15793: Tito: but aloud he said,—“Swallowed all as easily as you swallow a cup
15794: of Trebbiano. Ha! I see torches: there must be a dead body coming. The
15795: pestilence has been spreading, I hear.”
15796: 
15797: “Santiddio! I hate the sight of those biers. Good-night,” said Spini,
15798: hastily moving off.
15799: 
15800: The torches were really coming, but they preceded a church dignitary
15801: who was returning homeward; the suggestion of the dead body and the
15802: pestilence was Tito’s device for getting rid of Spini without telling
15803: him to go. The moment he had moved away, Tito turned to Romola, and
15804: said, quietly—
15805: 
15806: “Do not be alarmed by anything that _bestia_ has said, my Romola. We
15807: will go on now: I think the rain has not increased.”
15808: 
15809: She was quivering with indignant resolution; it was of no use for Tito
15810: to speak in that unconcerned way. She distrusted every word he could
15811: utter.
15812: 
15813: “I will not go on,” she said. “I will not move nearer home until I have
15814: some security against this treachery being perpetrated.”
15815: 
15816: “Wait, at least, until these torches have passed,” said Tito, with
15817: perfect self-command, but with a new rising of dislike to a wife who
15818: this time, he foresaw, might have the power of thwarting him in spite
15819: of the husband’s predominance.
15820: 
15821: The torches passed, with the Vicario dell’ Arcivescovo, and due
15822: reverence was done by Tito, but Romola saw nothing outward. If for the
15823: defeat of this treachery, in which she believed with all the force of
15824: long presentiment, it had been necessary at that moment for her to
15825: spring on her husband and hurl herself with him down a precipice, she
15826: felt as if she could have done it. Union with this man! At that moment
15827: the self-quelling discipline of two years seemed to be nullified: she
15828: felt nothing but that they were divided.
15829: 
15830: They were nearly in darkness again, and could only see each other’s
15831: faces dimly.
15832: 
15833: “Tell me the truth, Tito—this time tell me the truth,” said Romola, in
15834: a low quivering voice. “It will be safer for you.”
15835: 
15836: “Why should I desire to tell you anything else, my angry saint?” said
15837: Tito, with a slight touch of contempt, which was the vent of his
15838: annoyance; “since the truth is precisely that over which you have most
15839: reason to rejoice—namely, that my knowing a plot of Spini’s enables me
15840: to secure the Frate from falling a victim to it.”
15841: 
15842: “What is the plot?”
15843: 
15844: “That I decline to tell,” said Tito. “It is enough that the Frate’s
15845: safety will be secured.”
15846: 
15847: “It is a plot for drawing him outside the gates that Spini may murder
15848: him.”
15849: 
15850: “There has been no intention of murder. It is simply a plot for
15851: compelling him to obey the Pope’s summons to Rome. But as I serve the
15852: popular government, and think the Frate’s presence here is a necessary
15853: means of maintaining it at present, I choose to prevent his departure.
15854: You may go to sleep with entire ease of mind to-night.”
15855: 
15856: For a moment Romola was silent. Then she said, in a voice of anguish,
15857: “Tito, it is of no use: I have no belief in you.”
15858: 
15859: She could just discern his action as he shrugged his shoulders, and
15860: spread out his palms in silence. That cold dislike which is the anger
15861: of unimpassioned beings was hardening within him.
15862: 
15863: “If the Frate leaves the city—if any harm happens to him,” said Romola,
15864: after a slight pause, in a new tone of indignant resolution,—“I will
15865: declare what I have heard to the Signoria, and you will be disgraced.
15866: What if I am your wife?” she went on, impetuously; “I will be disgraced
15867: with you. If we are united, I am that part of you that will save you
15868: from crime. Others shall not be betrayed.”
15869: 
15870: “I am quite aware of what you would be likely to do, _anima mia_,” said
15871: Tito, in the coolest of his liquid tones; “therefore if you have a
15872: small amount of reasoning at your disposal just now, consider that if
15873: you believe me in nothing else, you may believe me when I say I will
15874: take care of myself, and not put it in your power to ruin me.”
15875: 
15876: “Then you assure me that the Frate is warned—he will not go beyond the
15877: gates?”
15878: 
15879: “He shall not go beyond the gates.”
15880: 
15881: There was a moment’s pause, but distrust was not to be expelled.
15882: 
15883: “I will go back to San Marco now and find out,” Romola said, making a
15884: movement forward.
15885: 
15886: “You shall not!” said Tito, in a bitter whisper, seizing her wrists
15887: with all his masculine force. “I am master of you. You shall not set
15888: yourself in opposition to me.”
15889: 
15890: There were passers-by approaching. Tito had heard them, and that was
15891: why he spoke in a whisper. Romola was too conscious of being mastered
15892: to have struggled, even if she had remained unconscious that witnesses
15893: were at hand. But she was aware now of footsteps and voices, and her
15894: habitual sense of personal dignity made her at once yield to Tito’s
15895: movement towards leading her from the loggia.
15896: 
15897: They walked on in silence for some time, under the small drizzling
15898: rain. The first rush of indignation and alarm in Romola had begun to
15899: give way to more complicated feelings, which rendered speech and action
15900: difficult. In that simpler state of vehemence, open opposition to the
15901: husband from whom she felt her soul revolting had had the aspect of
15902: temptation for her; it seemed the easiest of all courses. But now,
15903: habits of self-questioning, memories of impulse subdued, and that proud
15904: reserve which all discipline had left unmodified, began to emerge from
15905: the flood of passion. The grasp of her wrists, which asserted her
15906: husband’s physical predominance, instead of arousing a new fierceness
15907: in her, as it might have done if her impetuosity had been of a more
15908: vulgar kind, had given her a momentary shuddering horror at this form
15909: of contest with him. It was the first time they had been in declared
15910: hostility to each other since her flight and return, and the check
15911: given to her ardent resolution then, retained the power to arrest her
15912: now. In this altered condition her mind began to dwell on the
15913: probabilities that would save her from any desperate course: Tito would
15914: not risk betrayal by her; whatever had been his original intention, he
15915: must be determined now by the fact that she knew of the plot. She was
15916: not bound now to do anything else than to hang over him that certainty,
15917: that if he deceived her, her lips would not be closed. And then, it was
15918: possible—yes, she must cling to that possibility till it was
15919: disproved—that Tito had never meant to aid in the betrayal of the
15920: Frate.
15921: 
15922: Tito, on his side, was busy with thoughts, and did not speak again till
15923: they were near home. Then he said—
15924: 
15925: “Well, Romola, have you now had time to recover calmness? If so, you
15926: can supply your want of belief in me by a little rational inference:
15927: you can see, I presume, that if I had had any intention of furthering
15928: Spini’s plot, I should now be aware that the possession of a fair
15929: Piagnone for my wife, who knows the secret of the plot, would be a
15930: serious obstacle in my way.”
15931: 
15932: Tito assumed the tone which was just then the easiest to him,
15933: conjecturing that in Romola’s present mood persuasive deprecation would
15934: be lost upon her.
15935: 
15936: “Yes, Tito,” she said, in a low voice, “I think you believe that I
15937: would guard the Republic from further treachery. You are right to
15938: believe it: if the Frate is betrayed, I will denounce you.” She paused
15939: a moment, and then said, with an effort, “But it was not so. I have
15940: perhaps spoken too hastily—you never meant it. Only, why will you seem
15941: to be that man’s comrade?”
15942: 
15943: “Such relations are inevitable to practical men, my Romola,” said Tito,
15944: gratified by discerning the struggle within her. “You fair creatures
15945: live in the clouds. Pray go to rest with an easy heart,” he added,
15946: opening the door for her.
15947: 
15948: 
15949: 
15950: 
15951: CHAPTER XLVII.
15952: Check.
15953: 
15954: 
15955: Tito’s clever arrangements had been unpleasantly frustrated by trivial
15956: incidents which could not enter into a clever man’s calculations. It
15957: was very seldom that he walked with Romola in the evening, yet he had
15958: happened to be walking with her precisely on this evening when her
15959: presence was supremely inconvenient. Life was so complicated a game
15960: that the devices of skill were liable to be defeated at every turn by
15961: air-blown chances, incalculable as the descent of thistle-down.
15962: 
15963: It was not that he minded about the failure of Spini’s plot, but he
15964: felt an awkward difficulty in so adjusting his warning to Savonarola on
15965: the one hand, and to Spini on the other, as not to incur suspicion.
15966: Suspicion roused in the popular party might be fatal to his reputation
15967: and ostensible position in Florence: suspicion roused in Dolfo Spini
15968: might be as disagreeable in its effects as the hatred of a fierce dog
15969: not to be chained.
15970: 
15971: If Tito went forthwith to the monastery to warn Savonarola before the
15972: monks went to rest, his warning would follow so closely on his delivery
15973: of the forged letters that he could not escape unfavourable surmises.
15974: He could not warn Spini at once without telling him the true reason,
15975: since he could not immediately allege the discovery that Savonarola had
15976: changed his purpose; and he knew Spini well enough to know that his
15977: understanding would discern nothing but that Tito had “turned round”
15978: and frustrated the plot. On the other hand, by deferring his warning to
15979: Savonarola until the morning, he would be almost sure to lose the
15980: opportunity of warning Spini that the Frate had changed his mind; and
15981: the band of Compagnacci would come back in all the rage of
15982: disappointment. This last, however, was the risk he chose, trusting to
15983: his power of soothing Spini by assuring him that the failure was due
15984: only to the Frate’s caution.
15985: 
15986: Tito was annoyed. If he had had to smile it would have been an unusual
15987: effort to him. He was determined not to encounter Romola again, and he
15988: did not go home that night.
15989: 
15990: She watched through the night, and never took off her clothes. She
15991: heard the rain become heavier and heavier. She liked to hear the rain:
15992: the stormy heavens seemed a safeguard against men’s devices, compelling
15993: them to inaction. And Romola’s mind was again assailed, not only by the
15994: utmost doubt of her husband, but by doubt as to her own conduct. What
15995: lie might he not have told her? What project might he not have, of
15996: which she was still ignorant? Every one who trusted Tito was in danger;
15997: it was useless to try and persuade herself of the contrary. And was not
15998: she selfishly listening to the promptings of her own pride, when she
15999: shrank from warning men against him? “If her husband was a malefactor,
16000: her place was in the prison by his side”—that might be; she was
16001: contented to fulfil that claim. But was she, a wife, to allow a husband
16002: to inflict the injuries that would make him a malefactor, when it might
16003: be in her power to prevent them? Prayer seemed impossible to her. The
16004: activity of her thought excluded a mental state of which the essence is
16005: expectant passivity.
16006: 
16007: The excitement became stronger and stronger. Her imagination, in a
16008: state of morbid activity, conjured up possible schemes by which, after
16009: all, Tito would have eluded her threat; and towards daybreak the rain
16010: became less violent, till at last it ceased, the breeze rose again and
16011: dispersed the clouds, and the morning fell clear on all the objects
16012: around her. It made her uneasiness all the less endurable. She wrapped
16013: her mantle round her, and ran up to the loggia, as if there could be
16014: anything in the wide landscape that might determine her action; as if
16015: there could be anything but roofs hiding the line of street along which
16016: Savonarola might be walking towards betrayal.
16017: 
16018: If she went to her godfather, might she not induce him, without any
16019: specific revelation, to take measures for preventing Fra Girolamo from
16020: passing the gates? But that might be too late. Romola thought, with new
16021: distress, that she had failed to learn any guiding details from Tito,
16022: and it was already long past seven. She must go to San Marco: there was
16023: nothing else to be done.
16024: 
16025: She hurried down the stairs, she went out into the street without
16026: looking at her sick people, and walked at a swift pace along the Via
16027: de’ Bardi towards the Ponte Vecchio. She would go through the heart of
16028: the city; it was the most direct road, and, besides, in the great
16029: Piazza there was a chance of encountering her husband, who, by some
16030: possibility to which she still clung, might satisfy her of the Frate’s
16031: safety, and leave no need for her to go to San Marco. When she arrived
16032: in front of the Palazzo Vecchio, she looked eagerly into the pillared
16033: court; then her eyes swept the Piazza; but the well-known figure, once
16034: painted in her heart by young love, and now branded there by eating
16035: pain, was nowhere to be seen. She hurried straight on to the Piazza del
16036: Duomo. It was already full of movement: there were worshippers passing
16037: up and down the marble steps, there were men pausing for chat, and
16038: there were market-people carrying their burdens. Between those moving
16039: figures Romola caught a glimpse of her husband. On his way from San
16040: Marco he had turned into Nello’s shop, and was now leaning against the
16041: door-post. As Romola approached she could see that he was standing and
16042: talking, with the easiest air in the world, holding his cap in his
16043: hand, and shaking back his freshly-combed hair. The contrast of this
16044: ease with the bitter anxieties he had created convulsed her with
16045: indignation: the new vision of his hardness heightened her dread. She
16046: recognised Cronaca and two other frequenters of San Marco standing near
16047: her husband. It flashed through her mind—“I will compel him to speak
16048: before those men.” And her light step brought her close upon him before
16049: he had time to move, while Cronaca was saying, “Here comes Madonna
16050: Romola.”
16051: 
16052: A slight shock passed through Tito’s frame as he felt himself face to
16053: face with his wife. She was haggard with her anxious watching, but
16054: there was a flash of something else than anxiety in her eyes as she
16055: said—
16056: 
16057: “Is the Frate gone beyond the gates?”
16058: 
16059: “No,” said Tito, feeling completely helpless before this woman, and
16060: needing all the self-command he possessed to preserve a countenance in
16061: which there should seem to be nothing stronger than surprise.
16062: 
16063: “And you are certain that he is not going?” she insisted.
16064: 
16065: “I am certain that he is not going.”
16066: 
16067: “That is enough,” said Romola, and she turned up the steps, to take
16068: refuge in the Duomo, till she could recover from her agitation.
16069: 
16070: Tito never had a feeling so near hatred as that with which his eyes
16071: followed Romola retreating up the steps.
16072: 
16073: There were present not only genuine followers of the Frate, but Ser
16074: Ceccone, the notary, who at that time, like Tito himself, was secretly
16075: an agent of the Mediceans.
16076: 
16077: Ser Francesco di Ser Barone, more briefly known to infamy as Ser
16078: Ceccone, was not learned, not handsome, not successful, and the reverse
16079: of generous. He was a traitor without charm. It followed that he was
16080: not fond of Tito Melema.
16081: 
16082: 
16083: 
16084: 
16085: CHAPTER XLVIII.
16086: Counter-Check.
16087: 
16088: 
16089: It was late in the afternoon when Tito returned home. Romola, seated
16090: opposite the cabinet in her narrow room, copying documents, was about
16091: to desist from her work because the light was getting dim, when her
16092: husband entered. He had come straight to this room to seek her, with a
16093: thoroughly defined intention, and there was something new to Romola in
16094: his manner and expression as he looked at her silently on entering,
16095: and, without taking off his cap and mantle, leaned one elbow on the
16096: cabinet, and stood directly in front of her.
16097: 
16098: Romola, fully assured during the day of the Frate’s safety, was feeling
16099: the reaction of some penitence for the access of distrust and
16100: indignation which had impelled her to address her husband publicly on a
16101: matter that she knew he wished to be private. She told herself that she
16102: had probably been wrong. The scheming duplicity which she had heard
16103: even her godfather allude to as inseparable from party tactics might be
16104: sufficient to account for the connection with Spini, without the
16105: supposition that Tito had ever meant to further the plot. She wanted to
16106: atone for her impetuosity by confessing that she had been too hasty,
16107: and for some hours her mind had been dwelling on the possibility that
16108: this confession of hers might lead to other frank words breaking the
16109: two years’ silence of their hearts. The silence had been so complete,
16110: that Tito was ignorant of her having fled from him and come back again;
16111: they had never approached an avowal of that past which, both in its
16112: young love and in the shock that shattered the love, lay locked away
16113: from them like a banquet-room where death had once broken the feast.
16114: 
16115: She looked up at him with that submission in her glance which belonged
16116: to her state of self-reproof; but the subtle change in his face and
16117: manner arrested her speech. For a few moments they remained silent,
16118: looking at each other.
16119: 
16120: Tito himself felt that a crisis was come in his married life. The
16121: husband’s determination to mastery, which lay deep below all blandness
16122: and beseechingness, had risen permanently to the surface now, and
16123: seemed to alter his face, as a face is altered by a hidden muscular
16124: tension with which a man is secretly throttling or stamping out the
16125: life from something feeble, yet dangerous.
16126: 
16127: “Romola,” he began, in the cool liquid tone that made her shiver, “it
16128: is time that we should understand each other.” He paused.
16129: 
16130: “That is what I most desire, Tito,” she said, faintly. Her sweet pale
16131: face; with all its anger gone and nothing but the timidity of
16132: self-doubt in it, seemed to give a marked predominance to her husband’s
16133: dark strength.
16134: 
16135: “You took a step this morning,” Tito went on, “which you must now
16136: yourself perceive to have been useless—which exposed you to remark and
16137: may involve me in serious practical difficulties.”
16138: 
16139: “I acknowledge that I was too hasty; I am sorry for any injustice I may
16140: have done you.” Romola spoke these words in a fuller and firmer tone;
16141: Tito, she hoped, would look less hard when she had expressed her
16142: regret, and then she could say other things.
16143: 
16144: “I wish you once for all to understand,” he said, without any change of
16145: voice, “that such collisions are incompatible with our position as
16146: husband and wife. I wish you to reflect on the mode in which you were
16147: led to that step, that the process may not be repeated.”
16148: 
16149: “That depends chiefly on you, Tito,” said Romola, taking fire slightly.
16150: It was not at all what she had thought of saying, but we see a very
16151: little way before us in mutual speech.
16152: 
16153: “You would say, I suppose,” answered Tito, “that nothing is to occur in
16154: future which can excite your unreasonable suspicions. You were frank
16155: enough to say last night that you have no belief in me. I am not
16156: surprised at any exaggerated conclusion you may draw from slight
16157: premises, but I wish to point out to you what is likely to be the fruit
16158: of your making such exaggerated conclusions a ground for interfering in
16159: affairs of which you are ignorant. Your attention is thoroughly awake
16160: to what I am saying?”
16161: 
16162: He paused for a reply.
16163: 
16164: “Yes,” said Romola, flushing in irrepressible resentment at this cold
16165: tone of superiority.
16166: 
16167: “Well, then, it may possibly not be very long before some other chance
16168: words or incidents set your imagination at work devising crimes for me,
16169: and you may perhaps rush to the Palazzo Vecchio to alarm the Signoria
16170: and set the city in an uproar. Shall I tell you what may be the result?
16171: Not simply the disgrace of your husband, to which you look forward with
16172: so much courage, but the arrest and ruin of many among the chief men in
16173: Florence, including Messer Bernardo del Nero.”
16174: 
16175: Tito had meditated a decisive move, and he had made it. The flush died
16176: out of Romola’s face, and her very lips were pale—an unusual effect
16177: with her, for she was little subject to fear. Tito perceived his
16178: success.
16179: 
16180: “You would perhaps flatter yourself,” he went on, “that you were
16181: performing a heroic deed of deliverance; you might as well try to turn
16182: locks with fine words as apply such notions to the politics of
16183: Florence. The question now is, not whether you can have any belief in
16184: me, but whether, now you have been warned, you will dare to rush, like
16185: a blind man with a torch in his hand, amongst intricate affairs of
16186: which you know nothing.”
16187: 
16188: Romola felt as if her mind were held in a vice by Tito’s: the
16189: possibilities he had indicated were rising before her with terrible
16190: clearness.
16191: 
16192: “I am too rash,” she said. “I will try not to be rash.”
16193: 
16194: “Remember,” said Tito, with unsparing insistence, “that your act of
16195: distrust towards me this morning might, for aught you knew, have had
16196: more fatal effects than that sacrifice of your husband which you have
16197: learned to contemplate without flinching.”
16198: 
16199: “Tito, it is not so,” Romola burst forth in a pleading tone, rising and
16200: going nearer to him, with a desperate resolution to speak out. “It is
16201: false that I would willingly sacrifice you. It has been the greatest
16202: effort of my life to cling to you. I went away in my anger two years
16203: ago, and I came back again because I was more bound to you than to
16204: anything else on earth. But it is useless. You shut me out from your
16205: mind. You affect to think of me as a being too unreasonable to share in
16206: the knowledge of your affairs. You will be open with me about nothing.”
16207: 
16208: She looked like his good angel pleading with him, as she bent her face
16209: towards him with dilated eyes, and laid her hand upon his arm. But
16210: Romola’s touch and glance no longer stirred any fibre of tenderness in
16211: her husband. The good-humoured, tolerant Tito, incapable of hatred,
16212: incapable almost of impatience, disposed always to be gentle towards
16213: the rest of the world, felt himself becoming strangely hard towards
16214: this wife whose presence had once been the strongest influence he had
16215: known. With all his softness of disposition, he had a masculine
16216: effectiveness of intellect and purpose which, like sharpness of edge,
16217: is itself an energy, working its way without any strong momentum.
16218: Romola had an energy of her own which thwarted his, and no man, who is
16219: not exceptionally feeble, will endure being thwarted by his wife.
16220: Marriage must be a relation either of sympathy or of conquest.
16221: 
16222: No emotion darted across his face as he heard Romola for the first time
16223: speak of having gone away from him. His lips only looked a little
16224: harder as he smiled slightly and said—
16225: 
16226: “My Romola, when certain conditions are ascertained, we must make up
16227: our minds to them. No amount of wishing will fill the Arno, as your
16228: people say, or turn a plum into an orange. I have not observed even
16229: that prayers have much efficacy that way. You are so constituted as to
16230: have certain strong impressions inaccessible to reason: I cannot share
16231: those impressions, and you have withdrawn all trust from me in
16232: consequence. You have changed towards me; it has followed that I have
16233: changed towards you. It is useless to take any retrospect. We have
16234: simply to adapt ourselves to altered conditions.”
16235: 
16236: “Tito, it would not be useless for us to speak openly,” said Romola,
16237: with the sort of exasperation that comes from using living muscle
16238: against some lifeless insurmountable resistance. “It was the sense of
16239: deception in you that changed me, and that has kept us apart. And it is
16240: not true that I changed first. You changed towards me the night you
16241: first wore that chain-armour. You had some secret from me—it was about
16242: that old man—and I saw him again yesterday. Tito,” she went on, in a
16243: tone of agonised entreaty, “if you would once tell me everything, let
16244: it be what it may—I would not mind pain—that there might be no wall
16245: between us! Is it not possible that we could begin a new life?”
16246: 
16247: This time there was a flash of emotion across Tito’s face. He stood
16248: perfectly still; but the flash seemed to have whitened him. He took no
16249: notice of Romola’s appeal, but after a moment’s pause, said quietly—
16250: 
16251: “Your impetuosity about trifles, Romola, has a freezing influence that
16252: would cool the baths of Nero.” At these cutting words, Romola shrank
16253: and drew herself up into her usual self-sustained attitude. Tito went
16254: on. “If by ‘that old man’ you mean the mad Jacopo di Nola who attempted
16255: my life and made a strange accusation against me, of which I told you
16256: nothing because it would have alarmed you to no purpose, he, poor
16257: wretch, has died in prison. I saw his name in the list of dead.”
16258: 
16259: “I know nothing about his accusation,” said Romola. “But I know he is
16260: the man whom I saw with the rope round his neck in the Duomo—the man
16261: whose portrait Piero di Cosimo painted, grasping your arm as he saw him
16262: grasp it the day the French entered, the day you first wore the
16263: armour.”
16264: 
16265: “And where is he now, pray?” said Tito, still pale, but governing
16266: himself.
16267: 
16268: “He was lying lifeless in the street from starvation,” said Romola. “I
16269: revived him with bread and wine. I brought him to our door, but he
16270: refused to come in. Then I gave him some money, and he went away
16271: without telling me anything. But he had found out that I was your wife.
16272: Who is he?”
16273: 
16274: “A man, half mad, half imbecile, who was once my father’s servant in
16275: Greece, and who has a rancorous hatred towards me because I got him
16276: dismissed for theft. Now you have the whole mystery, and the further
16277: satisfaction of knowing that I am again in danger of assassination. The
16278: fact of my wearing the armour, about which you seem to have thought so
16279: much, must have led you to infer that I was in danger from this man.
16280: Was that the reason you chose to cultivate his acquaintance and invite
16281: him into the house?”
16282: 
16283: Romola was mute. To speak was only like rushing with bare breast
16284: against a shield.
16285: 
16286: Tito moved from his leaning posture, slowly took off his cap and
16287: mantle, and pushed back his hair. He was collecting himself for some
16288: final words. And Romola stood upright looking at him as she might have
16289: looked at some on-coming deadly force, to be met only by silent
16290: endurance.
16291: 
16292: “We need not refer to these matters again, Romola,” he said, precisely
16293: in the same tone as that in which he had spoken at first. “It is enough
16294: if you will remember that the next time your generous ardour leads you
16295: to interfere in political affairs, you are likely, not to save any one
16296: from danger, but to be raising scaffolds and setting houses on fire.
16297: You are not yet a sufficiently ardent Piagnone to believe that Messer
16298: Bernardo del Nero is the prince of darkness, and Messer Francesco
16299: Valori the archangel Michael. I think I need demand no promise from
16300: you?”
16301: 
16302: “I have understood you too well, Tito.”
16303: 
16304: “It is enough,” he said, leaving the room.
16305: 
16306: Romola turned round with despair in her face and sank into her seat. “O
16307: God, I have tried—I cannot help it. We shall always be divided.” Those
16308: words passed silently through her mind. “Unless,” she said aloud, as if
16309: some sudden vision had startled her into speech—“unless misery should
16310: come and join us!”
16311: 
16312: Tito, too, had a new thought in his mind after he had closed the door
16313: behind him. With the project of leaving Florence as soon as his life
16314: there had become a high enough stepping-stone to a life elsewhere,
16315: perhaps at Rome or Milan, there was now for the first time associated a
16316: desire to be free from Romola, and to leave her behind him. She had
16317: ceased to belong to the desirable furniture of his life: there was no
16318: possibility of an easy relation between them without genuineness on his
16319: part. Genuineness implied confession of the past, and confession
16320: involved a change of purpose. But Tito had as little bent that way as a
16321: leopard has to lap milk when its teeth are grown. From all relations
16322: that were not easy and agreeable, we know that Tito shrank: why should
16323: he cling to them?
16324: 
16325: And Romola had made his relations difficult with others besides
16326: herself. He had had a troublesome interview with Dolfo Spini, who had
16327: come back in a rage after an ineffectual soaking with rain and long
16328: waiting in ambush, and that scene between Romola and himself at Nello’s
16329: door, once reported in Spini’s ear, might be a seed of something more
16330: unmanageable than suspicion. But now, at least, he believed that he had
16331: mastered Romola by a terror which appealed to the strongest forces of
16332: her nature. He had alarmed her affection and her conscience by the
16333: shadowy image of consequences; he had arrested her intellect by hanging
16334: before it the idea of a hopeless complexity in affairs which defied any
16335: moral judgment.
16336: 
16337: Yet Tito was not at ease. The world was not yet quite cushioned with
16338: velvet, and, if it had been, he could not have abandoned himself to
16339: that softness with thorough enjoyment; for before he went out again
16340: this evening he put on his coat of chain-armour.
16341: 
16342: 
16343: 
16344: 
16345: CHAPTER XLIX.
16346: The Pyramid of Vanities.
16347: 
16348: 
16349: The wintry days passed for Romola as the white ships pass one who is
16350: standing lonely on the shore—passing in silence and sameness, yet each
16351: bearing a hidden burden of coming change. Tito’s hint had mingled so
16352: much dread with her interest in the progress of public affairs that she
16353: had begun to court ignorance rather than knowledge. The threatening
16354: German Emperor was gone again; and, in other ways besides, the position
16355: of Florence was alleviated; but so much distress remained that Romola’s
16356: active duties were hardly diminished, and in these, as usual, her mind
16357: found a refuge from its doubt.
16358: 
16359: She dared not rejoice that the relief which had come in extremity and
16360: had appeared to justify the policy of the Frate’s party was making that
16361: party so triumphant, that Francesco Valori, hot-tempered chieftain of
16362: the Piagnoni, had been elected Gonfaloniere at the beginning of the
16363: year, and was making haste to have as much of his own liberal way as
16364: possible during his two months of power. That seemed for the moment
16365: like a strengthening of the party most attached to freedom, and a
16366: reinforcement of protection to Savonarola; but Romola was now alive to
16367: every suggestion likely to deepen her foreboding, that whatever the
16368: present might be, it was only an unconscious brooding over the mixed
16369: germs of Change which might any day become tragic. And already by
16370: Carnival time, a little after mid-February, her presentiment was
16371: confirmed by the signs of a very decided change: the Mediceans had
16372: ceased to be passive, and were openly exerting themselves to procure
16373: the election of Bernardo del Nero as the new Gonfaloniere.
16374: 
16375: On the last day of the Carnival, between ten and eleven in the morning,
16376: Romola walked out, according to promise, towards the Corso degli
16377: Albizzi, to fetch her cousin Brigida, that they might both be ready to
16378: start from the Via de’ Bardi early in the afternoon, and take their
16379: places at a window which Tito had had reserved for them in the Piazza
16380: della Signoria, where there was to be a scene of so new and striking a
16381: sort, that all Florentine eyes must desire to see it. For the Piagnoni
16382: were having their own way thoroughly about the mode of keeping the
16383: Carnival. In vain Dolfo Spini and his companions had struggled to get
16384: up the dear old masques and practical jokes, well spiced with
16385: indecency. Such things were not to be in a city where Christ had been
16386: declared king.
16387: 
16388: Romola set out in that languid state of mind with which every one
16389: enters on a long day of sight-seeing purely for the sake of gratifying
16390: a child, or some dear childish friend. The day was certainly an epoch
16391: in carnival-keeping; but this phase of reform had not touched her
16392: enthusiasm: and she did not know that it was an epoch in her own life
16393: when _another_ lot would begin to be no longer secretly but visibly
16394: entwined with her own.
16395: 
16396: She chose to go through the great Piazza that she might take a first
16397: survey of the unparalleled sight there while she was still alone.
16398: Entering it from the south, she saw something monstrous and
16399: many-coloured in the shape of a pyramid, or, rather, like a huge
16400: fir-tree, sixty feet high, with shelves on the branches, widening and
16401: widening towards the base till they reached a circumference of eighty
16402: yards. The Piazza was full of life: slight young figures, in white
16403: garments, with olive wreaths on their heads, were moving to and fro
16404: about the base of the pyramidal tree, carrying baskets full of
16405: bright-coloured things; and maturer forms, some in the monastic frock,
16406: some in the loose tunics and dark-red caps of artists, were helping and
16407: examining, or else retreating to various points in the distance to
16408: survey the wondrous whole: while a considerable group, amongst whom
16409: Romola recognised Piero di Cosimo, standing on the marble steps of
16410: Orgagna’s Loggia, seemed to be keeping aloof in discontent and scorn.
16411: 
16412: Approaching nearer, she paused to look at the multifarious objects
16413: ranged in gradation from the base to the summit of the pyramid. There
16414: were tapestries and brocades of immodest design, pictures and
16415: sculptures held too likely to incite to vice; there were boards and
16416: tables for all sorts of games, playing-cards along with the blocks for
16417: printing them, dice, and other apparatus for gambling; there were
16418: worldly music-books, and musical instruments in all the pretty
16419: varieties of lute, drum, cymbal, and trumpet; there were masks and
16420: masquerading-dresses used in the old Carnival shows; there were
16421: handsome copies of Ovid, Boccaccio, Petrarca, Pulci, and other books of
16422: a vain or impure sort; there were all the implements of feminine
16423: vanity—rouge-pots, false hair, mirrors, perfumes, powders, and
16424: transparent veils intended to provoke inquisitive glances: lastly, at
16425: the very summit, there was the unflattering effigy of a probably
16426: mythical Venetian merchant, who was understood to have offered a heavy
16427: sum for this collection of marketable abominations, and, soaring above
16428: him in surpassing ugliness, the symbolic figure of the old debauched
16429: Carnival.
16430: 
16431: This was the preparation for a new sort of bonfire—the Burning of
16432: Vanities. Hidden in the interior of the pyramid was a plentiful store
16433: of dry fuel and gunpowder; and on this last day of the festival, at
16434: evening, the pile of vanities was to be set ablaze to the sound of
16435: trumpets, and the ugly old Carnival was to tumble into the flames amid
16436: the songs of reforming triumph.
16437: 
16438: This crowning act of the new festivities could hardly have been
16439: prepared but for a peculiar organisation which had been started by
16440: Savonarola two years before. The mass of the Florentine boyhood and
16441: youth was no longer left to its own genial promptings towards street
16442: mischief and crude dissoluteness. Under the training of Fra Domenico, a
16443: sort of lieutenant to Savonarola, lads and striplings, the hope of
16444: Florence, were to have none but pure words on their lips, were to have
16445: a zeal for Unseen Good that should put to shame the lukewarmness of
16446: their elders, and were to know no pleasures save of an angelic
16447: sort—singing divine praises and walking in white robes. It was for them
16448: that the ranges of seats had been raised high against the walls of the
16449: Duomo; and they had been used to hear Savonarola appeal to them as the
16450: future glory of a city specially appointed to do the work of God.
16451: 
16452: These fresh-cheeked troops were the chief agents in the regenerated
16453: merriment of the new Carnival, which was a sort of sacred parody of the
16454: old. Had there been bonfires in the old time? There was to be a bonfire
16455: now, consuming impurity from off the earth. Had there been symbolic
16456: processions? There were to be processions now, but the symbols were to
16457: be white robes and red crosses and olive wreaths—emblems of peace and
16458: innocent gladness—and the banners and images held aloft were to tell
16459: the triumphs of goodness. Had there been dancing in a ring under the
16460: open sky of the Piazza, to the sound of choral voices chanting loose
16461: songs? There was to be dancing in a ring now, but dancing of monks and
16462: laity in fraternal love and divine joy, and the music was to be the
16463: music of hymns. As for the collections from street passengers, they
16464: were to be greater than ever—not for gross and superfluous suppers, but
16465: for the benefit of the hungry and needy; and, besides, there was the
16466: collecting of the _Anathema_, or the Vanities to be laid on the great
16467: pyramidal bonfire.
16468: 
16469: Troops of young inquisitors went from house to house on this exciting
16470: business of asking that the Anathema should be given up to them.
16471: Perhaps, after the more avowed vanities had been surrendered, Madonna,
16472: at the head of the household, had still certain little reddened balls
16473: brought from the Levant, intended to produce on a sallow cheek a sudden
16474: bloom of the most ingenuous falsity? If so, let her bring them down and
16475: cast them into the basket of doom. Or, perhaps, she had ringlets and
16476: coils of “dead hair?”—if so, let her bring them to the streetdoor, not
16477: on her head, but in her hands, and publicly renounce the Anathema which
16478: hid the respectable signs of age under a ghastly mockery of youth. And,
16479: in reward, she would hear fresh young voices pronounce a blessing on
16480: her and her house.
16481: 
16482: The beardless inquisitors, organised into little regiments, doubtless
16483: took to their work very willingly. To coerce people by shame, or other
16484: spiritual pelting, into the giving up of things it will probably vex
16485: them to part with, is a form of piety to which the boyish mind is most
16486: readily converted; and if some obstinately wicked men got enraged and
16487: threatened the whip or the cudgel, this also was exciting. Savonarola
16488: himself evidently felt about the training of these boys the difficulty
16489: weighing on all minds with noble yearnings towards great ends, yet with
16490: that imperfect perception of means which forces a resort to some
16491: supernatural constraining influence as the only sure hope. The
16492: Florentine youth had had very evil habits and foul tongues: it seemed
16493: at first an unmixed blessing when they were got to shout “_Viva Gesù_!”
16494: But Savonarola was forced at last to say from the pulpit, “There is a
16495: little too much shouting of ‘_Viva Gesù_!’ This constant utterance of
16496: sacred words brings them into contempt. Let me have no more of that
16497: shouting till the next Festa.”
16498: 
16499: Nevertheless, as the long stream of white-robed youthfulness, with its
16500: little red crosses and olive wreaths, had gone to the Duomo at dawn
16501: this morning to receive the communion from the hands of Savonarola, it
16502: was a sight of beauty; and, doubtless, many of those young souls were
16503: laying up memories of hope and awe that might save them from ever
16504: resting in a merely vulgar view of their work as men and citizens.
16505: There is no kind of conscious obedience that is not an advance on
16506: lawlessness, and these boys became the generation of men who fought
16507: greatly and endured greatly in the last struggle of their Republic.
16508: Now, in the intermediate hours between the early communion and
16509: dinner-time, they were making their last perambulations to collect alms
16510: and vanities, and this was why Romola saw the slim white figures moving
16511: to and fro about the base of the great pyramid.
16512: 
16513: “What think you of this folly, Madonna Romola?” said a brusque voice
16514: close to her ear. “Your Piagnoni will make _l’inferno_ a pleasant
16515: prospect to us, if they are to carry things their own way on earth.
16516: It’s enough to fetch a cudgel over the mountains to see painters, like
16517: Lorenzo di Credi and young Baccio there, helping to burn colour out of
16518: life in this fashion.”
16519: 
16520: “My good Piero,” said Romola, looking up and smiling at the grim man,
16521: “even you must be glad to see some of these things burnt. Look at those
16522: gewgaws and wigs and rouge-pots: I have heard you talk as indignantly
16523: against those things as Fra Girolamo himself.”
16524: 
16525: “What then?” said Piero, turning round on her sharply. “I never said a
16526: woman should make a black patch of herself against the background. Va!
16527: Madonna Antigone, it’s a shame for a woman with your hair and shoulders
16528: to run into such nonsense—leave it to women who are not worth painting.
16529: What! the most holy Virgin herself has always been dressed well; that’s
16530: the doctrine of the Church:—talk of heresy, indeed! And I should like
16531: to know what the excellent Messer Bardo would have said to the burning
16532: of the divine poets by these Frati, who are no better an imitation of
16533: men than if they were onions with the bulbs uppermost. Look at that
16534: Petrarca sticking up beside a rouge-pot: do the idiots pretend that the
16535: heavenly Laura was a painted harridan? And Boccaccio, now: do you mean
16536: to say, Madonna Romola—you who are fit to be a model for a wise Saint
16537: Catherine of Egypt—do you mean to say you have never read the stories
16538: of the immortal Messer Giovanni?”
16539: 
16540: “It is true I have read them, Piero,” said Romola. “Some of them a
16541: great many times over, when I was a little girl. I used to get the book
16542: down when my father was asleep, so that I could read to myself.”
16543: 
16544: “_Ebbene_?” said Piero, in a fiercely challenging tone.
16545: 
16546: “There are some things in them I do not want ever to forget,” said
16547: Romola; “but you must confess, Piero, that a great many of those
16548: stories are only about low deceit for the lowest ends. Men do not want
16549: books to make them think lightly of vice, as if life were a vulgar
16550: joke. And I cannot blame Fra Girolamo for teaching that we owe our time
16551: to something better.”
16552: 
16553: “Yes, yes, it’s very well to say so now you’ve read them,” said Piero,
16554: bitterly, turning on his heel and walking away from her.
16555: 
16556: Romola, too, walked on, smiling at Piero’s innuendo, with a sort of
16557: tenderness towards the old painter’s anger, because she knew that her
16558: father would have felt something like it. For herself, she was
16559: conscious of no inward collision with the strict and sombre view of
16560: pleasure which tended to repress poetry in the attempt to repress vice.
16561: Sorrow and joy have each their peculiar narrowness; and a religious
16562: enthusiasm like Savonarola’s which ultimately blesses mankind by giving
16563: the soul a strong propulsion towards sympathy with pain, indignation
16564: against wrong, and the subjugation of sensual desire, must always incur
16565: the reproach of a great negation. Romola’s life had given her an
16566: affinity for sadness which inevitably made her unjust towards
16567: merriment. That subtle result of culture which we call Taste was
16568: subdued by the need for deeper motive; just as the nicer demands of the
16569: palate are annihilated by urgent hunger. Moving habitually amongst
16570: scenes of suffering, and carrying woman’s heaviest disappointment in
16571: her heart, the severity which allied itself with self-renouncing
16572: beneficent strength had no dissonance for her.
16573: 
16574: 
16575: 
16576: 
16577: CHAPTER L.
16578: Tessa Abroad and at Home.
16579: 
16580: 
16581: Another figure easily recognised by us—a figure not clad in black, but
16582: in the old red, green, and white—was approaching the Piazza that
16583: morning to see the Carnival. She came from an opposite point, for Tessa
16584: no longer lived on the hill of San Giorgio. After what had happened
16585: there with Baldassarre, Tito had thought it best for that and other
16586: reasons to find her a new home, but still in a quiet airy quarter, in a
16587: house bordering on the wide garden grounds north of the Porta Santa
16588: Croce.
16589: 
16590: Tessa was not come out sight-seeing without special leave. Tito had
16591: been with her the evening before, and she had kept back the entreaty
16592: which she felt to be swelling her heart and throat until she saw him in
16593: a state of radiant ease, with one arm round the sturdy Lillo, and the
16594: other resting gently on her own shoulder as she tried to make the tiny
16595: Ninna steady on her legs. She was sure then that the weariness with
16596: which he had come in and flung himself into his chair had quite melted
16597: away from his brow and lips. Tessa had not been slow at learning a few
16598: small stratagems by which she might avoid vexing Naldo and yet have a
16599: little of her own way. She could read nothing else, but she had learned
16600: to read a good deal in her husband’s face.
16601: 
16602: And certainly the charm of that bright, gentle-humoured Tito who woke
16603: up under the Loggia de’ Cerchi on a Lenten morning five years before,
16604: not having yet given any hostages to deceit, never returned so nearly
16605: as in the person of Naldo, seated in that straight-backed, carved
16606: arm-chair which he had provided for his comfort when he came to see
16607: Tessa and the children. Tito himself was surprised at the growing sense
16608: of relief which he felt in these moments. No guile was needed towards
16609: Tessa: she was too ignorant and too innocent to suspect him of
16610: anything. And the little voices calling him “Babbo” were very sweet in
16611: his ears for the short while that he heard them. When he thought of
16612: leaving Florence, he never thought of leaving Tessa and the little ones
16613: behind. He was very fond of these round-cheeked, wide-eyed human things
16614: that clung about him and knew no evil of him. And wherever affection
16615: can spring, it is like the green leaf and the blossom—pure, and
16616: breathing purity, whatever soil it may grow in. Poor Romola, with all
16617: her self-sacrificing effort, was really helping to harden Tito’s nature
16618: by chilling it with a positive dislike which had beforehand seemed
16619: impossible in him; but Tessa kept open the fountains of kindness.
16620: 
16621: “Ninna is very good without me now,” began Tessa, feeling her request
16622: rising very high in her throat, and letting Ninna seat herself on the
16623: floor. “I can leave her with Monna Lisa any time, and if she is in the
16624: cradle and cries, Lillo is as sensible as can be—he goes and thumps
16625: Monna Lisa.”
16626: 
16627: Lillo, whose great dark eyes looked all the darker because his curls
16628: were of a light-brown like his mother’s, jumped off Babbo’s knee, and
16629: went forthwith to attest his intelligence by thumping Monna Lisa, who
16630: was shaking her head slowly over her spinning at the other end of the
16631: room. “A wonderful boy!” said Tito, laughing. “Isn’t he?” said Tessa,
16632: eagerly, getting a little closer to him; “and I might go and see the
16633: Carnival to-morrow, just for an hour or two, mightn’t I?”
16634: 
16635: “Oh, you wicked pigeon!” said Tito, pinching her cheek; “those are your
16636: longings, are they? What have you to do with carnivals now you are an
16637: old woman with two children?”
16638: 
16639: “But old women like to see things,” said Tessa, her lower lip hanging a
16640: little. “Monna Lisa said she should like to go, only she’s so deaf she
16641: can’t hear what is behind her, and she thinks we couldn’t take care of
16642: both the children.”
16643: 
16644: “No, indeed, Tessa,” said Tito, looking rather grave, “you must not
16645: think of taking the children into the crowded streets, else I shall be
16646: angry.”
16647: 
16648: “But I have never been into the Piazza without leave,” said Tessa, in a
16649: frightened, pleading tone, “since the Holy Saturday, and I think Nofri
16650: is dead, for you know the poor _madre_ died; and I shall never forget
16651: the Carnival I saw once; it was so pretty—all roses and a king and
16652: queen under them—and singing. I liked it better than the San Giovanni.”
16653: 
16654: “But there’s nothing like that now, my Tessa. They are going to make a
16655: bonfire in the Piazza—that’s all. But I cannot let you go out by
16656: yourself in the evening.”
16657: 
16658: “Oh no, no! I don’t want to go in the evening. I only want to go and
16659: see the procession by daylight. There _will_ be a procession—is it not
16660: true?”
16661: 
16662: “Yes, after a sort,” said Tito, “as lively as a flight of cranes. You
16663: must not expect roses and glittering kings and queens, my Tessa.
16664: However, I suppose any string of people to be called a procession will
16665: please your blue eyes. And there’s a thing they have raised in the
16666: Piazza de’ Signori for the bonfire. You may like to see that. But come
16667: home early, and look like a grave little old woman; and if you see any
16668: men with feathers and swords, keep out of their way: they are very
16669: fierce, and like to cut old women’s heads off.”
16670: 
16671: “Santa Madonna! where do they come from? Ah! you are laughing; it is
16672: not so bad. But I will keep away from them. Only,” Tessa went on in a
16673: whisper, putting her lips near Naldo’s ear, “if I might take Lillo with
16674: me! He is very sensible.”
16675: 
16676: “But who will thump Monna Lisa then, if she doesn’t hear?” said Tito,
16677: finding it difficult not to laugh, but thinking it necessary to look
16678: serious. “No, Tessa, you could not take care of Lillo if you got into a
16679: crowd, and he’s too heavy for you to carry him.”
16680: 
16681: “It is true,” said Tessa, rather sadly, “and he likes to run away. I
16682: forgot that. Then I will go alone. But now look at Ninna—you have not
16683: looked at her enough.”
16684: 
16685: Ninna was a blue-eyed thing, at the tottering, tumbling age—a fair
16686: solid, which, like a loaded die, found its base with a constancy that
16687: warranted prediction. Tessa went to snatch her up, and when Babbo was
16688: paying due attention to the recent teeth and other marvels, she said,
16689: in a whisper, “And shall I buy some confetti for the children?”
16690: 
16691: Tito drew some small coins from his scarsella, and poured them into her
16692: palm.
16693: 
16694: “That will buy no end,” said Tessa, delighted at this abundance. “I
16695: shall not mind going without Lillo so much, if I bring him something.”
16696: 
16697: So Tessa set out in the morning towards the great Piazza where the
16698: bonfire was to be. She did not think the February breeze cold enough to
16699: demand further covering than her green woollen dress. A mantle would
16700: have been oppressive, for it would have hidden a new necklace and a new
16701: clasp, mounted with silver, the only ornamental presents Tito had ever
16702: made her. Tessa did not think at all of showing her figure, for no one
16703: had ever told her it was pretty; but she was quite sure that her
16704: necklace and clasp were of the prettiest sort ever worn by the richest
16705: contadina, and she arranged her white hood over her head so that the
16706: front of her necklace might be well displayed. These ornaments, she
16707: considered, must inspire respect for her as the wife of some one who
16708: could afford to buy them.
16709: 
16710: She tripped along very cheerily in the February sunshine, thinking much
16711: of the purchases for the little ones, with which she was to fill her
16712: small basket, and not thinking at all of any one who might be observing
16713: her. Yet her descent from her upper storey into the street had been
16714: watched, and she was being kept in sight as she walked by a person who
16715: had often waited in vain to see if it were not Tessa who lived in that
16716: house to which he had more than once dogged Tito. Baldassarre was
16717: carrying a package of yarn: he was constantly employed in that way, as
16718: a means of earning his scanty bread, and keeping the sacred fire of
16719: vengeance alive; and he had come out of his way this morning, as he had
16720: often done before, that he might pass by the house to which he had
16721: followed Tito in the evening. His long imprisonment had so intensified
16722: his timid suspicion and his belief in some diabolic fortune favouring
16723: Tito, that he had not dared to pursue him, except under cover of a
16724: crowd or of the darkness; he felt, with instinctive horror, that if
16725: Tito’s eyes fell upon him, he should again be held up to obloquy, again
16726: be dragged away; his weapon would be taken from him, and he should be
16727: cast helpless into a prison-cell. His fierce purpose had become as
16728: stealthy as a serpent’s, which depends for its prey on one dart of the
16729: fang. Justice was weak and unfriended; and he could not hear again the
16730: voice that pealed the promise of vengeance in the Duomo; he had been
16731: there again and again, but that voice, too, had apparently been stifled
16732: by cunning strong-armed wickedness. For a long while, Baldassarre’s
16733: ruling thought was to ascertain whether Tito still wore the armour, for
16734: now at last his fainting hope would have been contented with a
16735: successful stab on this side the grave; but he would never risk his
16736: precious knife again. It was a weary time he had had to wait for the
16737: chance of answering this question by touching Tito’s back in the press
16738: of the street. Since then, the knowledge that the sharp steel was
16739: useless, and that he had no hope but in some new device, had fallen
16740: with leaden weight on his enfeebled mind. A dim vision of winning one
16741: of those two wives to aid him came before him continually, and
16742: continually slid away. The wife who had lived on the hill was no longer
16743: there. If he could find her again, he might grasp some thread of a
16744: project, and work his way to more clearness.
16745: 
16746: And this morning he had succeeded. He was quite certain now where this
16747: wife lived, and as he walked, bent a little under his burden of yarn,
16748: yet keeping the green and white figure in sight, his mind was dwelling
16749: upon her and her circumstances as feeble eyes dwell on lines and
16750: colours, trying to interpret them into consistent significance.
16751: 
16752: Tessa had to pass through various long streets without seeing any other
16753: sign of the Carnival than unusual groups of the country people in their
16754: best garments, and that disposition in everybody to chat and loiter
16755: which marks the early hours of a holiday, before the spectacle has
16756: begun. Presently, in her disappointed search for remarkable objects,
16757: her eyes fell on a man with a pedlar’s basket before him, who seemed to
16758: be selling nothing but little red crosses to all the passengers. A
16759: little red cross would be pretty to hang up over her bed; it would also
16760: help to keep off harm, and would perhaps make Ninna stronger. Tessa
16761: went to the other side of the street that she might ask the pedlar the
16762: price of the crosses, fearing that they would cost a little too much
16763: for her to spare from her purchase of sweets. The pedlar’s back had
16764: been turned towards her hitherto, but when she came near him she
16765: recognised an old acquaintance of the Mercato, Bratti Ferravecchi, and,
16766: accustomed to feel that she was to avoid old acquaintances, she turned
16767: away again and passed to the other side of the street. But Bratti’s eye
16768: was too well practised in looking out at the corner after possible
16769: customers, for her movement to have escaped him, and she was presently
16770: arrested by a tap on the arm from one of the red crosses.
16771: 
16772: “Young woman,” said Bratti, as she unwillingly turned her head, “you
16773: come from some castello a good way off, it seems to me, else you’d
16774: never think of walking about, this blessed Carnival, without a red
16775: cross in your hand. Santa Madonna! Four white quattrini is a small
16776: price to pay for your soul—prices rise in purgatory, let me tell you.”
16777: 
16778: “Oh, I should like one,” said Tessa, hastily, “but I couldn’t spare
16779: four white quattrini.”
16780: 
16781: Bratti had at first regarded Tessa too abstractedly as a mere customer
16782: to look at her with any scrutiny, but when she began to speak he
16783: exclaimed, “By the head of San Giovanni, it must be the little Tessa,
16784: and looking as fresh as a ripe apple! What! you’ve done none the worse,
16785: then, for running away from father Nofri? You were in the right of it,
16786: for he goes on crutches now, and a crabbed fellow with crutches is
16787: dangerous; he can reach across the house and beat a woman as he sits.”
16788: 
16789: “I’m married,” said Tessa, rather demurely, remembering Naldo’s command
16790: that she should behave with gravity; “and my husband takes great care
16791: of me.”
16792: 
16793: “Ah, then, you’ve fallen on your feet! Nofri said you were
16794: good-for-nothing vermin; but what then? An ass may bray a good while
16795: before he shakes the stars down. I always said you did well to run
16796: away, and it isn’t often Bratti’s in the wrong. Well, and so you’ve got
16797: a husband and plenty of money? Then you’ll never think much of giving
16798: four white quattrini for a red cross. I get no profit; but what with
16799: the famine and the new religion, all other merchandise is gone down.
16800: You live in the country where the chestnuts are plenty, eh? You’ve
16801: never wanted for polenta, I can see.”
16802: 
16803: “No, I’ve never wanted anything,” said Tessa, still on her guard.
16804: 
16805: “Then you can afford to buy a cross. I got a Padre to bless them, and
16806: you get blessing and all for four quattrini. It isn’t for the profit; I
16807: hardly get a danaro by the whole lot. But then they’re holy wares, and
16808: it’s getting harder and harder work to see your way to Paradise: the
16809: very Carnival is like Holy Week, and the least you can do to keep the
16810: Devil from getting the upper hand is to buy a cross. God guard you!
16811: think what the Devil’s tooth is! You’ve seen him biting the man in San
16812: Giovanni, I should hope?”
16813: 
16814: Tessa felt much teased and frightened. “Oh, Bratti,” she said, with a
16815: discomposed face, “I want to buy a great many confetti: I’ve got little
16816: Lillo and Ninna at home. And nice coloured sweet things cost a great
16817: deal. And they will not like the cross so well, though I know it would
16818: be good to have it.”
16819: 
16820: “Come, then,” said Bratti, fond of laying up a store of merits by
16821: imagining possible extortions and then heroically renouncing them,
16822: “since you’re an old acquaintance, you shall have it for two quattrini.
16823: It’s making you a present of the cross, to say nothing of the
16824: blessing.”
16825: 
16826: Tessa was reaching out her two quattrini with trembling hesitation,
16827: when Bratti said abruptly, “Stop a bit! Where do you live?”
16828: 
16829: “Oh, a long way off,” she answered, almost automatically, being
16830: preoccupied with her quattrini; “beyond San Ambrogio, in the Via
16831: Piccola, at the top of the house where the wood is stacked below.”
16832: 
16833: “Very good,” said Bratti, in a patronising tone; “then I’ll let you
16834: have the cross on trust, and call for the money. So you live inside the
16835: gates? Well, well, I shall be passing.”
16836: 
16837: “No, no!” said Tessa, frightened lest Naldo should be angry at this
16838: revival of an old acquaintance. “I can spare the money. Take it now.”
16839: 
16840: “No,” said Bratti, resolutely; “I’m not a hard-hearted pedlar. I’ll
16841: call and see if you’ve got any rags, and you shall make a bargain. See,
16842: here’s the cross: and there’s Pippo’s shop not far behind you: you can
16843: go and fill your basket, and I must go and get mine empty. _Addio,
16844: piccina_.”
16845: 
16846: Bratti went on his way, and Tessa, stimulated to change her money into
16847: confetti before further accident, went into Pippo’s shop, a little
16848: fluttered by the thought that she had let Bratti know more about her
16849: than her husband would approve. There were certainly more dangers in
16850: coming to see the Carnival than in staying at home; and she would have
16851: felt this more strongly if she had known that the wicked old man, who
16852: had wanted to kill her husband on the hill, was still keeping her in
16853: sight. But she had not noticed the man with the burden on his back.
16854: 
16855: The consciousness of having a small basketful of things to make the
16856: children glad dispersed her anxiety, and as she entered the Via de’
16857: Libraj her face had its visual expression of childlike content. And now
16858: she thought there was really a procession coming, for she saw white
16859: robes and a banner, and her heart began to palpitate with expectation.
16860: She stood a little aside, but in that narrow street there was the
16861: pleasure of being obliged to look very close. The banner was pretty: it
16862: was the Holy Mother with the Babe, whose love for her Tessa had
16863: believed in more and more since she had had her babies; and the figures
16864: in white had not only green wreaths on their heads, but little red
16865: crosses by their side, which caused her some satisfaction that she also
16866: had her red cross. Certainly, they looked as beautiful as the angels on
16867: the clouds, and to Tessa’s mind they too had a background of cloud,
16868: like everything else that came to her in life. How and whence did they
16869: come? She did not mind much about knowing. But one thing surprised her
16870: as newer than wreaths and crosses; it was that some of the white
16871: figures carried baskets between them. What could the baskets be for?
16872: 
16873: But now they were very near, and, to her astonishment, they wheeled
16874: aside and came straight up to her. She trembled as she would have done
16875: if Saint Michael in the picture had shaken his head at her, and was
16876: conscious of nothing but terrified wonder till she saw close to her a
16877: round boyish face, lower than her own, and heard a treble voice saying,
16878: “Sister, you carry the Anathema about you. Yield it up to the blessed
16879: Gesu, and He will adorn you with the gems of His grace.”
16880: 
16881: Tessa was only more frightened, understanding nothing. Her first
16882: conjecture settled on her basket of sweets. They wanted that, these
16883: alarming angels. Oh dear, dear! She looked down at it.
16884: 
16885: “No, sister,” said a taller youth, pointing to her necklace and the
16886: clasp of her belt, “it is those vanities that are the Anathema. Take
16887: off that necklace and unclasp that belt, that they may be burned in the
16888: holy Bonfire of Vanities, and save _you_ from burning.”
16889: 
16890: “It is the truth, my sister,” said a still taller youth, evidently the
16891: archangel of this band. “Listen to these voices speaking the divine
16892: message. You already carry a red cross: let that be your only
16893: adornment. Yield up your necklace and belt, and you shall obtain
16894: grace.”
16895: 
16896: This was too much. Tessa, overcome with awe, dared not say “no,” but
16897: she was equally unable to render up her beloved necklace and clasp. Her
16898: pouting lips were quivering, the tears rushed to her eyes, and a great
16899: drop fell. For a moment she ceased to see anything; she felt nothing
16900: but confused terror and misery. Suddenly a gentle hand was laid on her
16901: arm, and a soft, wonderful voice, as if the Holy Madonna were speaking,
16902: said, “Do not be afraid; no one shall harm you.”
16903: 
16904: Tessa looked up and saw a lady in black, with a young heavenly face and
16905: loving hazel eyes. She had never seen any one like this lady before,
16906: and under other circumstances might have had awestruck thoughts about
16907: her; but now everything else was overcome by the sense that loving
16908: protection was near her. The tears only fell the faster, relieving her
16909: swelling heart, as she looked up at the heavenly face, and, putting her
16910: hand to her necklace, said sobbingly—
16911: 
16912: “I can’t give them to be burnt. My husband—he bought them for me—and
16913: they are so pretty—and Ninna—oh, I wish I’d never come!”
16914: 
16915: “Do not ask her for them,” said Romola, speaking to the white-robed
16916: boys in a tone of mild authority. “It answers no good end for people to
16917: give up such things against their will. That is not what Fra Girolamo
16918: approves: he would have such things given up freely.”
16919: 
16920: Madonna Romola’s word was not to be resisted, and the white train moved
16921: on. They even moved with haste, as if some new object had caught their
16922: eyes; and Tessa felt with bliss that they were gone, and that her
16923: necklace and clasp were still with her.
16924: 
16925: “Oh, I will go back to the house,” she said, still agitated; “I will go
16926: nowhere else. But if I should meet them again, and you not be there?”
16927: she added, expecting everything from this heavenly lady.
16928: 
16929: “Stay a little,” said Romola. “Come with me under this doorway, and we
16930: will hide the necklace and clasp, and then you will be in no danger.”
16931: 
16932: She led Tessa under the archway, and said, “Now, can we find room for
16933: your necklace and belt in your basket? Ah! your basket is full of crisp
16934: things that will break: let us be careful, and lay the heavy necklace
16935: under them.”
16936: 
16937: It was like a change in a dream to Tessa—the escape from nightmare into
16938: floating safety and joy—to find herself taken care of by this lady, so
16939: lovely, and powerful, and gentle. She let Romola unfasten her necklace
16940: and clasp, while she herself did nothing but look up at the face that
16941: bent over her.
16942: 
16943: “They are sweets for Lillo and Ninna,” she said, as Romola carefully
16944: lifted up the light parcels in the basket, and placed the ornaments
16945: below them.
16946: 
16947: “Those are your children?” said Romola, smiling. “And you would rather
16948: go home to them than see any more of the Carnival? Else you have not
16949: far to go to the Piazza de’ Signori, and there you would see the pile
16950: for the great bonfire.”
16951: 
16952: “No, oh no!” said Tessa, eagerly; “I shall never like bonfires again. I
16953: will go back.”
16954: 
16955: “You live at some castello, doubtless,” said Romola, not waiting for an
16956: answer. “Towards which gate do you go?”
16957: 
16958: “Towards Por’ Santa Croce.”
16959: 
16960: “Come, then,” said Romola, taking her by the hand and leading her to
16961: the corner of a street nearly opposite. “If you go down there,” she
16962: said, pausing, “you will soon be in a straight road. And I must leave
16963: you now, because some one else expects me. You will not be frightened.
16964: Your pretty things are quite safe now. Addio.”
16965: 
16966: “Addio, Madonna,” said Tessa, almost in a whisper, not knowing what
16967: else it would be right to say; and in an instant the heavenly lady was
16968: gone. Tessa turned to catch a last glimpse, but she only saw the tall
16969: gliding figure vanish round the projecting stonework. So she went on
16970: her way in wonder, longing to be once more safely housed with Monna
16971: Lisa, undesirous of carnivals for evermore.
16972: 
16973: Baldassarre had kept Tessa in sight till the moment of her parting with
16974: Romola: then he went away with his bundle of yarn. It seemed to him
16975: that he had discerned a clue which might guide him if he could only
16976: grasp the necessary details firmly enough. He had seen the two wives
16977: together, and the sight had brought to his conceptions that vividness
16978: which had been wanting before. His power of imagining facts needed to
16979: be reinforced continually by the senses. The tall wife was the noble
16980: and rightful wife; she had the blood in her that would be readily
16981: kindled to resentment; she would know what scholarship was, and how it
16982: might lie locked in by the obstructions of the stricken body, like a
16983: treasure buried by earthquake. She could believe him: she would be
16984: _inclined_ to believe him, if he proved to her that her husband was
16985: unfaithful. Women cared about that: they would take vengeance for that.
16986: If this wife of Tito’s loved him, she would have a sense of injury
16987: which Baldassarre’s mind dwelt on with keen longing, as if it would be
16988: the strength of another Will added to his own, the strength of another
16989: mind to form devices.
16990: 
16991: Both these wives had been kind to Baldassarre, and their acts towards
16992: him, being bound up with the very image of them, had not vanished from
16993: his memory; yet the thought of their pain could not present itself to
16994: him as a check. To him it seemed that pain was the order of the world
16995: for all except the hard and base. If any were innocent, if any were
16996: noble, where could the utmost gladness lie for them? Where it lay for
16997: him—in unconquerable hatred and triumphant vengeance. But he must be
16998: cautious: he must watch this wife in the Via de’ Bardi, and learn more
16999: of her; for even here frustration was possible. There was no power for
17000: him now but in patience.
17001: 
17002: 
17003: 
17004: 
17005: CHAPTER LI.
17006: Monna Brigida’s Conversion.
17007: 
17008: 
17009: When Romola said that some one else expected her, she meant her cousin
17010: Brigida, but she was far from suspecting how much that good kinswoman
17011: was in need of her. Returning together towards the Piazza, they had
17012: descried the company of youths coming to a stand before Tessa, and when
17013: Romola, having approached near enough to see the simple little
17014: contadina’s distress, said, “Wait for me a moment, cousin,” Monna
17015: Brigida said hastily, “Ah, I will not go on: come for me to Boni’s
17016: shop,—I shall go back there.”
17017: 
17018: The truth was, Monna Brigida had a consciousness on the one hand of
17019: certain “vanities” carried on her person, and on the other of a growing
17020: alarm lest the Piagnoni should be right in holding that rouge, and
17021: false hair, and pearl embroidery, endamaged the soul. Their serious
17022: view of things filled the air like an odour; nothing seemed to have
17023: exactly the same flavour as it used to have; and there was the dear
17024: child Romola, in her youth and beauty, leading a life that was
17025: uncomfortably suggestive of rigorous demands on woman. A widow at
17026: fifty-five whose satisfaction has been largely drawn from what she
17027: thinks of her own person, and what she believes others think of it,
17028: requires a great fund of imagination to keep her spirits buoyant. And
17029: Monna Brigida had begun to have frequent struggles at her toilet. If
17030: her soul would prosper better without them, was it really worth while
17031: to put on the rouge and the braids? But when she lifted up the
17032: hand-mirror and saw a sallow face with baggy cheeks, and crows’-feet
17033: that were not to be dissimulated by any simpering of the lips—when she
17034: parted her grey hair, and let it lie in simple Piagnone fashion round
17035: her face, her courage failed. Monna Berta would certainly burst out
17036: laughing at her, and call her an old hag, and as Monna Berta was really
17037: only fifty-two, she had a superiority which would make the observation
17038: cutting. Every woman who was not a Piagnone would give a shrug at the
17039: sight of her, and the men would accost her as if she were their
17040: grandmother. Whereas, at fifty-five a woman was not so very old—she
17041: only required making up a little. So the rouge and the braids and the
17042: embroidered berretta went on again, and Monna Brigida was satisfied
17043: with the accustomed effect; as for her neck, if she covered it up,
17044: people might suppose it was too old to show, and, on the contrary, with
17045: the necklaces round it, it looked better than Monna Berta’s. This very
17046: day, when she was preparing for the Piagnone Carnival, such a struggle
17047: had occurred, and the conflicting fears and longings which caused the
17048: struggle, caused her to turn back and seek refuge in the druggist’s
17049: shop rather than encounter the collectors of the Anathema when Romola
17050: was not by her side. But Monna Brigida was not quite rapid enough in
17051: her retreat. She had been descried, even before she turned away, by the
17052: white-robed boys in the rear of those who wheeled round towards Tessa,
17053: and the willingness with which Tessa was given up was, perhaps,
17054: slightly due to the fact that part of the troop had already accosted a
17055: personage carrying more markedly upon her the dangerous weight of the
17056: Anathema. It happened that several of this troop were at the youngest
17057: age taken into peculiar training; and a small fellow of ten, his olive
17058: wreath resting above cherubic cheeks and wide brown eyes, his
17059: imagination really possessed with a hovering awe at existence as
17060: something in which great consequences impended on being good or bad,
17061: his longings nevertheless running in the direction of mastery and
17062: mischief, was the first to reach Monna Brigida and place himself across
17063: her path. She felt angry, and looked for an open door, but there was
17064: not one at hand, and by attempting to escape now, she would only make
17065: things worse. But it was not the cherubic-faced young one who first
17066: addressed her; it was a youth of fifteen, who held one handle of a wide
17067: basket.
17068: 
17069: “Venerable mother!” he began, “the blessed Jesus commands you to give
17070: up the Anathema which you carry upon you. That cap embroidered with
17071: pearls, those jewels that fasten up your false hair—let them be given
17072: up and sold for the poor; and cast the hair itself away from you, as a
17073: lie that is only fit for burning. Doubtless, too, you have other jewels
17074: under your silk mantle.”
17075: 
17076: “Yes, lady,” said the youth at the other handle, who had many of Fra
17077: Girolamo’s phrases by heart, “they are too heavy for you: they are
17078: heavier than a millstone, and are weighting you for perdition. Will you
17079: adorn yourself with the hunger of the poor, and be proud to carry God’s
17080: curse upon your head?”
17081: 
17082: “In truth you are old, buona madre,” said the cherubic boy, in a sweet
17083: soprano. “You look very ugly with the red on your cheeks and that black
17084: glistening hair, and those fine things. It is only Satan who can like
17085: to see you. Your Angel is sorry. He wants you to rub away the red.”
17086: 
17087: The little fellow snatched a soft silk scarf from the basket, and held
17088: it towards Monna Brigida, that she might use it as her guardian angel
17089: desired. Her anger and mortification were fast giving way to spiritual
17090: alarm. Monna Berta and that cloud of witnesses, highly-dressed society
17091: in general, were not looking at her, and she was surrounded by young
17092: monitors, whose white robes, and wreaths, and red crosses, and dreadful
17093: candour, had something awful in their unusualness. Her Franciscan
17094: confessor, Fra Cristoforo, of Santa Croce, was not at hand to reinforce
17095: her distrust of Dominican teaching, and she was helplessly possessed
17096: and shaken by a vague sense that a supreme warning was come to her.
17097: Unvisited by the least suggestion of any other course that was open to
17098: her, she took the scarf that was held out, and rubbed her cheeks, with
17099: trembling submissiveness.
17100: 
17101: “It is well, madonna,” said the second youth. “It is a holy beginning.
17102: And when you have taken those vanities from your head, the dew of
17103: heavenly grace will descend on it.” The infusion of mischief was
17104: getting stronger, and putting his hand to one of the jewelled pins that
17105: fastened her braids to the berretta, he drew it out. The heavy black
17106: plait fell down over Monna Brigida’s face, and dragged the rest of the
17107: head-gear forward. It was a new reason for not hesitating: she put up
17108: her hands hastily, undid the other fastenings, and flung down into the
17109: basket of doom her beloved crimson-velvet berretta, with all its
17110: unsurpassed embroidery of seed-pearls, and stood an unrouged woman,
17111: with grey hair pushed backward from a face where certain deep lines of
17112: age had triumphed over _embonpoint_.
17113: 
17114: But the berretta was not allowed to lie in the basket. With impish zeal
17115: the youngsters lifted it, and held it up pitilessly, with the false
17116: hair dangling.
17117: 
17118: “See, venerable mother,” said the taller youth, “what ugly lies you
17119: have delivered yourself from! And now you look like the blessed Saint
17120: Anna, the mother of the Holy Virgin.”
17121: 
17122: Thoughts of going into a convent forthwith, and never showing herself
17123: in the world again, were rushing through Monna Brigida’s mind. There
17124: was nothing possible for her but to take care of her soul.
17125: 
17126: Of course, there were spectators laughing: she had no need to look
17127: round to assure herself of that. Well! it would, perhaps, be better to
17128: be forced to think more of Paradise. But at the thought that the dear
17129: accustomed world was no longer in her choice, there gathered some of
17130: those hard tears which just moisten elderly eyes, and she could see but
17131: dimly a large rough hand holding a red cross, which was suddenly thrust
17132: before her over the shoulders of the boys, while a strong guttural
17133: voice said—
17134: 
17135: “Only four quattrini, madonna, blessing and all! Buy it. You’ll find a
17136: comfort in it now your wig’s gone. Deh! what are we sinners doing all
17137: our lives? Making soup in a basket, and getting nothing but the scum
17138: for our stomachs. Better buy a blessing, madonna! Only four quattrini;
17139: the profit is not so much as the smell of a danaro, and it goes to the
17140: poor.”
17141: 
17142: Monna Brigida, in dim-eyed confusion, was proceeding to the further
17143: submission of reaching money from her embroidered scarsella, at present
17144: hidden by her silk mantle, when the group round her, which she had not
17145: yet entertained the idea of escaping, opened before a figure as welcome
17146: as an angel loosing prison-bolts.
17147: 
17148: “Romola, look at me!” said Monna Brigida, in a piteous tone, putting
17149: out both her hands.
17150: 
17151: The white troop was already moving away, with a slight consciousness
17152: that its zeal about the head-gear had been superabundant enough to
17153: afford a dispensation from any further demand for penitential
17154: offerings.
17155: 
17156: “Dear cousin, don’t be distressed,” said Romola, smitten with pity, yet
17157: hardly able to help smiling at the sudden apparition of her kinswoman
17158: in a genuine, natural guise, strangely contrasted with all memories of
17159: her. She took the black drapery from her own head, and threw it over
17160: Monna Brigida’s. “There,” she went on soothingly, “no one will remark
17161: you now. We will turn down the Via del Palagio and go straight to our
17162: house.”
17163: 
17164: They hastened away, Monna Brigida grasping Romola’s hand tightly, as if
17165: to get a stronger assurance of her being actually there.
17166: 
17167: “Ah, my Romola, my dear child!” said the short fat woman, hurrying with
17168: frequent steps to keep pace with the majestic young figure beside her;
17169: “what an old scarecrow I am! I must be good—I mean to be good!”
17170: 
17171: “Yes, yes; buy a cross!” said the guttural voice, while the rough hand
17172: was thrust once more before Monna Brigida: for Bratti was not to be
17173: abashed by Romola’s presence into renouncing a probable customer, and
17174: had quietly followed up their retreat. “Only four quattrini, blessing
17175: and all—and if there was any profit, it would all go to the poor.”
17176: 
17177: Monna Brigida would have been compelled to pause, even if she had been
17178: in a less submissive mood. She put up one hand deprecatingly to arrest
17179: Romola’s remonstrance, and with the other reached out a grosso, worth
17180: many white quattrini, saying, in an entreating tone—
17181: 
17182: “Take it, good man, and begone.”
17183: 
17184: “You’re in the right, madonna,” said Bratti, taking the coin quickly,
17185: and thrusting the cross into her hand; “I’ll not offer you change, for
17186: I might as well rob you of a mass. What! we must all be scorched a
17187: little, but you’ll come off the easier; better fall from the window
17188: than the roof. A good Easter and a good year to you!”
17189: 
17190: “Well, Romola,” cried Monna Brigida, pathetically, as Bratti left them,
17191: “if I’m to be a Piagnone it’s no matter how I look!”
17192: 
17193: “Dear cousin,” said Romola, smiling at her affectionately, “you don’t
17194: know how much better you look than you ever did before. I see now how
17195: good-natured your face is, like yourself. That red and finery seemed to
17196: thrust themselves forward and hide expression. Ask our Piero or any
17197: other painter if he would not rather paint your portrait now than
17198: before. I think all lines of the human face have something either
17199: touching or grand, unless they seem to come from low passions. How fine
17200: old men are, like my godfather! Why should not old women look grand and
17201: simple?”
17202: 
17203: “Yes, when one gets to be sixty, my Romola,” said Brigida, relapsing a
17204: little; “but I’m only fifty-five, and Monna Berta, and everybody—but
17205: it’s no use: I will be good, like you. Your mother, if she’d been
17206: alive, would have been as old as I am; we were cousins together. One
17207: _must_ either die or get old. But it doesn’t matter about being old, if
17208: one’s a Piagnone.”
17209: 
17210: 
17211:

17213: CHAPTER LII.
17214: A Prophetess.
17215: 
17216: 
17217: The incidents of that Carnival day seemed to Romola to carry no other
17218: personal consequences to her than the new care of supporting poor
17219: cousin Brigida in her fluctuating resignation to age and grey hairs;
17220: but they introduced a Lenten time in which she was kept at a high pitch
17221: of mental excitement and active effort.
17222: 
17223: Bernardo del Nero had been elected Gonfaloniere. By great exertions the
17224: Medicean party had so far triumphed, and that triumph had deepened
17225: Romola’s presentiment of some secretly-prepared scheme likely to ripen
17226: either into success or betrayal during these two months of her
17227: godfather’s authority. Every morning the dim daybreak as it peered into
17228: her room seemed to be that haunting fear coming back to her. Every
17229: morning the fear went with her as she passed through the streets on her
17230: way to the early sermon in the Duomo: but there she gradually lost the
17231: sense of its chill presence, as men lose the dread of death in the
17232: clash of battle.
17233: 
17234: In the Duomo she felt herself sharing in a passionate conflict which
17235: had wider relations than any enclosed within the walls of Florence. For
17236: Savonarola was preaching—preaching the last course of Lenten sermons he
17237: was ever allowed to finish in the Duomo: he knew that excommunication
17238: was imminent, and he had reached the point of defying it. He held up
17239: the condition of the Church in the terrible mirror of his unflinching
17240: speech, which called things by their right names and dealt in no polite
17241: periphrases; he proclaimed with heightening confidence the advent of
17242: renovation—of a moment when there would be a general revolt against
17243: corruption. As to his own destiny, he seemed to have a double and
17244: alternating prevision: sometimes he saw himself taking a glorious part
17245: in that revolt, sending forth a voice that would be heard through all
17246: Christendom, and making the dead body of the Church tremble into new
17247: life, as the body of Lazarus trembled when the Divine voice pierced the
17248: sepulchre; sometimes he saw no prospect for himself but persecution and
17249: martyrdom:—this life for him was only a vigil, and only after death
17250: would come the dawn.
17251: 
17252: The position was one which must have had its impressiveness for all
17253: minds that were not of the dullest order, even if they were inclined,
17254: as Macchiavelli was, to interpret the Frate’s character by a key that
17255: presupposed no loftiness. To Romola, whose kindred ardour gave her a
17256: firm belief in Savonarola’s genuine greatness of purpose, the crisis
17257: was as stirring as if it had been part of her personal lot. It blent
17258: itself as an exalting memory with all her daily labours; and those
17259: labours were calling not only for difficult perseverance, but for new
17260: courage. Famine had never yet taken its flight from Florence, and all
17261: distress, by its long continuance, was getting harder to bear; disease
17262: was spreading in the crowded city, and the Plague was expected. As
17263: Romola walked, often in weariness, among the sick, the hungry, and the
17264: murmuring, she felt it good to be inspired by something more than her
17265: pity—by the belief in a heroism struggling for sublime ends, towards
17266: which the daily action of her pity could only tend feebly, as the dews
17267: that freshen the weedy ground to-day tend to prepare an unseen harvest
17268: in the years to come.
17269: 
17270: But that mighty music which stirred her in the Duomo was not without
17271: its jarring notes. Since those first days of glowing hope when the
17272: Frate, seeing the near triumph of good in the reform of the Republic
17273: and the coming of the French deliverer, had preached peace, charity,
17274: and oblivion of political differences, there had been a marked change
17275: of conditions: political intrigue had been too obstinate to allow of
17276: the desired oblivion; the belief in the French deliverer, who had
17277: turned his back on his high mission, seemed to have wrought harm; and
17278: hostility, both on a petty and on a grand scale, was attacking the
17279: Prophet with new weapons and new determination.
17280: 
17281: It followed that the spirit of contention and self-vindication pierced
17282: more and more conspicuously in his sermons; that he was urged to meet
17283: the popular demands not only by increased insistence and detail
17284: concerning visions and private revelations, but by a tone of defiant
17285: confidence against objectors; and from having denounced the desire for
17286: the miraculous, and declared that miracles had no relation to true
17287: faith, he had come to assert that at the right moment the Divine power
17288: would attest the truth of his prophetic preaching by a miracle. And
17289: continually, in the rapid transitions of excited feeling, as the vision
17290: of triumphant good receded behind the actual predominance of evil, the
17291: threats of coming vengeance against vicious tyrants and corrupt priests
17292: gathered some impetus from personal exasperation, as well as from
17293: indignant zeal.
17294: 
17295: In the career of a great public orator who yields himself to the
17296: inspiration of the moment, that conflict of selfish and unselfish
17297: emotion which in most men is hidden in the chamber of the soul, is
17298: brought into terrible evidence: the language of the inner voices is
17299: written out in letters of fire.
17300: 
17301: But if the tones of exasperation jarred on Romola, there was often
17302: another member of Fra Girolamo’s audience to whom they were the only
17303: thrilling tones, like the vibration of deep bass notes to the deaf.
17304: Baldassarre had found out that the wonderful Frate was preaching again,
17305: and as often as he could, he went to hear the Lenten sermon, that he
17306: might drink in the threats of a voice which seemed like a power on the
17307: side of justice. He went the more because he had seen that Romola went
17308: too; for he was waiting and watching for a time when not only outward
17309: circumstances, but his own varying mental state, would mark the right
17310: moment for seeking an interview with her. Twice Romola had caught sight
17311: of his face in the Duomo—once when its dark glance was fixed on hers.
17312: She wished not to see it again, and yet she looked for it, as men look
17313: for the reappearance of a portent. But any revelation that might be yet
17314: to come about this old man was a subordinate fear now: it referred, she
17315: thought, only to the past, and her anxiety was almost absorbed by the
17316: present.
17317: 
17318: Yet the stirring Lent passed by; April, the second and final month of
17319: her godfather’s supreme authority, was near its close; and nothing had
17320: occurred to fulfil her presentiment. In the public mind, too, there had
17321: been fears, and rumours had spread from Rome of a menacing activity on
17322: the part of Piero de’ Medici; but in a few days the suspected Bernardo
17323: would go out of power.
17324: 
17325: Romola was trying to gather some courage from the review of her futile
17326: fears, when on the twenty-seventh, as she was walking out on her usual
17327: errands of mercy in the afternoon, she was met by a messenger from
17328: Camilla Rucellai, chief among the feminine seers of Florence, desiring
17329: her presence forthwith on matters of the highest moment. Romola, who
17330: shrank with unconquerable repulsion from the shrill volubility of those
17331: illuminated women, and had just now a special repugnance towards
17332: Camilla because of a report that she had announced revelations hostile
17333: to Bernardo del Nero, was at first inclined to send back a flat
17334: refusal. Camilla’s message might refer to public affairs, and Romola’s
17335: immediate prompting was to close her ears against knowledge that might
17336: only make her mental burden heavier. But it had become so thoroughly
17337: her habit to reject her impulsive choice, and to obey passively the
17338: guidance of outward claims, that, reproving herself for allowing her
17339: presentiments to make her cowardly and selfish, she ended by
17340: compliance, and went straight to Camilla.
17341: 
17342: She found the nervous grey-haired woman in a chamber arranged as much
17343: as possible like a convent cell. The thin fingers clutching Romola as
17344: she sat, and the eager voice addressing her at first in a loud whisper,
17345: caused her a physical shrinking that made it difficult for her to keep
17346: her seat.
17347: 
17348: Camilla had a vision to communicate—a vision in which it had been
17349: revealed to her by Romola’s Angel, that Romola knew certain secrets
17350: concerning her godfather, Bernardo del Nero, which, if disclosed, might
17351: save the Republic from peril. Camilla’s voice rose louder and higher as
17352: she narrated her vision, and ended by exhorting Romola to obey the
17353: command of her Angel, and separate herself from the enemy of God.
17354: 
17355: Romola’s impetuosity was that of a massive nature, and, except in
17356: moments when she was deeply stirred, her manner was calm and
17357: self-controlled. She had a constitutional disgust for the shallow
17358: excitability of women like Camilla, whose faculties seemed all wrought
17359: up into fantasies, leaving nothing for emotion and thought. The
17360: exhortation was not yet ended when she started up and attempted to
17361: wrench her arm from Camilla’s tightening grasp. It was of no use. The
17362: prophetess kept her hold like a crab, and, only incited to more eager
17363: exhortation by Romola’s resistance, was carried beyond her own
17364: intention into a shrill statement of other visions which were to
17365: corroborate this. Christ himself had appeared to her and ordered her to
17366: send his commands to certain citizens in office that they should throw
17367: Bernardo del Nero from the window of the Palazzo Vecchio. Fra Girolamo
17368: himself knew of it, and had not dared this time to say that the vision
17369: was not of Divine authority.
17370: 
17371: “And since then,” said Camilla, in her excited treble, straining upward
17372: with wild eyes towards Romola’s face, “the Blessed Infant has come to
17373: me and laid a wafer of sweetness on my tongue in token of his pleasure
17374: that I had done his will.”
17375: 
17376: “Let me go!” said Romola, in a deep voice of anger. “God grant you are
17377: mad! else you are detestably wicked!”
17378: 
17379: The violence of her effort to be free was too strong for Camilla now.
17380: She wrenched away her arm and rushed out of the room, not pausing till
17381: she had hurriedly gone far along the street, and found herself close to
17382: the church of the Badia. She had but to pass behind the curtain under
17383: the old stone arch, and she would find a sanctuary shut in from the
17384: noise and hurry of the street, where all objects and all uses suggested
17385: the thought of an eternal peace subsisting in the midst of turmoil.
17386: 
17387: She turned in, and sinking down on the step of the altar in front of
17388: Filippino Lippi’s serene Virgin appearing to Saint Bernard, she waited
17389: in hope that the inward tumult which agitated her would by-and-by
17390: subside.
17391: 
17392: The thought which pressed on her the most acutely was that Camilla
17393: could allege Savonarola’s countenance of her wicked folly. Romola did
17394: not for a moment believe that he had sanctioned the throwing of
17395: Bernardo del Nero from the window as a Divine suggestion; she felt
17396: certain that there was falsehood or mistake in that allegation.
17397: Savonarola had become more and more severe in his views of resistance
17398: to malcontents; but the ideas of strict law and order were fundamental
17399: to all his political teaching. Still, since he knew the possibly fatal
17400: effects of visions like Camilla’s, since he had a marked distrust of
17401: such spirit-seeing women, and kept aloof from them as much as possible,
17402: why, with his readiness to denounce wrong from the pulpit, did he not
17403: publicly denounce these pretended revelations which brought new
17404: darkness instead of light across the conception of a Supreme Will? Why?
17405: The answer came with painful clearness: he was fettered inwardly by the
17406: consciousness that such revelations were not, in their basis,
17407: distinctly separable from his own visions; he was fettered outwardly by
17408: the foreseen consequence of raising a cry against himself even among
17409: members of his own party, as one who would suppress all Divine
17410: inspiration of which he himself was not the vehicle—he or his
17411: confidential and supplementary seer of visions, Fra Salvestro.
17412: 
17413: Romola, kneeling with buried face on the altar-step, was enduring one
17414: of those sickening moments, when the enthusiasm which had come to her
17415: as the only energy strong enough to make life worthy, seemed to be
17416: inevitably bound up with vain dreams and wilful eye-shutting. Her mind
17417: rushed back with a new attraction towards the strong worldly sense, the
17418: dignified prudence, the untheoretic virtues of her godfather, who was
17419: to be treated as a sort of Agag because he held that a more restricted
17420: form of government was better than the Great Council, and because he
17421: would not pretend to forget old ties to the banished family.
17422: 
17423: But with this last thought rose the presentiment of some plot to
17424: restore the Medici; and then again she felt that the popular party was
17425: half justified in its fierce suspicion. Again she felt that to keep the
17426: Government of Florence pure, and to keep out a vicious rule, was a
17427: sacred cause; the Frate was right there, and had carried her
17428: understanding irrevocably with him. But at this moment the assent of
17429: her understanding went alone; it was given unwillingly. Her heart was
17430: recoiling from a right allied to so much narrowness; a right apparently
17431: entailing that hard systematic judgment of men which measures them by
17432: assents and denials quite superficial to the manhood within them. Her
17433: affection and respect were clinging with new tenacity to her godfather,
17434: and with him to those memories of her father which were in the same
17435: opposition to the division of men into sheep and goats by the easy mark
17436: of some political or religious symbol.
17437: 
17438: After all has been said that can be said about the widening influence
17439: of ideas, it remains true that they would hardly be such strong agents
17440: unless they were taken in a solvent of feeling. The great
17441: world-struggle of developing thought is continually foreshadowed in the
17442: struggle of the affections, seeking a justification for love and hope.
17443: 
17444: If Romola’s intellect had been less capable of discerning the
17445: complexities in human things, all the early loving associations of her
17446: life would have forbidden her to accept implicitly the denunciatory
17447: exclusiveness of Savonarola. She had simply felt that his mind had
17448: suggested deeper and more efficacious truth to her than any other, and
17449: the large breathing-room she found in his grand view of human duties
17450: had made her patient towards that part of his teaching which she could
17451: not absorb, so long as its practical effect came into collision with no
17452: strong force in her. But now a sudden insurrection of feeling had
17453: brought about that collision. Her indignation, once roused by Camilla’s
17454: visions, could not pause there, but ran like an illuminating fire over
17455: all the kindred facts in Savonarola’s teaching, and for the moment she
17456: felt what was true in the scornful sarcasms she heard continually flung
17457: against him, more keenly than she felt what was false.
17458: 
17459: But it was an illumination that made all life look ghastly to her.
17460: Where were the beings to whom she could cling, with whom she could work
17461: and endure, with the belief that she was working for the right? On the
17462: side from which moral energy came lay a fanaticism from which she was
17463: shrinking with newly-startled repulsion; on the side to which she was
17464: drawn by affection and memory, there was the presentiment of some
17465: secret plotting, which her judgment told her would not be unfairly
17466: called crime. And still surmounting every other thought was the dread
17467: inspired by Tito’s hints, lest that presentiment should be converted
17468: into knowledge, in such a way that she would be torn by irreconcilable
17469: claims.
17470: 
17471: Calmness would not come even on the altar-steps; it would not come from
17472: looking at the serene picture where the saint, writing in the rocky
17473: solitude, was being visited by faces with celestial peace in them.
17474: Romola was in the hard press of human difficulties, and that rocky
17475: solitude was too far off. She rose from her knees that she might hasten
17476: to her sick people in the courtyard, and by some immediate beneficent
17477: action, revive that sense of worth in life which at this moment was
17478: unfed by any wider faith. But when she turned round, she found herself
17479: face to face with a man who was standing only two yards off her. The
17480: man was Baldassarre.
17481: 
17482: 
17483: 
17484: 
17485: CHAPTER LIII.
17486: On San Miniato.
17487: 
17488: 
17489: “I would speak with you,” said Baldassarre, as Romola looked at him in
17490: silent expectation. It was plain that he had followed her, and had been
17491: waiting for her. She was going at last to know the secret about him.
17492: 
17493: “Yes,” she said, with the same sort of submission that she might have
17494: shown under an imposed penance. “But you wish to go where no one can
17495: hear us?”
17496: 
17497: “Where _he_ will not come upon us,” said Baldassarre, turning and
17498: glancing behind him timidly. “Out—in the air—away from the streets.”
17499: 
17500: “I sometimes go to San Miniato at this hour,” said Romola. “If you
17501: like, I will go now, and you can follow me. It is far, but we can be
17502: solitary there.”
17503: 
17504: He nodded assent, and Romola set out. To some women it might have
17505: seemed an alarming risk to go to a comparatively solitary spot with a
17506: man who had some of the outward signs of that madness which Tito
17507: attributed to him. But Romola was not given to personal fears, and she
17508: was glad of the distance that interposed some delay before another blow
17509: fell on her. The afternoon was far advanced, and the sun was already
17510: low in the west, when she paused on some rough ground in the shadow of
17511: the cypress-trunks, and looked round for Baldassarre. He was not far
17512: off, but when he reached her, he was glad to sink down on an edge of
17513: stony earth. His thickset frame had no longer the sturdy vigour which
17514: belonged to it when he first appeared with the rope round him in the
17515: Duomo; and under the transient tremor caused by the exertion of walking
17516: up the hill, his eyes seemed to have a more helpless vagueness.
17517: 
17518: “The hill is steep,” said Romola, with compassionate gentleness,
17519: seating herself by him. “And I fear you have been weakened by want?”
17520: 
17521: He turned his head and fixed his eyes on her in silence, unable, now
17522: the moment of speech was come, to seize the words that would convey the
17523: thought he wanted to utter: and she remained as motionless as she
17524: could, lest he should suppose her impatient. He looked like nothing
17525: higher than a common-bred, neglected old man; but she was used now to
17526: be very near to such people, and to think a great deal about their
17527: troubles. Gradually his glance gathered a more definite expression, and
17528: at last he said with abrupt emphasis—
17529: 
17530: “Ah! you would have been my daughter!”
17531: 
17532: The swift flush came in Romola’s face and went back again as swiftly,
17533: leaving her with white lips a little apart, like a marble image of
17534: horror. For her mind, the revelation was made. She divined the facts
17535: that lay behind that single word, and in the first moment there could
17536: be no check to the impulsive belief which sprang from her keen
17537: experience of Tito’s nature. The sensitive response of her face was a
17538: stimulus to Baldassarre; for the first time his words had wrought their
17539: right effect. He went on with gathering eagerness and firmness, laying
17540: his hand on her arm.
17541: 
17542: “You are a woman of proud blood—is it not true? You go to hear the
17543: preacher; you hate baseness—baseness that smiles and triumphs. You hate
17544: your husband?”
17545: 
17546: “Oh God! were you really his father?” said Romola, in a low voice, too
17547: entirely possessed by the images of the past to take any note of
17548: Baldassarre’s question. “Or was it as he said? Did you take him when he
17549: was little?”
17550: 
17551: “Ah, you believe me—you know what he is!” said Baldassarre, exultingly,
17552: tightening the pressure on her arm, as if the contact gave him power.
17553: “You will help me?”
17554: 
17555: “Yes,” said Romola, not interpreting the words as he meant them. She
17556: laid her palm gently on the rough hand that grasped her arm, and the
17557: tears came to her eyes as she looked at him. “Oh, it is piteous! Tell
17558: me—you were a great scholar; you taught him. How is it?”
17559: 
17560: She broke off. Tito’s allegation of this man’s madness had come across
17561: her; and where were the signs even of past refinement? But she had the
17562: self-command not to move her hand. She sat perfectly still, waiting to
17563: listen with new caution.
17564: 
17565: “It is gone!—it is all gone!” said Baldassarre; “and they would not
17566: believe me, because he lied, and said I was mad; and they had me
17567: dragged to prison. And I am old—my mind will not come back. And the
17568: world is against me.”
17569: 
17570: He paused a moment, and his eyes sank as if he were under a wave of
17571: despondency. Then he looked up at her again, and said with renewed
17572: eagerness—“But _you_ are not against me. He made you love him, and he
17573: has been false to you; and you hate him. Yes, he made _me_ love him: he
17574: was beautiful and gentle, and I was a lonely man. I took him when they
17575: were beating him. He slept in my bosom when he was little, and I
17576: watched him as he grew, and gave him all my knowledge, and everything
17577: that was mine I meant to be his. I had many things; money, and books,
17578: and gems. He had my gems—he sold them; and he left me in slavery. He
17579: never came to seek me, and when I came back poor and in misery, he
17580: denied me. He said I was a madman.”
17581: 
17582: “He told us his father was dead—was drowned,” said Romola, faintly.
17583: “Surely he must have believed it then. Oh! he could not have been so
17584: base _then_!”
17585: 
17586: A vision had risen of what Tito was to her in those first days when she
17587: thought no more of wrong in him than a child thinks of poison in
17588: flowers. The yearning regret that lay in that memory brought some
17589: relief from the tension of horror. With one great sob the tears rushed
17590: forth.
17591: 
17592: “Ah, you are young, and the tears come easily,” said Baldassarre, with
17593: some impatience. “But tears are no good; they only put out the fire
17594: within, and it is the fire that works. Tears will hinder us. Listen to
17595: me.”
17596: 
17597: Romola turned towards him with a slight start. Again the possibility of
17598: his madness had darted through her mind, and checked the rush of
17599: belief. If, after all, this man were only a mad assassin? But her deep
17600: belief in this story still lay behind, and it was more in sympathy than
17601: in fear that she avoided the risk of paining him by any show of doubt.
17602: 
17603: “Tell me,” she said, as gently as she could, “how did you lose your
17604: memory—your scholarship?”
17605: 
17606: “I was ill. I can’t tell how long—it was a blank. I remember nothing,
17607: only at last I was sitting in the sun among the stones, and everything
17608: else was darkness. And slowly, and by degrees, I felt something besides
17609: that: a longing for something—I did not know what—that never came. And
17610: when I was in the ship on the waters I began to know what I longed for;
17611: it was for the Boy to come back—it was to find all my thoughts again,
17612: for I was locked away outside them all. And I am outside now. I feel
17613: nothing but a wall and darkness.”
17614: 
17615: Baldassarre had become dreamy again, and sank into silence, resting his
17616: head between his hands; and again Romola’s belief in him had submerged
17617: all cautioning doubts. The pity with which she dwelt on his words
17618: seemed like the revival of an old pang. Had she not daily seen how her
17619: father missed Dino and the future he had dreamed of in that son?
17620: 
17621: “It all came back once,” Baldassarre went on presently. “I was master
17622: of everything. I saw all the world again, and my gems, and my books;
17623: and I thought I had him in my power, and I went to expose him
17624: where—where the lights were and the trees; and he lied again, and said
17625: I was mad, and they dragged me away to prison... Wickedness is strong;
17626: and he wears armour.”
17627: 
17628: The fierceness had flamed up again. He spoke with his former intensity,
17629: and again he grasped Romola’s arm.
17630: 
17631: “But you will help me? He has been false to you too. He has another
17632: wife, and she has children. He makes her believe he is her husband, and
17633: she is a foolish, helpless thing. I will show you where she lives.”
17634: 
17635: The first shock that passed through Romola was visibly one of anger.
17636: The woman’s sense of indignity was inevitably foremost. Baldassarre
17637: instinctively felt her in sympathy with him.
17638: 
17639: “You hate him,” he went on. “Is it not true? There is no love between
17640: you; I know that. I know women can hate; and you have proud blood. You
17641: hate falseness, and you can love revenge.”
17642: 
17643: Romola sat paralysed by the shock of conflicting feelings. She was not
17644: conscious of the grasp that was bruising her tender arm.
17645: 
17646: “You shall contrive it,” said Baldassarre, presently, in an eager
17647: whisper. “I have learned by heart that you are his rightful wife. You
17648: are a noble woman. You go to hear the preacher of vengeance; you will
17649: help justice. But you will think for me. My mind goes—everything goes
17650: sometimes—all but the fire. The fire is God: it is justice: it will not
17651: die. You believe that—is it not true? If they will not hang him for
17652: robbing me, you will take away his armour—you will make him go without
17653: it, and I will stab him. I have a knife, and my arm is still strong
17654: enough.”
17655: 
17656: He put his hand under his tunic, and reached out the hidden knife,
17657: feeling the edge abstractedly, as if he needed the sensation to keep
17658: alive his ideas.
17659: 
17660: It seemed to Romola as if every fresh hour of her life were to become
17661: more difficult than the last. Her judgment was too vigorous and rapid
17662: for her to fall into the mistake of using futile deprecatory words to a
17663: man in Baldassarre’s state of mind. She chose not to answer his last
17664: speech. She would win time for his excitement to allay itself by asking
17665: something else that she cared to know. She spoke rather tremulously—
17666: 
17667: “You say she is foolish and helpless—that other wife—and believes him
17668: to be her real husband. Perhaps he is: perhaps he married her before he
17669: married me.”
17670: 
17671: “I cannot tell,” said Baldassarre, pausing in that action of feeling
17672: the knife, and looking bewildered. “I can remember no more. I only know
17673: where she lives. You shall see her. I will take you; but not now,” he
17674: added hurriedly, “_he_ may be there. The night is coming on.”
17675: 
17676: “It is true,” said Romola, starting up with a sudden consciousness that
17677: the sun had set and the hills were darkening; “but you will come and
17678: take me—when?”
17679: 
17680: “In the morning,” said Baldassarre, dreaming that she, too, wanted to
17681: hurry to her vengeance.
17682: 
17683: “Come to me, then, where you came to me to-day, in the church. I will
17684: be there at ten; and if you are not there, I will go again towards
17685: mid-day. Can you remember?”
17686: 
17687: “Mid-day,” said Baldassarre—“only mid-day. The same place, and mid-day.
17688: And, after that,” he added, rising and grasping her arm again with his
17689: left hand, while he held the knife in his right; “we will have our
17690: revenge. He shall feel the sharp edge of justice. The world is against
17691: me, but you will help me.”
17692: 
17693: “I would help you in other ways,” said Romola, making a first, timid
17694: effort to dispel his illusion about her. “I fear you are in want; you
17695: have to labour, and get little. I should like to bring you comforts,
17696: and make you feel again that there is some one who cares for you.”
17697: 
17698: “Talk no more about that,” said Baldassarre, fiercely. “I will have
17699: nothing else. Help me to wring one drop of vengeance on this side of
17700: the grave. I have nothing but my knife. It is sharp; but there is a
17701: moment after the thrust when men see the face of death,—and it shall be
17702: my face that he will see.”
17703: 
17704: He loosed his hold, and sank down again in a sitting posture. Romola
17705: felt helpless: she must defer all intentions till the morrow.
17706: 
17707: “Mid-day, then,” she said, in a distinct voice.
17708: 
17709: “Yes,” he answered, with an air of exhaustion. “Go; I will rest here.”
17710: 
17711: She hastened away. Turning at the last spot whence he was likely to be
17712: in sight, she saw him seated still.
17713: 
17714: 
17715: 
17716: 
17717: CHAPTER LIV.
17718: The Evening and the Morning.
17719: 
17720: 
17721: Romola had a purpose in her mind as she was hastening away; a purpose
17722: which had been growing through the afternoon hours like a side-stream,
17723: rising higher and higher along with the main current. It was less a
17724: resolve than a necessity of her feeling. Heedless of the darkening
17725: streets, and not caring to call for Maso’s slow escort, she hurried
17726: across the bridge where the river showed itself black before the
17727: distant dying red, and took the most direct way to the Old Palace. She
17728: might encounter her husband there. No matter. She could not weigh
17729: probabilities; she must discharge her heart. She did not know what she
17730: passed in the pillared court or up the wide stairs; she only knew that
17731: she asked an usher for the Gonfaloniere, giving her name, and begging
17732: to be shown into a private room.
17733: 
17734: She was not left long alone with the frescoed figures and the newly-lit
17735: tapers. Soon the door opened, and Bernardo del Nero entered, still
17736: carrying his white head erect above his silk lucco.
17737: 
17738: “Romola, my child, what is this?” he said, in a tone of anxious
17739: surprise as he closed the door.
17740: 
17741: She had uncovered her head and went towards him without speaking. He
17742: laid his hand on her shoulder, and held her a little way from him that
17743: he might see her better. Her face was haggard from fatigue and long
17744: agitation, her hair had rolled down in disorder; but there was an
17745: excitement in her eyes that seemed to have triumphed over the bodily
17746: consciousness.
17747: 
17748: “What has he done?” said Bernardo, abruptly. “Tell me everything,
17749: child; throw away pride. I am your father.”
17750: 
17751: “It is not about myself—nothing about myself,” said Romola, hastily.
17752: “Dearest godfather, it is about you. I have heard things—some I cannot
17753: tell you. But you are in danger in the palace; you are in danger
17754: everywhere. There are fanatical men who would harm you, and—and there
17755: are traitors. Trust nobody. If you trust, you will be betrayed.”
17756: 
17757: Bernardo smiled.
17758: 
17759: “Have you worked yourself up into this agitation, my poor child,” he
17760: said, raising his hand to her head and patting it gently, “to tell such
17761: old truth as that to an old man like me?”
17762: 
17763: “Oh no, no! they are not old truths that I mean,” said Romola, pressing
17764: her clasped hands painfully together, as if that action would help her
17765: to suppress what must not be told. “They are fresh things that I know,
17766: but cannot tell. Dearest godfather, you know I am not foolish. I would
17767: not come to you without reason. Is it too late to warn you against any
17768: one, _every_ one who seems to be working on your side? Is it too late
17769: to say, ‘Go to your villa and keep away in the country when these three
17770: more days of office are over?’ Oh God! perhaps it is too late! and if
17771: any harm comes to you, it will be as if I had done it!”
17772: 
17773: The last words had burst from Romola involuntarily: a long-stifled
17774: feeling had found spasmodic utterance. But she herself was startled and
17775: arrested.
17776: 
17777: “I mean,” she added, hesitatingly, “I know nothing positive. I only
17778: know what fills me with fears.”
17779: 
17780: “Poor child!” said Bernardo, looking at her with quiet penetration for
17781: a moment or two. Then he said: “Go, Romola—go home and rest. These
17782: fears may be only big ugly shadows of something very little and
17783: harmless. Even traitors must see their interest in betraying; the rats
17784: will run where they smell the cheese, and there is no knowing yet which
17785: way the scent will come.”
17786: 
17787: He paused, and turned away his eyes from her with an air of
17788: abstraction, till, with a slow shrug, he added—
17789: 
17790: “As for warnings, they are of no use to me, child. I enter into no
17791: plots, but I never forsake my colours. If I march abreast with
17792: obstinate men, who will rush on guns and pikes, I must share the
17793: consequences. Let us say no more about that. I have not many years left
17794: at the bottom of my sack for them to rob me of. Go, child; go home and
17795: rest.”
17796: 
17797: He put his hand on her head again caressingly, and she could not help
17798: clinging to his arm, and pressing her brow against his shoulder. Her
17799: godfather’s caress seemed the last thing that was left to her out of
17800: that young filial life, which now looked so happy to her even in its
17801: troubles, for they were troubles untainted by anything hateful.
17802: 
17803: “Is silence best, my Romola?” said the old man.
17804: 
17805: “Yes, now; but I cannot tell whether it always will be,” she answered,
17806: hesitatingly, raising her head with an appealing look.
17807: 
17808: “Well, you have a father’s ear while I am above ground,”—he lifted the
17809: black drapery and folded it round her head, adding—“and a father’s
17810: home; remember that.” Then opening the door, he said: “There, hasten
17811: away. You are like a black ghost; you will be safe enough.”
17812: 
17813: When Romola fell asleep that night, she slept deep. Agitation had
17814: reached its limits; she must gather strength before she could suffer
17815: more; and, in spite of rigid habit, she slept on far beyond sunrise.
17816: 
17817: When she awoke, it was to the sound of guns. Piero de’ Medici, with
17818: thirteen hundred men at his back, was before the gate that looks
17819: towards Rome.
17820: 
17821: So much Romola learned from Maso, with many circumstantial additions of
17822: dubious quality. A countryman had come in and alarmed the Signoria
17823: before it was light, else the city would have been taken by surprise.
17824: His master was not in the house, having been summoned to the Palazzo
17825: long ago. She sent out the old man again, that he might gather news,
17826: while she went up to the loggia from time to time to try and discern
17827: any signs of the dreaded entrance having been made, or of its having
17828: been effectively repelled. Maso brought her word that the great Piazza
17829: was full of armed men, and that many of the chief citizens suspected as
17830: friends of the Medici had been summoned to the palace and detained
17831: there. Some of the people seemed not to mind whether Piero got in or
17832: not, and some said the Signoria itself had invited him; but however
17833: that might be, they were giving him an ugly welcome; and the soldiers
17834: from Pisa were coming against him.
17835: 
17836: In her memory of those morning hours, there were not many things that
17837: Romola could distinguish as actual external experiences standing
17838: markedly out above the tumultuous waves of retrospect and anticipation.
17839: She knew that she had really walked to the Badia by the appointed time
17840: in spite of street alarms; she knew that she had waited there in vain.
17841: And the scene she had witnessed when she came out of the church, and
17842: stood watching on the steps while the doors were being closed behind
17843: her for the afternoon interval, always came back to her like a
17844: remembered waking.
17845: 
17846: There was a change in the faces and tones of the people, armed and
17847: unarmed, who were pausing or hurrying along the streets. The guns were
17848: firing again, but the sound only provoked laughter. She soon knew the
17849: cause of the change. Piero de’ Medici and his horsemen had turned their
17850: backs on Florence, and were galloping as fast as they could along the
17851: Siena road. She learned this from a substantial shop-keeping Piagnone,
17852: who had not yet laid down his pike.
17853: 
17854: “It is true,” he ended, with a certain bitterness in his emphasis.
17855: “Piero is gone, but there are those left behind who were in the secret
17856: of his coming—we all know that; and if the new Signoria does its duty
17857: we shall soon know who they are.”
17858: 
17859: The words darted through Romola like a sharp spasm; but the evil they
17860: foreshadowed was not yet close upon her, and as she entered her home
17861: again, her most pressing anxiety was the possibility that she had lost
17862: sight for a long while of Baldassarre.
17863: 
17864: 
17865: 
17866: 
17867: CHAPTER LV.
17868: Waiting.
17869: 
17870: 
17871: The lengthening sunny days went on without bringing either what Romola
17872: most desired or what she most dreaded. They brought no sign from
17873: Baldassarre, and, in spite of special watch on the part of the
17874: Government, no revelation of the suspected conspiracy. But they brought
17875: other things which touched her closely, and bridged the phantom-crowded
17876: space of anxiety with active sympathy in immediate trial. They brought
17877: the spreading Plague and the Excommunication of Savonarola.
17878: 
17879: Both these events tended to arrest her incipient alienation from the
17880: Frate, and to rivet again her attachment to the man who had opened to
17881: her the new life of duty, and who seemed now to be worsted in the fight
17882: for principle against profligacy. For Romola could not carry from day
17883: to day into the abodes of pestilence and misery the sublime excitement
17884: of a gladness that, since such anguish existed, she too existed to make
17885: some of the anguish less bitter, without remembering that she owed this
17886: transcendent moral life to Fra Girolamo. She could not witness the
17887: silencing and excommunication of a man whose distinction from the great
17888: mass of the clergy lay, not in any heretical belief, not in his
17889: superstitions, but in the energy with which he sought to make the
17890: Christian life a reality, without feeling herself drawn strongly to his
17891: side.
17892: 
17893: Far on in the hot days of June the Excommunication, for some weeks
17894: arrived from Rome, was solemnly published in the Duomo. Romola went to
17895: witness the scene, that the resistance it inspired might invigorate
17896: that sympathy with Savonarola which was one source of her strength. It
17897: was in memorable contrast with the scene she had been accustomed to
17898: witness there.
17899: 
17900: Instead of upturned citizen-faces filling the vast area under the
17901: morning light, the youngest rising amphitheatre-wise towards the walls,
17902: and making a garland of hope around the memories of age—instead of the
17903: mighty voice thrilling all hearts with the sense of great things,
17904: visible and invisible, to be struggled for—there were the bare walls at
17905: evening made more sombre by the glimmer of tapers; there was the black
17906: and grey flock of monks and secular clergy with bent, unexpectant
17907: faces; there was the occasional tinkling of little bells in the pauses
17908: of a monotonous voice reading a sentence which had already been long
17909: hanging up in the churches; and at last there was the extinction of the
17910: tapers, and the slow, shuffling tread of monkish feet departing in the
17911: dim silence.
17912: 
17913: Romola’s ardour on the side of the Frate was doubly strengthened by the
17914: gleeful triumph she saw in hard and coarse faces, and by the
17915: fear-stricken confusion in the faces and speech of many among his
17916: strongly-attached friends. The question where the duty of obedience
17917: ends, and the duty of resistance begins, could in no case be an easy
17918: one; but it was made overwhelmingly difficult by the belief that the
17919: Church was—not a compromise of parties to secure a more or less
17920: approximate justice in the appropriation of funds, but—a living
17921: organism, instinct with Divine power to bless and to curse. To most of
17922: the pious Florentines, who had hitherto felt no doubt in their
17923: adherence to the Frate, that belief in the Divine potency of the Church
17924: was not an embraced opinion, it was an inalienable impression, like the
17925: concavity of the blue firmament; and the boldness of Savonarola’s
17926: written arguments that the Excommunication was unjust, and that, being
17927: unjust, it was not valid, only made them tremble the more, as a
17928: defiance cast at a mystic image, against whose subtle immeasurable
17929: power there was neither weapon nor defence.
17930: 
17931: But Romola, whose mind had not been allowed to draw its early
17932: nourishment from the traditional associations of the Christian
17933: community in which her father had lived a life apart, felt her relation
17934: to the Church only through Savonarola; his moral force had been the
17935: only authority to which she had bowed; and in his excommunication she
17936: only saw the menace of hostile vice: on one side she saw a man whose
17937: life was devoted to the ends of public virtue and spiritual purity, and
17938: on the other the assault of alarmed selfishness, headed by a lustful,
17939: greedy, lying, and murderous old man, once called Rodrigo Borgia, and
17940: now lifted to the pinnacle of infamy as Pope Alexander the Sixth. The
17941: finer shades of fact which soften the edge of such antitheses are not
17942: apt to be seen except by neutrals, who are not distressed to discern
17943: some folly in martyrs and some judiciousness in the men who burnt them.
17944: But Romola required a strength that neutrality could not give; and this
17945: Excommunication, which simplified and ennobled the resistant position
17946: of Savonarola by bringing into prominence its wider relations, seemed
17947: to come to her like a rescue from the threatening isolation of
17948: criticism and doubt. The Frate was now withdrawn from that smaller
17949: antagonism against Florentine enemies into which he continually fell in
17950: the unchecked excitement of the pulpit, and presented himself simply as
17951: appealing to the Christian world against a vicious exercise of
17952: ecclesiastical power. He was a standard-bearer leaping into the breach.
17953: Life never seems so clear and easy as when the heart is beating faster
17954: at the sight of some generous self-risking deed. We feel no doubt then
17955: what is the highest prize the soul can win; we almost believe in our
17956: own power to attain it. By a new current of such enthusiasm Romola was
17957: helped through these difficult summer days. She had ventured on no
17958: words to Tito that would apprise him of her late interview with
17959: Baldassarre, and the revelation he had made to her. What would such
17960: agitating, difficult words win from him? No admission of the truth;
17961: nothing, probably, but a cool sarcasm about her sympathy with his
17962: assassin. Baldassarre was evidently helpless: the thing to be feared
17963: was, not that he should injure Tito, but that Tito, coming upon his
17964: traces, should carry out some new scheme for ridding himself of the
17965: injured man who was a haunting dread to him. Romola felt that she could
17966: do nothing decisive until she had seen Baldassarre again, and learned
17967: the full truth about that “other wife”—learned whether she were the
17968: wife to whom Tito was first bound.
17969: 
17970: The possibilities about that other wife, which involved the worst wound
17971: to her hereditary pride, mingled themselves as a newly-embittering
17972: suspicion with the earliest memories of her illusory love, eating away
17973: the lingering associations of tenderness with the past image of her
17974: husband; and her irresistible belief in the rest of Baldassarre’s
17975: revelation made her shrink from Tito with a horror which would perhaps
17976: have urged some passionate speech in spite of herself if he had not
17977: been more than usually absent from home. Like many of the wealthier
17978: citizens in that time of pestilence, he spent the intervals of business
17979: chiefly in the country: the agreeable Melema was welcome at many
17980: villas, and since Romola had refused to leave the city, he had no need
17981: to provide a country residence of his own.
17982: 
17983: But at last, in the later days of July, the alleviation of those public
17984: troubles which had absorbed her activity and much of her thought, left
17985: Romola to a less counteracted sense of her personal lot. The Plague had
17986: almost disappeared, and the position of Savonarola was made more
17987: hopeful by a favourable magistracy, who were writing urgent vindicatory
17988: letters to Rome on his behalf, entreating the withdrawal of the
17989: Excommunication.
17990: 
17991: Romola’s healthy and vigorous frame was undergoing the reaction of
17992: languor inevitable after continuous excitement and over-exertion; but
17993: her mental restlessness would not allow her to remain at home without
17994: peremptory occupation, except during the sultry hours. In the cool of
17995: the morning and evening she walked out constantly, varying her
17996: direction as much as possible, with the vague hope that if Baldassarre
17997: were still alive she might encounter him. Perhaps some illness had
17998: brought a new paralysis of memory, and he had forgotten where she
17999: lived—forgotten even her existence. That was her most sanguine
18000: explanation of his non-appearance. The explanation she felt to be most
18001: probable was, that he had died of the Plague.

18005: 
18006: CHAPTER LVI.
18007: The Other Wife.
18008: 
18009: 
18010: The morning warmth was already beginning to be rather oppressive to
18011: Romola, when, after a walk along by the walls on her way from San
18012: Marco, she turned towards the intersecting streets again at the gate of
18013: Santa Croce.
18014: 
18015: The Borgo La Croce was so still, that she listened to her own footsteps
18016: on the pavement in the sunny silence, until, on approaching a bend in
18017: the street, she saw, a few yards before her, a little child not more
18018: than three years old, with no other clothing than his white shirt,
18019: pause from a waddling run and look around him. In the first moment of
18020: coming nearer she could only see his back—a boy’s back, square and
18021: sturdy, with a cloud of reddish-brown curls above it; but in the next
18022: he turned towards her, and she could see his dark eyes wide with tears,
18023: and his lower lip pushed up and trembling, while his fat brown fists
18024: clutched his shirt helplessly. The glimpse of a tall black figure
18025: sending a shadow over him brought his bewildered fear to a climax, and
18026: a loud crying sob sent the big tears rolling.
18027: 
18028: Romola, with the ready maternal instinct which was one hidden source of
18029: her passionate tenderness, instantly uncovered her head, and, stooping
18030: down on the pavement, put her arms round him, and her cheeks against
18031: his, while she spoke to him in caressing tones. At first his sobs were
18032: only the louder, but he made no effort to get away, and presently the
18033: outburst ceased with that strange abruptness which belongs to childish
18034: joys and griefs: his face lost its distortion, and was fixed in an
18035: open-mouthed gaze at Romola.
18036: 
18037: “You have lost yourself, little one,” she said, kissing him. “Never
18038: mind! we will find the house again. Perhaps mamma will meet us.”
18039: 
18040: She divined that he had made his escape at a moment when the mother’s
18041: eyes were turned away from him, and thought it likely that he would
18042: soon be followed.
18043: 
18044: “Oh, what a heavy, heavy boy!” she said, trying to lift him. “I cannot
18045: carry you. Come, then, you must toddle back by my side.”
18046: 
18047: The parted lips remained motionless in awed silence, and one brown fist
18048: still clutched the shirt with as much tenacity as ever; but the other
18049: yielded itself quite willingly to the wonderful white hand, strong but
18050: soft.
18051: 
18052: “You _have_ a mamma?” said Romola, as they set out, looking down at the
18053: boy with a certain yearning. But he was mute. A girl under those
18054: circumstances might perhaps have chirped abundantly; not so this
18055: square-shouldered little man with the big cloud of curls.
18056: 
18057: He was awake to the first sign of his whereabout, however. At the
18058: turning by the front of San Ambrogio he dragged Romola towards it,
18059: looking up at her.
18060: 
18061: “Ah, that is the way home, is it?” she said, smiling at him. He only
18062: thrust his head forward and pulled, as an admonition that they should
18063: go faster.
18064: 
18065: There was still another turning that he had a decided opinion about,
18066: and then Romola found herself in a short street leading to open garden
18067: ground. It was in front of a house at the end of this street that the
18068: little fellow paused, pulling her towards some stone stairs. He had
18069: evidently no wish for her to loose his hand, and she would not have
18070: been willing to leave him without being sure that she was delivering
18071: him to his friends. They mounted the stairs, seeing but dimly in that
18072: sudden withdrawal from the sunlight, till, at the final landing-place,
18073: an extra stream of light came from an open doorway. Passing through a
18074: small lobby, they came to another open door, and there Romola paused.
18075: Her approach had not been heard.
18076: 
18077: On a low chair at the farther end of the room, opposite the light, sat
18078: Tessa, with one hand on the edge of the cradle, and her head hanging a
18079: little on one side, fast asleep. Near one of the windows, with her back
18080: turned towards the door, sat Monna Lisa at her work of preparing salad,
18081: in deaf unconsciousness. There was only an instant for Romola’s eyes to
18082: take in that still scene; for Lillo snatched his hand away from her and
18083: ran up to his mother’s side, not making any direct effort to wake her,
18084: but only leaning his head back against her arm, and surveying Romola
18085: seriously from that distance.
18086: 
18087: As Lillo pushed against her, Tessa opened her eyes, and looked up in
18088: bewilderment; but her glance had no sooner rested on the figure at the
18089: opposite doorway than she started up, blushed deeply, and began to
18090: tremble a little, neither speaking nor moving forward.
18091: 
18092: “Ah! we have seen each other before,” said Romola, smiling, and coming
18093: forward. “I am glad it was _your_ little boy. He was crying in the
18094: street; I suppose he had run away. So we walked together a little way,
18095: and then he knew where he was, and brought me here. But you had not
18096: missed him? That is well, else you would have been frightened.”
18097: 
18098: The shock of finding that Lillo had run away overcame every other
18099: feeling in Tessa for the moment. Her colour went again, and, seizing
18100: Lillo’s arm, she ran with him to Monna Lisa, saying, with a half sob,
18101: loud in the old woman’s ear—
18102: 
18103: “Oh, Lisa, you are wicked! Why will you stand with your back to the
18104: door? Lillo ran away ever so far into the street.”
18105: 
18106: “Holy Mother!” said Monna Lisa, in her meek, thick tone, letting the
18107: spoon fall from her hands. “Where were _you_, then? I thought you were
18108: there, and had your eye on him.”
18109: 
18110: “But you _know_ I go to sleep when I am rocking,” said Tessa, in
18111: pettish remonstrance.
18112: 
18113: “Well, well, we must keep the outer door shut, or else tie him up,”
18114: said Monna Lisa, “for he’ll be as cunning as Satan before long, and
18115: that’s the holy truth. But how came he back, then?”
18116: 
18117: This question recalled Tessa to the consciousness of Romola’s presence.
18118: Without answering, she turned towards her, blushing and timid again,
18119: and Monna Lisa’s eyes followed her movement. The old woman made a low
18120: reverence, and said—
18121: 
18122: “Doubtless the most noble lady brought him back.” Then, advancing a
18123: little nearer to Romola, she added, “It’s my shame for him to have been
18124: found with only his shirt on; but he kicked, and wouldn’t have his
18125: other clothes on this morning, and the mother, poor thing, will never
18126: hear of his being beaten. But what’s an old woman to do without a stick
18127: when the lad’s legs get so strong? Let your nobleness look at his
18128: legs.”
18129: 
18130: Lillo, conscious that his legs were in question, pulled his shirt up a
18131: little higher, and looked down at their olive roundness with a
18132: dispassionate and curious air. Romola laughed, and stooped to give him
18133: a caressing shake and a kiss, and this action helped the reassurance
18134: that Tessa had already gathered from Monna Lisa’s address to Romola.
18135: For when Naldo had been told about the adventure at the Carnival, and
18136: Tessa had asked him who the heavenly lady that had come just when she
18137: was wanted, and had vanished so soon, was likely to be—whether she
18138: could be the Holy Madonna herself?—he had answered, “Not exactly, my
18139: Tessa; only one of the saints,” and had not chosen to say more. So that
18140: in the dreamlike combination of small experience which made up Tessa’s
18141: thought, Romola had remained confusedly associated with the pictures in
18142: the churches, and when she reappeared, the grateful remembrance of her
18143: protection was slightly tinctured with religious awe—not deeply, for
18144: Tessa’s dread was chiefly of ugly and evil beings. It seemed unlikely
18145: that good beings would be angry and punish her, as it was the nature of
18146: Nofri and the devil to do. And now that Monna Lisa had spoken freely
18147: about Lillo’s legs and Romola had laughed, Tessa was more at her ease.
18148: 
18149: “Ninna’s in the cradle,” she said. “_She’s_ pretty too.”
18150: 
18151: Romola went to look at the sleeping Ninna, and Monna Lisa, one of the
18152: exceptionally meek deaf, who never expect to be spoken to, returned to
18153: her salad.
18154: 
18155: “Ah! she is waking: she has opened her blue eyes,” said Romola. “You
18156: must take her up, and I will sit down in this chair—may I?—and nurse
18157: Lillo. Come, Lillo!”
18158: 
18159: She sat down in Tito’s chair, and put out her arms towards the lad,
18160: whose eyes had followed her. He hesitated: and, pointing his small
18161: fingers at her with a half-puzzled, half-angry feeling, said, “That’s
18162: Babbo’s chair,” not seeing his way out of the difficulty if Babbo came
18163: and found Romola in his place.
18164: 
18165: “But Babbo is not here, and I shall go soon. Come, let me nurse you as
18166: he does,” said Romola, wondering to herself for the first time what
18167: sort of Babbo he was whose wife was dressed in contadina fashion, but
18168: had a certain daintiness about her person that indicated idleness and
18169: plenty. Lillo consented to be lifted up, and, finding the lap
18170: exceedingly comfortable, began to explore her dress and hands, to see
18171: if there were any ornaments beside the rosary.
18172: 
18173: Tessa, who had hitherto been occupied in coaxing Ninna out of her
18174: waking peevishness, now sat down in her low chair, near Romola’s knee,
18175: arranging Ninna’s tiny person to advantage, jealous that the strange
18176: lady too seemed to notice the boy most, as Naldo did.
18177: 
18178: “Lillo was going to be angry with me, because I sat in Babbo’s chair,”
18179: said Romola, as she bent forward to kiss Ninna’s little foot. “Will he
18180: come soon and want it?”
18181: 
18182: “Ah, no!” said Tessa, “you can sit in it a long while. I shall be sorry
18183: when you go. When you first came to take care of me at the Carnival, I
18184: thought it was wonderful; you came and went away again so fast. And
18185: Naldo said, perhaps you were a saint, and that made me tremble a
18186: little, though the saints are very good, I know; and you were good to
18187: me, and now you have taken care of Lillo. Perhaps you will always come
18188: and take care of me. That was how Naldo did a long while ago; he came
18189: and took care of me when I was frightened, one San Giovanni. I couldn’t
18190: think where he came from—he was so beautiful and good. And so are you,”
18191: ended Tessa, looking up at Romola with devout admiration.
18192: 
18193: “Naldo is your husband. His eyes are like Lillo’s,” said Romola,
18194: looking at the boy’s darkly-pencilled eyebrows, unusual at his age. She
18195: did not speak interrogatively, but with a quiet certainty of inference
18196: which was necessarily mysterious to Tessa.
18197: 
18198: “Ah! you know him!” she said, pausing a little in wonder. “Perhaps you
18199: know Nofri and Peretola, and our house on the hill, and everything.
18200: Yes, like Lillo’s; but not his hair. His hair is dark and long—” she
18201: went on, getting rather excited. “Ah! if you know it, ecco!”
18202: 
18203: She had put her hand to a thin red silk cord that hung round her neck,
18204: and drew from her bosom the tiny old parchment _Breve_, the horn of red
18205: coral, and a long dark curl carefully tied at one end and suspended
18206: with those mystic treasures. She held them towards Romola, away from
18207: Ninna’s snatching hand.
18208: 
18209: “It is a fresh one. I cut it lately. See how bright it is!” she said,
18210: laying it against the white background of Romola’s fingers. “They get
18211: dim, and then he lets me cut another when his hair is grown; and I put
18212: it with the _Breve_, because sometimes he is away a long while, and
18213: then I think it helps to take care of me.”
18214: 
18215: A slight shiver passed through Romola as the curl was laid across her
18216: fingers. At Tessa’s first mention of her husband as having come
18217: mysteriously she knew not whence, a possibility had risen before Romola
18218: that made her heart beat faster; for to one who is anxiously in search
18219: of a certain object the faintest suggestions have a peculiar
18220: significance. And when the curl was held towards her, it seemed for an
18221: instant like a mocking phantasm of the lock she herself had cut to wind
18222: with one of her own five years ago. But she preserved her outward
18223: calmness, bent not only on knowing the truth, but also on coming to
18224: that knowledge in a way that would not pain this poor, trusting,
18225: ignorant thing, with the child’s mind in the woman’s body. “Foolish and
18226: helpless:” yes; so far she corresponded to Baldassarre’s account.
18227: 
18228: “It is a beautiful curl,” she said, resisting the impulse to withdraw
18229: her hand. “Lillo’s curls will be like it, perhaps, for _his_ cheek,
18230: too, is dark. And you never know where your husband goes to when he
18231: leaves you?”
18232: 
18233: “No,” said Tessa, putting back her treasures out of the children’s way.
18234: “But I know Messer San Michele takes care of him, for he gave him a
18235: beautiful coat, all made of little chains; and if he puts that on,
18236: nobody can kill him. And perhaps, if—”
18237: 
18238: Tessa hesitated a little, under a recurrence of that original dreamy
18239: wonder about Romola which had been expelled by chatting contact—“if you
18240: _were_ a saint, you would take care of him, too, because you have taken
18241: care of me and Lillo.”
18242: 
18243: An agitated flush came over Romola’s face in the first moment of
18244: certainty, but she had bent her cheek against Lillo’s head. The feeling
18245: that leaped out in that flush was something like exultation at the
18246: thought that the wife’s burden might be about to slip from her
18247: overladen shoulders; that this little ignorant creature might prove to
18248: be Tito’s lawful wife. A strange exultation for a proud and high-born
18249: woman to have been brought to! But it seemed to Romola as if that were
18250: the only issue that would make duty anything else for her than an
18251: insoluble problem. Yet she was not deaf to Tessa’s last appealing
18252: words; she raised her head, and said, in her clearest tones—
18253: 
18254: “I will always take care of you if I see you need me. But that
18255: beautiful coat? your husband did not wear it when you were first
18256: married? Perhaps he used not to be so long away from you then?”
18257: 
18258: “Ah, yes! he was. Much—much longer. So long, I thought he would never
18259: come back. I used to cry. Oh me! I was beaten then; a long, long while
18260: ago at Peretola, where we had the goats and mules.”
18261: 
18262: “And how long had you been married before your husband had that
18263: chain-coat?” said Romola, her heart beating faster and faster.
18264: 
18265: Tessa looked meditative, and began to count on her fingers, and Romola
18266: watched the fingers as if they would tell the secret of her destiny.
18267: 
18268: “The chestnuts were ripe when we were married,” said Tessa, marking off
18269: her thumb and fingers again as she spoke; “and then again they were
18270: ripe at Peretola before he came back, and then again, after that, on
18271: the hill. And soon the soldiers came, and we heard the trumpets, and
18272: then Naldo had the coat.”
18273: 
18274: “You had been married more than two years. In which church were you
18275: married?” said Romola, too entirely absorbed by one thought to put any
18276: question that was less direct. Perhaps before the next morning she
18277: might go to her godfather and say that she was not Tito Melema’s lawful
18278: wife—that the vows which had bound her to strive after an impossible
18279: union had been made void beforehand.
18280: 
18281: Tessa gave a slight start at Romola’s new tone of inquiry, and looked
18282: up at her with a hesitating expression. Hitherto she had prattled on
18283: without consciousness that she was making revelations, any more than
18284: when she said old things over and over again to Monna Lisa.
18285: 
18286: “Naldo said I was never to tell about that,” she said, doubtfully. “Do
18287: you think he would not be angry if I told you?”
18288: 
18289: “It is right that you should tell me. Tell me everything,” said Romola,
18290: looking at her with mild authority.
18291: 
18292: If the impression from Naldo’s command had been much more recent than
18293: it was, the constraining effect of Romola’s mysterious authority would
18294: have overcome it. But the sense that she was telling what she had never
18295: told before made her begin with a lowered voice.
18296: 
18297: “It was not in a church—it was at the Nativita, when there was a fair,
18298: and all the people went overnight to see the Madonna in the Nunziata,
18299: and my mother was ill and couldn’t go, and I took the bunch of cocoons
18300: for her; and then he came to me in the church and I heard him say,
18301: ‘Tessa!’ I knew him because he had taken care of me at the San
18302: Giovanni, and then we went into the piazza where the fair was, and I
18303: had some _berlingozzi_, for I was hungry and he was very good to me;
18304: and at the end of the piazza there was a holy father, and an altar like
18305: what they have at the processions outside the churches. So he married
18306: us, and then Naldo took me back into the church and left me; and I went
18307: home, and my mother died, and Nofri began to beat me more, and Naldo
18308: never came back. And I used to cry, and once at the Carnival I saw him
18309: and followed him, and he was angry, and said he would come some time, I
18310: must wait. So I went and waited; but, oh! it was a long while before he
18311: came; but he would have come if he could, for he was good; and then he
18312: took me away, because I cried and said I could not bear to stay with
18313: Nofri. And, oh! I was so glad, and since then I have been always happy,
18314: for I don’t mind about the goats and mules, because I have Lillo and
18315: Ninna now; and Naldo is never angry, only I think he doesn’t love Ninna
18316: so well as Lillo, and she _is_ pretty.”
18317: 
18318: Quite forgetting that she had thought her speech rather momentous at
18319: the beginning, Tessa fell to devouring Ninna with kisses, while Romola
18320: sat in silence with absent eyes. It was inevitable that in this moment
18321: she should think of the three beings before her chiefly in their
18322: relation to her own lot, and she was feeling the chill of
18323: disappointment that her difficulties were not to be solved by external
18324: law. She had relaxed her hold of Lillo, and was leaning her cheek
18325: against her hand, seeing nothing of the scene around her. Lillo was
18326: quick in perceiving a change that was not agreeable to him; he had not
18327: yet made any return to her caresses, but he objected to their
18328: withdrawal, and putting up both his brown arms to pull her head towards
18329: him, he said, “Play with me again!”
18330: 
18331: Romola, roused from her self-absorption, clasped the lad anew, and
18332: looked from him to Tessa, who had now paused from her shower of kisses,
18333: and seemed to have returned to the more placid delight of contemplating
18334: the heavenly lady’s face. That face was undergoing a subtle change,
18335: like the gradual oncoming of a warmer, softer light. Presently Romola
18336: took her scissors from her scarsella, and cut off one of her long wavy
18337: locks, while the three pair of wide eyes followed her movements with
18338: kitten-like observation.
18339: 
18340: “I must go away from you now,” she said, “but I will leave this lock of
18341: hair that it may remind you of me, because if you are ever in trouble
18342: you can think that perhaps God will send me to take care of you again.
18343: I cannot tell you where to find me, but if I ever know that you want
18344: me, I will come to you. Addio!”
18345: 
18346: She had set down Lillo hurriedly, and held out her hand to Tessa, who
18347: kissed it with a mixture of awe and sorrow at this parting. Romola’s
18348: mind was oppressed with thoughts; she needed to be alone as soon as
18349: possible, but with her habitual care for the least fortunate, she
18350: turned aside to put her hand in a friendly way on Monna Lisa’s shoulder
18351: and make her a farewell sign. Before the old woman had finished her
18352: deep reverence, Romola had disappeared.
18353: 
18354: Monna Lisa and Tessa moved towards each other by simultaneous impulses,
18355: while the two children stood clinging to their mother’s skirts as if
18356: they, too, felt the atmosphere of awe.
18357: 
18358: “Do you think she _was_ a saint?” said Tessa, in Lisa’s ear, showing
18359: her the lock.
18360: 
18361: Lisa rejected that notion very decidedly by a backward movement of her
18362: fingers, and then stroking the rippled gold, said—
18363: 
18364: “She’s a great and noble lady. I saw such in my youth.”
18365: 
18366: Romola went home and sat alone through the sultry hours of that day
18367: with the heavy certainty that her lot was unchanged. She was thrown
18368: back again on the conflict between the demands of an outward law, which
18369: she recognised as a widely-ramifying obligation, and the demands of
18370: inner moral facts which were becoming more and more peremptory. She had
18371: drunk in deeply the spirit of that teaching by which Savonarola had
18372: urged her to return to her place. She felt that the sanctity attached
18373: to all close relations, and, therefore, pre-eminently to the closest,
18374: was but the expression in outward law of that result towards which all
18375: human goodness and nobleness must spontaneously tend; that the light
18376: abandonment of ties, whether inherited or voluntary, because they had
18377: ceased to be pleasant, was the uprooting of social and personal virtue.
18378: What else had Tito’s crime towards Baldassarre been but that
18379: abandonment working itself out to the most hideous extreme of falsity
18380: and ingratitude?
18381: 
18382: And the inspiring consciousness breathed into her by Savonarola’s
18383: influence that her lot was vitally united with the general lot had
18384: exalted even the minor details of obligation into religion. She was
18385: marching with a great army; she was feeling the stress of a common
18386: life. If victims were needed, and it was uncertain on whom the lot
18387: might fall, she would stand ready to answer to her name. She had stood
18388: long; she had striven hard to fulfil the bond, but she had seen all the
18389: conditions which made the fulfilment possible gradually forsaking her.
18390: The one effect of her marriage-tie seemed to be the stifling
18391: predominance over her of a nature that she despised. All her efforts at
18392: union had only made its impossibility more palpable, and the relation
18393: had become for her simply a degrading servitude. The law was sacred.
18394: Yes, but rebellion might be sacred too. It flashed upon her mind that
18395: the problem before her was essentially the same as that which had lain
18396: before Savonarola—the problem where the sacredness of obedience ended,
18397: and where the sacredness of rebellion began. To her, as to him, there
18398: had come one of those moments in life when the soul must dare to act on
18399: its own warrant, not only without external law to appeal to, but in the
18400: face of a law which is not unarmed with Divine lightnings—lightnings
18401: that may yet fall if the warrant has been false.
18402: 
18403: Before the sun had gone down she had adopted a resolve. She would ask
18404: no counsel of her godfather or of Savonarola until she had made one
18405: determined effort to speak freely with Tito and obtain his consent that
18406: she should live apart from him. She desired not to leave him
18407: clandestinely again, or to forsake Florence. She would tell him that if
18408: he ever felt a real need of her, she would come back to him. Was not
18409: that the utmost faithfulness to her bond that could be required of her?
18410: A shuddering anticipation came over her that he would clothe a refusal
18411: in a sneering suggestion that she should enter a convent as the only
18412: mode of quitting him that would not be scandalous. He knew well that
18413: her mind revolted from that means of escape, not only because of her
18414: own repugnance to a narrow rule, but because all the cherished memories
18415: of her father forbade that she should adopt a mode of life which was
18416: associated with his deepest griefs and his bitterest dislike.
18417: 
18418: Tito had announced his intention of coming home this evening. She would
18419: wait for him, and say what she had to say at once, for it was difficult
18420: to get his ear during the day. If he had the slightest suspicion that
18421: personal words were coming, he slipped away with an appearance of
18422: unpremeditated ease. When she sent for Maso to tell him that she would
18423: wait for his master, she observed that the old man looked at her and
18424: lingered with a mixture of hesitation and wondering anxiety; but
18425: finding that she asked him no question, he slowly turned away. Why
18426: should she ask questions? Perhaps Maso only knew or guessed something
18427: of what she knew already.
18428: 
18429: It was late before Tito came. Romola had been pacing up and down the
18430: long room which had once been the library, with the windows open, and a
18431: loose white linen robe on instead of her usual black garment. She was
18432: glad of that change after the long hours of heat and motionless
18433: meditation; but the coolness and exercise made her more intensely
18434: wakeful, and as she went with the lamp in her hand to open the door for
18435: Tito, he might well have been startled by the vividness of her eyes and
18436: the expression of painful resolution, which was in contrast with her
18437: usual self-restrained quiescence before him. But it seemed that this
18438: excitement was just what he expected.
18439: 
18440: “Ah! it is you, Romola. Maso is gone to bed,” he said, in a grave,
18441: quiet tone, interposing to close the door for her. Then, turning round,
18442: he said, looking at her more fully than he was wont, “You have heard it
18443: all, I see.”
18444: 
18445: Romola quivered. _He_ then was inclined to take the initiative. He had
18446: been to Tessa. She led the way through the nearest door, set down her
18447: lamp, and turned towards him again.
18448: 
18449: “You must not think despairingly of the consequences,” said Tito, in a
18450: tone of soothing encouragement, at which Romola stood wondering, until
18451: he added, “The accused have too many family ties with all parties not
18452: to escape; and Messer Bernardo del Nero has other things in his favour
18453: besides his age.”
18454: 
18455: Romola started, and gave a cry as if she had been suddenly stricken by
18456: a sharp weapon.
18457: 
18458: “What! you did not know it?” said Tito, putting his hand under her arm
18459: that he might lead her to a seat; but she seemed to be unaware of his
18460: touch.
18461: 
18462: “Tell me,” she said, hastily—“tell me what it is.”
18463: 
18464: “A man, whose name you may forget—Lamberto dell’ Antella—who was
18465: banished, has been seized within the territory: a letter has been found
18466: on him of very dangerous import to the chief Mediceans, and the
18467: scoundrel, who was once a favourite hound of Piero de’ Medici, is ready
18468: now to swear what any one pleases against him or his friends. Some have
18469: made their escape, but five are now in prison.”
18470: 
18471: “My godfather?” said Romola, scarcely above a whisper, as Tito made a
18472: slight pause.
18473: 
18474: “Yes: I grieve to say it. But along with him there are three, at least,
18475: whose names have a commanding interest even among the popular
18476: party—Niccolò Ridolfi, Lorenzo Tornabuoni, and Giannozzo Pucci.”
18477: 
18478: The tide of Romola’s feelings had been violently turned into a new
18479: channel. In the tumult of that moment there could be no check to the
18480: words which came as the impulsive utterance of her long-accumulating
18481: horror. When Tito had named the men of whom she felt certain he was the
18482: confederate, she said, with a recoiling gesture and low-toned
18483: bitterness—
18484: 
18485: “And _you_—you are safe?”
18486: 
18487: “You are certainly an amiable wife, my Romola,” said Tito, with the
18488: coldest irony. “Yes; I am safe.”
18489: 
18490: They turned away from each other in silence.
18491: 
18492: 
18493: 
18494: 
18495: CHAPTER LVII.
18496: Why Tito was Safe.
18497: 
18498: 
18499: Tito had good reasons for saying that he was safe. In the last three
18500: months, during which he had foreseen the discovery of the Medicean
18501: conspirators as a probable event, he had had plenty of time to provide
18502: himself with resources. He had been strengthening his influence at Rome
18503: and at Milan, by being the medium of secret information and indirect
18504: measures against the Frate and the popular party; he had cultivated
18505: more assiduously than ever the regard of this party, by showing subtle
18506: evidence that his political convictions were entirely on their side;
18507: and all the while, instead of withdrawing his agency from the
18508: Mediceans, he had sought to be more actively employed and exclusively
18509: trusted by them. It was easy to him to keep up this triple game. The
18510: principle of duplicity admitted by the Mediceans on their own behalf
18511: deprived them of any standard by which they could measure the
18512: trustworthiness of a colleague who had not, like themselves, hereditary
18513: interests, alliances, and prejudices, which were intensely Medicean. In
18514: their minds, to deceive the opposite party was fair stratagem; to
18515: deceive their own party was a baseness to which they felt no
18516: temptation; and, in using Tito’s facile ability, they were not keenly
18517: awake to the fact that the absence of traditional attachments which
18518: made him a convenient agent was also the absence of what among
18519: themselves was the chief guarantee of mutual honour. Again, the Roman
18520: and Milanese friends of the aristocratic party, or Arrabbiati, who were
18521: the bitterest enemies of Savonarola, carried on a system of underhand
18522: correspondence and espionage, in which the deepest hypocrisy was the
18523: best service, and demanded the heaviest pay; so that to suspect an
18524: agent because he played a part strongly would have been an absurd want
18525: of logic. On the other hand, the Piagnoni of the popular party, who had
18526: the directness that belongs to energetic conviction, were the more
18527: inclined to credit Tito with sincerity in his political adhesion to
18528: them, because he affected no religious sympathies.
18529: 
18530: By virtue of these conditions, the last three months had been a time of
18531: flattering success to Tito. The result he most cared for was the
18532: securing of a future position for himself at Rome or at Milan; for he
18533: had a growing determination, when the favourable moment should come, to
18534: quit Florence for one of those great capitals where life was easier,
18535: and the rewards of talent and learning were more splendid. At present,
18536: the scale dipped in favour of Milan; and if within the year he could
18537: render certain services to Duke Ludovico Sforza, he had the prospect of
18538: a place at the Milanese court which outweighed the advantages of Rome.
18539: 
18540: The revelation of the Medicean conspiracy, then, had been a subject of
18541: forethought to Tito; but he had not been able to foresee the mode in
18542: which it would be brought about. The arrest of Lamberto dell’ Antella
18543: with a tell-tale letter on his person, and a bitter rancour against the
18544: Medici in his heart, was an incalculable event. It was not possible, in
18545: spite of the careful pretexts with which his agency had been guarded,
18546: that Tito should escape implication: he had never expected this in case
18547: of any wide discovery concerning the Medicean plots. But his quick mind
18548: had soon traced out the course that would secure his own safety with
18549: the fewest unpleasant concomitants. It is agreeable to keep a whole
18550: skin; but the skin still remains an organ sensitive to the atmosphere.
18551: 
18552: His reckoning had not deceived him. That night, before he returned
18553: home, he had secured the three results for which he most cared: he was
18554: to be freed from all proceedings against him on account of complicity
18555: with the Mediceans; he was to retain his secretaryship for another
18556: year, unless he previously resigned it; and, lastly, the price by which
18557: he had obtained these guarantees was to be kept as a State secret. The
18558: price would have been thought heavy by most men; and Tito himself would
18559: rather not have paid it.
18560: 
18561: He had applied himself first to win the mind of Francesco Valori, who
18562: was not only one of the Ten under whom he immediately held his
18563: secretaryship, but one of the special council appointed to investigate
18564: the evidence of the plot. Francesco Valori, as we have seen, was the
18565: head of the Piagnoni, a man with certain fine qualities that were not
18566: incompatible with violent partisanship, with an arrogant temper that
18567: alienated his friends, nor with bitter personal animosities—one of the
18568: bitterest being directed against Bernardo del Nero. To him, in a brief
18569: private interview, after obtaining a pledge of secrecy, Tito avowed his
18570: own agency for the Mediceans—an agency induced by motives about which
18571: he was very frank, declaring at the same time that he had always
18572: believed their efforts futile, and that he sincerely preferred the
18573: maintenance of the popular government; affected to confide to Valori,
18574: as a secret, his own personal dislike for Bernardo del Nero; and, after
18575: this preparation, came to the important statement that there was
18576: another Medicean plot, of which, if he obtained certain conditions from
18577: the government, he could, by a journey to Siena and into Romagna, where
18578: Piero de’ Medici was again trying to gather forces, obtain documentary
18579: evidence to lay before the council. To this end it was essential that
18580: his character as a Medicean agent should be unshaken for all Mediceans,
18581: and hence the fact that he had been a source of information to the
18582: authorities must be wrapped in profound secrecy. Still, some odour of
18583: the facts might escape in spite of precaution, and before Tito could
18584: incur the unpleasant consequences of acting against his friends, he
18585: must be assured of immunity from any prosecution as a Medicean, and
18586: from deprivation of office for a year to come.
18587: 
18588: These propositions did not sound in the ear of Francesco Valori
18589: precisely as they sound to us. Valori’s mind was not intensely bent on
18590: the estimation of Tito’s conduct; and it _was_ intensely bent on
18591: procuring an extreme sentence against the five prisoners. There were
18592: sure to be immense efforts to save them; and it was to be wished (on
18593: public grounds) that the evidence against them should be of the
18594: strongest, so as to alarm all well-affected men at the dangers of
18595: clemency. The character of legal proceedings at that time implied that
18596: evidence was one of those desirable things which could only be come at
18597: by foul means. To catch a few people and torture them into confessing
18598: everybody’s guilt was one step towards justice; and it was not always
18599: easy to see the next, unless a traitor turned up. Lamberto dell’
18600: Antella had been tortured in aid of his previous willingness to tell
18601: more than he knew; nevertheless, additional and stronger facts were
18602: desirable, especially against Bernardo del Nero, who, so far as
18603: appeared hitherto, had simply refrained from betraying the late plot
18604: after having tried in vain to discourage it; for the welfare of
18605: Florence demanded that the guilt of Bernardo del Nero should be put in
18606: the strongest light. So Francesco Valori zealously believed; and
18607: perhaps he was not himself aware that the strength of his zeal was
18608: determined by his hatred. He decided that Tito’s proposition ought to
18609: be accepted, laid it before his colleagues without disclosing Tito’s
18610: name, and won them over to his opinion. Late in the day, Tito was
18611: admitted to an audience of the Special Council, and produced a deep
18612: sensation among them by revealing another plot for insuring the mastery
18613: of Florence to Piero de’ Medici, which was to have been carried into
18614: execution in the middle of this very month of August. Documentary
18615: evidence on this subject would do more than anything else to make the
18616: right course clear. He received a commission to start for Siena by
18617: break of day; and, besides this, he carried away with him from the
18618: council-chamber a written guarantee of his immunity and of his
18619: retention of office.
18620: 
18621: Among the twenty Florentines who bent their grave eyes on Tito, as he
18622: stood gracefully before them, speaking of startling things with easy
18623: periphrasis, and with that apparently unaffected admission of being
18624: actuated by motives short of the highest, which is often the intensest
18625: affectation, there were several whose minds were not too entirely
18626: preoccupied to pass a new judgment on him in these new circumstances;
18627: they silently concluded that this ingenious and serviceable Greek was
18628: in future rather to be used for public needs than for private intimacy.
18629: Unprincipled men were useful, enabling those who had more scruples to
18630: keep their hands tolerably clean in a world where there was much dirty
18631: work to be done. Indeed, it was not clear to respectable Florentine
18632: brains, unless they held the Frate’s extravagant belief in a possible
18633: purity and loftiness to be striven for on this earth, how life was to
18634: be carried on in any department without human instruments whom it would
18635: not be unbecoming to kick or to spit upon in the act of handing them
18636: their wages. Some of these very men who passed a tacit judgment on Tito
18637: were shortly to be engaged in a memorable transaction that could by no
18638: means have been carried through without the use of an unscrupulousness
18639: as decided as his; but, as their own bright poet Pulci had said for
18640: them, it is one thing to love the fruits of treachery, and another
18641: thing to love traitors—
18642: 
18643: 
18644: “Il tradimento a molti piace assai,
18645: Ma il traditore a gnun non piacque mal.”
18646: 
18647: 
18648: The same society has had a gibbet for the murderer and a gibbet for the
18649: martyr, an execrating hiss for a dastardly act, and as loud a hiss for
18650: many a word of generous truthfulness or just insight: a mixed condition
18651: of things which is the sign, not of hopeless confusion, but of
18652: struggling order.
18653: 
18654: For Tito himself, he was not unaware that he had sunk a little in the
18655: estimate of the men who had accepted his services. He had that degree
18656: of self-contemplation which necessarily accompanies the habit of acting
18657: on well-considered reasons, of whatever quality; and if he could have
18658: chosen, he would have declined to see himself disapproved by men of the
18659: world. He had never meant to be disapproved; he had meant always to
18660: conduct himself so ably that if he acted in opposition to the standard
18661: of other men they should not be aware of it; and the barrier between
18662: himself and Romola had been raised by the impossibility of such
18663: concealment with her. He shrank from condemnatory judgments as from a
18664: climate to which he could not adapt himself. But things were not so
18665: plastic in the hands of cleverness as could be wished, and events had
18666: turned out inconveniently. He had really no rancour against Messer
18667: Bernardo del Nero: he had a personal liking for Lorenzo Tornabuoni and
18668: Giannozzo Pucci. He had served them very ably, and in such a way that
18669: if their party had been winners he would have merited high reward; but
18670: was he to relinquish all the agreeable fruits of life because their
18671: party had failed? His proffer of a little additional proof against them
18672: would probably have no influence on their fate; in fact, he felt
18673: convinced they would escape any extreme consequences; but if he had not
18674: given it, his own fortunes, which made a promising fabric, would have
18675: been utterly ruined. And what motive could any man really have, except
18676: his own interest? Florentines whose passions were engaged in their
18677: petty and precarious political schemes might have no self-interest
18678: separable from family pride and tenacity in old hatreds and
18679: attachments; a modern simpleton who swallowed whole one of the old
18680: systems of philosophy, and took the indigestion it occasioned for the
18681: signs of a divine afflux or the voice of an inward monitor, might see
18682: his interest in a form of self-conceit which he called self-rewarding
18683: virtue; fanatics who believed in the coming Scourge and Renovation
18684: might see their own interest in a future palm-branch and white robe:
18685: but no man of clear intellect allowed his course to be determined by
18686: such puerile impulses or questionable inward fumes. Did not Pontanus,
18687: poet and philosopher of unrivalled Latinity, make the finest possible
18688: oration at Naples to welcome the French king, who had come to dethrone
18689: the learned orator’s royal friend and patron? and still Pontanus held
18690: up his head and prospered. Men did not really care about these things,
18691: except when their personal spleen was touched. It was weakness only
18692: that was despised; power of any sort carried its immunity; and no man,
18693: unless by very rare good fortune, could mount high in the world without
18694: incurring a few unpleasant necessities which laid him open to enmity,
18695: and perhaps to a little hissing, when enmity wanted a pretext.
18696: 
18697: It was a faint prognostic of that hissing, gathered by Tito from
18698: certain indications when he was before the council, which gave his
18699: present conduct the character of an epoch to him, and made him dwell on
18700: it with argumentative vindication. It was not that he was taking a
18701: deeper step in wrong-doing, for it was not possible that he should feel
18702: any tie to the Mediceans to be stronger than the tie to his father; but
18703: his conduct to his father had been hidden by successful lying: his
18704: present act did not admit of total concealment—in its very nature it
18705: was a revelation. And Tito winced under his new liability to disesteem.
18706: 
18707: Well! a little patience, and in another year, or perhaps in half a
18708: year, he might turn his back on these hard, eager Florentines, with
18709: their futile quarrels and sinking fortunes. His brilliant success at
18710: Florence had had some ugly flaws in it: he had fallen in love with the
18711: wrong woman, and Baldassarre had come back under incalculable
18712: circumstances. But as Tito galloped with a loose rein towards Siena, he
18713: saw a future before him in which he would no longer be haunted by those
18714: mistakes. He had much money safe out of Florence already; he was in the
18715: fresh ripeness of eight-and-twenty; he was conscious of well-tried
18716: skill. Could he not strip himself of the past, as of rehearsal
18717: clothing, and throw away the old bundle, to robe himself for the real
18718: scene?
18719: 
18720: It did not enter into Tito’s meditations on the future, that, on
18721: issuing from the council-chamber and descending the stairs, he had
18722: brushed against a man whose face he had not stayed to recognise in the
18723: lamplight. The man was Ser Ceccone—also willing to serve the State by
18724: giving information against unsuccessful employers.
18725: 
18726: 
18727: 
18728: 
18729: CHAPTER LVIII.
18730: A Final Understanding.
18731: 
18732: 
18733: Tito soon returned from Siena, but almost immediately set out on
18734: another journey, from which he did not return till the seventeenth of
18735: August. Nearly a fortnight had passed since the arrest of the accused,
18736: and still they were in prison, still their fate was uncertain. Romola
18737: had felt during this interval as if all cares were suspended for her,
18738: other than watching the fluctuating probabilities concerning that fate.
18739: Sometimes they seemed strongly in favour of the prisoners; for the
18740: chances of effective interest on their behalf were heightened by delay,
18741: and an indefinite prospect of delay was opened by the reluctance of all
18742: persons in authority to incur the odium attendant on any decision. On
18743: the one side there was a loud cry that the Republic was in danger, and
18744: that lenity to the prisoners would be the signal of attack for all its
18745: enemies; on the other, there was a certainty that a sentence of death
18746: and confiscation of property passed on five citizens of distinguished
18747: name, would entail the rancorous hatred of their relatives on all who
18748: were conspicuously instrumental to such a sentence.
18749: 
18750: The final judgment properly lay with the Eight, who presided over the
18751: administration of criminal justice; and the sentence depended on a
18752: majority of six votes. But the Eight shrank from their onerous
18753: responsibility, and asked in this exceptional case to have it shared by
18754: the Signoria (or the Gonfaloniere and the eight Priors). The Signoria
18755: in its turn shrugged its shoulders, and proposed the appeal to the
18756: Great Council. For, according to a law passed by the earnest persuasion
18757: of Savonarola nearly three years before, whenever a citizen was
18758: condemned to death by the fatal six votes (called the _set fave_ or
18759: _six beans_, beans being in more senses than one the political pulse of
18760: Florence), he had the right of appealing from that sentence to the
18761: Great Council.
18762: 
18763: But in this stage of the business, the friends of the accused resisted
18764: the appeal, determined chiefly by the wish to gain delay; and, in fact,
18765: strict legality required that sentence should have been passed prior to
18766: the appeal. Their resistance prevailed, and a middle course was taken;
18767: the sentence was referred to a large assembly convened on the
18768: seventeenth, consisting of all the higher magistracies, the smaller
18769: council or Senate of Eighty, and a select number of citizens.
18770: 
18771: On this day Romola, with anxiety heightened by the possibility that
18772: before its close her godfather’s fate might be decided, had obtained
18773: leave to see him for the second time, but only in the presence of
18774: witnesses. She had returned to the Via de’ Bardi in company with her
18775: cousin Brigida, still ignorant whether the council had come to any
18776: decisive issue; and Monna Brigida had gone out again to await the
18777: momentous news at the house of a friend belonging to one of the
18778: magistracies, that she might bring back authentic tidings as soon as
18779: they were to be had.
18780: 
18781: Romola had sunk on the first seat in the bright saloon, too much
18782: agitated, too sick at heart, to care about her place, or be conscious
18783: of discordance in the objects that surrounded her. She sat with her
18784: back to the door, resting her head on her hands. It seemed a long while
18785: since Monna Brigida had gone, and Romola was expecting her return. But
18786: when the door opened she knew it was not Monna Brigida who entered.
18787: 
18788: Since she had parted from Tito on that memorable night, she had had no
18789: external proof to warrant her belief that he had won his safety by
18790: treachery; on the contrary, she had had evidence that he was still
18791: trusted by the Mediceans, and was believed by them to be accomplishing
18792: certain errands of theirs in Romagna, under cover of fulfilling a
18793: commission of the government. For the obscurity in which the evidence
18794: concerning the conspirators was shrouded allowed it to be understood
18795: that Tito had escaped any implication.
18796: 
18797: But Romola’s suspicion was not to be dissipated: her horror of his
18798: conduct towards Baldassarre projected itself over every conception of
18799: his acts; it was as if she had seen him committing a murder, and had
18800: had a diseased impression ever after that his hands were covered with
18801: fresh blood.
18802: 
18803: As she heard his step on the stone floor, a chill shudder passed
18804: through her; she could not turn round, she could not rise to give any
18805: greeting. He did not speak, but after an instant’s pause took a seat on
18806: the other side of the table just opposite to her. Then she raised her
18807: eyes and looked at him; but she was mute. He did not show any
18808: irritation, but said, coolly—
18809: 
18810: “This meeting corresponds with our parting, Romola. But I understand
18811: that it is a moment of terrible suspense. I am come, however, if you
18812: will listen to me, to bring you the relief of hope.”
18813: 
18814: She started, and altered her position, but looked at him dubiously.
18815: 
18816: “It will not be unwelcome to you to hear—even though it is I who tell
18817: it—that the council is prorogued till the twenty-first. The Eight have
18818: been frightened at last into passing a sentence of condemnation, but
18819: the demand has now been made on behalf of the condemned for the Appeal
18820: to the Great Council.”
18821: 
18822: Romola’s face lost its dubious expression; she asked eagerly—
18823: 
18824: “And when is it to be made?”
18825: 
18826: “It has not yet been granted; but it _may_ be granted. The Special
18827: Council is to meet again on the twenty-first to deliberate whether the
18828: Appeal shall be allowed or not. In the meantime there is an interval of
18829: three days, in which chances may occur in favour of the prisoners—in
18830: which interest may be used on their behalf.”
18831: 
18832: Romola started from her seat. The colour had risen to her face like a
18833: visible thought, and her hands trembled. In that moment her feeling
18834: towards Tito was forgotten.
18835: 
18836: “Possibly,” said Tito, also rising, “your own intention may have
18837: anticipated what I was going to say. You are thinking of the Frate.”
18838: 
18839: “I am,” said Romola, looking at him with surprise. “Has he done
18840: anything? Is there anything to tell me?”
18841: 
18842: “Only this. It was Messer Francesco Valori’s bitterness and violence
18843: which chiefly determined the course of things in the council to-day.
18844: Half the men who gave in their opinion against the prisoners were
18845: frightened into it, and there are numerous friends of Fra Girolamo both
18846: in this Special Council and out of it who are strongly opposed to the
18847: sentence of death—Piero Guicciardini, for example, who is one member of
18848: the Signoria that made the stoutest resistance; and there is Giovan
18849: Battista Ridolfi, who, Piagnone as he is, will not lightly forgive the
18850: death of his brother Niccolò.”
18851: 
18852: “But how can the Appeal be denied,” said Romola, indignantly, “when it
18853: is the law—when it was one of the chief glories of the popular
18854: government to have passed the law?”
18855: 
18856: “They call this an exceptional case. Of course there are ingenious
18857: arguments, but there is much more of loud bluster about the danger of
18858: the Republic. But, you see, no opposition could prevent the assembly
18859: from being prorogued, and a certain powerful influence rightly applied
18860: during the next three days might determine the wavering courage of
18861: those who desire that the Appeal should be granted, and might even give
18862: a check to the headlong enmity of Francesco Valori. It happens to have
18863: come to my knowledge that the Frate has so far interfered as to send a
18864: message to him in favour of Lorenzo Tornabuoni. I know you can
18865: sometimes have access to the Frate: it might at all events be worth
18866: while to use your privilege now.”
18867: 
18868: “It is true,” said Romola, with an air of abstraction. “I cannot
18869: believe that the Frate would approve denying the Appeal.”
18870: 
18871: “I heard it said by more than one person in the court of the Palazzo,
18872: before I came away, that it would be to the everlasting discredit of
18873: Fra Girolamo if he allowed a government which is almost entirely made
18874: up of his party, to deny the Appeal, without entering his protest, when
18875: he has been boasting in his books and sermons that it was he who got
18876: the law passed.[1] But between ourselves, with all respect for your
18877: Frate’s ability, my Romola, he has got into the practice of preaching
18878: that form of human sacrifices called killing tyrants and wicked
18879: malcontents, which some of his followers are likely to think
18880: inconsistent with lenity in the present case.”
18881: 
18882:  [1] The most recent, and in some respects the best, biographer of
18883:  Savonarola, Signor Villari, endeavours to show that the Law of Appeal
18884:  ultimately enacted, being wider than the law originally contemplated
18885:  by Savonarola, was a source of bitter annoyance to him, as a
18886:  contrivance of the aristocratic party for attaching to the measures of
18887:  the popular government the injurious results of licence. But in taking
18888:  this view the estimable biographer lost sight of the fact that, not
18889:  only in his sermons, but in a deliberately prepared book (the
18890:  _Compendium Revelationum_) written long after the Appeal had become
18891:  law, Savonarola enumerates among the benefits secured to Florence,
18892:  “_the Appeal from the Six Votes, advocated by me, for the greater
18893:  security of the citizens_.”
18894: 
18895: 
18896: “I know, I know,” said Romola, with a look and tone of pain. “But he is
18897: driven into those excesses of speech. It used to be different. I _will_
18898: ask for an interview. I cannot rest without it. I trust in the
18899: greatness of his heart.”
18900: 
18901: She was not looking at Tito; her eyes were bent with a vague gaze
18902: towards the ground, and she had no distinct consciousness that the
18903: words she heard came from her husband.
18904: 
18905: “Better lose no time, then,” said Tito, with unmixed suavity, moving
18906: his cap round in his hands as if he were about to put it on and depart.
18907: “And now, Romola, you will perhaps be able to see, in spite of
18908: prejudice, that my wishes go with yours in this matter. You will not
18909: regard the misfortune of my safety as an offence.”
18910: 
18911: Something like an electric shock passed through Romola: it was the full
18912: consciousness of her husband’s presence returning to her. She looked at
18913: him without speaking.
18914: 
18915: “At least,” he added, in a slightly harder tone, “you will endeavour to
18916: base our intercourse on some other reasonings than that because an evil
18917: deed is possible, _I_ have done it. Am I alone to be beyond the pale of
18918: your extensive charity?”
18919: 
18920: The feeling which had been driven back from Romola’s lips a fortnight
18921: before rose again with the gathered force of a tidal wave. She spoke
18922: with a decision which told him that she was careless of consequences.
18923: 
18924: “It is too late, Tito. There is no killing the suspicion that deceit
18925: has once begotten. And now I know everything. I know who that old man
18926: was: he was your father, to whom you owe everything—to whom you owe
18927: more than if you had been his own child. By the side of that, it is a
18928: small thing that you broke my trust and my father’s. As long as you
18929: deny the truth about that old man, there is a horror rising between us:
18930: the law that should make us one can never be obeyed. I too am a human
18931: being. I have a soul of my own that abhors your actions. Our union is a
18932: pretence—as if a perpetual lie could be a sacred marriage.”
18933: 
18934: Tito did not answer immediately. When he did speak it was with a
18935: calculated caution, that was stimulated by alarm.
18936: 
18937: “And you mean to carry out that independence by quitting me, I
18938: presume?”
18939: 
18940: “I desire to quit you,” said Romola, impetuously.
18941: 
18942: “And supposing I do not submit to part with what the law gives me some
18943: security for retaining? You will then, of course, proclaim your reasons
18944: in the ear of all Florence. You will bring forward your mad assassin,
18945: who is doubtless ready to obey your call, and you will tell the world
18946: that you believe his testimony because he is so rational as to desire
18947: to assassinate me. You will first inform the Signoria that I am a
18948: Medicean conspirator, and then you will inform the Mediceans that I
18949: have betrayed them, and in both cases you will offer the excellent
18950: proof that you believe me capable in general of everything bad. It will
18951: certainly be a striking position for a wife to adopt. And if, on such
18952: evidence, you succeed in holding me up to infamy, you will have
18953: surpassed all the heroines of the Greek drama.”
18954: 
18955: He paused a moment, but she stood mute. He went on with the sense of
18956: mastery.
18957: 
18958: “I believe you have no other grievance against me—except that I have
18959: failed in fulfilling some lofty indefinite conditions on which you gave
18960: me your wifely affection, so that, by withdrawing it, you have
18961: gradually reduced me to the careful supply of your wants as a fair
18962: Piagnone of high condition and liberal charities. I think your success
18963: in gibbeting me is not certain. But doubtless you would begin by
18964: winning the ear of Messer Bernardo del Nero?”
18965: 
18966: “Why do I speak of anything?” cried Romola, in anguish, sinking on her
18967: chair again. “It is hateful in me to be thinking of myself.”
18968: 
18969: She did not notice when Tito left the room, or know how long it was
18970: before the door opened to admit Monna Brigida. But in that instant she
18971: started up and said—
18972: 
18973: “Cousin, we must go to San Marco directly. I must see my confessor, Fra
18974: Salvestro.”
18975: 
18976: 
18977: 
18978: 
18979: CHAPTER LIX.
18980: Pleading.
18981: 
18982: 
18983: The morning was in its early brightness when Romola was again on her
18984: way to San Marco, having obtained through Fra Salvestro, the evening
18985: before, the promise of an interview with Fra Girolamo in the
18986: chapter-house of the convent. The rigidity with which Savonarola
18987: guarded his life from all the pretexts of calumny made such interviews
18988: very rare, and whenever they were granted, they were kept free from any
18989: appearance of mystery. For this reason the hour chosen was one at which
18990: there were likely to be other visitors in the outer cloisters of San
18991: Marco.
18992: 
18993: She chose to pass through the heart of the city that she might notice
18994: the signs of public feeling. Every loggia, every convenient corner of
18995: the piazza, every shop that made a rendezvous for gossips, was astir
18996: with the excitement of gratuitous debate; a languishing trade tending
18997: to make political discussion all the more vigorous. It was clear that
18998: the parties for and against the death of the conspirators were bent on
18999: making the fullest use of the three days’ interval in order to
19000: determine the popular mood. Already handbills were in circulation; some
19001: presenting, in large print, the alternative of justice on the
19002: conspirators or ruin to the Republic; others in equally large print
19003: urging the observance of the law and the granting of the Appeal. Round
19004: these jutting islets of black capitals there were lakes of smaller
19005: characters setting forth arguments less necessary to be read: for it
19006: was an opinion entertained at that time (in the first flush of triumph
19007: at the discovery of printing), that there was no argument more widely
19008: convincing than question-begging phrases in large type.
19009: 
19010: Romola, however, cared especially to become acquainted with the
19011: arguments in smaller type, and, though obliged to hasten forward, she
19012: looked round anxiously as she went that she might miss no opportunity
19013: of securing copies. For a long way she saw none but such as were in the
19014: hands of eager readers, or else fixed on the walls, from which in some
19015: places the sbirri were tearing them down. But at last, passing behind
19016: San Giovanni with a quickened pace that she might avoid the many
19017: acquaintances who frequented the piazza, she saw Bratti with a stock of
19018: handbills which he appeared to be exchanging for small coin with the
19019: passers-by. She was too familiar with the humble life of Florence for
19020: Bratti to be any stranger to her, and turning towards him she said,
19021: “Have you two sorts of handbills, Bratti? Let me have them quickly.”
19022: 
19023: “Two sorts,” said Bratti, separating the wet sheets with a slowness
19024: that tried Romola’s patience. “There’s ‘Law,’ and there’s ‘Justice.’”
19025: 
19026: “Which sort do you sell most of?”
19027: 
19028: “‘Justice’—‘Justice’ goes the quickest,—so I raised the price, and made
19029: it two danari. But then I bethought me the ‘Law’ was good ware too, and
19030: had as good a right to be charged for as ‘Justice;’ for people set no
19031: store by cheap things, and if I sold the ‘Law’ at one danaro, I should
19032: be doing it a wrong. And I’m a fair trader. ‘Law,’ or ‘Justice,’ it’s
19033: all one to me; they’re good wares. I got ’em both for nothing, and I
19034: sell ’em at a fair profit. But you’ll want more than one of a sort?”
19035: 
19036: “No, no: here’s a white quattrino for the two,” said Romola, folding up
19037: the bills and hurrying away.
19038: 
19039: She was soon in the outer cloisters of San Marco, where Fra Salvestro
19040: was awaiting her under the cloister, but did not notice the approach of
19041: her light step. He was chatting, according to his habit, with lay
19042: visitors; for under the auspices of a government friendly to the Frate,
19043: the timidity about frequenting San Marco, which had followed on the
19044: first shock of the Excommunication, had been gradually giving way. In
19045: one of these lay visitors she recognised a well-known satellite of
19046: Francesco Valori, named Andrea Cambini, who was narrating or expounding
19047: with emphatic gesticulation, while Fra Salvestro was listening with
19048: that air of trivial curiosity which tells that the listener cares very
19049: much about news and very little about its quality. This characteristic
19050: of her confessor, which was always repulsive to Romola, was made
19051: exasperating to her at this moment by the certainty she gathered, from
19052: the disjointed words which reached her ear, that Cambini was narrating
19053: something relative to the fate of the conspirators. She chose not to
19054: approach the group, but as soon as she saw that she had arrested Fra
19055: Salvestro’s attention, she turned towards the door of the
19056: chapter-house, while he, making a sign of approval, disappeared within
19057: the inner cloister. A lay Brother stood ready to open the door of the
19058: chapter-house for her, and closed it behind her as she entered.
19059: 
19060: Once more looked at by those sad frescoed figures which had seemed to
19061: be mourning with her at the death of her brother Dino, it was
19062: inevitable that something of that scene should come back to her; but
19063: the intense occupation of her mind with the present made the
19064: remembrance less a retrospect than an indistinct recurrence of
19065: impressions which blended themselves with her agitating fears, as if
19066: her actual anxiety were a revival of the strong yearning she had once
19067: before brought to this spot—to be repelled by marble rigidity. She gave
19068: no space for the remembrance to become more definite, for she at once
19069: opened the handbills, thinking she should perhaps be able to read them
19070: in the interval before Fra Girolamo appeared. But by the time she had
19071: read to the end of the one that recommended the observance of the law,
19072: the door was opening, and doubling up the papers she stood expectant.
19073: 
19074: When the Frate had entered she knelt, according to the usual practice
19075: of those who saw him in private; but as soon as he had uttered a
19076: benedictory greeting she rose and stood opposite to him at a few yards’
19077: distance. Owing to his seclusion since he had been excommunicated, it
19078: had been an unusually long while since she had seen him, and the late
19079: months had visibly deepened in his face the marks of over-taxed mental
19080: activity and bodily severities; and yet Romola was not so conscious of
19081: this change as of another, which was less definable. Was it that the
19082: expression of serene elevation and pure human fellowship which had once
19083: moved her was no longer present in the same force, or was it that the
19084: sense of his being divided from her in her feeling about her godfather
19085: roused the slumbering sources of alienation, and marred her own vision?
19086: Perhaps both causes were at work. Our relations with our fellow-men are
19087: most often determined by coincident currents of that sort; the
19088: inexcusable word or deed seldom comes until after affection or
19089: reverence has been already enfeebled by the strain of repeated excuses.
19090: 
19091: It was true that Savonarola’s glance at Romola had some of that
19092: hardness which is caused by an egotistic prepossession. He divined that
19093: the interview she had sought was to turn on the fate of the
19094: conspirators, a subject on which he had already had to quell inner
19095: voices that might become loud again when encouraged from without.
19096: Seated in his cell, correcting the sheets of his ‘Triumph of the
19097: Cross,’ it was easier to repose on a resolution of neutrality.
19098: 
19099: “It is a question of moment, doubtless, on which you wished to see me,
19100: my daughter,” he began, in a tone which was gentle rather from
19101: self-control than from immediate inclination. “I know you are not wont
19102: to lay stress on small matters.”
19103: 
19104: “Father, you know what it is before I tell you,” said Romola,
19105: forgetting everything else as soon as she began to pour forth her plea.
19106: “You know what I am caring for—it is for the life of the old man I love
19107: best in the world. The thought of him has gone together with the
19108: thought of my father as long as I remember the daylight. That is my
19109: warrant for coming to you, even if my coming should have been needless.
19110: Perhaps it is: perhaps you have already determined that your power over
19111: the hearts of men shall be used to prevent them from denying to
19112: Florentines a right which you yourself helped to earn for them.”
19113: 
19114: “I meddle not with the functions of the State, my daughter,” said Fra
19115: Girolamo, strongly disinclined to reopen externally a debate which he
19116: had already gone through inwardly. “I have preached and laboured that
19117: Florence should have a good government, for a good government is
19118: needful to the perfecting of the Christian life; but I keep away my
19119: hands from particular affairs which it is the office of experienced
19120: citizens to administer.”
19121: 
19122: “Surely, father—” Romola broke off. She had uttered this first word
19123: almost impetuously, but she was checked by the counter-agitation of
19124: feeling herself in an attitude of remonstrance towards the man who had
19125: been the source of guidance and strength to her. In the act of
19126: rebelling she was bruising her own reverence.
19127: 
19128: Savonarola was too keen not to divine something of the conflict that
19129: was arresting her—too noble, deliberately to assume in calm speech that
19130: self-justifying evasiveness into which he was often hurried in public
19131: by the crowding impulses of the orator.
19132: 
19133: “Say what is in your heart; speak on, my daughter,” he said, standing
19134: with his arms laid one upon the other, and looking at her with quiet
19135: expectation.
19136: 
19137: “I was going to say, father, that this matter is surely of higher
19138: moment than many about which I have heard you preach and exhort
19139: fervidly. If it belonged to you to urge that men condemned for offences
19140: against the State should have the right to appeal to the Great
19141: Council—if—” Romola was getting eager again—“if you count it a glory to
19142: have won that right for them, can it less belong to you to declare
19143: yourself against the right being denied to almost the first men who
19144: need it? Surely that touches the Christian life more closely than
19145: whether you knew beforehand that the Dauphin would die, or whether Pisa
19146: will be conquered.”
19147: 
19148: There was a subtle movement, like a subdued sign of pain, in
19149: Savonarola’s strong lips, before he began to speak.
19150: 
19151: “My daughter, I speak as it is given me to speak—I am not master of the
19152: times when I may become the vehicle of knowledge beyond the common
19153: lights of men. In this case I have no illumination beyond what wisdom
19154: may give to those who are charged with the safety of the State. As to
19155: the law of Appeal against the Six Votes, I laboured to have it passed
19156: in order that no Florentine should be subject to loss of life and goods
19157: through the private hatred of a few who might happen to be in power;
19158: but these five men, who have desired to overthrow a free government and
19159: restore a corrupt tyrant, have been condemned with the assent of a
19160: large assembly of their fellow-citizens. They refused at first to have
19161: their cause brought before the Great Council. They have lost the right
19162: to the appeal.”
19163: 
19164: “How can they have lost it?” said Romola. “It is the right to appeal
19165: against condemnation, and they have never been condemned till now; and,
19166: forgive me, father, it _is_ private hatred that would deny them the
19167: appeal; it _is_ the violence of the few that frightens others; else why
19168: was the assembly divided again directly after it had seemed to agree?
19169: And if anything weighs against the observance of the law, let this
19170: weigh for it—this, that you used to preach more earnestly than all
19171: else, that there should be no place given to hatred and bloodshed
19172: because of these party strifes, so that private ill-will should not
19173: find its opportunities in public acts. Father, you know that there is
19174: private hatred concerned here: will it not dishonour you not to have
19175: interposed on the side of mercy, when there are many who hold that it
19176: is also the side of law and justice?”
19177: 
19178: “My daughter,” said Fra Girolamo, with more visible emotion than
19179: before, “there is a mercy which is weakness, and even treason against
19180: the common good. The safety of Florence, which means even more than the
19181: welfare of Florentines, now demands severity, as it once demanded
19182: mercy. It is not only for a past plot that these men are condemned, but
19183: also for a plot which has not yet been executed; and the devices that
19184: were leading to its execution are not put an end to: the tyrant is
19185: still gathering his forces in Romagna, and the enemies of Florence, who
19186: sit in the highest places of Italy, are ready to hurl any stone that
19187: will crush her.”
19188: 
19189: “What plot?” said Romola, reddening, and trembling with alarmed
19190: surprise.
19191: 
19192: “You carry papers in your hand, I see,” said Fra Girolamo, pointing to
19193: the handbills. “One of them will, perhaps, tell you that the government
19194: has had new information.”
19195: 
19196: Romola hastily opened the handbill she had not yet read, and saw that
19197: the government had now positive evidence of a second plot, which was to
19198: have been carried out in this August time. To her mind it was like
19199: reading a confirmation that Tito had won his safety by foul means; his
19200: pretence of wishing that the Frate should exert himself on behalf of
19201: the condemned only helped the wretched conviction. She crushed up the
19202: paper in her hand, and, turning to Savonarola, she said, with new
19203: passion, “Father, what safety can there be for Florence when the worst
19204: man can always escape? And,” she went on, a sudden flash of remembrance
19205: coming from the thought about her husband, “have not you yourself
19206: encouraged this deception which corrupts the life of Florence, by
19207: wanting more favour to be shown to Lorenzo Tornabuoni, who has worn two
19208: faces, and flattered you with a show of affection, when my godfather
19209: has always been honest? Ask all Florence who of those five men has the
19210: truest heart, and there will not be many who will name any other name
19211: than Bernardo del Nero. You did interpose with Francesco Valori for the
19212: sake of one prisoner: you have _not_ then been neutral; and you know
19213: that your word will be powerful.”
19214: 
19215: “I do not desire the death of Bernardo,” said Savonarola, colouring
19216: deeply. “It would be enough if he were sent out of the city.”
19217: 
19218: “Then why do you not speak to save an old man of seventy-five from
19219: dying a death of ignominy—to give him at least the fair chances of the
19220: law?” burst out Romola, the impetuosity of her nature so roused that
19221: she forgot everything but her indignation. “It is not that you feel
19222: bound to be neutral; else why did you speak for Lorenzo Tornabuoni? You
19223: spoke for him because he is more friendly to San Marco; my godfather
19224: feigns no friendship. It is not, then, as a Medicean that my godfather
19225: is to die; it is as a man you have no love for!”
19226: 
19227: When Romola paused, with cheeks glowing, and with quivering lips, there
19228: was dead silence. As she saw Fra Girolamo standing motionless before
19229: her, she seemed to herself to be hearing her own words over again;
19230: words that in this echo of consciousness were in strange, painful
19231: dissonance with the memories that made part of his presence to her. The
19232: moments of silence were expanded by gathering compunction and
19233: self-doubt. She had committed sacrilege in her passion. And even the
19234: sense that she could retract nothing of her plea, that her mind could
19235: not submit itself to Savonarola’s negative, made it the more needful to
19236: her to satisfy those reverential memories. With a sudden movement
19237: towards him she said—
19238: 
19239: “Forgive me, father; it is pain to me to have spoken those words—yet I
19240: cannot help speaking. I am little and feeble compared with you; you
19241: brought me light and strength. But I submitted because I felt the
19242: proffered strength—because I saw the light. _Now_ I cannot see it.
19243: Father, you yourself declare that there comes a moment when the soul
19244: must have no guide but the voice within it, to tell whether the
19245: consecrated thing has sacred virtue. And therefore I must speak.”
19246: 
19247: Savonarola had that readily-roused resentment towards opposition,
19248: hardly separable from a power-loving and powerful nature, accustomed to
19249: seek great ends that cast a reflected grandeur on the means by which
19250: they are sought. His sermons have much of that red flame in them. And
19251: if he had been a meaner man his susceptibility might have shown itself
19252: in irritation at Romola’s accusatory freedom, which was in strong
19253: contrast with the deference he habitually received from his disciples.
19254: But at this moment such feelings were nullified by that hard struggle
19255: which made half the tragedy of his life—the struggle of a mind
19256: possessed by a never-silent hunger after purity and simplicity, yet
19257: caught in a tangle of egoistic demands, false ideas, and difficult
19258: outward conditions, that made simplicity impossible. Keenly alive to
19259: all the suggestions of Romola’s remonstrating words, he was rapidly
19260: surveying, as he had done before, the courses of action that were open
19261: to him, and their probable results. But it was a question on which
19262: arguments could seem decisive only in proportion as they were charged
19263: with feeling, and he had received no impulse that could alter his bias.
19264: He looked at Romola, and said—
19265: 
19266: “You have full pardon for your frankness, my daughter. You speak, I
19267: know, out of the fulness of your family affections. But these
19268: affections must give way to the needs of the Republic. If those men who
19269: have a close acquaintance with the affairs of the State believe, as I
19270: understand they do, that the public safety requires the extreme
19271: punishment of the law to fall on the five conspirators, I cannot
19272: control their opinion, seeing that I stand aloof from such affairs.”
19273: 
19274: “Then you desire that they should die? You desire that the Appeal
19275: should be denied them?” said Romola, feeling anew repelled by a
19276: vindication which seemed to her to have the nature of a subterfuge.
19277: 
19278: “I have said that I do not desire their death.”
19279: 
19280: “Then,” said Romola, her indignation rising again, “you can be
19281: indifferent that Florentines should inflict death which you do not
19282: desire, when you might have protested against it—when you might have
19283: helped to hinder it, by urging the observance of a law which you held
19284: it good to get passed. Father, you used not to stand aloof: you used
19285: not to shrink from protesting. Do not say you cannot protest where the
19286: lives of men are concerned; say rather, you desire their death. Say
19287: rather, you hold it good for Florence that there shall be more blood
19288: and more hatred. Will the death of five Mediceans put an end to parties
19289: in Florence? Will the death of a noble old man like Bernardo del Nero
19290: save a city that holds such men as Dolfo Spini?”
19291: 
19292: “My daughter, it is enough. The cause of freedom, which is the cause of
19293: God’s kingdom upon earth, is often most injured by the enemies who
19294: carry within them the power of certain human virtues. The wickedest man
19295: is often not the most insurmountable obstacle to the triumph of good.”
19296: 
19297: “Then why do you say again, that you do not desire my godfather’s
19298: death?” said Romola, in mingled anger and despair. “Rather, you hold it
19299: the more needful he should die because he is the better man. I cannot
19300: unravel your thoughts, father; I cannot hear the real voice of your
19301: judgment and conscience.”
19302: 
19303: There was a moment’s pause. Then Savonarola said, with keener emotion
19304: than he had yet shown—
19305: 
19306: “Be thankful, my daughter, if your own soul has been spared perplexity;
19307: and judge not those to whom a harder lot has been given. _You_ see one
19308: ground of action in this matter. I see many. I have to choose that
19309: which will further the work intrusted to me. The end I seek is one to
19310: which minor respects must be sacrificed. The death of five men—were
19311: they less guilty than these—is a light matter weighed against the
19312: withstanding of the vicious tyrannies which stifle the life of Italy,
19313: and foster the corruption of the Church; a light matter weighed against
19314: the furthering of God’s kingdom upon earth, the end for which I live
19315: and am willing myself to die.”
19316: 
19317: Under any other circumstances, Romola would have been sensitive to the
19318: appeal at the beginning of Savonarola’s speech; but at this moment she
19319: was so utterly in antagonism with him, that what he called perplexity
19320: seemed to her sophistry and doubleness; and as he went on, his words
19321: only fed that flame of indignation, which now again, more fully than
19322: ever before, lit up the memory of all his mistakes, and made her trust
19323: in him seem to have been a purblind delusion. She spoke almost with
19324: bitterness.
19325: 
19326: “Do you, then, know so well what will further the coming of God’s
19327: kingdom, father, that you will dare to despise the plea of mercy—of
19328: justice—of faithfulness to your own teaching? Has the French king,
19329: then, brought renovation to Italy? Take care, father, lest your enemies
19330: have some reason when they say, that in your visions of what will
19331: further God’s kingdom you see only what will strengthen your own
19332: party.”
19333: 
19334: “And that is true!” said Savonarola, with flashing eyes. Romola’s voice
19335: had seemed to him in that moment the voice of his enemies. “The cause
19336: of my party _is_ the cause of God’s kingdom.”
19337: 
19338: “I do not believe it!” said Romola, her whole frame shaken with
19339: passionate repugnance. “God’s kingdom is something wider—else, let me
19340: stand outside it with the beings that I love.”
19341: 
19342: The two faces were lit up, each with an opposite emotion, each with an
19343: opposite certitude. Further words were impossible. Romola hastily
19344: covered her head and went out in silence.
19345: 
19346: 
19347: 
19348: 
19349: CHAPTER LX.
19350: The Scaffold.
19351: 
19352: 
19353: Three days later the moon that was just surmounting the buildings of
19354: the piazza in front of the Old Palace within the hour of midnight, did
19355: not make the usual broad lights and shadows on the pavement. Not a
19356: hand’s-breadth of pavement was to be seen, but only the heads of an
19357: eager struggling multitude. And instead of that background of silence
19358: in which the pattering footsteps and buzzing voices, the lute-thrumming
19359: or rapid scampering of the many night wanderers of Florence stood out
19360: in obtrusive distinctness, there was the background of a roar from
19361: mingled shouts and imprecations, tramplings and pushings, and
19362: accidental clashing of weapons, across which nothing was
19363: distinguishable but a darting shriek, or the heavy dropping toll of a
19364: bell.
19365: 
19366: Almost all who could call themselves the public of Florence were awake
19367: at that hour, and either enclosed within the limits of that piazza, or
19368: struggling to enter it. Within the palace were still assembled in the
19369: council-chamber all the chief magistracies, the eighty members of the
19370: senate, and the other select citizens who had been in hot debate
19371: through long hours of daylight and torchlight whether the Appeal should
19372: be granted or whether the sentence of death should be executed on the
19373: prisoners forthwith, to forestall the dangerous chances of delay. And
19374: the debate had been so much like fierce quarrel that the noise from the
19375: council-chamber had reached the crowd outside. Only within the last
19376: hour had the question been decided: the Signoria had remained divided,
19377: four of them standing out resolutely for the Appeal in spite of the
19378: strong argument that if they did not give way their houses should be
19379: sacked, until Francesco Valori, in brief and furious speech, made the
19380: determination of his party more ominously distinct by declaring that if
19381: the Signoria would not defend the liberties of the Florentine people by
19382: executing those five perfidious citizens, there would not be wanting
19383: others who would take that cause in hand to the peril of all who
19384: opposed it. The Florentine Cato triumphed. When the votes were counted
19385: again, the four obstinate white beans no longer appeared; the whole
19386: nine were of the fatal affirmative black, deciding the death of the
19387: five prisoners without delay—deciding also, only tacitly and with much
19388: more delay, the death of Francesco Valori.
19389: 
19390: And now, while the judicial Eight were gone to the Bargello to prepare
19391: for the execution, the five condemned men were being led barefoot and
19392: in irons through the midst of the council. It was their friends who had
19393: contrived this: would not Florentines be moved by the visible
19394: association of such cruel ignominy with two venerable men like Bernardo
19395: del Nero and Niccolò Ridolfi, who had taken their bias long before the
19396: new order of things had come to make Mediceanism retrograde—with two
19397: brilliant popular young men like Tornabuoni and Pucci, whose absence
19398: would be felt as a haunting vacancy wherever there was a meeting of
19399: chief Florentines? It was useless: such pity as could be awakened now
19400: was of that hopeless sort which leads not to rescue, but to the tardier
19401: action of revenge.
19402: 
19403: While this scene was passing upstairs Romola stood below against one of
19404: the massive pillars in the court of the palace, expecting the moment
19405: when her godfather would appear, on his way to execution. By the use of
19406: strong interest she had gained permission to visit him in the evening
19407: of this day, and remain with him until the result of the council should
19408: be determined. And now she was waiting with his confessor to follow the
19409: guard that would lead him to the Bargello. Her heart was bent on
19410: clinging to the presence of the childless old man to the last moment,
19411: as her father would have done; and she had overpowered all
19412: remonstrances. Giovan Battista Ridolfi, a disciple of Savonarola, who
19413: was going in bitterness to behold the death of his elder brother
19414: Niccolò, had promised that she should be guarded, and now stood by her
19415: side.
19416: 
19417: Tito, too, was in the palace; but Romola had not seen him. Since the
19418: evening of the seventeenth they had avoided each other, and Tito only
19419: knew by inference from the report of the Frate’s neutrality that her
19420: pleading had failed. He was now surrounded with official and other
19421: personages, both Florentine and foreign, who had been awaiting the
19422: issue of the long-protracted council, maintaining, except when he was
19423: directly addressed, the subdued air and grave silence of a man whom
19424: actual events are placing in a painful state of strife between public
19425: and private feeling. When an allusion was made to his wife in relation
19426: to those events, he implied that, owing to the violent excitement of
19427: her mind, the mere fact of his continuing to hold office under a
19428: government concerned in her godfather’s condemnation, roused in her a
19429: diseased hostility towards him; so that for her sake he felt it best
19430: not to approach her.
19431: 
19432: “Ah, the old Bardi blood!” said Cennini, with a shrug. “I shall not be
19433: surprised if this business shakes _her_ loose from the Frate, as well
19434: as some others I could name.”
19435: 
19436: “It is excusable in a woman, who is doubtless beautiful, since she is
19437: the wife of Messer Tito,” said a young French envoy, smiling and bowing
19438: to Tito, “to think that her affections must overrule the good of the
19439: State, and that nobody is to be beheaded who is anybody’s cousin; but
19440: such a view is not to be encouraged in the male population. It seems to
19441: me your Florentine polity is much weakened by it.”
19442: 
19443: “That is true,” said Niccolò Macchiavelli; “but where personal ties are
19444: strong, the hostilities they raise must be taken due account of. Many
19445: of these half-way severities are mere hot-headed blundering. The only
19446: safe blows to be inflicted on men and parties are the blows that are
19447: too heavy to be avenged.”
19448: 
19449: “Niccolò,” said Cennini, “there is a clever wickedness in thy talk
19450: sometimes that makes me mistrust thy pleasant young face as if it were
19451: a mask of Satan.”
19452: 
19453: “Not at all, my good Domenico,” said Macchiavelli, smiling, and laying
19454: his hand on the elder’s shoulder. “Satan was a blunderer, an introducer
19455: of _novita_, who made a stupendous failure. If he had succeeded, we
19456: should all have been worshipping him, and his portrait would have been
19457: more flattered.”
19458: 
19459: “Well, well,” said Cennini, “I say not thy doctrine is not too clever
19460: for Satan: I only say it is wicked enough for him.”
19461: 
19462: “I tell you,” said Macchiavelli, “my doctrine is the doctrine of all
19463: men who seek an end a little farther off than their own noses. Ask our
19464: Frate, our prophet, how his universal renovation is to be brought
19465: about: he will tell you, first, by getting a free and pure government;
19466: and since it appears that this cannot be done by making all Florentines
19467: love each other, it must be done by cutting off every head that happens
19468: to be obstinately in the way. Only if a man incurs odium by sanctioning
19469: a severity that is not thorough enough to be final, he commits a
19470: blunder. And something like that blunder, I suspect, the Frate has
19471: committed. It was an occasion on which he might have won some lustre by
19472: exerting himself to maintain the Appeal; instead of that, he has lost
19473: lustre, and has gained no strength.”
19474: 
19475: Before any one else could speak, there came the expected announcement
19476: that the prisoners were about to leave the council-chamber; and the
19477: majority of those who were present hurried towards the door, intent on
19478: securing the freest passage to the Bargello in the rear of the
19479: prisoners’ guard; for the scene of the execution was one that drew
19480: alike those who were moved by the deepest passions and those who were
19481: moved by the coldest curiosity.
19482: 
19483: Tito was one of those who remained behind. He had a native repugnance
19484: to sights of death and pain, and five days ago whenever he had thought
19485: of this execution as a possibility he had hoped that it would not take
19486: place, and that the utmost sentence would be exile: his own safety
19487: demanded no more. But now he felt that it would be a welcome guarantee
19488: of his security when he had learned that Bernardo del Nero’s head was
19489: off the shoulders. The new knowledge and new attitude towards him
19490: disclosed by Romola on the day of his return, had given him a new dread
19491: of the power she possessed to make his position insecure. If any act of
19492: hers only succeeded in making him an object of suspicion and odium, he
19493: foresaw not only frustration, but frustration under unpleasant
19494: circumstances. Her belief in Baldassarre had clearly determined her
19495: wavering feelings against further submission, and if her godfather
19496: lived she would win him to share her belief without much trouble.
19497: Romola seemed more than ever an unmanageable fact in his destiny. But
19498: if Bernardo del Nero were dead, the difficulties that would beset her
19499: in placing herself in opposition to her husband would probably be
19500: insurmountable to her shrinking pride. Therefore Tito had felt easier
19501: when he knew that the Eight had gone to the Bargello to order the
19502: instant erection of the scaffold. Four other men—his intimates and
19503: confederates—were to die, besides Bernardo del Nero. But a man’s own
19504: safety is a god that sometimes makes very grim demands. Tito felt them
19505: to be grim: even in the pursuit of what was agreeable, this paradoxical
19506: life forced upon him the desire for what was disagreeable. But he had
19507: had other experience of this sort, and as he heard through the open
19508: doorway the shuffle of many feet and the clanking of metal on the
19509: stairs, he was able to answer the questions of the young French envoy
19510: without showing signs of any other feeling than that of sad resignation
19511: to State necessities.
19512: 
19513: Those sounds fell on Romola as if her power of hearing had been exalted
19514: along with every other sensibility of her nature. She needed no arm to
19515: support her; she shed no tears. She felt that intensity of life which
19516: seems to transcend both grief and joy—in which the mind seems to itself
19517: akin to elder forces that wrought out existence before the birth of
19518: pleasure and pain. Since her godfather’s fate had been decided, the
19519: previous struggle of feeling in her had given way to an identification
19520: of herself with him in these supreme moments: she was inwardly
19521: asserting for him that, if he suffered the punishment of treason, he
19522: did not deserve the name of traitor; he was the victim to a collision
19523: between two kinds of faithfulness. It was not given him to die for the
19524: noblest cause, and yet he died because of his nobleness. He might have
19525: been a meaner man and found it easier not to incur this guilt. Romola
19526: was feeling the full force of that sympathy with the individual lot
19527: that is continually opposing itself to the formulae by which actions
19528: and parties are judged. She was treading the way with her second father
19529: to the scaffold, and nerving herself to defy ignominy by the
19530: consciousness that it was not deserved.
19531: 
19532: The way was fenced in by three hundred armed men, who had been placed
19533: as a guard by the orders of Francesco Valori, for among the apparent
19534: contradictions that belonged to this event, not the least striking was
19535: the alleged alarm on the one hand at the popular rage against the
19536: conspirators, and the alleged alarm on the other lest there should be
19537: an attempt to rescue them in the midst of a hostile crowd. When they
19538: had arrived within the court of the Bargello, Romola was allowed to
19539: approach Bernardo with his confessor for a moment of farewell. Many
19540: eyes were bent on them even in that struggle of an agitated throng, as
19541: the aged man, forgetting that his hands were bound with irons, lifted
19542: them towards the golden head that was bent towards him, and then,
19543: checking that movement, leaned to kiss her. She seized the fettered
19544: hands that were hung down again, and kissed them as if they had been
19545: sacred things.
19546: 
19547: “My poor Romola,” said Bernardo, in a low voice, “I have only to die,
19548: but thou hast to live—and I shall not be there to help thee.”
19549: 
19550: “Yes,” said Romola, hurriedly, “you _will_ help me—always—because I
19551: shall remember you.”
19552: 
19553: She was taken away and conducted up the flight of steps that led to the
19554: loggia surrounding the grand old court. She took her place there,
19555: determined to look till the moment when her godfather laid his head on
19556: the block. Now while the prisoners were allowed a brief interval with
19557: their confessor, the spectators were pressing into court until the
19558: crowd became dense around the black scaffold, and the torches fixed in
19559: iron rings against the pillars threw a varying startling light at one
19560: moment on passionless stone carvings, at another on some pale face
19561: agitated with suppressed rage or suppressed grief—the face of one among
19562: the many near relatives of the condemned, who were presently to receive
19563: their dead and carry them home.
19564: 
19565: Romola’s face looked like a marble image against the dark arch as she
19566: stood watching for the moment when her godfather would appear at the
19567: foot of the scaffold. He was to suffer first, and Battista Ridolfi, who
19568: was by her side, had promised to take her away through a door behind
19569: them when she would have seen the last look of the man who alone in all
19570: the world had shared her pitying love for her father. And still, in the
19571: background of her thought, there was the possibility striving to be a
19572: hope, that some rescue might yet come, something that would keep that
19573: scaffold unstained by blood.
19574: 
19575: For a long while there was constant movement, lights flickering, heads
19576: swaying to and fro, confused voices within the court, rushing waves of
19577: sound through the entrance from without. It seemed to Romola as if she
19578: were in the midst of a storm-troubled sea, caring nothing about the
19579: storm, caring only to hold out a signal till the eyes that looked for
19580: it could seek it no more.
19581: 
19582: Suddenly there was stillness, and the very tapers seemed to tremble
19583: into quiet. The executioner was ready on the scaffold, and Bernardo del
19584: Nero was seen ascending it with a slow firm step. Romola made no
19585: visible movement, uttered not even a suppressed sound: she stood more
19586: firmly, caring for _his_ firmness. She saw him pause, saw the white
19587: head kept erect, while he said, in a voice distinctly audible—
19588: 
19589: “It is but a short space of life that my fellow-citizens have taken
19590: from me.”
19591: 
19592: She perceived that he was gazing slowly round him as he spoke. She felt
19593: that his eyes were resting on her, and that she was stretching out her
19594: arms towards him. Then she saw no more till—a long while after, as it
19595: seemed—a voice said, “My daughter, all is peace now. I can conduct you
19596: to your house.”
19597: 
19598: She uncovered her head and saw her godfather’s confessor standing by
19599: her, in a room where there were other grave men talking in subdued
19600: tones.
19601: 
19602: “I am ready,” she said, starting up. “Let us lose no time.”
19603: 
19604: She thought all clinging was at an end for her: all her strength now
19605: should be given to escape from a grasp under which she shuddered.
19606: 
19607: 
19608: 
19609: 
19610: CHAPTER LXI.
19611: Drifting Away.
19612: 
19613: 
19614: On the eighth day from that memorable night Romola was standing on the
19615: brink of the Mediterranean, watching the gentle summer pulse of the sea
19616: just above what was then the little fishing village of Viareggio.
19617: 
19618: Again she had fled from Florence, and this time no arresting voice had
19619: called her back. Again she wore the grey religious dress; and this
19620: time, in her heart-sickness, she did not care that it was a disguise. A
19621: new rebellion had risen within her, a new despair. Why should she care
19622: about wearing one badge more than another, or about being called by her
19623: own name? She despaired of finding any consistent duty belonging to
19624: that name. What force was there to create for her that supremely
19625: hallowed motive which men call duty, but which can have no inward
19626: constraining existence save through some form of believing love?
19627: 
19628: The bonds of all strong affection were snapped. In her marriage, the
19629: highest bond of all, she had ceased to see the mystic union which is
19630: its own guarantee of indissolubleness, had ceased even to see the
19631: obligation of a voluntary pledge: had she not proved that the things to
19632: which she had pledged herself were impossible? The impulse to set
19633: herself free had risen again with overmastering force; yet the freedom
19634: could only be an exchange of calamity. There is no compensation for the
19635: woman who feels that the chief relation of her life has been no more
19636: than a mistake. She has lost her crown. The deepest secret of human
19637: blessedness has half whispered itself to her, and then for ever passed
19638: her by.
19639: 
19640: And now Romola’s best support under that supreme woman’s sorrow had
19641: slipped away from her. The vision of any great purpose, any end of
19642: existence which could ennoble endurance and exalt the common deeds of a
19643: dusty life with divine ardours, was utterly eclipsed for her now by the
19644: sense of a confusion in human things which made all effort a mere
19645: dragging at tangled threads; all fellowship, either for resistance or
19646: advocacy, mere unfairness and exclusiveness. What, after all, was the
19647: man who had represented for her the highest heroism: the heroism not of
19648: hard, self-contained endurance, but of willing, self-offering love?
19649: What was the cause he was struggling for? Romola had lost her trust in
19650: Savonarola, had lost that fervour of admiration which had made her
19651: unmindful of his aberrations, and attentive only to the grand curve of
19652: his orbit. And now that her keen feeling for her godfather had thrown
19653: her into antagonism with the Frate, she saw all the repulsive and
19654: inconsistent details in his teaching with a painful lucidity which
19655: exaggerated their proportions. In the bitterness of her disappointment
19656: she said that his striving after the renovation of the Church and the
19657: world was a striving after a mere name which told no more than the
19658: title of a book: a name that had come to mean practically the measures
19659: that would strengthen his own position in Florence; nay, often
19660: questionable deeds and words, for the sake of saving his influence from
19661: suffering by his own errors. And that political reform which had once
19662: made a new interest in her life seemed now to reduce itself to narrow
19663: devices for the safety of Florence, in contemptible contradiction with
19664: the alternating professions of blind trust in the Divine care.
19665: 
19666: It was inevitable that she should judge the Frate unfairly on a
19667: question of individual suffering, at which she looked with the eyes of
19668: personal tenderness, and _he_ with the eyes of theoretic conviction. In
19669: that declaration of his, that the cause of his party was the cause of
19670: God’s kingdom, she heard only the ring of egoism. Perhaps such words
19671: have rarely been uttered without that meaner ring in them; yet they are
19672: the implicit formula of all energetic belief. And if such energetic
19673: belief, pursuing a grand and remote end, is often in danger of becoming
19674: a demon-worship, in which the votary lets his son and daughter pass
19675: through the fire with a readiness that hardly looks like sacrifice;
19676: tender fellow-feeling for the nearest has its danger too, and is apt to
19677: be timid and sceptical towards the larger aims without which life
19678: cannot rise into religion. In this way poor Romola was being blinded by
19679: her tears.
19680: 
19681: No one who has ever known what it is thus to lose faith in a fellow-man
19682: whom he has profoundly loved and reverenced, will lightly say that the
19683: shock can leave the faith in the Invisible Goodness unshaken. With the
19684: sinking of high human trust, the dignity of life sinks too; we cease to
19685: believe in our own better self, since that also is part of the common
19686: nature which is degraded in our thought; and all the finer impulses of
19687: the soul are dulled. Romola felt even the springs of her once active
19688: pity drying up, and leaving her to barren egoistic complaining. Had not
19689: _she_ had her sorrows too? And few had cared for her, while she had
19690: cared for many. She had done enough; she had striven after the
19691: impossible, and was weary of this stifling crowded life. She longed for
19692: that repose in mere sensation which she had sometimes dreamed of in the
19693: sultry afternoons of her early girlhood, when she had fancied herself
19694: floating naïad-like in the waters.
19695: 
19696: The clear waves seemed to invite her: she wished she could lie down to
19697: sleep on them and pass from sleep into death. But Romola could not
19698: directly seek death; the fulness of young life in her forbade that. She
19699: could only wish that death would come.
19700: 
19701: At the spot where she had paused there was a deep bend in the shore,
19702: and a small boat with a sail was moored there. In her longing to glide
19703: over the waters that were getting golden with the level sun-rays, she
19704: thought of a story which had been one of the things she had loved to
19705: dwell on in Boccaccio, when her father fell asleep and she glided from
19706: her stool to sit on the floor and read the ‘Decamerone.’ It was the
19707: story of that fair Gostanza who in her lovelorn-ness desired to live no
19708: longer, but not having the courage to attack her young life, had put
19709: herself into a boat and pushed off to sea; then, lying down in the
19710: boat, had wrapt her mantle round her head, hoping to be wrecked, so
19711: that her fear would be helpless to flee from death. The memory had
19712: remained a mere thought in Romola’s mind, without budding into any
19713: distinct wish; but now, as she paused again in her walking to and fro,
19714: she saw gliding black against the red gold another boat with one man in
19715: it, making towards the bend where the first and smaller boat was
19716: moored. Walking on again, she at length saw the man land, pull his boat
19717: ashore and begin to unload something from it. He was perhaps the owner
19718: of the smaller boat also: he would be going away soon, and her
19719: opportunity would be gone with him—her opportunity of buying that
19720: smaller boat. She had not yet admitted to herself that she meant to use
19721: it, but she felt a sudden eagerness to secure the possibility of using
19722: it, which disclosed the half-unconscious growth of a thought into a
19723: desire.
19724: 
19725: “Is that little boat yours also?” she said to the fisherman, who had
19726: looked up, a little startled by the tall grey figure, and had made a
19727: reverence to this holy Sister wandering thus mysteriously in the
19728: evening solitude.
19729: 
19730: It _was_ his boat; an old one, hardly seaworthy, yet worth repairing to
19731: any man who would buy it. By the blessing of San Antonio, whose chapel
19732: was in the village yonder, his fishing had prospered, and he had now a
19733: better boat, which had once been Gianni’s who died. But he had not yet
19734: sold the old one. Romola asked him how much it was worth, and then,
19735: while he was busy, thrust the price into a little satchel lying on the
19736: ground and containing the remnant of his dinner. After that, she
19737: watched him furling his sail and asked him how he should set it if he
19738: wanted to go out to sea, and then pacing up and down again, waited to
19739: see him depart.
19740: 
19741: The imagination of herself gliding away in that boat on the darkening
19742: waters was growing more and more into a longing, as the thought of a
19743: cool brook in sultriness becomes a painful thirst. To be freed from the
19744: burden of choice when all motive was bruised, to commit herself,
19745: sleeping, to destiny which would either bring death or else new
19746: necessities that might rouse a new life in her!—it was a thought that
19747: beckoned her the more because the soft evening air made her long to
19748: rest in the still solitude, instead of going back to the noise and heat
19749: of the village.
19750: 
19751: At last the slow fisherman had gathered up all his movables and was
19752: walking away. Soon the gold was shrinking and getting duskier in sea
19753: and sky, and there was no living thing in sight, no sound but the
19754: lulling monotony of the lapping waves. In this sea there was no tide
19755: that would help to carry her away if she waited for its ebb; but Romola
19756: thought the breeze from the land was rising a little. She got into the
19757: boat, unfurled the sail, and fastened it as she had learned in that
19758: first brief lesson. She saw that it caught the light breeze, and this
19759: was all she cared for. Then she loosed the boat from its moorings, and
19760: tried to urge it with an oar, till she was far out from the land, till
19761: the sea was dark even to the west, and the stars were disclosing
19762: themselves like a palpitating life over the wide heavens. Resting at
19763: last, she threw back her cowl, and, taking off the kerchief underneath,
19764: which confined her hair, she doubled them both under her head for a
19765: pillow on one of the boat’s ribs. The fair head was still very young
19766: and could bear a hard pillow.
19767: 
19768: And so she lay, with the soft night air breathing on her while she
19769: glided on the water and watched the deepening quiet of the sky. She was
19770: alone now: she had freed herself from all claims, she had freed herself
19771: even from that burden of choice which presses with heavier and heavier
19772: weight when claims have loosed their guiding hold.
19773: 
19774: Had she found anything like the dream of her girlhood? No. Memories
19775: hung upon her like the weight of broken wings that could never be
19776: lifted—memories of human sympathy which even in its pains leaves a
19777: thirst that the Great Mother has no milk to still. Romola felt orphaned
19778: in those wide spaces of sea and sky. She read no message of love for
19779: her in that far-off symbolic writing of the heavens, and with a great
19780: sob she wished that she might be gliding into death.
19781: 
19782: She drew the cowl over her head again and covered her face, choosing
19783: darkness rather than the light of the stars, which seemed to her like
19784: the hard light of eyes that looked at her without seeing her. Presently
19785: she felt that she was in the grave, but not resting there: she was
19786: touching the hands of the beloved dead beside her, and trying to wake
19787: them.
19788: 
19789: 
19790: 
19791: 
19792: CHAPTER LXII.
19793: The Benediction.
19794: 
19795: 
19796: About ten o’clock on the morning of the twenty-seventh of February the
19797: currents of passengers along the Florentine streets set decidedly
19798: towards San Marco. It was the last morning of the Carnival, and every
19799: one knew there was a second Bonfire of Vanities being prepared in front
19800: of the Old Palace; but at this hour it was evident that the centre of
19801: popular interest lay elsewhere.
19802: 
19803: The Piazza di San Marco was filled by a multitude who showed no other
19804: movement than that which proceeded from the pressure of new-comers
19805: trying to force their way forward from all the openings: but the front
19806: ranks were already close-serried and resisted the pressure. Those ranks
19807: were ranged around a semicircular barrier in front of the church, and
19808: within this barrier were already assembling the Dominican Brethren of
19809: San Marco.
19810: 
19811: But the temporary wooden pulpit erected over the church-door was still
19812: empty. It was presently to be entered by the man whom the Pope’s
19813: command had banished from the pulpit of the Duomo, whom the other
19814: ecclesiastics of Florence had been forbidden to consort with, whom the
19815: citizens had been forbidden to hear on pain of excommunication. This
19816: man had said, “A wicked, unbelieving Pope who has gained the pontifical
19817: chair by bribery is not Christ’s Vicar. His curses are broken swords:
19818: he grasps a hilt without a blade. His commands are contrary to the
19819: Christian life: it is lawful to disobey them—nay, _it is not lawful to
19820: obey them_.” And the people still flocked to hear him as he preached in
19821: his own church of San Marco, though the Pope was hanging terrible
19822: threats over Florence if it did not renounce the pestilential
19823: schismatic and send him to Rome to be “converted”—still, as on this
19824: very morning, accepted the Communion from his excommunicated hands. For
19825: how if this Frate had really more command over the Divine lightnings
19826: than that official successor of Saint Peter? It was a momentous
19827: question, which for the mass of citizens could never be decided by the
19828: Frate’s ultimate test, namely, what was and what was not accordant with
19829: the highest spiritual law. No: in such a case as this, if God had
19830: chosen the Frate as his prophet to rebuke the High Priest who carried
19831: the mystic raiment unworthily, he would attest his choice by some
19832: unmistakable sign. As long as the belief in the Prophet carried no
19833: threat of outward calamity, but rather the confident hope of
19834: exceptional safety, no sign was needed: his preaching was a music to
19835: which the people felt themselves marching along the way they wished to
19836: go; but now that belief meant an immediate blow to their commerce, the
19837: shaking of their position among the Italian States, and an interdict on
19838: their city, there inevitably came the question, “What miracle showest
19839: thou?” Slowly at first, then faster and faster, that fatal demand had
19840: been swelling in Savonarola’s ear, provoking a response, outwardly in
19841: the declaration that at the fitting time the miracle would come;
19842: inwardly in the faith—not unwavering, for what faith is so?—that if the
19843: need for miracle became urgent, the work he had before him was too
19844: great for the Divine power to leave it halting. His faith wavered, but
19845: not his speech: it is the lot of every man who has to speak for the
19846: satisfaction of the crowd, that he must often speak in virtue of
19847: yesterday’s faith, hoping it will come back to-morrow.
19848: 
19849: It was in preparation for a scene which was really a response to the
19850: popular impatience for some supernatural guarantee of the Prophet’s
19851: mission, that the wooden pulpit had been erected above the church-door.
19852: But while the ordinary Frati in black mantles were entering and
19853: arranging themselves, the faces of the multitude were not yet eagerly
19854: directed towards the pulpit: it was felt that Savonarola would not
19855: appear just yet, and there was some interest in singling out the
19856: various monks, some of them belonging to high Florentine families, many
19857: of them having fathers, brothers, or cousins among the artisans and
19858: shopkeepers who made the majority of the crowd. It was not till the
19859: tale of monks was complete, not till they had fluttered their books and
19860: had begun to chant, that people said to each other, “Fra Girolamo must
19861: be coming now.”
19862: 
19863: That expectation rather than any spell from the accustomed wail of
19864: psalmody was what made silence and expectation seem to spread like a
19865: paling solemn light over the multitude of upturned faces, all now
19866: directed towards the empty pulpit.
19867: 
19868: The next instant the pulpit was no longer empty. A figure covered from
19869: head to foot in black cowl and mantle had entered it, and was kneeling
19870: with bent head and with face turned away. It seemed a weary time to the
19871: eager people while the black figure knelt and the monks chanted. But
19872: the stillness was not broken, for the Frate’s audiences with Heaven
19873: were yet charged with electric awe for that mixed multitude, so that
19874: those who had already the will to stone him felt their arms unnerved.
19875: 
19876: At last there was a vibration among the multitude, each seeming to give
19877: his neighbour a momentary aspen-like touch, as when men who have been
19878: watching for something in the heavens see the expected presence
19879: silently disclosing itself. The Frate had risen, turned towards the
19880: people, and partly pushed back his cowl. The monotonous wail of
19881: psalmody had ceased, and to those who stood near the pulpit, it was as
19882: if the sounds which had just been filling their ears had suddenly
19883: merged themselves in the force of Savonarola’s flashing glance, as he
19884: looked round him in the silence. Then he stretched out his hands,
19885: which, in their exquisite delicacy, seemed transfigured from an animal
19886: organ for grasping into vehicles of sensibility too acute to need any
19887: gross contact: hands that came like an appealing speech from that part
19888: of his soul which was masked by his strong passionate face, written on
19889: now with deeper lines about the mouth and brow than are made by
19890: forty-four years of ordinary life.
19891: 
19892: At the first stretching out of the hands some of the crowd in the front
19893: ranks fell on their knees, and here and there a devout disciple farther
19894: off; but the great majority stood firm, some resisting the impulse to
19895: kneel before this excommunicated man (might not a great judgment fall
19896: upon him even in this act of blessing?)—others jarred with scorn and
19897: hatred of the ambitious deceiver who was getting up this new comedy,
19898: before which, nevertheless, they felt themselves impotent, as before
19899: the triumph of a fashion.
19900: 
19901: But then came the voice, clear and low at first, uttering the words of
19902: absolution—“_Misereatur vestri_”—and more fell on their knees: and as
19903: it rose higher and yet clearer, the erect heads became fewer and fewer,
19904: till, at the words “_Benedicat vos omnipotens Deus_” it rose to a
19905: masculine cry, as if protesting its power to bless under the clutch of
19906: a demon that wanted to stifle it: it rang like a trumpet to the
19907: extremities of the Piazza, and under it every head was bowed.
19908: 
19909: After the utterance of that blessing, Savonarola himself fell on his
19910: knees and hid his face in temporary exhaustion. Those great jets of
19911: emotion were a necessary part of his life; he himself had said to the
19912: people long ago, “Without preaching I cannot live.” But it was a life
19913: that shattered him.
19914: 
19915: In a few minutes more, some had risen to their feet, but a larger
19916: number remained kneeling, and all faces were intently watching him. He
19917: had taken into his hands a crystal vessel, containing the consecrated
19918: Host, and was about to address the people.
19919: 
19920: “You remember, my children, three days ago I besought you, when I
19921: should hold this Sacrament in my hand in the face of you all, to pray
19922: fervently to the Most High that if this work of mine does not come from
19923: Him, He will send a fire and consume me, that I may vanish into the
19924: eternal darkness away from His light which I have hidden with my
19925: falsity. Again I beseech you to make that prayer, and to make it
19926: _now_.”
19927: 
19928: It was a breathless moment: perhaps no man really prayed, if some in a
19929: spirit of devout obedience made the effort to pray. Every consciousness
19930: was chiefly possessed by the sense that Savonarola was praying, in a
19931: voice not loud, but distinctly audible in the wide stillness.
19932: 
19933: “Lord, if I have not wrought in sincerity of soul, if my word cometh
19934: not from Thee, strike me in this moment with Thy thunder, and let the
19935: fires of Thy wrath enclose me.”
19936: 
19937: He ceased to speak, and stood motionless, with the consecrated Mystery
19938: in his hand, with eyes uplifted, and a quivering excitement in his
19939: whole aspect. Every one else was motionless and silent too, while the
19940: sunlight, which for the last quarter of an hour had here and there been
19941: piercing the greyness, made fitful streaks across the convent wall,
19942: causing some awe-stricken spectators to start timidly. But soon there
19943: was a wider parting, and with a gentle quickness, like a smile, a
19944: stream of brightness poured itself on the crystal vase, and then spread
19945: itself over Savonarola’s face with mild glorification.
19946: 
19947: An instantaneous shout rang through the Piazza, “Behold the answer!”
19948: 
19949: The warm radiance thrilled through Savonarola’s frame, and so did the
19950: shout. It was his last moment of untroubled triumph, and in its
19951: rapturous confidence he felt carried to a grander scene yet to come,
19952: before an audience that would represent all Christendom, in whose
19953: presence he should again be sealed as the messenger of the supreme
19954: righteousness, and feel himself full charged with Divine strength. It
19955: was but a moment that expanded itself in that prevision. While the
19956: shout was still ringing in his ears he turned away within the church,
19957: feeling the strain too great for him to bear it longer.
19958: 
19959: But when the Frate had disappeared, and the sunlight seemed no longer
19960: to have anything special in its illumination, but was spreading itself
19961: impartially over all things clean and unclean, there began, along with
19962: the general movement of the crowd, a confusion of voices in which
19963: certain strong discords and varying scales of laughter made it evident
19964: that, in the previous silence and universal kneeling, hostility and
19965: scorn had only submitted unwillingly to a momentary spell.
19966: 
19967: “It seems to me the plaudits are giving way to criticism,” said Tito,
19968: who had been watching the scene attentively from an upper loggia in one
19969: of the houses opposite the church. “Nevertheless it was a striking
19970: moment, eh, Messer Pietro? Fra Girolamo is a man to make one understand
19971: that there was a time when the monk’s frock was a symbol of power over
19972: men’s minds rather than over the keys of women’s cupboards.”
19973: 
19974: “Assuredly,” said Pietro Cennini. “And until I have seen proof that Fra
19975: Girolamo has much less faith in God’s judgments than the common run of
19976: men, instead of having considerably more, I shall not believe that he
19977: would brave Heaven in this way if his soul were laden with a conscious
19978: lie.”
19979: 
19980: 
19981: 
19982: 
19983: CHAPTER LXIII.
19984: Ripening Schemes.
19985: 
19986: 
19987: A month after that Carnival, one morning near the end of March, Tito
19988: descended the marble steps of the Old Palace, bound on a pregnant
19989: errand to San Marco. For some reason, he did not choose to take the
19990: direct road, which was but a slightly-bent line from the Old Palace; he
19991: chose rather to make a circuit by the Piazza di Santa Croce, where the
19992: people would be pouring out of the church after the early sermon.
19993: 
19994: It was in the grand church of Santa Croce that the daily Lenten sermon
19995: had of late had the largest audience. For Savonarola’s voice had ceased
19996: to be heard even in his own church of San Marco, a hostile Signoria
19997: having imposed silence on him in obedience to a new letter from the
19998: Pope, threatening the city with an immediate interdict if this
19999: “wretched worm” and “monstrous idol” were not forbidden to preach, and
20000: sent to demand pardon at Rome. And next to hearing Fra Girolamo
20001: himself, the most exciting Lenten occupation was to hear him argued
20002: against and vilified. This excitement was to be had in Santa Croce,
20003: where the Franciscan appointed to preach the Quaresimal sermons had
20004: offered to clench his arguments by walking through the fire with Fra
20005: Girolamo. Had not that schismatical Dominican said, that his prophetic
20006: doctrine would be proved by a miracle at the fitting time? Here, then,
20007: was the fitting time. Let Savonarola walk through the fire, and if he
20008: came out unhurt, the Divine origin of his doctrine would be
20009: demonstrated; but if the fire consumed him, his falsity would be
20010: manifest; and that he might have no excuse for evading the test, the
20011: Franciscan declared himself willing to be a victim to this high logic,
20012: and to be burned for the sake of securing the necessary minor premiss.
20013: 
20014: Savonarola, according to his habit, had taken no notice of these pulpit
20015: attacks. But it happened that the zealous preacher of Santa Croce was
20016: no other than the Fra Francesco di Puglia, who at Prato the year before
20017: had been engaged in a like challenge with Savonarola’s fervent follower
20018: Fra Domenico, but had been called home by his superiors while the heat
20019: was simply oratorical. Honest Fra Domenico, then, who was preaching
20020: Lenten sermons to the women in the Via del Cocomero, no sooner heard of
20021: this new challenge, than he took up the gauntlet for his master, and
20022: declared himself ready to walk through the fire with Fra Francesco.
20023: Already the people were beginning to take a strong interest in what
20024: seemed to them a short and easy method of argument (for those who were
20025: to be convinced), when Savonarola, keenly alive to the dangers that lay
20026: in the mere discussion of the case, commanded Fra Domenico to withdraw
20027: his acceptance of the challenge and secede from the affair. The
20028: Franciscan declared himself content: he had not directed his challenge
20029: to any subaltern, but to Fra Girolamo himself.
20030: 
20031: After that, the popular interest in the Lenten sermons had flagged a
20032: little. But this morning, when Tito entered the Piazza di Santa Croce,
20033: he found, as he expected, that the people were pouring from the church
20034: in large numbers. Instead of dispersing, many of them concentrated
20035: themselves towards a particular spot near the entrance of the
20036: Franciscan monastery, and Tito took the same direction, threading the
20037: crowd with a careless and leisurely air, but keeping careful watch on
20038: that monastic entrance, as if he expected some object of interest to
20039: issue from it.
20040: 
20041: It was no such expectation that occupied the crowd. The object they
20042: were caring about was already visible to them in the shape of a large
20043: placard, affixed by order of the Signoria, and covered with very
20044: legible official handwriting. But curiosity was somewhat balked by the
20045: fact that the manuscript was chiefly in Latin, and though nearly every
20046: man knew beforehand approximately what the placard contained, he had an
20047: appetite for more exact knowledge, which gave him an irritating sense
20048: of his neighbour’s ignorance in not being able to interpret the learned
20049: tongue. For that aural acquaintance with Latin phrases which the
20050: unlearned might pick up from pulpit quotations constantly interpreted
20051: by the preacher could help them little when they saw written Latin; the
20052: spelling even of the modern language being in an unorganised and
20053: scrambling condition for the mass of people who could read and
20054: write,[1] while the majority of those assembled nearest to the placard
20055: were not in the dangerous predicament of possessing that little
20056: knowledge.
20057: 
20058:  [1] The old diarists throw in their consonants with a regard rather to
20059:  quantity than position, well typified by the _Ragnolo Braghiello_
20060:  (Agnolo Gabriello) of Boccaccio’s Ferondo.
20061: 
20062: 
20063: “It’s the Frate’s doctrines that he’s to prove by being burned,” said
20064: that large public character Goro, who happened to be among the foremost
20065: gazers. “The Signoria has taken it in hand, and the writing is to let
20066: us know. It’s what the Padre has been telling us about in his sermon.”
20067: 
20068: “Nay, Goro,” said a sleek shopkeeper, compassionately, “thou hast got
20069: thy legs into twisted hose there. The Frate has to prove his doctrines
20070: by _not_ being burned: he is to walk through the fire, and come out on
20071: the other side sound and whole.”
20072: 
20073: “Yes, yes,” said a young sculptor, who wore his white-streaked cap and
20074: tunic with a jaunty air. “But Fra Girolamo objects to walking through
20075: the fire. Being sound and whole already, he sees no reason why he
20076: should walk through the fire to come out in just the same condition. He
20077: leaves such odds and ends of work to Fra Domenico.”
20078: 
20079: “Then I say he flinches like a coward,” said Goro, in a wheezy treble.
20080: “Suffocation! that was what he did at the Carnival. He had us all in
20081: the Piazza to see the lightning strike him, and nothing came of it.”
20082: 
20083: “Stop that bleating,” said a tall shoemaker, who had stepped in to hear
20084: part of the sermon, with bunches of slippers hanging over his
20085: shoulders. “It seems to me, friend, that you are about as wise as a
20086: calf with water on its brain. The Frate will flinch from nothing: he’ll
20087: say nothing beforehand, perhaps, but when the moment comes he’ll walk
20088: through the fire without asking any grey-frock to keep him company. But
20089: I would give a shoestring to know what this Latin all is.”
20090: 
20091: “There’s so much of it,” said the shopkeeper, “else I’m pretty good at
20092: guessing. Is there no scholar to be seen?” he added, with a slight
20093: expression of disgust.
20094: 
20095: There was a general turning of heads, which caused the talkers to
20096: descry Tito approaching in their rear.
20097: 
20098: “Here is one,” said the young sculptor, smiling and raising his cap.
20099: 
20100: “It is the secretary of the Ten: he is going to the convent, doubtless;
20101: make way for him,” said the shopkeeper, also doffing, though that mark
20102: of respect was rarely shown by Florentines except to the highest
20103: officials. The exceptional reverence was really exacted by the
20104: splendour and grace of Tito’s appearance, which made his black mantle,
20105: with its gold fibula, look like a regal robe, and his ordinary black
20106: velvet cap like an entirely exceptional head-dress. The hardening of
20107: his cheeks and mouth, which was the chief change in his face since he
20108: came to Florence, seemed to a superficial glance only to give his
20109: beauty a more masculine character. He raised his own cap immediately
20110: and said—
20111: 
20112: “Thanks, my friend, I merely wished, as you did, to see what is at the
20113: foot of this placard—ah, it is as I expected. I had been informed that
20114: the government permits any one who will, to subscribe his name as a
20115: candidate to enter the fire—which is an act of liberality worthy of the
20116: magnificent Signoria—reserving of course the right to make a selection.
20117: And doubtless many believers will be eager to subscribe their names.
20118: For what is it to enter the fire, to one whose faith is firm? A man is
20119: afraid of the fire, because he believes it will burn him; but if he
20120: believes the contrary?”—here Tito lifted his shoulders and made an
20121: oratorical pause—“for which reason I have never been one to disbelieve
20122: the Frate, when he has said that he would enter the fire to prove his
20123: doctrine. For in his place, if you believed the fire would not burn
20124: you, which of you, my friends, would not enter it as readily as you
20125: would walk along the dry bed of the Mugnone?”
20126: 
20127: As Tito looked round him during this appeal, there was a change in some
20128: of his audience very much like the change in an eager dog when he is
20129: invited to smell something pungent. Since the question of burning was
20130: becoming practical, it was not every one who would rashly commit
20131: himself to any general view of the relation between faith and fire. The
20132: scene might have been too much for a gravity less under command than
20133: Tito’s.
20134: 
20135: “Then, Messer Segretario,” said the young sculptor, “it seems to me Fra
20136: Francesco is the greater hero, for he offers to enter the fire for the
20137: truth, though he is sure the fire will burn him.”
20138: 
20139: “I do not deny it,” said Tito, blandly. “But if it turns out that Fra
20140: Francesco is mistaken, he will have been burned for the wrong side, and
20141: the Church has never reckoned such victims to be martyrs. We must
20142: suspend our judgment until the trial has really taken place.”
20143: 
20144: “It is true, Messer Segretario,” said the shopkeeper, with subdued
20145: impatience. “But will you favour us by interpreting the Latin?”
20146: 
20147: “Assuredly,” said Tito. “It does but express the conclusions or
20148: doctrines which the Frate specially teaches, and which the trial by
20149: fire is to prove true or false. They are doubtless familiar to you.
20150: First, that Florence—”
20151: 
20152: “Let us have the Latin bit by bit, and then tell us what it means,”
20153: said the shoemaker, who had been a frequent hearer of Fra Girolamo.
20154: 
20155: “Willingly,” said Tito, smiling. “You will then judge if I give you the
20156: right meaning.”
20157: 
20158: “Yes, yes; that’s fair,” said Goro.
20159: 
20160: “_Ecclesia Dei indiget renovatione_; that is, the Church of God needs
20161: purifying or regenerating.”
20162: 
20163: “It is true,” said several voices at once.
20164: 
20165: “That means, the priests ought to lead better lives; there needs no
20166: miracle to prove that. That’s what the Frate has always been saying,”
20167: said the shoemaker.
20168: 
20169: “_Flagellabitur_,” Tito went on. “That is, it will be scourged.
20170: _Renovabitur_: it will be purified. _Florentia quoque post flagellam
20171: renovabitur et prosperabitur_: Florence also, after the scourging,
20172: shall be purified and shall prosper.”
20173: 
20174: “That means we are to get Pisa again,” said the shopkeeper.
20175: 
20176: “And get the wool from England as we used to do, I should hope,” said
20177: an elderly man, in an old-fashioned berretta, who had been silent till
20178: now. “There’s been scourging enough with the sinking of the trade.”
20179: 
20180: At this moment, a tall personage, surmounted by a red feather, issued
20181: from the door of the convent, and exchanged an indifferent glance with
20182: Tito; who, tossing his becchetto carelessly over his left shoulder,
20183: turned to his reading again, while the bystanders, with more timidity
20184: than respect, shrank to make a passage for Messer Dolfo Spini.
20185: 
20186: “_Infideles convertentur ad Christum_,” Tito went on. “That is, the
20187: infidels shall be converted to Christ.”
20188: 
20189: “Those are the Turks and the Moors. Well, I’ve nothing to say against
20190: that,” said the shopkeeper, dispassionately.
20191: 
20192: “_Haec autem omnia erunt temporibus nostris_: and all these things
20193: shall happen in our times.”
20194: 
20195: “Why, what use would they be else?” said Goro.
20196: 
20197: “_Excommunicato nuper lata contra Reverendum Patrem nostrum Fratrem
20198: Hieronymum nulla est_: the excommunication lately pronounced against
20199: our reverend father, Fra Girolamo, is null. _Non observantes eam non
20200: peccant_: those who disregard it are not committing a sin.”
20201: 
20202: “I shall know better what to say to that when we have had the Trial by
20203: Fire,” said the shopkeeper.
20204: 
20205: “Which doubtless will clear up everything,” said Tito. “That is all the
20206: Latin—all the conclusions that are to be proved true or false by the
20207: trial. The rest you can perceive is simply a proclamation of the
20208: Signoria in good Tuscan, calling on such as are eager to walk through
20209: the fire, to come to the Palazzo and subscribe their names. Can I serve
20210: you further? If not—”
20211: 
20212: Tito, as he turned away, raised his cap and bent slightly, with so easy
20213: an air that the movement seemed a natural prompting of deference.
20214: 
20215: He quickened his pace as he left the Piazza, and after two or three
20216: turnings he paused in a quiet street before a door at which he gave a
20217: light and peculiar knock. It was opened by a young woman whom he
20218: chucked under the chin as he asked her if the Padrone was within, and
20219: he then passed, without further ceremony, through another door which
20220: stood ajar on his right-hand. It admitted him into a handsome but
20221: untidy room, where Dolfo Spini sat playing with a fine stag-hound which
20222: alternately snuffed at a basket of pups and licked his hands with that
20223: affectionate disregard of her master’s morals sometimes held to be one
20224: of the most agreeable attributes of her sex. He just looked up as Tito
20225: entered, but continued his play, simply from that disposition to
20226: persistence in some irrelevant action, by which slow-witted sensual
20227: people seem to be continually counteracting their own purposes. Tito
20228: was patient.
20229: 
20230: “A handsome _bracca_ that,” he said, quietly, standing with his thumbs
20231: in his belt. Presently he added, in that cool liquid tone which seemed
20232: mild, but compelled attention, “When you have finished such caresses as
20233: cannot possibly be deferred, my Dolfo, we will talk of business, if you
20234: please. My time, which I could wish to be eternity at your service, is
20235: not entirely my own this morning.”
20236: 
20237: “Down, Mischief, down!” said Spini, with sudden roughness.
20238: “Malediction!” he added, still more gruffly, pushing the dog aside;
20239: then, starting from his seat, he stood close to Tito, and put a hand on
20240: his shoulder as he spoke.
20241: 
20242: “I hope your sharp wits see all the ins and outs of this business, my
20243: fine necromancer, for it seems to me no clearer than the bottom of a
20244: sack.”
20245: 
20246: “What is your difficulty, my cavalier?”
20247: 
20248: “These accursed Frati Minori at Santa Croce. They are drawing back now.
20249: Fra Francesco himself seems afraid of sticking to his challenge; talks
20250: of the Prophet being likely to use magic to get up a false
20251: miracle—thinks he himself might be dragged into the fire and burned,
20252: and the Prophet might come out whole by magic, and the Church be none
20253: the better. And then, after all our talking, there’s not so much as a
20254: blessed lay brother who will offer himself to pair with that pious
20255: sheep Fra Domenico.”
20256: 
20257: “It is the peculiar stupidity of the tonsured skull that prevents them
20258: from seeing of how little consequence it is whether they are burned or
20259: not,” said Tito. “Have you sworn well to them that they shall be in no
20260: danger of entering the fire?”
20261: 
20262: “No,” said Spini, looking puzzled; “because one of them will be obliged
20263: to go in with Fra Domenico, who thinks it a thousand years till the
20264: fagots are ready.”
20265: 
20266: “Not at all. Fra Domenico himself is not likely to go in. I have told
20267: you before, my Dolfo, only your powerful mind is not to be impressed
20268: without more repetition than suffices for the vulgar—I have told you
20269: that now you have got the Signoria to take up this affair and prevent
20270: it from being hushed up by Fra Girolamo, nothing is necessary but that
20271: on a given day the fuel should be prepared in the Piazza, and the
20272: people got together with the expectation of seeing something
20273: prodigious. If, after that, the Prophet quits the Piazza without any
20274: appearance of a miracle on his side, he is ruined with the people: they
20275: will be ready to pelt him out of the city, the Signoria will find it
20276: easy to banish him from the territory, and his Holiness may do as he
20277: likes with him. Therefore, my Alcibiades, swear to the Franciscans that
20278: their grey-frocks shall not come within singeing distance of the fire.”
20279: 
20280: Spini rubbed the back of his head with one hand, and tapped his sword
20281: against his leg with the other, to stimulate his power of seeing these
20282: intangible combinations.
20283: 
20284: “But,” he said presently, looking up again, “unless we fall on him in
20285: the Piazza, when the people are in a rage, and make an end of him and
20286: his lies then and there, Valori and the Salviati and the Albizzi will
20287: take up arms and raise a fight for him. I know that was talked of when
20288: there was the hubbub on Ascension Sunday. And the people may turn round
20289: again: there may be a story raised of the French king coming again, or
20290: some other cursed chance in the hypocrite’s favour. The city will never
20291: be safe till he’s out of it.”
20292: 
20293: “He _will_ be out of it before long, without your giving yourself any
20294: further trouble than this little comedy of the Trial by Fire. The wine
20295: and the sun will make vinegar without any shouting to help them, as
20296: your Florentine sages would say. You will have the satisfaction of
20297: delivering your city from an incubus by an able stratagem, instead of
20298: risking blunders with sword-thrusts.”
20299: 
20300: “But suppose he _did_ get magic and the devil to help him, and walk
20301: through the fire after all?” said Spini, with a grimace intended to
20302: hide a certain shyness in trenching on this speculative ground. “How do
20303: you know there’s nothing in those things? Plenty of scholars believe in
20304: them, and this Frate is bad enough for anything.”
20305: 
20306: “Oh, of course there are such things,” said Tito, with a shrug: “but I
20307: have particular reasons for knowing that the Frate is not on such terms
20308: with the devil as can give him any confidence in this affair. The only
20309: magic he relies on is his own ability.”
20310: 
20311: “Ability!” said Spini. “Do you call it ability to be setting Florence
20312: at loggerheads with the Pope and all the powers of Italy—all to keep
20313: beckoning at the French king who never comes? You may call him able,
20314: but I call him a hypocrite, who wants to be master of everybody, and
20315: get himself made Pope.”
20316: 
20317: “You judge with your usual penetration, my captain, but our opinions do
20318: not clash. The Frate, wanting to be master, and to carry out his
20319: projects against the Pope, requires the lever of a foreign power, and
20320: requires Florence as a fulcrum. I used to think him a narrow-minded
20321: bigot, but now, I think him a shrewd ambitious man who knows what he is
20322: aiming at, and directs his aim as skilfully as you direct a ball when
20323: you are playing at _maglio_.”
20324: 
20325: “Yes, yes,” said Spini, cordially, “I can aim a ball.”
20326: 
20327: “It is true,” said Tito, with bland gravity; “and I should not have
20328: troubled you with my trivial remark on the Frate’s ability, but that
20329: you may see how this will heighten the credit of your success against
20330: him at Rome and at Milan, which is sure to serve you in good stead when
20331: the city comes to change its policy.”
20332: 
20333: “Well, thou art a good little demon, and shalt have good pay,” said
20334: Spini, patronisingly; whereupon he thought it only natural that the
20335: useful Greek adventurer should smile with gratification as he said—
20336: 
20337: “Of course, any advantage to me depends entirely on your—”
20338: 
20339: “We shall have our supper at my palace to-night,” interrupted Spini,
20340: with a significant nod and an affectionate pat on Tito’s shoulder, “and
20341: I shall expound the new scheme to them all.”
20342: 
20343: “Pardon, my magnificent patron,” said Tito; “the scheme has been the
20344: same from the first—it has never varied except in your memory. Are you
20345: sure you have fast hold of it now?”
20346: 
20347: Spini rehearsed.
20348: 
20349: “One thing more,” he said, as Tito was hastening away. “There is that
20350: sharp-nosed notary, Ser Ceccone; he has been handy of late. Tell me,
20351: you who can see a man wink when you’re behind him, do you think I may
20352: go on making use of him?”
20353: 
20354: Tito dared not say “No.” He knew his companion too well to trust him
20355: with advice when all Spini’s vanity and self-interest were not engaged
20356: in concealing the adviser.
20357: 
20358: “Doubtless,” he answered, promptly. “I have nothing to say against
20359: Ceccone.”
20360: 
20361: That suggestion of the notary’s intimate access to Spini caused Tito a
20362: passing twinge, interrupting his amused satisfaction in the success
20363: with which he made a tool of the man who fancied himself a patron. For
20364: he had been rather afraid of Ser Ceccone. Tito’s nature made him
20365: peculiarly alive to circumstances that might be turned to his
20366: disadvantage; his memory was much haunted by such possibilities,
20367: stimulating him to contrivances by which he might ward them off. And it
20368: was not likely that he should forget that October morning more than a
20369: year ago, when Romola had appeared suddenly before him at the door of
20370: Nello’s shop, and had compelled him to declare his certainty that Fra
20371: Girolamo was not going outside the gates. The fact that Ser Ceccone had
20372: been a witness of that scene, together with Tito’s perception that for
20373: some reason or other he was an object of dislike to the notary, had
20374: received a new importance from the recent turn of events. For after
20375: having been implicated in the Medicean plots, and having found it
20376: advisable in consequence to retire into the country for some time, Ser
20377: Ceccone had of late, since his reappearance in the city, attached
20378: himself to the Arrabbiati, and cultivated the patronage of Dolfo Spini.
20379: Now that captain of the Compagnacci was much given, when in the company
20380: of intimates, to confidential narrative about his own doings, and if
20381: Ser Ceccone’s powers of combination were sharpened by enmity, he might
20382: gather some knowledge which he could use against Tito with very
20383: unpleasant results.
20384: 
20385: It would be pitiable to be balked in well-conducted schemes by an
20386: insignificant notary; to be lamed by the sting of an insect whom he had
20387: offended unawares. “But,” Tito said to himself, “the man’s dislike to
20388: me can be nothing deeper than the ill-humour of a dinnerless dog; I
20389: shall conquer it if I can make him prosperous.” And he had been very
20390: glad of an opportunity which had presented itself of providing the
20391: notary with a temporary post as an extra _cancelliere_ or registering
20392: secretary under the Ten, believing that with this sop and the
20393: expectation of more, the waspish cur must be quite cured of the
20394: disposition to bite him.
20395: 
20396: But perfect scheming demands omniscience, and the notary’s envy had
20397: been stimulated into hatred by causes of which Tito knew nothing. That
20398: evening when Tito, returning from his critical audience with the
20399: Special Council, had brushed by Ser Ceccone on the stairs, the notary,
20400: who had only just returned from Pistoja, and learned the arrest of the
20401: conspirators, was bound on an errand which bore a humble resemblance to
20402: Tito’s. He also, without giving up a show of popular zeal, had been
20403: putting in the Medicean lottery. He also had been privy to the
20404: unexecuted plot, and was willing to tell what he knew, but knew much
20405: less to tell. He also would have been willing to go on treacherous
20406: errands, but a more eligible agent had forestalled him. His
20407: propositions were received coldly; the council, he was told, was
20408: already in possession of the needed information, and since he had been
20409: thus busy in sedition, it would be well for him to retire out of the
20410: way of mischief, otherwise the government might be obliged to take note
20411: of him. Ser Ceccone wanted no evidence to make him attribute his
20412: failure to Tito, and his spite was the more bitter because the nature
20413: of the case compelled him to hold his peace about it. Nor was this the
20414: whole of his grudge against the flourishing Melema. On issuing from his
20415: hiding-place, and attaching himself to the Arrabbiati, he had earned
20416: some pay as one of the spies who reported information on Florentine
20417: affairs to the Milanese court; but his pay had been small,
20418: notwithstanding his pains to write full letters, and he had lately been
20419: apprised that his news was seldom more than a late and imperfect
20420: edition of what was known already. Now Ser Ceccone had no positive
20421: knowledge that Tito had an underhand connection with the Arrabbiati and
20422: the Court of Milan, but he had a suspicion of which he chewed the cud
20423: with as strong a sense of flavour as if it had been a certainty.
20424: 
20425: This fine-grown vigorous hatred could swallow the feeble opiate of
20426: Tito’s favours, and be as lively as ever after it. Why should Ser
20427: Ceccone like Melema any the better for doing him favours? Doubtless the
20428: suave secretary had his own ends to serve; and what right had he to the
20429: superior position which made it possible for him to show favour? But
20430: since he had tuned his voice to flattery, Ser Ceccone would pitch his
20431: in the same key, and it remained to be seen who would win at the game
20432: of outwitting.
20433: 
20434: To have a mind well oiled with that sort of argument which prevents any
20435: claim from grasping it, seems eminently convenient sometimes: only the
20436: oil becomes objectionable when we find it anointing other minds on
20437: which we want to establish a hold.
20438: 
20439: Tito, however, not being quite omniscient, felt now no more than a
20440: passing twinge of uneasiness at the suggestion of Ser Ceccone’s power
20441: to hurt him. It was only for a little while that he cared greatly about
20442: keeping clear of suspicions and hostility. He was now playing his final
20443: game in Florence, and the skill he was conscious of applying gave him a
20444: pleasure in it even apart from the expected winnings. The errand on
20445: which he was sent to San Marco was a stroke in which he felt so much
20446: confidence that he had already given notice to the Ten of his desire to
20447: resign his office at an indefinite period within the next month or two,
20448: and had obtained permission to make that resignation suddenly, if his
20449: affairs needed it, with the understanding that Niccolò Macchiavelli was
20450: to be his provisional substitute, if not his successor. He was acting
20451: on hypothetic grounds, but this was the sort of action that had the
20452: keenest interest for his diplomatic mind. From a combination of general
20453: knowledge concerning Savonarola’s purposes with diligently observed
20454: details he had framed a conjecture which he was about to verify by this
20455: visit to San Marco. If he proved to be right, his game would be won,
20456: and he might soon turn his back on Florence. He looked eagerly towards
20457: that consummation, for many circumstances besides his own weariness of
20458: the place told him that it was time for him to be gone.
20459: 
20460: 
20461: 
20462: 
20463: CHAPTER LXIV.
20464: The Prophet in his Cell.
20465: 
20466: 
20467: Tito’s visit to San Marco had been announced beforehand, and he was at
20468: once conducted by Fra Niccolò, Savonarola’s secretary, up the spiral
20469: staircase into the long corridors lined with cells—corridors where Fra
20470: Angelico’s frescoes, delicate as the rainbow on the melting cloud,
20471: startled the unaccustomed eye here and there, as if they had been
20472: sudden reflections cast from an ethereal world, where the Madonna sat
20473: crowned in her radiant glory, and the Divine infant looked forth with
20474: perpetual promise.
20475: 
20476: It was an hour of relaxation in the monastery, and most of the cells
20477: were empty. The light through the narrow windows looked in on nothing
20478: but bare walls, and the hard pallet and the crucifix. And even behind
20479: that door at the end of a long corridor, in the inner cell opening from
20480: an antechamber where the Prior usually sat at his desk or received
20481: private visitors, the high jet of light fell on only one more object
20482: that looked quite as common a monastic sight as the bare walls and hard
20483: pallet. It was but the back of a figure in the long white Dominican
20484: tunic and scapulary, kneeling with bowed head before a crucifix. It
20485: might have been any ordinary Fra Girolamo, who had nothing worse to
20486: confess than thinking of wrong things when he was singing _in coro_, or
20487: feeling a spiteful joy when Fra Benedetto dropped the ink over his own
20488: miniatures in the breviary he was illuminating—who had no higher
20489: thought than that of climbing safely into Paradise up the narrow ladder
20490: of prayer, fasting, and obedience. But under this particular white
20491: tunic there was a heart beating with a consciousness inconceivable to
20492: the average monk, and perhaps hard to be conceived by any man who has
20493: not arrived at self-knowledge through a tumultuous inner life: a
20494: consciousness in which irrevocable errors and lapses from veracity were
20495: so entwined with noble purposes and sincere beliefs, in which
20496: self-justifying expediency was so inwoven with the tissue of a great
20497: work which the whole being seemed as unable to abandon as the body was
20498: unable to abandon glowing and trembling before the objects of hope and
20499: fear, that it was perhaps impossible, whatever course might be adopted,
20500: for the conscience to find perfect repose.
20501: 
20502: Savonarola was not only in the attitude of prayer, there were Latin
20503: words of prayer on his lips; and yet he was not praying. He had entered
20504: his cell, had fallen on his knees, and burst into words of
20505: supplication, seeking in this way for an influx of calmness which would
20506: be a warrant to him that the resolutions urged on him by crowding
20507: thoughts and passions were not wresting him away from the Divine
20508: support; but the previsions and impulses which had been at work within
20509: him for the last hour were too imperious; and while he pressed his
20510: hands against his face, and while his lips were uttering audibly, “_Cor
20511: mundum crea in me_” his mind was still filled with the images of the
20512: snare his enemies had prepared for him, was still busy with the
20513: arguments by which he could justify himself against their taunts and
20514: accusations.
20515: 
20516: And it was not only against his opponents that Savonarola had to defend
20517: himself. This morning he had had new proof that his friends and
20518: followers were as much inclined to urge on the Trial by Fire as his
20519: enemies: desiring and tacitly expecting that he himself would at last
20520: accept the challenge and evoke the long-expected miracle which was to
20521: dissipate doubt and triumph over malignity. Had he not said that God
20522: would declare himself at the fitting time? And to the understanding of
20523: plain Florentines, eager to get party questions settled, it seemed that
20524: no time could be more fitting than this. Certainly, if Fra Domenico
20525: walked through the fire unhurt, _that_ would be a miracle, and the
20526: faith and ardour of that good brother were felt to be a cheering
20527: augury; but Savonarola was acutely conscious that the secret longing of
20528: his followers to see him accept the challenge had not been dissipated
20529: by any reasons he had given for his refusal.
20530: 
20531: Yet it was impossible to him to satisfy them; and with bitter distress
20532: he saw now that it was impossible for him any longer to resist the
20533: prosecution of the trial in Fra Domenico’s case. Not that Savonarola
20534: had uttered and written a falsity when he declared his belief in a
20535: future supernatural attestation of his work; but his mind was so
20536: constituted that while it was easy for him to believe in a miracle
20537: which, being distant and undefined, was screened behind the strong
20538: reasons he saw for its occurrence, and yet easier for him to have a
20539: belief in inward miracles such as his own prophetic inspiration and
20540: divinely-wrought intuitions; it was at the same time insurmountably
20541: difficult to him to believe in the probability of a miracle which, like
20542: this of being carried unhurt through the fire, pressed in all its
20543: details on his imagination and involved a demand not only for belief
20544: but for exceptional action.
20545: 
20546: Savonarola’s nature was one of those in which opposing tendencies
20547: co-exist in almost equal strength: the passionate sensibility which,
20548: impatient of definite thought, floods every idea with emotion and tends
20549: towards contemplative ecstasy, alternated in him with a keen perception
20550: of outward facts and a vigorous practical judgment of men and things.
20551: And in this case of the Trial by Fire, the latter characteristics were
20552: stimulated into unusual activity by an acute physical sensitiveness
20553: which gives overpowering force to the conception of pain and
20554: destruction as a necessary sequence of facts which have already been
20555: causes of pain in our experience. The promptitude with which men will
20556: consent to touch red-hot iron with a wet finger is not to be measured
20557: by their theoretic acceptance of the impossibility that the iron will
20558: burn them: practical belief depends on what is most strongly
20559: represented in the mind at a given moment. And with the Frate’s
20560: constitution, when the Trial by Fire was urged on his imagination as an
20561: immediate demand, it was impossible for him to believe that he or any
20562: other man could walk through the flames unhurt—impossible for him to
20563: believe that even if he resolved to offer himself, he would not shrink
20564: at the last moment.
20565: 
20566: But the Florentines were not likely to make these fine distinctions. To
20567: the common run of mankind it has always seemed a proof of mental vigour
20568: to find moral questions easy, and judge conduct according to concise
20569: alternatives. And nothing was likely to seem plainer than that a man
20570: who at one time declared that God would not leave him without the
20571: guarantee of a miracle, and yet drew back when it was proposed to test
20572: his declaration, had said what he did not believe. Were not Fra
20573: Domenico and Fra Mariano, and scores of Piagnoni besides, ready to
20574: enter the fire? What was the cause of their superior courage, if it was
20575: not their superior faith? Savonarola could not have explained his
20576: conduct satisfactorily to his friends, even if he had been able to
20577: explain it thoroughly to himself. And he was not. Our naked feelings
20578: make haste to clothe themselves in propositions which lie at hand among
20579: our store of opinions, and to give a true account of what passes within
20580: us something else is necessary besides sincerity, even when sincerity
20581: is unmixed. In these very moments, when Savonarola was kneeling in
20582: audible prayer, he had ceased to hear the words on his lips. They were
20583: drowned by argumentative voices within him that shaped their reasons
20584: more and more for an outward audience.
20585: 
20586: “To appeal to heaven for a miracle by a rash acceptance of a challenge,
20587: which is a mere snare prepared for me by ignoble foes, would be a
20588: tempting of God, and the appeal would not be responded to. Let the
20589: Pope’s legate come, let the ambassadors of all the great Powers come
20590: and promise that the calling of a General Council and the reform of the
20591: Church shall hang on the miracle, and I will enter the flames, trusting
20592: that God will not withhold His seal from that great work. Until then I
20593: reserve myself for higher duties which are directly laid upon me: it is
20594: not permitted to me to leap from the chariot for the sake of wrestling
20595: with every loud vaunter. But Fra Domenico’s invincible zeal to enter
20596: into the trial may be the sign of a Divine vocation, may be a pledge
20597: that the miracle—”
20598: 
20599: But no! when Savonarola brought his mind close to the threatened scene
20600: in the Piazza, and imagined a human body entering the fire, his belief
20601: recoiled again. It was not an event that his imagination could simply
20602: see: he felt it with shuddering vibrations to the extremities of his
20603: sensitive fingers. The miracle could not be. Nay, the trial itself was
20604: not to happen: he was warranted in doing all in his power to hinder it.
20605: The fuel might be got ready in the Piazza, the people might be
20606: assembled, the preparatory formalities might be gone through: all this
20607: was perhaps inevitable now, and he could no longer resist it without
20608: bringing dishonour on—himself? Yes, and therefore on the cause of God.
20609: But it was not really intended that the Franciscan should enter the
20610: fire, and while _he_ hung back there would be the means of preventing
20611: Fra Domenico’s entrance. At the very worst, if Fra Domenico were
20612: compelled to enter, he should carry the consecrated Host with him, and
20613: with that Mystery in his hand, there might be a warrant for expecting
20614: that the ordinary effects of fire would be stayed; or, more probably,
20615: this demand would be resisted, and might thus be a final obstacle to
20616: the trial.
20617: 
20618: But these intentions could not be avowed: he must appear frankly to
20619: await the trial, and to trust in its issue. That dissidence between
20620: inward reality and outward seeming was not the Christian simplicity
20621: after which he had striven through years of his youth and prime, and
20622: which he had preached as a chief fruit of the Divine life. In the
20623: stress and heat of the day, with cheeks burning, with shouts ringing in
20624: the ears, who is so blest as to remember the yearnings he had in the
20625: cool and silent morning and know that he has not belied them?
20626: 
20627: “O God, it is for the sake of the people—because they are blind—because
20628: their faith depends on me. If I put on sackcloth and cast myself among
20629: the ashes, who will take up the standard and head the battle? Have I
20630: not been led by a way which I knew not to the work that lies before
20631: me?”
20632: 
20633: The conflict was one that could not end, and in the effort at prayerful
20634: pleading the uneasy mind laved its smart continually in thoughts of the
20635: greatness of that task which there was no man else to fulfil if he
20636: forsook it. It was not a thing of everyday that a man should be
20637: inspired with the vision and the daring that made a sacred rebel.
20638: 
20639: Even the words of prayer had died away. He continued to kneel, but his
20640: mind was filled with the images of results to be felt through all
20641: Europe; and the sense of immediate difficulties was being lost in the
20642: glow of that vision, when the knocking at the door announced the
20643: expected visit.
20644: 
20645: Savonarola drew on his mantle before he left his cell, as was his
20646: custom when he received visitors; and with that immediate response to
20647: any appeal from without which belongs to a power-loving nature
20648: accustomed to make its power felt by speech, he met Tito with a glance
20649: as self-possessed and strong as if he had risen from resolution instead
20650: of conflict.
20651: 
20652: Tito did not kneel, but simply made a greeting of profound deference,
20653: which Savonarola received quietly without any sacerdotal words, and
20654: then desiring him to be seated, said at once—
20655: 
20656: “Your business is something of weight, my son, that could not be
20657: conveyed through others?”
20658: 
20659: “Assuredly, father, else I should not have presumed to ask it. I will
20660: not trespass on your time by any proem. I gathered from a remark of
20661: Messer Domenico Mazzinghi that you might be glad to make use of the
20662: next special courier who is sent to France with despatches from the
20663: Ten. I must entreat you to pardon me if I have been too officious; but
20664: inasmuch as Messer Domenico is at this moment away at his villa, I
20665: wished to apprise you that a courier carrying important letters is
20666: about to depart for Lyons at daybreak to-morrow.”
20667: 
20668: The muscles of Fra Girolamo’s face were eminently under command, as
20669: must be the case with all men whose personality is powerful, and in
20670: deliberate speech he was habitually cautious, confiding his intentions
20671: to none without necessity. But under any strong mental stimulus, his
20672: eyes were liable to a dilatation and added brilliancy that no strength
20673: of will could control. He looked steadily at Tito, and did not answer
20674: immediately, as if he had to consider whether the information he had
20675: just heard met any purpose of his.
20676: 
20677: Tito, whose glance never seemed observant, but rarely let anything
20678: escape it, had expected precisely that dilatation and flash of
20679: Savonarola’s eyes which he had noted on other occasions. He saw it, and
20680: then immediately busied himself in adjusting his gold fibula, which had
20681: got wrong; seeming to imply that he awaited an answer patiently.
20682: 
20683: The fact was that Savonarola had expected to receive this intimation
20684: from Domenico Mazzinghi, one of the Ten, an ardent disciple of his whom
20685: he had already employed to write a private letter to the Florentine
20686: ambassador in France, to prepare the way for a letter to the French
20687: king himself in Savonarola’s handwriting, which now lay ready in the
20688: desk at his side. It was a letter calling on the king to assist in
20689: summoning a General Council, that might reform the abuses of the
20690: Church, and begin by deposing Pope Alexander, who was not rightfully
20691: Pope, being a vicious unbeliever, elected by corruption and governing
20692: by simony.
20693: 
20694: This fact was not what Tito knew, but what his constructive talent,
20695: guided by subtle indications, had led him to guess and hope.
20696: 
20697: “It is true, my son,” said Savonarola, quietly,—“it is true I have
20698: letters which I would gladly send by safe conveyance under cover to our
20699: ambassador. Our community of San Marco, as you know, has affairs in
20700: France, being, amongst other things, responsible for a debt to that
20701: singularly wise and experienced Frenchman, Signor Philippe de Comines,
20702: on the library of the Medici, which we purchased; but I apprehend that
20703: Domenico Mazzinghi himself may return to the city before evening, and I
20704: should gain more time for preparation of the letters if I waited to
20705: deposit them in his hands.”
20706: 
20707: “Assuredly, reverend father, that might be better on all grounds,
20708: except one, namely, that if anything occurred to hinder Messer
20709: Domenico’s return, the despatch of the letters would require either
20710: that I should come to San Marco again at a late hour, or that you
20711: should send them to me by your secretary; and I am aware that you wish
20712: to guard against the false inferences which might be drawn from a too
20713: frequent communication between yourself and any officer of the
20714: government.” In throwing out this difficulty Tito felt that the more
20715: unwillingness the Frate showed to trust him, the more certain he would
20716: be of his conjecture.
20717: 
20718: Savonarola was silent; but while he kept his mouth firm, a slight glow
20719: rose in his face with the suppressed excitement that was growing within
20720: him. It would be a critical moment—that in which he delivered the
20721: letter out of his own hands.
20722: 
20723: “It is most probable that Messer Domenico will return in time,” said
20724: Tito, affecting to consider the Frate’s determination settled, and
20725: rising from his chair as he spoke. “With your permission, I will take
20726: my leave, father, not to trespass on your time when my errand is done;
20727: but as I may not be favoured with another interview, I venture to
20728: confide to you—what is not yet known to others, except to the
20729: magnificent Ten—that I contemplate resigning my secretaryship, and
20730: leaving Florence shortly. Am I presuming too much on your interest in
20731: stating what relates chiefly to myself?”
20732: 
20733: “Speak on, my son,” said the Frate; “I desire to know your prospects.”
20734: 
20735: “I find, then, that I have mistaken my real vocation in forsaking the
20736: career of pure letters, for which I was brought up. The politics of
20737: Florence, father, are worthy to occupy the greatest mind—to occupy
20738: yours—when a man is in a position to execute his own ideas; but when,
20739: like me, he can only hope to be the mere instrument of changing
20740: schemes, he requires to be animated by the minor attachments of a born
20741: Florentine: also, my wife’s unhappy alienation from a Florentine
20742: residence since the painful events of August naturally influences me. I
20743: wish to join her.”
20744: 
20745: Savonarola inclined his head approvingly.
20746: 
20747: “I intend, then, soon to leave Florence, to visit the chief courts of
20748: Europe, and to widen my acquaintance with the men of letters in the
20749: various universities. I shall go first to the court of Hungary, where
20750: scholars are eminently welcome; and I shall probably start in a week or
20751: ten days. I have not concealed from you, father, that I am no religious
20752: enthusiast; I have not my wife’s ardour; but religious enthusiasm, as I
20753: conceive, is not necessary in order to appreciate the grandeur and
20754: justice of your views concerning the government of nations and the
20755: Church. And if you condescend to intrust me with any commission that
20756: will further the relations you wish to establish, I shall feel
20757: honoured. May I now take my leave?”
20758: 
20759: “Stay, my son. When you depart from Florence I will send a letter to
20760: your wife, of whose spiritual welfare I would fain be assured, for she
20761: left me in anger. As for the letters to France, such as I have ready—”
20762: 
20763: Savonarola rose and turned to his desk as he spoke. He took from it a
20764: letter on which Tito could see, but not read, an address in the Frate’s
20765: own minute and exquisite handwriting, still to be seen covering the
20766: margins of his Bibles. He took a large sheet of paper, enclosed the
20767: letter, and sealed it.
20768: 
20769: “Pardon me, father,” said Tito, before Savonarola had time to speak,
20770: “unless it were your decided wish, I would rather not incur the
20771: responsibility of carrying away the letter. Messer Domenico Mazzinghi
20772: will doubtless return, or, if not, Fra Niccolò can convey it to me at
20773: the second hour of the evening, when I shall place the other despatches
20774: in the courier’s hands.”
20775: 
20776: “At present, my son,” said the Frate, waiving that point, “I wish you
20777: to address this packet to our ambassador in your own handwriting, which
20778: is preferable to my secretary’s.”
20779: 
20780: Tito sat down to write the address while the Frate stood by him with
20781: folded arms, the glow mounting in his cheek, and his lip at last
20782: quivering. Tito rose and was about to move away, when Savonarola said
20783: abruptly—“Take it, my son. There is no use in waiting. It does not
20784: please me that Fra Niccolò should have needless errands to the
20785: Palazzo.”
20786: 
20787: As Tito took the letter, Savonarola stood in suppressed excitement that
20788: forbade further speech. There seems to be a subtle emanation from
20789: passionate natures like his, making their mental states tell
20790: immediately on others; when they are absent-minded and inwardly excited
20791: there is silence in the air.
20792: 
20793: Tito made a deep reverence and went out with the letter under his
20794: mantle.
20795: 
20796: The letter was duly delivered to the courier and carried out of
20797: Florence. But before that happened another messenger, privately
20798: employed by Tito, had conveyed information in cipher, which was carried
20799: by a series of relays to armed agents of Ludovico Sforza, Duke of
20800: Milan, on the watch for the very purpose of intercepting despatches on
20801: the borders of the Milanese territory.
20802: 
20803: 
20804: 
20805: 
20806: CHAPTER LXV.
20807: The Trial by Fire.
20808: 
20809: 
20810: Little more than a week after, on the seventh of April, the great
20811: Piazza della Signoria presented a stranger spectacle even than the
20812: famous Bonfire of Vanities. And a greater multitude had assembled to
20813: see it than had ever before tried to find place for themselves in the
20814: wide Piazza, even on the day of San Giovanni.
20815: 
20816: It was near mid-day, and since the early morning there had been a
20817: gradual swarming of the people at every coign of vantage or
20818: disadvantage offered by the façades and roofs of the houses, and such
20819: spaces of the pavement as were free to the public. Men were seated on
20820: iron rods that made a sharp angle with the rising wall, were clutching
20821: slim pillars with arms and legs, were astride on the necks of the rough
20822: statuary that here and there surmounted the entrances of the grander
20823: houses, were finding a palm’s-breadth of seat on a bit of architrave,
20824: and a footing on the rough projections of the rustic stonework, while
20825: they clutched the strong iron rings or staples driven into the walls
20826: beside them.
20827: 
20828: For they were come to see a Miracle: cramped limbs and abraded flesh
20829: seemed slight inconveniences with that prospect close at hand. It is
20830: the ordinary lot of mankind to hear of miracles, and more or less to
20831: believe in them; but now the Florentines were going to see one. At the
20832: very least they would see half a miracle; for if the monk did not come
20833: whole out of the fire, they would see him enter it, and infer that he
20834: was burned in the middle.
20835: 
20836: There could be no reasonable doubt, it seemed, that the fire would be
20837: kindled, and that the monks would enter it. For there, before their
20838: eyes, was the long platform, eight feet broad, and twenty yards long,
20839: with a grove of fuel heaped up terribly, great branches of dry oak as a
20840: foundation, crackling thorns above, and well-anointed tow and rags,
20841: known to make fine flames in Florentine illuminations. The platform
20842: began at the corner of the marble terrace in front of the Old Palace,
20843: close to Marzocco, the stone lion, whose aged visage looked frowningly
20844: along the grove of fuel that stretched obliquely across the Piazza.
20845: 
20846: Besides that, there were three large bodies of armed men: five hundred
20847: hired soldiers of the Signoria stationed before the palace; five
20848: hundred Compagnacci under Dolfo Spini, far-off on the opposite side of
20849: the Piazza; and three hundred armed citizens of another sort, under
20850: Marco Salviati, Savonarola’s friend, in front of Orgagna’s Loggia,
20851: where the Franciscans and Dominicans were to be placed with their
20852: champions.
20853: 
20854: Here had been much expense of money and labour, and high dignities were
20855: concerned. There could be no reasonable doubt that something great was
20856: about to happen; and it would certainly be a great thing if the two
20857: monks were simply burned, for in that case too God would have spoken,
20858: and said very plainly that Fra Girolamo was not His prophet.
20859: 
20860: And there was not much longer to wait, for it was now near mid-day.
20861: Half the monks were already at their post, and that half of the Loggia
20862: that lies towards the Palace was already filled with grey mantles; but
20863: the other half, divided off by boards, was still empty of everything
20864: except a small altar. The Franciscans had entered and taken their
20865: places in silence. But now, at the other side of the Piazza was heard
20866: loud chanting from two hundred voices, and there was general
20867: satisfaction, if not in the chanting, at least in the evidence that the
20868: Dominicans were come. That loud chanting repetition of the prayer, “Let
20869: God arise, and let His enemies be scattered,” was unpleasantly
20870: suggestive to some impartial ears of a desire to vaunt confidence and
20871: excite dismay; and so was the flame-coloured velvet cope in which Fra
20872: Domenico was arrayed as he headed the procession, cross in hand, his
20873: simple mind really exalted with faith, and with the genuine intention
20874: to enter the flames for the glory of God and Fra Girolamo. Behind him
20875: came Savonarola in the white vestment of a priest, carrying in his
20876: hands a vessel containing the consecrated Host. He, too, was chanting
20877: loudly; he, too, looked firm and confident, and as all eyes were turned
20878: eagerly on him, either in anxiety, curiosity, or malignity, from the
20879: moment when he entered the Piazza till he mounted the steps of the
20880: Loggia and deposited the Sacrament on the altar, there was an
20881: intensifying flash and energy in his countenance responding to that
20882: scrutiny.
20883: 
20884: We are so made, almost all of us, that the false seeming which we have
20885: thought of with painful shrinking when beforehand in our solitude it
20886: has urged itself on us as a necessity, will possess our muscles and
20887: move our lips as if nothing but that were easy when once we have come
20888: under the stimulus of expectant eyes and ears. And the strength of that
20889: stimulus to Savonarola can hardly be measured by the experience of
20890: ordinary lives. Perhaps no man has ever had a mighty influence over his
20891: fellows without having the innate need to dominate, and this need
20892: usually becomes the more imperious in proportion as the complications
20893: of life make Self inseparable from a purpose which is not selfish. In
20894: this way it came to pass that on the day of the Trial by Fire, the
20895: doubleness which is the pressing temptation in every public career,
20896: whether of priest, orator, or statesman, was more strongly defined in
20897: Savonarola’s consciousness as the acting of a part, than at any other
20898: period in his life. He was struggling not against impending martyrdom,
20899: but against impending ruin.
20900: 
20901: Therefore he looked and acted as if he were thoroughly confident, when
20902: all the while foreboding was pressing with leaden weight on his heart,
20903: not only because of the probable issues of this trial, but because of
20904: another event already past—an event which was spreading a sunny
20905: satisfaction through the mind of a man who was looking down at the
20906: passion-worn prophet from a window of the Old Palace. It was a common
20907: turning-point towards which those widely-sundered lives had been
20908: converging, that two evenings ago the news had come that the Florentine
20909: courier of the Ten had been arrested and robbed of all his despatches,
20910: so that Savonarola’s letter was already in the hands of the Duke of
20911: Milan, and would soon be in the hands of the Pope, not only heightening
20912: rage, but giving a new justification to extreme measures. There was no
20913: malignity in Tito Melema’s satisfaction: it was the mild
20914: self-gratulation of a man who has won a game that has employed
20915: hypothetic skill, not a game that has stirred the muscles and heated
20916: the blood. Of course that bundle of desires and contrivances called
20917: human nature, when moulded into the form of a plain-featured Frate
20918: Predicatore, more or less of an impostor, could not be a pathetic
20919: object to a brilliant-minded scholar who understood everything. Yet
20920: this tonsured Girolamo with the high nose and large under lip was an
20921: immensely clever Frate, mixing with his absurd superstitions or
20922: fabrications very remarkable notions about government: no babbler, but
20923: a man who could keep his secrets. Tito had no more spite against him
20924: than against Saint Dominic. On the contrary, Fra Girolamo’s existence
20925: had been highly convenient to Tito Melema, furnishing him with that
20926: round of the ladder from which he was about to leap on to a new and
20927: smooth footing very much to his heart’s content. And everything now was
20928: in forward preparation for that leap: let one more sun rise and set,
20929: and Tito hoped to quit Florence. He had been so industrious that he
20930: felt at full leisure to amuse himself with to-day’s comedy, which the
20931: thick-headed Dolfo Spini could never have brought about but for him.
20932: 
20933: Not yet did the loud chanting cease, but rather swelled to a deafening
20934: roar, being taken up in all parts of the Piazza by the Piagnoni, who
20935: carried their little red crosses as a badge, and, most of them, chanted
20936: the prayer for the confusion of God’s enemies with the expectation of
20937: an answer to be given through the medium of a more signal personage
20938: than Fra Domenico. This good Frate in his flame-coloured cope was now
20939: kneeling before the little altar on which the Sacrament was deposited,
20940: awaiting his summons.
20941: 
20942: On the Franciscan side of the Loggia there was no chanting and no
20943: flame-colour: only silence and greyness. But there was this
20944: counterbalancing difference, that the Franciscans had two champions: a
20945: certain Fra Giuliano was to pair with Fra Domenico, while the original
20946: champion, Fra Francesco, confined his challenge to Savonarola.
20947: 
20948: “Surely,” thought the men perched uneasily on the rods and pillars,
20949: “all must be ready now. This chanting might stop, and we should see
20950: better when the Frati are moving towards the platform.”
20951: 
20952: But the Frati were not to be seen moving yet. Pale Franciscan faces
20953: were looking uneasily over the boarding at that flame-coloured cope. It
20954: had an evil look and might be enchanted, so that a false miracle would
20955: be wrought by magic. Your monk may come whole out of the fire, and yet
20956: it may be the work of the devil.
20957: 
20958: And now there was passing to and fro between the Loggia and the marble
20959: terrace of the Palazzo, and the roar of chanting became a little
20960: quieter, for every one at a distance was beginning to watch more
20961: eagerly. But it soon appeared that the new movement was not a
20962: beginning, but an obstacle to beginning. The dignified Florentines
20963: appointed to preside over this affair as moderators on each side, went
20964: in and out of the Palace, and there was much debate with the
20965: Franciscans. But at last it was clear that Fra Domenico, conspicuous in
20966: his flame-colour, was being fetched towards the Palace. Probably the
20967: fire had already been kindled—it was difficult to see at a distance—and
20968: the miracle was going to begin.
20969: 
20970: Not at all. The flame-coloured cope disappeared within the Palace; then
20971: another Dominican was fetched away; and for a long while everything
20972: went on as before—the tiresome chanting, which was not miraculous, and
20973: Fra Girolamo in his white vestment standing just in the same place. But
20974: at last something happened: Fra Domenico was seen coming out of the
20975: Palace again, and returning to his brethren. He had changed all his
20976: clothes with a brother monk, but he was guarded on each flank by a
20977: Franciscan, lest coming into the vicinity of Savonarola he should be
20978: enchanted again.
20979: 
20980: “Ah, then,” thought the distant spectators, a little less conscious of
20981: cramped limbs and hunger, “Fra Domenico is not going to enter the fire.
20982: It is Fra Girolamo who offers himself after all. We shall see him move
20983: presently, and if he comes out of the flames we shall have a fine view
20984: of him!”
20985: 
20986: But Fra Girolamo did not move, except with the ordinary action
20987: accompanying speech. The speech was bold and firm, perhaps somewhat
20988: ironically remonstrant, like that of Elijah to the priests of Baal,
20989: demanding the cessation of these trivial delays. But speech is the most
20990: irritating kind of argument for those who are out of hearing, cramped
20991: in the limbs, and empty in the stomach. And what need was there for
20992: speech? If the miracle did not begin, it could be no one’s fault but
20993: Fra Girolamo’s, who might put an end to all difficulties by offering
20994: himself now the fire was ready, as he had been forward enough to do
20995: when there was no fuel in sight.
20996: 
20997: More movement to and fro, more discussion; and the afternoon seemed to
20998: be slipping away all the faster because the clouds had gathered, and
20999: changed the light on everything, and sent a chill through the
21000: spectators, hungry in mind and body.
21001: 
21002: _Now_ it was the crucifix which Fra Domenico wanted to carry into the
21003: fire and must not be allowed to profane in that manner. After some
21004: little resistance Savonarola gave way to this objection, and thus had
21005: the advantage of making one more concession; but he immediately placed
21006: in Fra Domenico’s hands the vessel containing the consecrated Host. The
21007: idea that the presence of the sacred Mystery might in the worst
21008: extremity avert the ordinary effects of fire hovered in his mind as a
21009: possibility; but the issue on which he counted was of a more positive
21010: kind. In taking up the Host he said quietly, as if he were only doing
21011: what had been presupposed from the first—
21012: 
21013: “Since they are not willing that you should enter with the crucifix, my
21014: brother, enter simply with the Sacrament.”
21015: 
21016: New horror in the Franciscans; new firmness in Savonarola. “It was
21017: impious presumption to carry the Sacrament into the fire: if it were
21018: burned the scandal would be great in the minds of the weak and
21019: ignorant.”
21020: 
21021: “Not at all: even if it were burned, the Accidents only would be
21022: consumed, the Substance would remain.” Here was a question that might
21023: be argued till set of sun and remain as elastic as ever; and no one
21024: could propose settling it by proceeding to the trial, since it was
21025: essentially a preliminary question. It was only necessary that both
21026: sides should remain firm—that the Franciscans should persist in not
21027: permitting the Host to be carried into the fire, and that Fra Domenico
21028: should persist in refusing to enter without it.
21029: 
21030: Meanwhile the clouds were getting darker, the air chiller. Even the
21031: chanting was missed now it had given way to inaudible argument; and the
21032: confused sounds of talk from all points of the Piazza, showing that
21033: expectation was everywhere relaxing, contributed to the irritating
21034: presentiment that nothing decisive would be done. Here and there a
21035: dropping shout was heard; then, more frequent shouts in a rising scale
21036: of scorn.
21037: 
21038: “Light the fire and drive them in!”
21039: 
21040: “Let us have a smell of roast—we want our dinner!”
21041: 
21042: “Come Prophet, let us know whether anything is to happen before the
21043: twenty-four hours are over!”
21044: 
21045: “Yes, yes, what’s your last vision?”
21046: 
21047: “Oh, he’s got a dozen in his inside; they’re the small change for a
21048: miracle!”
21049: 
21050: “Ola, Frate, where are you? Never mind wasting the fuel!”
21051: 
21052: Still the same movement to and fro between the Loggia and the Palace;
21053: still the same debate, slow and unintelligible to the multitude as the
21054: colloquies of insects that touch antennas to no other apparent effect
21055: than that of going and coming. But an interpretation was not long
21056: wanting to unheard debates in which Fra Girolamo was constantly a
21057: speaker: it was he who was hindering the trial; everybody was appealing
21058: to him now, and he was hanging back.
21059: 
21060: Soon the shouts ceased to be distinguishable, and were lost in an
21061: uproar not simply of voices, but of clashing metal and trampling feet.
21062: The suggestions of the irritated people had stimulated old impulses in
21063: Dolfo Spini and his band of Compagnacci; it seemed an opportunity not
21064: to be lost for putting an end to Florentine difficulties by getting
21065: possession of the arch-hypocrite’s person; and there was a vigorous
21066: rush of the armed men towards the Loggia, thrusting the people aside,
21067: or driving them on to the file of soldiery stationed in front of the
21068: Palace. At this movement, everything was suspended both with monks and
21069: embarrassed magistrates except the palpitating watch to see what would
21070: come of the struggle.
21071: 
21072: But the Loggia was well guarded by the band under the brave Salviati;
21073: the soldiers of the Signoria assisted in the repulse; and the trampling
21074: and rushing were all backward again towards the Tetto de’ Pisani, when
21075: the blackness of the heavens seemed to intensify in this moment of
21076: utter confusion; and the rain, which had already been felt in scattered
21077: drops, began to fall with rapidly growing violence, wetting the fuel,
21078: and running in streams off the platform, wetting the weary hungry
21079: people to the skin, and driving every man’s disgust and rage inwards to
21080: ferment there in the damp darkness.
21081: 
21082: Everybody knew now that the Trial by Fire was not to happen. The
21083: Signoria was doubtless glad of the rain, as an obvious reason, better
21084: than any pretext, for declaring that both parties might go home. It was
21085: the issue which Savonarola had expected and desired; yet it would be an
21086: ill description of what he felt to say that he was glad. As that rain
21087: fell, and plashed on the edge of the Loggia, and sent spray over the
21088: altar and all garments and faces, the Frate knew that the demand for
21089: him to enter the fire was at an end. But he knew too, with a certainty
21090: as irresistible as the damp chill that had taken possession of his
21091: frame, that the design of his enemies was fulfilled, and that his
21092: honour was not saved. He knew that he should have to make his way to
21093: San Marco again through the enraged crowd, and that the hearts of many
21094: friends who would once have defended him with their lives would now be
21095: turned against him.
21096: 
21097: When the rain had ceased he asked for a guard from the Signoria, and it
21098: was given him. Had he said that he was willing to die for the work of
21099: his life? Yes, and he had not spoken falsely. But to die in
21100: dishonour—held up to scorn as a hypocrite and a false prophet? “O God!
21101: _that_ is not martyrdom! It is the blotting out of a life that has been
21102: a protest against wrong. Let me die because of the worth that is in me,
21103: not because of my weakness.”
21104: 
21105: The rain had ceased, and the light from the breaking clouds fell on
21106: Savonarola as he left the Loggia in the midst of his guard, walking as
21107: he had come, with the Sacrament in his hand. But there seemed no glory
21108: in the light that fell on him now, no smile of heaven: it was only that
21109: light which shines on, patiently and impartially, justifying or
21110: condemning by simply showing all things in the slow history of their
21111: ripening. He heard no blessing, no tones of pity, but only taunts and
21112: threats. He knew this was a foretaste of coming bitterness; yet his
21113: courage mounted under all moral attack, and he showed no sign of
21114: dismay.
21115: 
21116: “Well parried, Frate!” said Tito, as Savonarola descended the steps of
21117: the Loggia. “But I fear your career at Florence is ended. What say you,
21118: my Niccolò?”
21119: 
21120: “It is a pity his falsehoods were not all of a wise sort,” said
21121: Macchiavelli, with a melancholy shrug. “With the times so much on his
21122: side as they are about Church affairs, he might have done something
21123: great.”
21124: 
21125: 
21126: 
21127: 
21128: CHAPTER LXVI.
21129: A Masque of the Furies.
21130: 
21131: 
21132: The next day was Palm Sunday, or Olive Sunday, as it was chiefly called
21133: in the olive-growing Valdarno; and the morning sun shone with a more
21134: delicious clearness for the yesterday’s rain. Once more Savonarola
21135: mounted the pulpit in San Marco, and saw a flock around him whose faith
21136: in him was still unshaken; and this morning in calm and sad sincerity
21137: he declared himself ready to die: in front of all visions he saw his
21138: own doom. Once more he uttered the benediction, and saw the faces of
21139: men and women lifted towards him in venerating love. Then he descended
21140: the steps of the pulpit and turned away from that sight for ever.
21141: 
21142: For before the sun had set Florence was in an uproar. The passions
21143: which had been roused the day before had been smouldering through that
21144: quiet morning, and had now burst out again with a fury not unassisted
21145: by design, and not without official connivance. The uproar had begun at
21146: the Duomo in an attempt of some Compagnacci to hinder the evening
21147: sermon, which the Piagnoni had assembled to hear. But no sooner had
21148: men’s blood mounted and the disturbances had become an affray than the
21149: cry arose, “To San Marco! the fire to San Marco!”
21150: 
21151: And long before the daylight had died, both the church and convent were
21152: being besieged by an enraged and continually increasing multitude. Not
21153: without resistance. For the monks, long conscious of growing hostility
21154: without, had arms within their walls, and some of them fought as
21155: vigorously in their long white tunics as if they had been Knights
21156: Templars. Even the command of Savonarola could not prevail against the
21157: impulse to self-defence in arms that were still muscular under the
21158: Dominican serge. There were laymen too who had not chosen to depart,
21159: and some of them fought fiercely: there was firing from the high altar
21160: close by the great crucifix, there was pouring of stones and hot embers
21161: from the convent roof, there was close fighting with swords in the
21162: cloisters. Notwithstanding the force of the assailants, the attack
21163: lasted till deep night.
21164: 
21165: The demonstrations of the Government had all been against the convent;
21166: early in the attack guards had been sent for, not to disperse the
21167: assailants, but to command all within the convent to lay down their
21168: arms, all laymen to depart from it, and Savonarola himself to quit the
21169: Florentine territory within twelve hours. Had Savonarola quitted the
21170: convent then, he could hardly have escaped being torn to pieces; he was
21171: willing to go, but his friends hindered him. It was felt to be a great
21172: risk even for some laymen of high name to depart by the garden wall,
21173: but among those who had chosen to do so was Francesco Valori, who hoped
21174: to raise rescue from without.
21175: 
21176: And now when it was deep night—when the struggle could hardly have
21177: lasted much longer, and the Compagnacci might soon have carried their
21178: swords into the library, where Savonarola was praying with the Brethren
21179: who had either not taken up arms or had laid them down at his
21180: command—there came a second body of guards, commissioned by the
21181: Signoria to demand the persons of Fra Girolamo and his two coadjutors,
21182: Fra Domenico and Fra Salvestro.
21183: 
21184: Loud was the roar of triumphant hate when the light of lanterns showed
21185: the Frate issuing from the door of the convent with a guard who
21186: promised him no other safety than that of the prison. The struggle now
21187: was, who should get first in the stream that rushed up the narrow
21188: street to see the Prophet carried back in ignominy to the Piazza where
21189: he had braved it yesterday—who should be in the best place for reaching
21190: his ear with insult, nay, if possible, for smiting him and kicking him.
21191: This was not difficult for some of the armed Compagnacci who were not
21192: prevented from mixing themselves with the guards.
21193: 
21194: When Savonarola felt himself dragged and pushed along in the midst of
21195: that hooting multitude; when lanterns were lifted to show him deriding
21196: faces; when he felt himself spit upon, smitten and kicked with grossest
21197: words of insult, it seemed to him that the worst bitterness of life was
21198: past. If men judged him guilty, and were bent on having his blood, it
21199: was only death that awaited him. But the worst drop of bitterness can
21200: never be wrung on to our lips from without: the lowest depth of
21201: resignation is not to be found in martyrdom; it is only to be found
21202: when we have covered our heads in silence and felt, “I am not worthy to
21203: be a martyr; the Truth shall prosper, but not by me.”
21204: 
21205: But that brief imperfect triumph of insulting the Frate, who had soon
21206: disappeared under the doorway of the Old Palace, was only like the
21207: taste of blood to the tiger. Were there not the houses of the
21208: hypocrite’s friends to be sacked? Already one-half of the armed
21209: multitude, too much in the rear to share greatly in the siege of the
21210: convent, had been employed in the more profitable work of attacking
21211: rich houses, not with planless desire for plunder, but with that
21212: discriminating selection of such as belonged to chief Piagnoni, which
21213: showed that the riot was under guidance, and that the rabble with clubs
21214: and staves was well officered by sword-girt Compagnacci. Was there
21215: not—next criminal after the Frate—the ambitious Francesco Valori,
21216: suspected of wanting with the Frate’s help to make himself a Doge or
21217: Gonfaloniere for life? And the grey-haired man who, eight months ago,
21218: had lifted his arm and his voice in such ferocious demand for justice
21219: on five of his fellow-citizens, only escaped from San Marco to
21220: experience what _others_ called justice—to see his house surrounded by
21221: an angry, greedy multitude, to see his wife shot dead with an arrow,
21222: and to be himself murdered, as he was on his way to answer a summons to
21223: the Palazzo, by the swords of men named Ridolfi and Tornabuoni.
21224: 
21225: In this way that Masque of the Furies, called Riot, was played on in
21226: Florence through the hours of night and early morning.
21227: 
21228: But the chief director was not visible: he had his reasons for issuing
21229: his orders from a private retreat, being of rather too high a name to
21230: let his red feather be seen waving amongst all the work that was to be
21231: done before the dawn. The retreat was the same house and the same room
21232: in a quiet street between Santa Croce and San Marco, where we have seen
21233: Tito paying a secret visit to Dolfo Spini. Here the Captain of the
21234: Compagnacci sat through this memorable night, receiving visitors who
21235: came and went, and went and came, some of them in the guise of armed
21236: Compagnacci, others dressed obscurely and without visible arms. There
21237: was abundant wine on the table, with drinking-cups for chance comers
21238: and though Spini was on his guard against excessive drinking, he took
21239: enough from time to time to heighten the excitement produced by the
21240: news that was being brought to him continually.
21241: 
21242: Among the obscurely-dressed visitors Ser Ceccone was one of the most
21243: frequent, and as the hours advanced towards the morning twilight he had
21244: remained as Spini’s constant companion, together with Francesco Cei,
21245: who was then in rather careless hiding in Florence, expecting to have
21246: his banishment revoked when the Frate’s fall had been accomplished.
21247: 
21248: The tapers had burnt themselves into low shapeless masses, and holes in
21249: the shutters were just marked by a sombre outward light, when Spini,
21250: who had started from his seat and walked up and down with an angry
21251: flush on his face at some talk that had been going forward with those
21252: two unmilitary companions, burst out—
21253: 
21254: “The devil spit him! he shall pay for it, though. Ha, ha! the claws
21255: shall be down on him when he little thinks of them. So _he_ was to be
21256: the great man after all! He’s been pretending to chuck everything
21257: towards my cap, as if I were a blind beggarman, and all the while he’s
21258: been winking and filling his own scarsella. I should like to hang skins
21259: about him and set my hounds on him! And he’s got that fine ruby of
21260: mine, I was fool enough to give him yesterday. Malediction! And he was
21261: laughing at me in his sleeve two years ago, and spoiling the best plan
21262: that ever was laid. I was a fool for trusting myself with a rascal who
21263: had long-twisted contrivances that nobody could see to the end of but
21264: himself.”
21265: 
21266: “A Greek, too, who dropped into Florence with gems packed about him,”
21267: said Francesco Cei, who had a slight smile of amusement on his face at
21268: Spini’s fuming. “You did _not_ choose your confidant very wisely, my
21269: Dolfo.”
21270: 
21271: “He’s a cursed deal cleverer than you, Francesco, and handsomer too,”
21272: said Spini, turning on his associate with a general desire to worry
21273: anything that presented itself.
21274: 
21275: “I humbly conceive,” said Ser Ceccone, “that Messer Francesco’s poetic
21276: genius will outweigh—”
21277: 
21278: “Yes, yes, rub your hands! I hate that notary’s trick of yours,”
21279: interrupted Spini, whose patronage consisted largely in this sort of
21280: frankness. “But there comes Taddeo, or somebody: now’s the time! What
21281: news, eh?” he went on, as two Compagnacci entered with heated looks.
21282: 
21283: “Bad!” said one. “The people have made up their minds they were going
21284: to have the sacking of Soderini’s house, and now they have been balked
21285: we shall have them turning on us, if we don’t take care. I suspect
21286: there are some Mediceans buzzing about among them, and we may see them
21287: attacking your palace over the bridge before long, unless we can find a
21288: bait for them another way.”
21289: 
21290: “I have it!” said Spini, and seizing Taddeo by the belt he drew him
21291: aside to give him directions, while the other went on telling Cei how
21292: the Signoria had interfered about Soderini’s house.
21293: 
21294: “Ecco!” exclaimed Spini, presently, giving Taddeo a slight push towards
21295: the door. “Go, and make quick work.”
21296: 
21297: 
21298: 
21299: 
21300: CHAPTER LXVII.
21301: Waiting by the River.
21302: 
21303: 
21304: About the time when the two Compagnacci went on their errand, there was
21305: another man who, on the opposite side of the Arno, was also going out
21306: into the chill grey twilight. His errand, apparently, could have no
21307: relation to theirs; he was making his way to the brink of the river at
21308: a spot which, though within the city walls, was overlooked by no
21309: dwellings, and which only seemed the more shrouded and lonely for the
21310: warehouses and granaries which at some little distance backward turned
21311: their shoulders to the river. There was a sloping width of long grass
21312: and rushes made all the more dank by broad gutters which here and there
21313: emptied themselves into the Arno.
21314: 
21315: The gutters and the loneliness were the attraction that drew this man
21316: to come and sit down among the grass, and bend over the waters that ran
21317: swiftly in the channelled slope at his side. For he had once had a
21318: large piece of bread brought to him by one of those friendly runlets,
21319: and more than once a raw carrot and apple-parings. It was worth while
21320: to wait for such chances in a place where there was no one to see, and
21321: often in his restless wakefulness he came to watch here before
21322: daybreak; it might save him for one day the need of that silent begging
21323: which consisted in sitting on a church-step by the wayside out beyond
21324: the Porta San Frediano.
21325: 
21326: For Baldassarre hated begging so much that he would perhaps have chosen
21327: to die rather than make even that silent appeal, but for one reason
21328: that made him desire to live. It was no longer a hope; it was only that
21329: possibility which clings to every idea that has taken complete
21330: possession of the mind: the sort of possibility that makes a woman
21331: watch on a headland for the ship which held something dear, though all
21332: her neighbours are certain that the ship was a wreck long years ago.
21333: After he had come out of the convent hospital, where the monks of San
21334: Miniato had taken care of him as long as he was helpless; after he had
21335: watched in vain for the Wife who was to help him, and had begun to
21336: think that she was dead of the pestilence that seemed to fill all the
21337: space since the night he parted from her, he had been unable to
21338: conceive any way in which sacred vengeance could satisfy itself through
21339: his arm. His knife was gone, and he was too feeble in body to win
21340: another by work, too feeble in mind, even if he had had the knife, to
21341: contrive that it should serve its one purpose. He was a shattered,
21342: bewildered, lonely old man; yet he desired to live: _he_ waited for
21343: something of which he had no distinct vision—something dim,
21344: formless—that startled him, and made strong pulsations within him, like
21345: that unknown thing which we look for when we start from sleep, though
21346: no voice or touch has waked us. Baldassarre desired to live; and
21347: therefore he crept out in the grey light, and seated himself in the
21348: long grass, and watched the waters that had a faint promise in them.
21349: 
21350: Meanwhile the Compagnacci were busy at their work. The formidable bands
21351: of armed men, left to do their will with very little interference from
21352: an embarrassed if not conniving Signoria, had parted into two masses,
21353: but both were soon making their way by different roads towards the
21354: Arno. The smaller mass was making for the Ponte Rubaconte, the larger
21355: for the Ponte Vecchio; but in both the same words had passed from mouth
21356: to mouth as a signal, and almost every man of the multitude knew that
21357: he was going to the Via de’ Bardi to sack a house there. If he knew no
21358: other reason, could he demand a better?
21359: 
21360: The armed Compagnacci knew something more, for a brief word of command
21361: flies quickly, and the leaders of the two streams of rabble had a
21362: perfect understanding that they would meet before a certain house a
21363: little towards the eastern end of the Via de’ Bardi, where the master
21364: would probably be in bed, and be surprised in his morning sleep.
21365: 
21366: But the master of that house was neither sleeping nor in bed; he had
21367: not been in bed that night. For Tito’s anxiety to quit Florence had
21368: been stimulated by the events of the previous day: investigations would
21369: follow in which appeals might be made to him delaying his departure:
21370: and in all delay he had an uneasy sense that there was danger.
21371: Falsehood had prospered and waxed strong; but it had nourished the twin
21372: life, Fear. He no longer wore his armour, he was no longer afraid of
21373: Baldassarre; but from the corpse of that dead fear a spirit had
21374: risen—the undying _habit_ of fear. He felt he should not be safe till
21375: he was out of this fierce, turbid Florence; and now he was ready to go.
21376: Maso was to deliver up his house to the new tenant; his horses and
21377: mules were awaiting him in San Gallo; Tessa and the children had been
21378: lodged for the night in the Borgo outside the gate, and would be
21379: dressed in readiness to mount the mules and join him. He descended the
21380: stone steps into the courtyard, he passed through the great doorway,
21381: not the same Tito, but nearly as brilliant as on the day when he had
21382: first entered that house and made the mistake of falling in love with
21383: Romola. The mistake was remedied now: the old life was cast off, and
21384: was soon to be far behind him.
21385: 
21386: He turned with rapid steps towards the Piazza dei Mozzi, intending to
21387: pass over the Ponte Rubaconte; but as he went along certain sounds came
21388: upon his ears that made him turn round and walk yet more quickly in the
21389: opposite direction. Was the mob coming into Oltrarno? It was a
21390: vexation, for he would have preferred the more private road. He must
21391: now go by the Ponte Vecchio; and unpleasant sensations made him draw
21392: his mantle close round him, and walk at his utmost speed. There was no
21393: one to see him in that grey twilight. But before he reached the end of
21394: the Via de’ Bardi, like sounds fell on his ear again, and this time
21395: they were much louder and nearer. Could he have been deceived before?
21396: The mob must be coming over the Ponte Vecchio. Again he turned, from an
21397: impulse of fear that was stronger than reflection; but it was only to
21398: be assured that the mob was actually entering the street from the
21399: opposite end. He chose not to go back to his house: after all they
21400: would not attack _him_. Still, he had some valuables about him; and all
21401: things except reason and order are possible with a mob. But necessity
21402: does the work of courage. He went on towards the Ponte Vecchio, the
21403: rush and the trampling and the confused voices getting so loud before
21404: him that he had ceased to hear them behind.
21405: 
21406: For he had reached the end of the street, and the crowd pouring from
21407: the bridge met him at the turning and hemmed in his way. He had not
21408: time to wonder at a sudden shout before he felt himself surrounded,
21409: not, in the first instance, by an unarmed rabble, but by armed
21410: Compagnacci; the next sensation was that his cap fell off, and that he
21411: was thrust violently forward amongst the rabble, along the narrow
21412: passage of the bridge. Then he distinguished the shouts, “Piagnone!
21413: Medicean! Piagnone! Throw him over the bridge!”
21414: 
21415: His mantle was being torn off him with strong pulls that would have
21416: throttled him if the fibula had not given way. Then his scarsella was
21417: snatched at; but all the while he was being hustled and dragged; and
21418: the snatch failed—his scarsella still hung at his side. Shouting,
21419: yelling, half motiveless execration rang stunningly in his ears,
21420: spreading even amongst those who had not yet seen him, and only knew
21421: there was a man to be reviled. Tito’s horrible dread was that he should
21422: be struck down or trampled on before he reached the open arches that
21423: surmount the centre of the bridge. There was one hope for him, that
21424: they might throw him over before they had wounded him or beaten the
21425: strength out of him; and his whole soul was absorbed in that one hope
21426: and its obverse terror.
21427: 
21428: Yes—they _were_ at the arches. In that moment Tito, with bloodless face
21429: and eyes dilated, had one of the self-preserving inspirations that come
21430: in extremity. With a sudden desperate effort he mastered the clasp of
21431: his belt, and flung belt and scarsella forward towards a yard of clear
21432: space against the parapet, crying in a ringing voice—
21433: 
21434: “There are diamonds! there is gold!”
21435: 
21436: In the instant the hold on him was relaxed, and there was a rush
21437: towards the scarsella. He threw himself on the parapet with a desperate
21438: leap, and the next moment plunged—plunged with a great plash into the
21439: dark river far below.
21440: 
21441: It was his chance of salvation; and it was a good chance. His life had
21442: been saved once before by his fine swimming, and as he rose to the
21443: surface again after his long dive he had a sense of deliverance. He
21444: struck out with all the energy of his strong prime, and the current
21445: helped him. If he could only swim beyond the Ponte alla Carrara he
21446: might land in a remote part of the city, and even yet reach San Gallo.
21447: Life was still before him. And the idiot mob, shouting and bellowing on
21448: the bridge there, would think he was drowned.
21449: 
21450: They did think so. Peering over the parapet along the dark stream, they
21451: could not see afar off the moving blackness of the floating hair, and
21452: the velvet tunic-sleeves.
21453: 
21454: It was only from the other way that a pale olive face could be seen
21455: looking white above the dark water: a face not easy even for the
21456: indifferent to forget, with its square forehead, the long low arch of
21457: the eyebrows, and the long lustrous agate-like eyes. Onward the face
21458: went on the dark current, with inflated quivering nostrils, with the
21459: blue veins distended on the temples. One bridge was passed—the bridge
21460: of Santa Trinita. Should he risk landing now rather than trust to his
21461: strength? No. He heard, or fancied he heard, yells and cries pursuing
21462: him. Terror pressed him most from the side of his fellow-men: he was
21463: less afraid of indefinite chances, and he swam on, panting and
21464: straining. He was not so fresh as he would have been if he had passed
21465: the night in sleep.
21466: 
21467: Yet the next bridge—the last bridge—was passed. He was conscious of it;
21468: but in the tumult of his blood, he could only feel vaguely that he was
21469: safe and might land. But where? The current was having its way with
21470: him: he hardly knew where he was: exhaustion was bringing on the dreamy
21471: state that precedes unconsciousness.
21472: 
21473: But now there were eyes that discerned him—aged eyes, strong for the
21474: distance. Baldassarre, looking up blankly from the search in the runlet
21475: that brought him nothing, had seen a white object coming along the
21476: broader stream. Could that be any fortunate chance for _him_? He looked
21477: and looked till the object gathered form: then he leaned forward with a
21478: start as he sat among the rank green stems, and his eyes seemed to be
21479: filled with a new light. Yet he only watched—motionless. Something was
21480: being brought to him.
21481: 
21482: The next instant a man’s body was cast violently on the grass two yards
21483: from him, and he started forward like a panther, clutching the velvet
21484: tunic as he fell forward on the body and flashed a look in the man’s
21485: face.
21486: 
21487: Dead—was he dead? The eyes were rigid. But no, it could not be—Justice
21488: had brought him. Men looked dead sometimes, and yet the life came back
21489: into them. Baldassarre did not feel feeble in that moment. He knew just
21490: what he could do. He got his large fingers within the neck of the tunic
21491: and held them there, kneeling on one knee beside the body and watching
21492: the face. There was a fierce hope in his heart, but it was mixed with
21493: trembling. In his eyes there was only fierceness: all the slow-burning
21494: remnant of life within him seemed to have leaped into flame.
21495: 
21496: Rigid—rigid still. Those eyes with the half-fallen lids were locked
21497: against vengeance. _Could_ it be that he was dead? There was nothing to
21498: measure the time: it seemed long enough for hope to freeze into
21499: despair.
21500: 
21501: Surely at last the eyelids were quivering: the eyes were no longer
21502: rigid. There was a vibrating light in them; they opened wide.
21503: 
21504: “Ah, yes! You see me—you know me!”
21505: 
21506: Tito knew him; but he did not know whether it was life or death that
21507: had brought him into the presence of his injured father. It might be
21508: death—and death might mean this chill gloom with the face of the
21509: hideous past hanging over him for ever.
21510: 
21511: But now Baldassarre’s only dread was, lest the young limbs should
21512: escape him. He pressed his knuckles against the round throat, and knelt
21513: upon the chest with all the force of his aged frame. Let death come
21514: now!
21515: 
21516: Again he kept his watch on the face. And when the eyes were rigid
21517: again, he dared not trust them. He would never lose his hold till some
21518: one came and found them. Justice would send some witness, and then he,
21519: Baldassarre, would declare that he had killed this traitor, to whom he
21520: had once been a father. They would perhaps believe him now, and then he
21521: would be content with the struggle of justice on earth—then he would
21522: desire to die with his hold on this body, and follow the traitor to
21523: hell that he might clutch him there.
21524: 
21525: And so he knelt, and so he pressed his knuckles against the round
21526: throat, without trusting to the seeming death, till the light got
21527: strong and he could kneel no longer. Then he sat on the body, still
21528: clutching the neck of the tunic. But the hours went on, and no witness
21529: came. No eyes descried afar off the two human bodies among the tall
21530: grass by the riverside. Florence was busy with greater affairs, and the
21531: preparation of a deeper tragedy.
21532: 
21533: Not long after those two bodies were lying in the grass, Savonarola was
21534: being tortured, and crying out in his agony, “I will confess!”
21535: 
21536: It was not until the sun was westward that a waggon drawn by a mild
21537: grey ox came to the edge of the grassy margin, and as the man who led
21538: it was leaning to gather up the round stones that lay heaped in
21539: readiness to be carried away, he detected some startling object in the
21540: grass. The aged man had fallen forward, and his dead clutch was on the
21541: garment of the other. It was not possible to separate them: nay, it was
21542: better to put them into the waggon and carry them as they were into the
21543: great Piazza, that notice might be given to the Eight.
21544: 
21545: As the waggon entered the frequented streets there was a growing crowd
21546: escorting it with its strange burden. No one knew the bodies for a long
21547: while, for the aged face had fallen forward, half hiding the younger.
21548: But before they had been moved out of sight, they had been recognised.
21549: 
21550: “I know that old man,” Piero di Cosimo had testified. “I painted his
21551: likeness once. He is the prisoner who clutched Melema on the steps of
21552: the Duomo.”
21553: 
21554: “He is perhaps the same old man who appeared at supper in my gardens,”
21555: said Bernardo Rucellai, one of the Eight. “I had forgotten him. I
21556: thought he had died in prison. But there is no knowing the truth now.”
21557: 
21558: Who shall put his finger on the work of justice, and say, “It is
21559: there”? Justice is like the Kingdom of God—it is not without us as a
21560: fact, it is within us as a great yearning.
21561: 
21562: 
21563: 
21564: 
21565: CHAPTER LXVIII.
21566: Romola’s waking.
21567: 
21568: 
21569: Romola in her boat passed from dreaming into long deep sleep, and then
21570: again from deep sleep into busy dreaming, till at last she felt herself
21571: stretching out her arms in the court of the Bargello, where the
21572: flickering flames of the tapers seemed to get stronger and stronger
21573: till the dark scene was blotted out with light. Her eyes opened and she
21574: saw it was the light of morning. Her boat was lying still in a little
21575: creek; on her right-hand lay the speckless sapphire-blue of the
21576: Mediterranean; on her left one of those scenes which were and still are
21577: repeated again and again like a sweet rhythm, on the shores of that
21578: loveliest sea.
21579: 
21580: In a deep curve of the mountains lay a breadth of green land, curtained
21581: by gentle tree-shadowed slopes leaning towards the rocky heights. Up
21582: these slopes might be seen here and there, gleaming between the
21583: tree-tops, a pathway leading to a little irregular mass of building
21584: that seemed to have clambered in a hasty way up the mountain-side, and
21585: taken a difficult stand there for the sake of showing the tall belfry
21586: as a sight of beauty to the scattered and clustered houses of the
21587: village below. The rays of the newly-risen sun fell obliquely on the
21588: westward horn of this crescent-shaped nook: all else lay in dewy
21589: shadow. No sound came across the stillness; the very waters seemed to
21590: have curved themselves there for rest.
21591: 
21592: The delicious sun-rays fell on Romola and thrilled her gently like a
21593: caress. She lay motionless, hardly watching the scene; rather, feeling
21594: simply the presence of peace and beauty. While we are still in our
21595: youth there can always come, in our early waking, moments when mere
21596: passive existence is itself a Lethe, when the exquisiteness of subtle
21597: indefinite sensation creates a bliss which is without memory and
21598: without desire. As the soft warmth penetrated Romola’s young limbs, as
21599: her eyes rested on this sequestered luxuriance, it seemed that the
21600: agitating past had glided away like that dark scene in the Bargello,
21601: and that the afternoon dreams of her girlhood had really come back to
21602: her. For a minute or two the oblivion was untroubled; she did not even
21603: think that she could rest here for ever, she only felt that she rested.
21604: Then she became distinctly conscious that she was lying in the boat
21605: which had been bearing her over the waters all through the night.
21606: Instead of bringing her to death, it had been the gently lulling cradle
21607: of a new life. And in spite of her evening despair she was glad that
21608: the morning had come to her again: glad to think that she was resting
21609: in the familiar sunlight rather than in the unknown regions of death.
21610: _Could_ she not rest here? No sound from Florence would reach her.
21611: Already oblivion was troubled; from behind the golden haze were
21612: piercing domes and towers and walls, parted by a river and enclosed by
21613: the green hills.
21614: 
21615: She rose from her reclining posture and sat up in the boat, willing, if
21616: she could, to resist the rush of thoughts that urged themselves along
21617: with the conjecture how far the boat had carried her. Why need she
21618: mind? This was a sheltered nook where there were simple villagers who
21619: would not harm her. For a little while, at least, she might rest and
21620: resolve on nothing. Presently she would go and get some bread and milk,
21621: and then she would nestle in the green quiet, and feel that there was a
21622: pause in her life. She turned to watch the crescent-shaped valley, that
21623: she might get back the soothing sense of peace and beauty which she had
21624: felt in her first waking.
21625: 
21626: She had not been in this attitude of contemplation more than a few
21627: minutes when across the stillness there came a piercing cry; not a
21628: brief cry, but continuous and more and more intense. Romola felt sure
21629: it was the cry of a little child in distress that no one came to help.
21630: She started up and put one foot on the side of the boat ready to leap
21631: on to the beach; but she paused there and listened: the mother of the
21632: child must be near, the cry must soon cease. But it went on, and drew
21633: Romola so irresistibly, seeming the more piteous to her for the sense
21634: of peace which had preceded it, that she jumped on to the beach and
21635: walked many paces before she knew what direction she would take. The
21636: cry, she thought, came from some rough garden growth many yards on her
21637: right-hand, where she saw a half-ruined hovel. She climbed over a low
21638: broken stone fence, and made her way across patches of weedy green
21639: crops and ripe but neglected corn. The cry grew plainer, and convinced
21640: that she was right she hastened towards the hovel; but even in that
21641: hurried walk she felt an oppressive change in the air as she left the
21642: sea behind. Was there some taint lurking amongst the green luxuriance
21643: that had seemed such an inviting shelter from the heat of the coming
21644: day? She could see the opening into the hovel now, and the cry was
21645: darting through her like a pain. The next moment her foot was within
21646: the doorway, but the sight she beheld in the sombre light arrested her
21647: with a shock of awe and horror. On the straw, with which the floor was
21648: scattered, lay three dead bodies, one of a tall man, one of a girl
21649: about eight years old, and one of a young woman whose long black hair
21650: was being clutched and pulled by a living child—the child that was
21651: sending forth the piercing cry. Romola’s experience in the haunts of
21652: death and disease made thought and action prompt: she lifted the little
21653: living child, and in trying to soothe it on her bosom, still sent to
21654: look at the bodies and see if they were really dead. The strongly
21655: marked type of race in their features, and their peculiar garb, made
21656: her conjecture that they were Spanish or Portuguese Jews, who had
21657: perhaps been put ashore and abandoned there by rapacious sailors, to
21658: whom their property remained as a prey. Such things were happening
21659: continually to Jews compelled to abandon their homes by the
21660: Inquisition: the cruelty of greed thrust them from the sea, and the
21661: cruelty of superstition thrust them back to it.
21662: 
21663: “But, surely,” thought Romola, “I shall find some woman in the village
21664: whose mother’s heart will not let her refuse to tend this helpless
21665: child—if the real mother is indeed dead.”
21666: 
21667: This doubt remained, because while the man and girl looked emaciated
21668: and also showed signs of having been long dead, the woman seemed to
21669: have been hardier, and had not quite lost the robustness of her form.
21670: Romola, kneeling, was about to lay her hand on the heart; but as she
21671: lifted the piece of yellow woollen drapery that lay across the bosom,
21672: she saw the purple spots which marked the familiar pestilence. Then it
21673: struck her that if the villagers knew of this, she might have more
21674: difficulty than she had expected in getting help from them; they would
21675: perhaps shrink from her with that child in her arms. But she had money
21676: to offer them, and they would not refuse to give her some goat’s milk
21677: in exchange for it.
21678: 
21679: She set out at once towards the village, her mind filled now with the
21680: effort to soothe the little dark creature, and with wondering how she
21681: should win some woman to be good to it. She could not help hoping a
21682: little in a certain awe she had observed herself to inspire, when she
21683: appeared, unknown and unexpected, in her religious dress. As she passed
21684: across a breadth of cultivated ground, she noticed, with wonder, that
21685: little patches of corn mingled with the other crops had been left to
21686: over-ripeness untouched by the sickle, and that golden apples and dark
21687: figs lay rotting on the weedy earth. There were grassy spaces within
21688: sight, but no cow, or sheep, or goat. The stillness began to have
21689: something fearful in it to Romola; she hurried along towards the
21690: thickest cluster of houses, where there would be the most life to
21691: appeal to on behalf of the helpless life she carried in her arms. But
21692: she had picked up two figs, and bit little pieces from the sweet pulp
21693: to still the child with.
21694: 
21695: She entered between two lines of dwellings. It was time that villagers
21696: should have been stirring long ago, but not a soul was in sight. The
21697: air was becoming more and more oppressive, laden, it seemed, with some
21698: horrible impurity. There was a door open; she looked in, and saw grim
21699: emptiness. Another open door; and through that she saw a man lying dead
21700: with all his garments on, his head lying athwart a spade handle, and an
21701: earthenware cruse in his hand, as if he had fallen suddenly.
21702: 
21703: Romola felt horror taking possession of her. Was she in a village of
21704: the unburied dead? She wanted to listen if there were any faint sound,
21705: but the child cried out afresh when she ceased to feed it, and the cry
21706: filled her ears. At last she saw a figure crawling slowly out of a
21707: house, and soon sinking back in a sitting posture against the wall. She
21708: hastened towards the figure; it was a young woman in fevered anguish,
21709: and she, too, held a pitcher in her hand. As Romola approached her she
21710: did not start; the one need was too absorbing for any other idea to
21711: impress itself on her.
21712: 
21713: “Water! get me water!” she said, with a moaning utterance.
21714: 
21715: Romola stooped to take the pitcher, and said gently in her ear, “You
21716: shall have water; can you point towards the well?”
21717: 
21718: The hand was lifted towards the more distant end of the little street,
21719: and Romola set off at once with as much speed as she could use under
21720: the difficulty of carrying the pitcher as well as feeding the child.
21721: But the little one was getting more content as the morsels of sweet
21722: pulp were repeated, and ceased to distress her with its cry, so that
21723: she could give a less distracted attention to the objects around her.
21724: 
21725: The well lay twenty yards or more beyond the end of the street, and as
21726: Romola was approaching it her eyes were directed to the opposite green
21727: slope immediately below the church. High up, on a patch of grass
21728: between the trees, she had descried a cow and a couple of goats, and
21729: she tried to trace a line of path that would lead her close to that
21730: cheering sight, when once she had done her errand to the well. Occupied
21731: in this way, she was not aware that she was very near the well, and
21732: that some one approaching it on the other side had fixed a pair of
21733: astonished eyes upon her.
21734: 
21735: Romola certainly presented a sight which, at, that moment and in that
21736: place, could hardly have been seen without some pausing and
21737: palpitation. With her gaze fixed intently on the distant slope, the
21738: long lines of her thick grey garment giving a gliding character to her
21739: rapid walk, her hair rolling backward and illuminated on the left side
21740: by the sun-rays, the little olive baby on her right arm now looking out
21741: with jet-black eyes, she might well startle that youth of fifteen,
21742: accustomed to swing the censer in the presence of a Madonna less fair
21743: and marvellous than this.
21744: 
21745: “She carries a pitcher in her hand—to fetch water for the sick. It is
21746: the Holy Mother, come to take care of the people who have the
21747: pestilence.”
21748: 
21749: It was a sight of awe: she would, perhaps, be angry with those who
21750: fetched water for themselves only. The youth flung down his vessel in
21751: terror, and Romola, aware now of some one near her, saw the black and
21752: white figure fly as if for dear life towards the slope she had just
21753: been contemplating. But remembering the parched sufferer, she
21754: half-filled her pitcher quickly and hastened back.
21755: 
21756: Entering the house to look for a small cup, she saw salt meat and meal:
21757: there were no signs of want in the dwelling. With nimble movement she
21758: seated baby on the ground, and lifted a cup of water to the sufferer,
21759: who drank eagerly and then closed her eyes and leaned her head
21760: backward, seeming to give herself up to the sense of relief. Presently
21761: she opened her eyes, and, looking at Romola, said languidly—
21762: 
21763: “Who are you?”
21764: 
21765: “I came over the sea,” said Romola, “I only came this morning. Are all
21766: the people dead in these houses?”
21767: 
21768: “I think they are all ill now—all that are not dead. My father and my
21769: sister lie dead upstairs, and there is no one to bury them: and soon I
21770: shall die.”
21771: 
21772: “Not so, I hope,” said Romola. “I am come to take care of you. I am
21773: used to the pestilence; I am not afraid. But there must be some left
21774: who are not ill. I saw a youth running towards the mountain when I went
21775: to the well.”
21776: 
21777: “I cannot tell. When the pestilence came, a great many people went
21778: away, and drove off the cows and goats. Give me more water!”
21779: 
21780: Romola, suspecting that if she followed the direction of the youth’s
21781: flight, she should find some men and women who were still healthy and
21782: able, determined to seek them out at once, that she might at least win
21783: them to take care of the child, and leave her free to come back and see
21784: how many living needed help, and how many dead needed burial. She
21785: trusted to her powers of persuasion to conquer the aid of the timorous,
21786: when once she knew what was to be done.
21787: 
21788: Promising the sick woman to come back to her, she lifted the dark
21789: bantling again, and set off towards the slope. She felt no burden of
21790: choice on her now, no longing for death. She was thinking how she would
21791: go to the other sufferers, as she had gone to that fevered woman.
21792: 
21793: But, with the child on her arm, it was not so easy to her as usual to
21794: walk up a slope, and it seemed a long while before the winding path
21795: took her near the cow and the goats. She was beginning herself to feel
21796: faint from heat, hunger, and thirst, and as she reached a double
21797: turning, she paused to consider whether she would not wait near the
21798: cow, which some one was likely to come and milk soon, rather than toil
21799: up to the church before she had taken any rest. Raising her eyes to
21800: measure the steep distance, she saw peeping between the boughs, not
21801: more than five yards off, a broad round face, watching her attentively,
21802: and lower down the black skirt of a priest’s garment, and a hand
21803: grasping a bucket. She stood mutely observing, and the face, too,
21804: remained motionless. Romola had often witnessed the overpowering force
21805: of dread in cases of pestilence, and she was cautious.
21806: 
21807: Raising her voice in a tone of gentle pleading, she said, “I came over
21808: the sea. I am hungry, and so is the child. Will you not give us some
21809: milk?”
21810: 
21811: Romola had divined part of the truth, but she had not divined that
21812: preoccupation of the priest’s mind which charged her words with a
21813: strange significance. Only a little while ago, the young acolyte had
21814: brought word to the Padre that he had seen the Holy Mother with the
21815: Babe, fetching water for the sick: she was as tall as the cypresses,
21816: and had a light about her head, and she looked up at the church. The
21817: pievano (parish priest) had not listened with entire belief: he had
21818: been more than fifty years in the world without having any vision of
21819: the Madonna, and he thought the boy might have misinterpreted the
21820: unexpected appearance of a villager. But he had been made uneasy, and
21821: before venturing to come down and milk his cow, he had repeated many
21822: Aves. The pievano’s conscience tormented him a little: he trembled at
21823: the pestilence, but he also trembled at the thought of the mild-faced
21824: Mother, conscious that that Invisible Mercy might demand something more
21825: of him than prayers and “Hails.” In this state of mind—unable to banish
21826: the image the boy had raised of the Mother with the glory about her
21827: tending the sick—the pievano had come down to milk his cow, and had
21828: suddenly caught sight of Romola pausing at the parted way. Her pleading
21829: words, with their strange refinement of tone and accent, instead of
21830: being explanatory, had a preternatural sound for him. Yet he did not
21831: quite believe he saw the Holy Mother: he was in a state of alarmed
21832: hesitation. If anything miraculous were happening, he felt there was no
21833: strong presumption that the miracle would be in his favour. He dared
21834: not run away; he dared not advance.
21835: 
21836: “Come down,” said Romola, after a pause. “Do not fear. Fear rather to
21837: deny food to the hungry when they ask you.”
21838: 
21839: A moment after, the boughs were parted, and the complete figure of a
21840: thickset priest with a broad, harmless face, his black frock much worn
21841: and soiled, stood, bucket in hand, looking at her timidly, and still
21842: keeping aloof as he took the path towards the cow in silence.
21843: 
21844: Romola followed him and watched him without speaking again, as he
21845: seated himself against the tethered cow, and, when he had nervously
21846: drawn some milk, gave it to her in a brass cup he carried with him in
21847: the bucket. As Romola put the cup to the lips of the eager child, and
21848: afterwards drank some milk herself, the Padre observed her from his
21849: wooden stool with a timidity that changed its character a little. He
21850: recognised the Hebrew baby, he was certain that he had a substantial
21851: woman before him; but there was still something strange and
21852: unaccountable in Romola’s presence in this spot, and the Padre had a
21853: presentiment that things were going to change with him. Moreover, that
21854: Hebrew baby was terribly associated with the dread of pestilence.
21855: 
21856: Nevertheless, when Romola smiled at the little one sucking its own
21857: milky lips, and stretched out the brass cup again, saying, “Give us
21858: more, good father,” he obeyed less nervously than before.
21859: 
21860: Romola on her side was not unobservant; and when the second supply of
21861: milk had been drunk, she looked down at the round-headed man, and said
21862: with mild decision—
21863: 
21864: “And now tell me, father, how this pestilence came, and why you let
21865: your people die without the sacraments; and lie unburied. For I am come
21866: over the sea to help those who are left alive—and you, too, will help
21867: them now.”
21868: 
21869: He told her the story of the pestilence: and while he was telling it,
21870: the youth, who had fled before, had come peeping and advancing
21871: gradually, till at last he stood and watched the scene from behind a
21872: neighbouring bush.
21873: 
21874: Three families of Jews, twenty souls in all, had been put ashore many
21875: weeks ago, some of them already ill of the pestilence. The villagers,
21876: said the priest, had of course refused to give shelter to the
21877: miscreants, otherwise than in a distant hovel, and under heaps of
21878: straw. But when the strangers had died of the plague, and some of the
21879: people had thrown the bodies into the sea, the sea had brought them
21880: back again in a great storm, and everybody was smitten with terror. A
21881: grave was dug, and the bodies were buried; but then the pestilence
21882: attacked the Christians, and the greater number of the villagers went
21883: away over the mountain, driving away their few cattle, and carrying
21884: provisions. The priest had not fled; he had stayed and prayed for the
21885: people, and he had prevailed on the youth Jacopo to stay with him; but
21886: he confessed that a mortal terror of the plague had taken hold of him,
21887: and he had not dared to go down into the valley.
21888: 
21889: “You will fear no longer, father,” said Romola, in a tone of
21890: encouraging authority; “you will come down with me, and we will see who
21891: is living, and we will look for the dead to bury them. I have walked
21892: about for months where the pestilence was, and see, I am strong. Jacopo
21893: will come with us,” she added, motioning to the peeping lad, who came
21894: slowly from behind his defensive bush, as if invisible threads were
21895: dragging him.
21896: 
21897: “Come, Jacopo,” said Romola again, smiling at him, “you will carry the
21898: child for me. See! your arms are strong, and I am tired.”
21899: 
21900: That was a dreadful proposal to Jacopo, and to the priest also; but
21901: they were both under a peculiar influence forcing them to obey. The
21902: suspicion that Romola was a supernatural form was dissipated, but their
21903: minds were filled instead with the more effective sense that she was a
21904: human being whom God had sent over the sea to command them.
21905: 
21906: “Now we will carry down the milk,” said Romola, “and see if any one
21907: wants it.”
21908: 
21909: So they went all together down the slope, and that morning the
21910: sufferers saw help come to them in their despair. There were hardly
21911: more than a score alive in the whole valley; but all of these were
21912: comforted, most were saved, and the dead were buried.
21913: 
21914: In this way days, weeks, and months passed with Romola till the men
21915: were digging and sowing again, till the women smiled at her as they
21916: carried their great vases on their heads to the well, and the Hebrew
21917: baby was a tottering tumbling Christian, Benedetto by name, having been
21918: baptised in the church on the mountain-side. But by that time she
21919: herself was suffering from the fatigue and languor that must come after
21920: a continuous strain on mind and body. She had taken for her dwelling
21921: one of the houses abandoned by their owners, standing a little aloof
21922: from the village street; and here on a thick heap of clean straw—a
21923: delicious bed for those who do not dream of down—she felt glad to lie
21924: still through most of the daylight hours, taken care of along with the
21925: little Benedetto by a woman whom the pestilence had widowed.
21926: 
21927: Every day the Padre and Jacopo and the small flock of surviving
21928: villagers paid their visit to this cottage to see the blessed Lady, and
21929: to bring her of their best as an offering—honey, fresh cakes, eggs, and
21930: polenta. It was a sight they could none of them forget, a sight they
21931: all told of in their old age—how the sweet and sainted lady with her
21932: fair face, her golden hair, and her brown eyes that had a blessing in
21933: them, lay weary with her labours after she had been sent over the sea
21934: to help them in their extremity, and how the queer little black
21935: Benedetto used to crawl about the straw by her side and want everything
21936: that was brought to her, and she always gave him a bit of what she
21937: took, and told them if they loved her they must be good to Benedetto.
21938: 
21939: Many legends were afterwards told in that valley about the blessed Lady
21940: who came over the sea, but they were legends by which all who heard
21941: might know that in times gone by a woman had done beautiful loving
21942: deeds there, rescuing those who were ready to perish.
21943: 
21944: 
21945: 
21946: 
21947: CHAPTER LXIX.
21948: Homeward.
21949: 
21950: 
21951: In those silent wintry hours when Romola lay resting from her
21952: weariness, her mind, travelling back over the past, and gazing across
21953: the undefined distance of the future, saw all objects from a new
21954: position. Her experience since the moment of her waking in the boat had
21955: come to her with as strong an effect as that of the fresh seal on the
21956: dissolving wax. She had felt herself without bonds, without motive;
21957: sinking in mere egoistic complaining that life could bring her no
21958: content; feeling a right to say, “I am tired of life, I want to die.”
21959: That thought had sobbed within her as she fell asleep, but from the
21960: moment after her waking when the cry had drawn her, she had not even
21961: reflected, as she used to do in Florence, that she was glad to live
21962: because she could lighten sorrow—she had simply lived, with so
21963: energetic an impulse to share the life around her, to answer the call
21964: of need and do the work which cried aloud to be done, that the reasons
21965: for living, enduring, labouring, never took the form of argument.
21966: 
21967: The experience was like a new baptism to Romola. In Florence the
21968: simpler relations of the human being to his fellow-men had been
21969: complicated for her with all the special ties of marriage, the State,
21970: and religious discipleship, and when these had disappointed her trust,
21971: the shock seemed to have shaken her aloof from life and stunned her
21972: sympathy. But now she said, “It was mere baseness in me to desire
21973: death. If everything else is doubtful, this suffering that I can help
21974: is certain; if the glory of the cross is an illusion, the sorrow is
21975: only the truer. While the strength is in my arm I will stretch it out
21976: to the fainting; while the light visits my eyes they shall seek the
21977: forsaken.”
21978: 
21979: And then the past arose with a fresh appeal to her. Her work in this
21980: green valley was done, and the emotions that were disengaged from the
21981: people immediately around her rushed back into the old deep channels of
21982: use and affection. That rare possibility of self-contemplation which
21983: comes in any complete severance from our wonted life made her judge
21984: herself as she had never done before: the compunction which is
21985: inseparable from a sympathetic nature keenly alive to the possible
21986: experience of others, began to stir in her with growing force. She
21987: questioned the justness of her own conclusions, of her own deeds: she
21988: had been rash, arrogant, always dissatisfied that others were not good
21989: enough, while she herself had not been true to what her soul had once
21990: recognised as the best. She began to condemn her flight: after all, it
21991: had been cowardly self-care; the grounds on which Savonarola had once
21992: taken her back were truer, deeper than the grounds she had had for her
21993: second flight. How could she feel the needs of others and not feel,
21994: above all, the needs of the nearest?
21995: 
21996: But then came reaction against such self-reproach. The memory of her
21997: life with Tito, of the conditions which made their real union
21998: impossible, while their external union imposed a set of false duties on
21999: her which were essentially the concealment and sanctioning of what her
22000: mind revolted from, told her that flight had been her only resource.
22001: All minds, except such as are delivered from doubt by dulness of
22002: sensibility, must be subject to this recurring conflict where the
22003: many-twisted conditions of life have forbidden the fulfilment of a
22004: bond. For in strictness there is no replacing of relations: the
22005: presence of the new does not nullify the failure and breach of the old.
22006: Life has lost its perfection: it has been maimed; and until the wounds
22007: are quite scarred, conscience continually casts backward, doubting
22008: glances.
22009: 
22010: Romola shrank with dread from the renewal of her proximity to Tito, and
22011: yet she was uneasy that she had put herself out of reach of knowing
22012: what was his fate—uneasy that the moment might yet come when he would
22013: be in misery and need her. There was still a thread of pain within her,
22014: testifying to those words of Fra Girolamo, that she could not cease to
22015: be a wife. Could anything utterly cease for her that had once mingled
22016: itself with the current of her heart’s blood?
22017: 
22018: Florence, and all her life there, had come back to her like hunger; her
22019: feelings could not go wandering after the possible and the vague: their
22020: living fibre was fed with the memory of familiar things. And the
22021: thought that she had divided herself from them for ever became more and
22022: more importunate in these hours that were unfilled with action. What if
22023: Fra Girolamo had been wrong? What if the life of Florence was a web of
22024: inconsistencies? Was she, then, something higher, that she should shake
22025: the dust from off her feet, and say, “This world is not good enough for
22026: me”? If she had been really higher, she would not so easily have lost
22027: all her trust.
22028: 
22029: Her indignant grief for her godfather had no longer complete possession
22030: of her, and her sense of debt to Savonarola was recovering
22031: predominance. Nothing that had come, or was to come, could do away with
22032: the fact that there had been a great inspiration in him which had waked
22033: a new life in her. Who, in all her experience, could demand the same
22034: gratitude from her as he? His errors—might they not bring calamities?
22035: 
22036: She could not rest. She hardly knew whether it was her strength
22037: returning with the budding leaves that made her active again, or
22038: whether it was her eager longing to get nearer Florence. She did not
22039: imagine herself daring to enter Florence, but the desire to be near
22040: enough to learn what was happening there urged itself with a strength
22041: that excluded all other purposes.
22042: 
22043: And one March morning the people in the valley were gathered together
22044: to see the blessed Lady depart. Jacopo had fetched a mule for her, and
22045: was going with her over the mountains. The Padre, too, was going with
22046: her to the nearest town, that he might help her in learning the safest
22047: way by which she might get to Pistoja. Her store of trinkets and money,
22048: untouched in this valley, was abundant for her needs.
22049: 
22050: If Romola had been less drawn by the longing that was taking her away,
22051: it would have been a hard moment for her when she walked along the
22052: village street for the last time, while the Padre and Jacopo, with the
22053: mule, were awaiting her near the well. Her steps were hindered by the
22054: wailing people, who knelt and kissed her hands, then clung to her
22055: skirts and kissed the grey folds, crying, “Ah, why will you go, when
22056: the good season is beginning and the crops will be plentiful? Why will
22057: you go?”
22058: 
22059: “Do not be sorry,” said Romola, “you are well now, and I shall remember
22060: you. I must go and see if my own people want me.”
22061: 
22062: “Ah, yes, if they have the pestilence!”
22063: 
22064: “Look at us again, Madonna!”
22065: 
22066: “Yes, yes, we will be good to the little Benedetto!”
22067: 
22068: At last Romola mounted her mule, but a vigorous screaming from
22069: Benedetto as he saw her turn from him in this new position, was an
22070: excuse for all the people to follow her and insist that he must ride on
22071: the mule’s neck to the foot of the slope.
22072: 
22073: The parting must come at last, but as Romola turned continually before
22074: she passed out of sight, she saw the little flock lingering to catch
22075: the last waving of her hand.
22076: 
22077: 
22078: 
22079: 
22080: CHAPTER LXX.
22081: Meeting Again.
22082: 
22083: 
22084: On the fourteenth of April Romola was once more within the walls of
22085: Florence. Unable to rest at Pistoja, where contradictory reports
22086: reached her about the Trial by Fire, she had gone on to Prato; and was
22087: beginning to think that she should be drawn on to Florence in spite of
22088: dread, when she encountered that monk of San Spirito who had been her
22089: godfather’s confessor. From him she learned the full story of
22090: Savonarola’s arrest, and of her husband’s death. This Augustinian monk
22091: had been in the stream of people who had followed the waggon with its
22092: awful burthen into the Piazza, and he could tell her what was generally
22093: known in Florence—that Tito had escaped from an assaulting mob by
22094: leaping into the Arno, but had been murdered on the bank by an old man
22095: who had long had an enmity against him. But Romola understood the
22096: catastrophe as no one else did. Of Savonarola the monk told her, in
22097: that tone of unfavourable prejudice which was usual in the Black
22098: Brethren (Frati Neri) towards the brother who showed white under his
22099: black, that he had confessed himself a deceiver of the people.
22100: 
22101: Romola paused no longer. That evening she was in Florence, sitting in
22102: agitated silence under the exclamations of joy and wailing, mingled
22103: with exuberant narrative, which were poured into her ears by Monna
22104: Brigida, who had backslided into false hair in Romola’s absence, but
22105: now drew it off again and declared she would not mind being grey, if
22106: her dear child would stay with her.
22107: 
22108: Romola was too deeply moved by the main events which she had known
22109: before coming to Florence, to be wrought upon by the doubtful gossiping
22110: details added in Brigida’s narrative. The tragedy of her husband’s
22111: death, of Fra Girolamo’s confession of duplicity under the coercion of
22112: torture, left her hardly any power of apprehending minor circumstances.
22113: All the mental activity she could exert under that load of awe-stricken
22114: grief, was absorbed by two purposes which must supersede every other;
22115: to try and see Savonarola, and to learn what had become of Tessa and
22116: the children.
22117: 
22118: “Tell me, cousin,” she said abruptly, when Monna Brigida’s tongue had
22119: run quite away from troubles into projects of Romola’s living with her,
22120: “has anything been seen or said since Tito’s death of a young woman
22121: with two little children?”
22122: 
22123: Brigida started, rounded her eyes, and lifted up her hands.
22124: 
22125: “Cristo! no. What! was he so bad as that, my poor child? Ah, then, that
22126: was why you went away, and left me word only that you went of your own
22127: free will. Well, well; if I’d known that, I shouldn’t have thought you
22128: so strange and flighty. For I did say to myself, though I didn’t tell
22129: anybody else, ‘What was she to go away from her husband for, leaving
22130: him to mischief, only because they cut poor Bernardo’s head off? She’s
22131: got her father’s temper,’ I said, ‘that’s what it is.’ Well, well;
22132: never scold me, child: Bardo _was_ fierce, you can’t deny it. But if
22133: you had only told me the truth, that there was a young hussey and
22134: children, I should have understood it all. Anything seen or said of
22135: her? No; and the less the better. They say enough of ill about him
22136: without that. But since that was the reason you went—”
22137: 
22138: “No, dear cousin,” said Romola, interrupting her earnestly, “pray do
22139: not talk so. I wish above all things to find that young woman and her
22140: children, and to take care of them. They are quite helpless. Say
22141: nothing against it; that is the thing I shall do first of all.”
22142: 
22143: “Well,” said Monna Brigida, shrugging her shoulders and lowering her
22144: voice with an air of puzzled discomfiture, “if that’s being a Piagnone,
22145: I’ve been taking peas for paternosters. Why, Fra Girolamo said as good
22146: as that widows ought not to marry again. Step in at the door and it’s a
22147: sin and a shame, it seems; but come down the chimney and you’re
22148: welcome. _Two_ children—Santiddio!”
22149: 
22150: “Cousin, the poor thing has done no conscious wrong: she is ignorant of
22151: everything. I will tell you—but not now.”
22152: 
22153: Early the next morning Romola’s steps were directed to the house beyond
22154: San Ambrogio where she had once found Tessa; but it was as she had
22155: feared: Tessa was gone. Romola conjectured that Tito had sent her away
22156: beforehand to some spot where he had intended to join her, for she did
22157: not believe that he would willingly part with those children. It was a
22158: painful conjecture, because, if Tessa were out of Florence, there was
22159: hardly a chance of finding her, and Romola pictured the childish
22160: creature waiting and waiting at some wayside spot in wondering,
22161: helpless misery. Those who lived near could tell her nothing except
22162: that old deaf Lisa had gone away a week ago with her goods, but no one
22163: knew where Tessa had gone. Romola saw no further active search open to
22164: her; for she had no knowledge that could serve as a starting-point for
22165: inquiry, and not only her innate reserve but a more noble sensitiveness
22166: made her shrink from assuming an attitude of generosity in the eyes of
22167: others by publishing Tessa’s relation to Tito, along with her own
22168: desire to find her. Many days passed in anxious inaction. Even under
22169: strong solicitation from other thoughts Romola found her heart
22170: palpitating if she caught sight of a pair of round brown legs, or of a
22171: short woman in the contadina dress.
22172: 
22173: She never for a moment told herself that it was heroism or exalted
22174: charity in her to seek these beings; she needed something that she was
22175: bound specially to care for; she yearned to clasp the children and to
22176: make them love her. This at least would be some sweet result, for
22177: others as well as herself, from all her past sorrow. It appeared there
22178: was much property of Tito’s to which she had a claim; but she
22179: distrusted the cleanness of that money, and she had determined to make
22180: it all over to the State, except so much as was equal to the price of
22181: her father’s library. This would be enough for the modest support of
22182: Tessa and the children. But Monna Brigida threw such planning into the
22183: background by clamorously insisting that Romola must live with her and
22184: never forsake her till she had seen her safe in Paradise—else why had
22185: she persuaded her to turn Piagnone?—and if Romola wanted to rear other
22186: people’s children, she, Monna Brigida, must rear them too. Only they
22187: must be found first.
22188: 
22189: Romola felt the full force of that innuendo. But strong feeling
22190: unsatisfied is never without its superstition, either of hope or
22191: despair. Romola’s was the superstition of hope: _somehow_ she was to
22192: find that mother and the children. And at last another direction for
22193: active inquiry suggested itself. She learned that Tito had provided
22194: horses and mules to await him in San Gallo; he was therefore going to
22195: leave Florence by the gate of San Gallo, and she determined, though
22196: without much confidence in the issue, to try and ascertain from the
22197: gatekeepers if they had observed any one corresponding to the
22198: description of Tessa with her children, to have passed the gates before
22199: the morning of the ninth of April. Walking along the Via San Gallo, and
22200: looking watchfully about her through her long widow’s veil, lest she
22201: should miss any object that might aid her, she descried Bratti
22202: chaffering with a customer. That roaming man, she thought, might aid
22203: her: she would not mind talking of Tessa to _him_. But as she put aside
22204: her veil and crossed the street towards him, she saw something hanging
22205: from the corner of his basket which made her heart leap with a much
22206: stronger hope.
22207: 
22208: “Bratti, my friend,” she said abruptly, “where did you get that
22209: necklace?”
22210: 
22211: “Your servant, madonna,” said Bratti, looking round at her very
22212: deliberately, his mind not being subject to surprise. “It’s a necklace
22213: worth money, but I shall get little by it, for my heart’s too tender
22214: for a trader’s; I have promised to keep it in pledge.”
22215: 
22216: “Pray tell me where you got it;—from a little woman named Tessa, is it
22217: not true?”
22218: 
22219: “Ah! if you know her,” said Bratti, “and would redeem it of me at a
22220: small profit, and give it her again, you’d be doing a charity, for she
22221: cried at parting with it—you’d have thought she was running into a
22222: brook. It’s a small profit I’ll charge you. You shall have it for a
22223: florin, for I don’t like to be hard-hearted.”
22224: 
22225: “Where is she?” said Romola, giving him the money, and unclasping the
22226: necklace from the basket in joyful agitation.
22227: 
22228: “Outside the gate there, at the other end of the Borgo, at old Sibilla
22229: Manetti’s: anybody will tell you which is the house.”
22230: 
22231: Romola went along with winged feet, blessing that incident of the
22232: Carnival which had made her learn by heart the appearance of this
22233: necklace. Soon she was at the house she sought. The young woman and the
22234: children were in the inner room—were to have been fetched away a
22235: fortnight ago and more—had no money, only their clothes, to pay a poor
22236: widow with for their food and lodging. But since madonna knew them—
22237: Romola waited to hear no more, but opened the door.
22238: 
22239: Tessa was seated on the low bed: her crying had passed into tearless
22240: sobs, and she was looking with sad blank eyes at the two children, who
22241: were playing in an opposite corner—Lillo covering his head with his
22242: skirt and roaring at Ninna to frighten her, then peeping out again to
22243: see how she bore it. The door was a little behind Tessa, and she did
22244: not turn round when it opened, thinking it was only the old woman:
22245: expectation was no longer alive. Romola had thrown aside her veil and
22246: paused a moment, holding the necklace in sight. Then she said, in that
22247: pure voice that used to cheer her father—
22248: 
22249: “Tessa!”
22250: 
22251: Tessa started to her feet and looked round.
22252: 
22253: “See,” said Romola, clasping the beads on Tessa’s neck, “God has sent
22254: me to you again.”
22255: 
22256: The poor thing screamed and sobbed, and clung to the arms that fastened
22257: the necklace. She could not speak. The two children came from their
22258: corner, laid hold of their mother’s skirts, and looked up with wide
22259: eyes at Romola.
22260: 
22261: That day they all went home to Monna Brigida’s, in the Borgo degli
22262: Albizzi. Romola had made known to Tessa, by gentle degrees, that Naldo
22263: could never come to her again: not because he was cruel, but because he
22264: was dead.
22265: 
22266: “But be comforted, my Tessa,” said Romola. “I am come to take care of
22267: you always. And we have got Lillo and Ninna.”
22268: 
22269: Monna Brigida’s mouth twitched in the struggle between her awe of
22270: Romola and the desire to speak unseasonably.
22271: 
22272: “Let be, for the present,” she thought; “but it seems to me a thousand
22273: years till I tell this little contadina, who seems not to know how many
22274: fingers she’s got on her hand, who Romola is. And I _will_ tell her
22275: some day, else she’ll never know her place. It’s all very well for
22276: Romola;—nobody will call their souls their own when she’s by; but if
22277: I’m to have this puss-faced minx living in my house she must be humble
22278: to me.”
22279: 
22280: However, Monna Brigida wanted to give the children too many sweets for
22281: their supper, and confessed to Romola, the last thing before going to
22282: bed, that it would be a shame not to take care of such cherubs.
22283: 
22284: “But you must give up to me a little, Romola, about their eating, and
22285: those things. For you have never had a baby, and I had twins, only they
22286: died as soon as they were born.”
22287: 
22288: 
22289: 
22290: 
22291: CHAPTER LXXI.
22292: The Confession.
22293: 
22294: 
22295: When Romola brought home Tessa and the children, April was already near
22296: its close, and the other great anxiety on her mind had been wrought to
22297: its highest pitch by the publication in print of Fra Girolamo’s Trial,
22298: or rather of the confessions drawn from him by the sixteen Florentine
22299: citizens commissioned to interrogate him. The appearance of this
22300: document, issued by order of the Signoria, had called forth such strong
22301: expressions of public suspicion and discontent, that severe measures
22302: were immediately taken for recalling it. Of course there were copies
22303: accidentally mislaid, and a second edition, _not_ by order of the
22304: Signoria, was soon in the hands of eager readers.
22305: 
22306: Romola, who began to despair of ever speaking with Fra Girolamo, read
22307: this evidence again and again, desiring to judge it by some clearer
22308: light than the contradictory impressions that were taking the form of
22309: assertions in the mouths of both partisans and enemies.
22310: 
22311: In the more devout followers of Savonarola his want of constancy under
22312: torture, and his retraction of prophetic claims, had produced a
22313: consternation too profound to be at once displaced as it ultimately was
22314: by the suspicion, which soon grew into a positive datum, that any
22315: reported words of his which were in inexplicable contradiction to their
22316: faith in him, had not come from the lips of the prophet, but from the
22317: falsifying pen of Ser Ceccone, that notary of evil repute, who had made
22318: the digest of the examination. But there were obvious facts that at
22319: once threw discredit on the printed document. Was not the list of
22320: sixteen examiners half made up of the prophet’s bitterest enemies? Was
22321: not the notorious Dolfo Spini one of the new Eight prematurely elected,
22322: in order to load the dice against a man whose ruin had been determined
22323: on by the party in power? It was but a murder with slow formalities
22324: that was being transacted in the Old Palace. The Signoria had resolved
22325: to drive a good bargain with the Pope and the Duke of Milan, by
22326: extinguishing the man who was as great a molestation to vicious
22327: citizens and greedy foreign tyrants as to a corrupt clergy. The Frate
22328: had been doomed beforehand, and the only question that was pretended to
22329: exist now was, whether the Republic, in return for a permission to lay
22330: a tax on ecclesiastical property, should deliver him alive into the
22331: hands of the Pope, or whether the Pope should further concede to the
22332: Republic what its dignity demanded—the privilege of hanging and burning
22333: its own prophet on its own piazza.
22334: 
22335: Who, under such circumstances, would give full credit to this so-called
22336: confession? If the Frate had denied his prophetic gift, the denial had
22337: only been wrenched from him by the agony of torture—agony that, in his
22338: sensitive frame, must quickly produce raving. What if these wicked
22339: examiners declared that he had only had the torture of the rope and
22340: pulley thrice, and only on one day, and that his confessions had been
22341: made when he was under no bodily coercion—was that to be believed? He
22342: had been tortured much more; he had been tortured in proportion to the
22343: distress his confessions had created in the hearts of those who loved
22344: him.
22345: 
22346: Other friends of Savonarola, who were less ardent partisans, did not
22347: doubt the substantial genuineness of the confession, however it might
22348: have been coloured by the transpositions and additions of the notary;
22349: but they argued indignantly that there was nothing which could warrant
22350: a condemnation to death, or even to grave punishment. It must be clear
22351: to all impartial men that if this examination represented the only
22352: evidence against the Frate, he would die, not for any crime, but
22353: because he had made himself inconvenient to the Pope, to the rapacious
22354: Italian States that wanted to dismember their Tuscan neighbour, and to
22355: those unworthy citizens who sought to gratify their private ambition in
22356: opposition to the common weal.
22357: 
22358: Not a shadow of political crime had been proved against him. Not one
22359: stain had been detected on his private conduct: his fellow-monks,
22360: including one who had formerly been his secretary for several years,
22361: and who, with more than the average culture of his companions, had a
22362: disposition to criticise Fra Girolamo’s rule as Prior, bore testimony,
22363: even after the shock of his retraction, to an unimpeachable purity and
22364: consistency in his life, which had commanded their unsuspecting
22365: veneration. The Pope himself had not been able to raise a charge of
22366: heresy against the Frate, except on the ground of disobedience to a
22367: mandate, and disregard of the sentence of excommunication. It was
22368: difficult to justify that breach of discipline by argument, but there
22369: was a moral insurgence in the minds of grave men against the Court of
22370: Rome, which tended to confound the theoretic distinction between the
22371: Church and churchmen, and to lighten the scandal of disobedience.
22372: 
22373: Men of ordinary morality and public spirit felt that the triumph of the
22374: Frate’s enemies was really the triumph of gross licence. And keen
22375: Florentines like Soderini and Piero Guicciardini may well have had an
22376: angry smile on their lips at a severity which dispensed with all law in
22377: order to hang and burn a man in whom the seductions of a public career
22378: had warped the strictness of his veracity; may well have remarked that
22379: if the Frate had mixed a much deeper fraud with a zeal and ability less
22380: inconvenient to high personages, the fraud would have been regarded as
22381: an excellent oil for ecclesiastical and political wheels.
22382: 
22383: Nevertheless such shrewd men were forced to admit that, however poor a
22384: figure the Florentine government made in its clumsy pretence of a
22385: judicial warrant for what had in fact been predetermined as an act of
22386: policy, the measures of the Pope against Savonarola were necessary
22387: measures of self-defence. Not to try and rid himself of a man who
22388: wanted to stir up the Powers of Europe to summon a General Council and
22389: depose him, would have been adding ineptitude to iniquity. There was no
22390: denying that towards Alexander the Sixth Savonarola was a rebel, and,
22391: what was much more, a dangerous rebel. Florence had heard him say, and
22392: had well understood what he meant, that he would not _obey the devil_.
22393: It was inevitably a life and death struggle between the Frate and the
22394: Pope; but it was less inevitable that Florence should make itself the
22395: Pope’s executioner.
22396: 
22397: Romola’s ears were filled in this way with the suggestions of a faith
22398: still ardent under its wounds, and the suggestions of worldly
22399: discernment, judging things according to a very moderate standard of
22400: what is possible to human nature. She could be satisfied with neither.
22401: She brought to her long meditations over that printed document many
22402: painful observations, registered more or less consciously through the
22403: years of her discipleship, which whispered a presentiment that
22404: Savonarola’s retraction of his prophetic claims was not merely a
22405: spasmodic effort to escape from torture. But, on the other hand, her
22406: soul cried out for some explanation of his lapses which would make it
22407: still possible for her to believe that the main striving of his life
22408: had been pure and grand. The recent memory of the selfish discontent
22409: which had come over her like a blighting wind along with the loss of
22410: her trust in the man who had been for her an incarnation of the highest
22411: motives, had produced a reaction which is known to many as a sort of
22412: faith that has sprung up to them out of the very depths of their
22413: despair. It was impossible, she said now, that the negative
22414: disbelieving thoughts which had made her soul arid of all good, could
22415: be founded in the truth of things: impossible that it had not been a
22416: living spirit, and no hollow pretence, which had once breathed in the
22417: Frate’s words, and kindled a new life in her. Whatever falsehood there
22418: had been in him, had been a fall and not a purpose; a gradual
22419: entanglement in which he struggled, not a contrivance encouraged by
22420: success.
22421: 
22422: Looking at the printed confessions, she saw many sentences which bore
22423: the stamp of bungling fabrication: they had that emphasis and
22424: repetition in self-accusation which none but very low hypocrites use to
22425: their fellow-men. But the fact that these sentences were in striking
22426: opposition, not only to the character of Savonarola, but also to the
22427: general tone of the confessions, strengthened the impression that the
22428: rest of the text represented in the main what had really fallen from
22429: his lips. Hardly a word was dishonourable to him except what turned on
22430: his prophetic annunciations. He was unvarying in his statement of the
22431: ends he had pursued for Florence, the Church, and the world; and, apart
22432: from the mixture of falsity in that claim to special inspiration by
22433: which he sought to gain hold of men’s minds, there was no admission of
22434: having used unworthy means. Even in this confession, and without
22435: expurgation of the notary’s malign phrases, Fra Girolamo shone forth as
22436: a man who had sought his own glory indeed, but sought it by labouring
22437: for the very highest end—the moral welfare of men—not by vague
22438: exhortations, but by striving to turn beliefs into energies that would
22439: work in all the details of life.
22440: 
22441: “Everything that I have done,” said one memorable passage, which may
22442: perhaps have had its erasures and interpolations, “I have done with the
22443: design of being for ever famous in the present and in future ages; and
22444: that I might win credit in Florence; and that nothing of great import
22445: should be done without my sanction. And when I had thus established my
22446: position in Florence, I had it in my mind to do great things in Italy
22447: and beyond Italy, by means of those chief personages with whom I had
22448: contracted friendship and consulted on high matters, such as this of
22449: the General Council. And in proportion as my first efforts succeeded, I
22450: should have adopted further measures. Above all, when the General
22451: Council had once been brought about, I intended to rouse the princes of
22452: Christendom, and especially those beyond the borders of Italy, to
22453: subdue the infidels. It was not much in my thoughts to get myself made
22454: a Cardinal or Pope, for when I should have achieved the work I had in
22455: view, I should, without being Pope, have been the first man in the
22456: world in the authority I should have possessed, and the reverence that
22457: would have been paid me. If I had been made Pope, I would not have
22458: refused the office: but it seemed to me that to be the head of that
22459: work was a greater thing than to be Pope, because a man without virtue
22460: may be Pope; but _such a work as I contemplated demanded a man of
22461: excellent virtues_.”
22462: 
22463: That blending of ambition with belief in the supremacy of goodness made
22464: no new tone to Romola, who had been used to hear it in the voice that
22465: rang through the Duomo. It was the habit of Savonarola’s mind to
22466: conceive great things, and to feel that he was the man to do them.
22467: Iniquity should be brought low; the cause of justice, purity, and love
22468: should triumph; and it should triumph by his voice, by his work, by his
22469: blood. In moments of ecstatic contemplation, doubtless, the sense of
22470: self melted in the sense of the Unspeakable, and in that part of his
22471: experience lay the elements of genuine self-abasement; but in the
22472: presence of his fellow-men for whom he was to act, pre-eminence seemed
22473: a necessary condition of his life.
22474: 
22475: And perhaps this confession, even when it described a doubleness that
22476: was conscious and deliberate, really implied no more than that wavering
22477: of belief concerning his own impressions and motives which most human
22478: beings who have not a stupid inflexibility of self-confidence must be
22479: liable to under a marked change of external conditions. In a life where
22480: the experience was so tumultuously mixed as it must have been in the
22481: Frate’s, what a possibility was opened for a change of self-judgment,
22482: when, instead of eyes that venerated and knees that knelt, instead of a
22483: great work on its way to accomplishment, and in its prosperity stamping
22484: the agent as a chosen instrument, there came the hooting and the
22485: spitting and the curses of the crowd; and then the hard faces of
22486: enemies made judges; and then the horrible torture, and with the
22487: torture the irrepressible cry, “It is true, what you would have me say:
22488: let me go: do not torture me again: yes, yes, I am guilty. O God! Thy
22489: stroke has reached me!”
22490: 
22491: As Romola thought of the anguish that must have followed the
22492: confession—whether, in the subsequent solitude of the prison,
22493: conscience retracted or confirmed the self-taxing words—that anguish
22494: seemed to be pressing on her own heart and urging the slow bitter
22495: tears. Every vulgar self-ignorant person in Florence was glibly
22496: pronouncing on this man’s demerits, while _he_ was knowing a depth of
22497: sorrow which can only be known to the soul that has loved and sought
22498: the most perfect thing, and beholds itself fallen.
22499: 
22500: She had not then seen—what she saw afterwards—the evidence of the
22501: Frate’s mental state after he had had thus to lay his mouth in the
22502: dust. As the days went by, the reports of new unpublished examinations,
22503: eliciting no change of confessions, ceased; Savonarola was left alone
22504: in his prison and allowed pen and ink for a while, that, if he liked,
22505: he might use his poor bruised and strained right arm to write with. He
22506: wrote; but what he wrote was no vindication of his innocence, no
22507: protest against the proceedings used towards him: it was a continued
22508: colloquy with that divine purity with which he sought complete reunion;
22509: it was the outpouring of self-abasement; it was one long cry for inward
22510: renovation. No lingering echoes of the old vehement self-assertion,
22511: “Look at my work, for it is good, and those who set their faces against
22512: it are the children of the devil!” The voice of Sadness tells him, “God
22513: placed thee in the midst of the people even as if thou hadst been one
22514: of the excellent. In this way thou hast taught others, and hast failed
22515: to learn thyself. Thou hast cured others: and thou thyself hast been
22516: still diseased. Thy heart was lifted up at the beauty of thy own deeds,
22517: and through this thou hast lost thy wisdom and art become, and shalt be
22518: to all eternity, nothing... After so many benefits with which God has
22519: honoured thee, thou art fallen into the depths of the sea; and after so
22520: many gifts bestowed on thee, thou, by thy pride and vainglory, hast
22521: scandalised all the world.” And when Hope speaks and argues that the
22522: divine love has not forsaken him, it says nothing now of a great work
22523: to be done, but only says, “Thou art not forsaken, else why is thy
22524: heart bowed in penitence? That too is a gift.”
22525: 
22526: There is no jot of worthy evidence that from the time of his
22527: imprisonment to the supreme moment, Savonarola thought or spoke of
22528: himself as a martyr. The idea of martyrdom had been to him a passion
22529: dividing the dream of the future with the triumph of beholding his work
22530: achieved. And now, in place of both, had come a resignation which he
22531: called by no glorifying name.
22532: 
22533: _But therefore he may the more fitly be called a martyr by his
22534: fellow-men to all time_. For power rose against him not because of his
22535: sins, but because of his greatness—not because he sought to deceive the
22536: world, but because he sought to make it noble. And through that
22537: greatness of his he endured a double agony: not only the reviling, and
22538: the torture, and the death-throe, but the agony of sinking from the
22539: vision of glorious achievement into that deep shadow where he could
22540: only say, “I count as nothing: darkness encompasses me: yet the light I
22541: saw was the true light.”
22542: 
22543: 
22544: 
22545: 
22546: CHAPTER LXXII.
22547: The Last Silence.
22548: 
22549: 
22550: Romola had seemed to hear, as if they had been a cry, the words
22551: repeated to her by many lips—the words uttered by Savonarola when he
22552: took leave of those brethren of San Marco who had come to witness his
22553: signature of the confession: “Pray for me, for God has withdrawn from
22554: me the spirit of prophecy.”
22555: 
22556: Those words had shaken her with new doubts as to the mode in which he
22557: looked back at the past in moments of complete self-possession. And the
22558: doubts were strengthened by more piteous things still, which soon
22559: reached her ears.
22560: 
22561: The nineteenth of May had come, and by that day’s sunshine there had
22562: entered into Florence the two Papal Commissaries, charged with the
22563: completion of Savonarola’s trial. They entered amid the acclamations of
22564: the people, calling for the death of the Frate. For now the popular cry
22565: was, “It is the Frate’s deception that has brought on all our
22566: misfortunes; let him be burned, and all things right will be done, and
22567: our evils will cease.”
22568: 
22569: The next day it is well certified that there was fresh and fresh
22570: torture of the shattered sensitive frame; and now, at the first sight
22571: of the horrible implements, Savonarola, in convulsed agitation, fell on
22572: his knees, and in brief passionate words _retracted his confession_,
22573: declared that he had spoken falsely in denying his prophetic gift, and
22574: that if he suffered, he would suffer for the truth—“The things that I
22575: have spoken, I had them from God.”
22576: 
22577: But not the less the torture was laid upon him, and when he was under
22578: it he was asked why he had uttered those retracting words. Men were not
22579: demons in those days, and yet nothing but concessions of guilt were
22580: held a reason for release from torture. The answer came: “I said it
22581: that I might seem good; tear me no more, I will tell you the truth.”
22582: 
22583: There were Florentine assessors at this new trial, and those words of
22584: twofold retraction had soon spread. They filled Romola with dismayed
22585: uncertainty.
22586: 
22587: “But,”—it flashed across her—“there will come a moment when he may
22588: speak. When there is no dread hanging over him but the dread of
22589: falsehood, when they have brought him into the presence of death, when
22590: he is lifted above the people, and looks on them for the last time,
22591: they cannot hinder him from speaking a last decisive word. I will be
22592: there.”
22593: 
22594: Three days after, on the 23rd of May 1498, there was again a long
22595: narrow platform stretching across the great piazza, from the Palazzo
22596: Vecchio towards the Tetta de’ Pisani. But there was no grove of fuel as
22597: before: instead of that, there was one great heap of fuel placed on the
22598: circular area which made the termination of the long narrow platform.
22599: And above this heap of fuel rose a gibbet with three halters on it; a
22600: gibbet which, having two arms, still looked so much like a cross as to
22601: make some beholders uncomfortable, though one arm had been truncated to
22602: avoid the resemblance.
22603: 
22604: On the marble terrace of the Palazzo were three tribunals; one near the
22605: door for the Bishop, who was to perform the ceremony of degradation on
22606: Fra Girolamo and the two brethren who were to suffer as his followers
22607: and accomplices; another for the Papal Commissaries, who were to
22608: pronounce them heretics and schismatics, and deliver them over to the
22609: secular arm; and a third, close to Marzocco, at the corner of the
22610: terrace where the platform began, for the Gonfaloniere, and the Eight
22611: who were to pronounce the sentence of death.
22612: 
22613: Again the Piazza was thronged with expectant faces: again there was to
22614: be a great fire kindled. In the majority of the crowd that pressed
22615: around the gibbet the expectation was that of ferocious hatred, or of
22616: mere hard curiosity to behold a barbarous sight. But there were still
22617: many spectators on the wide pavement, on the roofs, and at the windows,
22618: who, in the midst of their bitter grief and their own endurance of
22619: insult as hypocritical Piagnoni, were not without a lingering hope,
22620: even at this eleventh hour, that God would interpose, by some sign, to
22621: manifest their beloved prophet as His servant. And there were yet more
22622: who looked forward with trembling eagerness, as Romola did, to that
22623: final moment when Savonarola might say, “O people, I was innocent of
22624: deceit.”
22625: 
22626: Romola was at a window on the north side of the Piazza, far away from
22627: the marble terrace where the tribunals stood; and near her, also
22628: looking on in painful doubt concerning the man who had won his early
22629: reverence, was a young Florentine of two-and-twenty, named Jacopo
22630: Nardi, afterwards to deserve honour as one of the very few who, feeling
22631: Fra Girolamo’s eminence, have written about him with the simple desire
22632: to be veracious. He had said to Romola, with respectful gentleness,
22633: when he saw the struggle in her between her shuddering horror of the
22634: scene and her yearning to witness what might happen in the last moment—
22635: 
22636: “Madonna, there is no need for you to look at these cruel things. I
22637: will tell you when he comes out of the Palazzo. Trust to me; I know
22638: what you would see.”
22639: 
22640: Romola covered her face, but the hootings that seemed to make the
22641: hideous scene still visible could not be shut out. At last her arm was
22642: touched, and she heard the words, “He comes.” She looked towards the
22643: Palace, and could see Savonarola led out in his Dominican garb; could
22644: see him standing before the Bishop, and being stripped of the black
22645: mantle, the white scapulary and long white tunic, till he stood in a
22646: close woollen under-tunic, that told of no sacred office, no rank. He
22647: had been degraded, and cut off from the Church Militant.
22648: 
22649: The baser part of the multitude delight in degradations, apart from any
22650: hatred; it is the satire they best understand. There was a fresh hoot
22651: of triumph as the three degraded brethren passed on to the tribunal of
22652: the Papal Commissaries, who were to pronounce them schismatics and
22653: heretics. Did not the prophet look like a schismatic and heretic now?
22654: It is easy to believe in the damnable state of a man who stands
22655: stripped and degraded.
22656: 
22657: Then the third tribunal was passed—that of the Florentine officials who
22658: were to pronounce sentence, and amongst whom, even at her distance,
22659: Romola could discern the odious figure of Dolfo Spini, indued in the
22660: grave black lucco, as one of the Eight.
22661: 
22662: Then the three figures, in their close white raiment, trod their way
22663: along the platform, amidst yells and grating tones of insult.
22664: 
22665: “Cover your eyes, Madonna,” said Jacopo Nardi; “Fra Girolamo will be
22666: the last.”
22667: 
22668: It was not long before she had to uncover them again. Savonarola was
22669: there. He was not far off her now. He had mounted the steps; she could
22670: see him look round on the multitude.
22671: 
22672: But in the same moment expectation died, and she only saw what he was
22673: seeing—torches waving to kindle the fuel beneath his dead body, faces
22674: glaring with a yet worse light; she only heard what _he_ was
22675: hearing—gross jests, taunts, and curses.
22676: 
22677: The moment was past. Her face was covered again, and she only knew that
22678: Savonarola’s voice had passed into eternal silence.
22679: 
22680: 
22681: 
22682: 
22683: Epilogue.
22684: 
22685: 
22686: On the evening of the 22nd of May 1509, five persons, of whose history
22687: we have known something, were seated in a handsome upper room opening
22688: on to a loggia which, at its right-hand corner, looked all along the
22689: Borgo Pinti, and over the city gate towards Fiesole and the solemn
22690: heights beyond it.
22691: 
22692: At one end of the room was an archway opening into a narrow inner room,
22693: hardly more than a recess, where the light fell from above on a small
22694: altar covered with fair white linen. Over the altar was a picture,
22695: discernible at the distance where the little party sat only as the
22696: small full-length portrait of a Dominican Brother. For it was shaded
22697: from the light above by overhanging branches and wreaths of flowers,
22698: and the fresh tapers below it were unlit. But it seemed that the
22699: decoration of the altar and its recess was not complete. For part of
22700: the floor was strewn with a confusion of flowers and green boughs, and
22701: among them sat a delicate blue-eyed girl of thirteen, tossing her long
22702: light-brown hair out of her eyes, as she made selections for the
22703: wreaths she was weaving, or looked up at her mother’s work in the same
22704: kind, and told her how to do it with a little air of instruction.
22705: 
22706: For that mother was not very clever at weaving flowers or at any other
22707: work. Tessa’s fingers had not become more adroit with the years—only
22708: very much fatter. She got on slowly and turned her head about a good
22709: deal, and asked Ninna’s opinion with much deference; for Tessa never
22710: ceased to be astonished at the wisdom of her children. She still wore
22711: her contadina gown: it was only broader than the old one; and there was
22712: the silver pin in her rough curly brown hair, and round her neck the
22713: memorable necklace, with a red cord under it, that ended mysteriously
22714: in her bosom. Her rounded face wore even a more perfect look of
22715: childish content than in her younger days: everybody was so good in the
22716: world, Tessa thought; even Monna Brigida never found fault with her
22717: now, and did little else than sleep, which was an amiable practice in
22718: everybody, and one that Tessa liked for herself.
22719: 
22720: Monna Brigida was asleep at this moment, in a straight-backed
22721: arm-chair, a couple of yards off. Her hair, parting backward under her
22722: black hood, had that soft whiteness which is not like snow or anything
22723: else, but is simply the lovely whiteness of aged hair. Her chin had
22724: sunk on her bosom, and her hands rested on the elbow of her chair. She
22725: had not been weaving flowers or doing anything else: she had only been
22726: looking on as usual, and as usual had fallen asleep.
22727: 
22728: The other two figures were seated farther off, at the wide doorway that
22729: opened on to the loggia. Lillo sat on the ground with his back against
22730: the angle of the door-post, and his long legs stretched out, while he
22731: held a large book open on his knee, and occasionally made a dash with
22732: his hand at an inquisitive fly, with an air of interest stronger than
22733: that excited by the finely-printed copy of Petrarch which he kept open
22734: at one place, as if he were learning something by heart.
22735: 
22736: Romola sat nearly opposite Lillo, but she was not observing him. Her
22737: hands were crossed on her lap and her eyes were fixed absently on the
22738: distant mountains: she was evidently unconscious of anything around
22739: her. An eager life had left its marks upon her: the finely-moulded
22740: cheek had sunk a little, the golden crown was less massive; but there
22741: was a placidity in Romola’s face which had never belonged to it in
22742: youth. It is but once that we can know our worst sorrows, and Romola
22743: had known them while life was new.
22744: 
22745: Absorbed in this way, she was not at first aware that Lillo had ceased
22746: to look at his book, and was watching her with a slightly impatient
22747: air, which meant that he wanted to talk to her, but was not quite sure
22748: whether she would like that entertainment just now. But persevering
22749: looks make themselves felt at last. Romola did presently turn away her
22750: eyes from the distance and met Lillo’s impatient dark gaze with a
22751: brighter and brighter smile. He shuffled along the floor, still keeping
22752: the book on his lap, till he got close to her and lodged his chin on
22753: her knee.
22754: 
22755: “What is it, Lillo?” said Romola, pulling his hair back from his brow.
22756: Lillo was a handsome lad, but his features were turning out to be more
22757: massive and less regular than his father’s. The blood of the Tuscan
22758: peasant was in his veins.
22759: 
22760: “Mamma. Romola, what am I to be?” he said, well contented that there
22761: was a prospect of talking till it would be too late to con “Spirto
22762: gentil” any longer.
22763: 
22764: “What should you like to be, Lillo? You might be a scholar. My father
22765: was a scholar, you know, and taught me a great deal. That is the reason
22766: why I can teach you.”
22767: 
22768: “Yes,” said Lillo, rather hesitatingly. “But he is old and blind in the
22769: picture. Did he get a great deal of glory?”
22770: 
22771: “Not much, Lillo. The world was not always very kind to him, and he saw
22772: meaner men than himself put into higher places, because they could
22773: flatter and say what was false. And then his dear son thought it right
22774: to leave him and become a monk; and after that, my father, being blind
22775: and lonely, felt unable to do the things that would have made his
22776: learning of greater use to men, so that he might still have lived in
22777: his works after he was in his grave.”
22778: 
22779: “I should not like that sort of life,” said Lillo. “I should like to be
22780: something that would make me a great man, and very happy
22781: besides—something that would not hinder me from having a good deal of
22782: pleasure.”
22783: 
22784: “That is not easy, my Lillo. It is only a poor sort of happiness that
22785: could ever come by caring very much about our own narrow pleasures. We
22786: can only have the highest happiness, such as goes along with being a
22787: great man, by having wide thoughts, and much feeling for the rest of
22788: the world as well as ourselves; and this sort of happiness often brings
22789: so much pain with it, that we can only tell it from pain by its being
22790: what we would choose before everything else, because our souls see it
22791: is good. There are so many things wrong and difficult in the world,
22792: that no man can be great—he can hardly keep himself from
22793: wickedness—unless he gives up thinking much about pleasure or rewards,
22794: and gets strength to endure what is hard and painful. My father had the
22795: greatness that belongs to integrity; he chose poverty and obscurity
22796: rather than falsehood. And there was Fra Girolamo—you know why I keep
22797: to-morrow sacred: _he_ had the greatness which belongs to a life spent
22798: in struggling against powerful wrong, and in trying to raise men to the
22799: highest deeds they are capable of. And so, my Lillo, if you mean to act
22800: nobly and seek to know the best things God has put within reach of men,
22801: you must learn to fix your mind on that end, and not on what will
22802: happen to you because of it. And remember, if you were to choose
22803: something lower, and make it the rule of your life to seek your own
22804: pleasure and escape from what is disagreeable, calamity might come just
22805: the same; and it would be calamity falling on a base mind, which, is
22806: the one form of sorrow that has no balm in it, and that may well make a
22807: man say, ‘It would have been better for me if I had never been born.’ I
22808: will tell you something, Lillo.”
22809: 
22810: Romola paused for a moment. She had taken Lillo’s cheeks between her
22811: hands, and his young eyes were meeting hers.
22812: 
22813: “There was a man to whom I was very near, so that I could see a great
22814: deal of his life, who made almost every one fond of him, for he was
22815: young, and clever, and beautiful, and his manners to all were gentle
22816: and kind. I believe, when I first knew him, he never thought of
22817: anything cruel or base. But because he tried to slip away from
22818: everything that was unpleasant, and cared for nothing else so much as
22819: his own safety, he came at last to commit some of the basest deeds—such
22820: as make men infamous. He denied his father, and left him to misery; he
22821: betrayed every trust that was reposed in him, that he might keep
22822: himself safe and get rich and prosperous. Yet calamity overtook him.”
22823: 
22824: Again Romola paused. Her voice was unsteady, and Lillo was looking up
22825: at her with awed wonder.
22826: 
22827: “Another time, my Lillo—I will tell you another time. See, there are
22828: our old Piero di Cosimo and Nello coming up the Borgo Pinti, bringing
22829: us their flowers. Let us go and wave our hands to them, that they may
22830: know we see them.”
22831: 
22832: “How queer old Piero is!” said Lillo as they stood at the corner of the
22833: loggia, watching the advancing figures. “He abuses you for dressing the
22834: altar, and thinking so much of Fra Girolamo, and yet he brings you the
22835: flowers.”
22836: 
22837: “Never mind,” said Romola. “There are many good people who did not love
22838: Fra Girolamo. Perhaps I should never have learned to love him if he had
22839: not helped me when I was in great need.”
