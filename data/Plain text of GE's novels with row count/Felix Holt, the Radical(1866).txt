41: INTRODUCTION.
42: 
43: 
44: Five-and-thirty years ago the glory had not yet departed from the old
45: coach roads: the great roadside inns were still brilliant with
46: well-polished tankards, the smiling glances of pretty barmaids, and the
47: repartees of jocose hostlers; the mail still announced itself by the
48: merry notes of the horn; the hedge-cutter or the rick-thatcher might
49: still know the exact hour by the unfailing yet otherwise meteoric
50: apparition of the pea-green Tally-ho or the yellow Independent; and
51: elderly gentlemen in pony-chaises, quartering nervously to make way for
52: the rolling, swinging swiftness, had not ceased to remark that times
53: were finely changed since they used to see the pack-horses and hear the
54: tinkling of their bells on this very highway.
55: 
56: In those days there were pocket boroughs, a Birmingham unrepresented in
57: Parliament and compelled to make strong representations out of it,
58: unrepealed corn-laws, three-and-sixpenny letters, a brawny and
59: many-breeding pauperism, and other departed evils; but there were some
60: pleasant things, too, which have also departed. _Non omnia grandior ætas
61: quæ fugiamus habet_, says the wise goddess: you have not the best of it
62: in all things, O youngsters! the elderly man has his enviable memories,
63: and not the least of them is the memory of a long journey in mid-spring
64: or autumn on the outside of a stage coach. Posterity may be shot, like a
65: bullet through a tube, by atmospheric pressure, from Winchester to
66: Newcastle: that is a fine result to have among our hopes; but the slow,
67: old fashioned way of getting from one end of our country to the other is
68: the better thing to have in the memory. The tube-journey can never lend
69: much to picture and narrative; it is as barren as an exclamatory O!
70: Whereas, the happy outside passenger, seated on the box from the dawn to
71: the gloaming, gathered enough stories of English life, enough of English
72: labors in town and country, enough aspects of earth and sky, to make
73: episodes for a modern Odyssey. Suppose only that his journey took him
74: through that central plain, watered at one extremity by the Avon, at the
75: other by the Trent. As the morning silvered the meadows with their long
76: lines of bushy willows marking the water-courses, or burnished the
77: golden corn-ricks clustered near the long roofs of some midland
78: homestead, he saw the full-uddered cows driven from their pasture to the
79: early milking. Perhaps it was the shepherd, head-servant of the farm,
80: who drove them, his sheep-dog following with a heedless, unofficial air,
81: as of a beadle in undress. The shepherd, with a slow and slouching walk,
82: timed by the walk of grazing beasts, moved aside, as if unwillingly,
83: throwing out a monosyllabic hint to his cattle; his glance, accustomed
84: to rest on things very near the earth, seemed to lift itself with
85: difficulty to the coachman. Mail or stage coach for him belonged to the
86: mysterious distant system of things called "Gover'ment," which, whatever
87: it might be, was no business of his, any more than the most outlying
88: nebula or the coal-sacks of the southern hemisphere: his solar system
89: was the parish; the master's temper and the casualties of lambing-time
90: were his region of storms. He cut his bread and bacon with his
91: pocket-knife, and felt no bitterness except in the matter of pauper
92: laborers and the bad-luck that sent contrarious seasons and the
93: sheep-rot. He and his cows were soon left behind, and the homestead,
94: too, with its pond overhung by elder-trees, its untidy kitchen-garden
95: and cone-shaped yew-tree arbor. But everywhere the bushy hedgerows
96: wasted the land with their straggling beauty, shrouded the grassy
97: borders of the pastures with catkined hazels, and tossed their long
98: blackberry branches on the corn-fields. Perhaps they were white with
99: May, or starred with pale pink dog-roses; perhaps the urchins were
100: already nutting among them, or gathering the plenteous crabs. It was
101: worth the journey only to see those hedgerows, the liberal homes of
102: unmarketable beauty--of the purple blossomed, ruby-berried nightshade,
103: of the wild convolvulus climbing and spreading in tendriled strength
104: till it made a great curtain of pale-green hearts and white trumpets, of
105: the many-tubed honey-suckle which, in its most delicate fragrance, hid a
106: charm more subtle and penetrating than beauty. Even if it were winter,
107: the hedgerows showed their coral, the scarlet haws, the deep-crimson
108: hips, with lingering brown leaves to make a resting-place for the jewels
109: of the hoar-frost. Such hedgerows were often as tall as the laborers'
110: cottages dotted along the lanes, or clustered into a small hamlet, their
111: little dingy windows telling, like thick-filmed eyes, of nothing but the
112: darkness within. The passenger on the coach-box, bowled along above
113: such a hamlet, saw chiefly the roofs of it: probably it turned its back
114: on the road, and seemed to lie away from everything but its own patch of
115: earth and sky, away from the parish church by long fields and green
116: lanes, away from all intercourse except that of tramps. If its face
117: could be seen, it was most likely dirty; but the dirt was Protestant
118: dirt, and the big, bold, gin-breathing tramps were Protestant tramps.
119: There was no sign of superstition near, no crucifix or image to indicate
120: a misguided reverence: the inhabitants were probably so free from
121: superstition that they were in much less awe of the parson than of the
122: overseer. Yet they were saved from the excess of Protestantism by not
123: knowing how to read, and by the absence of handlooms and mines to be the
124: pioneers of Dissent: they were kept safely in the _via media_ of
125: indifference, and could have registered themselves in the census by a
126: big black mark as members of the Church of England.
127: 
128: But there were trim cheerful villages too, with a neat or handsome
129: parsonage and gray church set in the midst; there was the pleasant
130: tinkle of the blacksmith's anvil, the patient cart horses waiting at his
131: door; the basket-maker peeling his willow wands in the sunshine; the
132: wheelwright putting his last touch to a blue cart with red wheels; here
133: and there a cottage with bright transparent windows showing pots full of
134: blooming balsams or geraniums, and little gardens in front all double
135: daisies or dark wallflowers; at the well, clean and comely women
136: carrying yoked buckets, and toward the free school small Britons
137: dawdling on, and handling their marbles in the pockets of unpatched
138: corduroys adorned with brass buttons. The land around was rich and
139: marly, great corn-stacks stood in the rick-yards--for the rick-burners
140: had not found their way hither; the homesteads were those of rich
141: farmers who paid no rent, or had the rare advantage of a lease, and
142: could afford to keep the corn till prices had risen. The coach would be
143: sure to overtake some of them on their way to their outlying fields or
144: to the market-town, sitting heavily on their well-groomed horses, or
145: weighing down one side of an olive-green gig. They probably thought of
146: the coach with some contempt, as an accommodation for people who had not
147: their own gigs, or who, wanting to travel to London and such distant
148: places, belonged to the trading and less solid part of the nation. The
149: passenger on the box could see that this was the district of protuberant
150: optimists, sure that old England was the best of all possible countries,
151: and that if there were any facts which had not fallen under their own
152: observation, they were facts not worth observing: the district of clean
153: little market-towns without manufactures, of fat livings, an
154: aristocratic clergy, and low poor-rates. But as the day wore on the
155: scene would change: the land would begin to be blackened with coal-pits,
156: the rattle of handlooms to be heard in hamlets and villages. Here were
157: powerful men walking queerly with knees bent outward from squatting in
158: the mine, going home to throw themselves down in their blackened flannel
159: and sleep through the daylight, then rise and spend much of their high
160: wages at the ale-house with their fellows of the Benefit Club; here the
161: pale eager faces of the handloom-weavers, men and women, haggard from
162: sitting up late at night to finish the week's work, hardly begun till
163: the Wednesday. Everywhere the cottages and the small children were
164: dirty, for the languid mothers gave their strength to the loom; pious
165: Dissenting women, perhaps, who took life patiently, and thought that
166: salvation depended chiefly on predestination, and not at all on
167: cleanliness. The gables of Dissenting chapels now made a visible sign of
168: religion, and of a meeting-place to counterbalance the ale-house, even
169: in the hamlets; but if a couple of old termagants were seen tearing each
170: other's caps, it was a safe conclusion that, if they had not received
171: the sacraments of the Church, they had not at least given in to
172: schismatic rites, and were free from the errors of Voluntaryism. The
173: breath of the manufacturing town, which made a cloudy day and a red
174: gloom by night on the horizon, diffused itself over all the surrounding
175: country, filling the air with eager unrest. Here was a population not
176: convinced that old England was as good as possible; here were
177: multitudinous men and women aware that their religion was not exactly
178: the religion of their rulers, who might therefore be better than they
179: were, and who, if better, might alter many things which now made the
180: world perhaps more painful than it need be, and certainly more sinful.
181: Yet there were the gray steeples too, and the churchyards, with their
182: grassy mounds and venerable headstones, sleeping in the sunlight; there
183: were broad fields and homesteads, and fine old woods covering a rising
184: ground, or stretching far by the roadside, allowing only peeps at the
185: park and mansion which they shut in from the working-day world. In these
186: midland districts the traveller passed rapidly from one phase of English
187: life to another: after looking down on a village dingy with coal-dust,
188: noisy with the shaking of looms, he might skirt a parish all of fields,
189: high hedges, and deep rutted lanes; after the coach had rattled over the
190: pavement of a manufacturing town, the scenes of riots and trades-union
191: meetings, it would take him in another ten minutes into a rural region,
192: where the neighborhood of the town was only felt in the advantages of a
193: near market for corn, cheese, and hay, and where men with a considerable
194: banking account were accustomed to say that "they never meddled with
195: politics themselves." The busy scenes of the shuttle and the wheel, of
196: the roaring furnace, of the shaft and the pulley, seemed to make but
197: crowded nests in the midst of the large-spaced, slow-moving life of
198: homesteads and far-away cottages and oak-sheltered parks. Looking at the
199: dwellings scattered amongst the woody flats and the plowed uplands,
200: under the low gray sky which overhung them with an unchanging stillness
201: as if Time itself were pausing, it was easy for the traveller to
202: conceive that town and country had no pulse in common, except where the
203: handlooms made a far-reaching straggling fringe about the great centres
204: of manufacture; that till the agitation about the Catholics in '29,
205: rural Englishmen had hardly known more of Catholics than of the fossil
206: mammals; and that their notion of Reform was a confused combination of
207: rick-burners, trades-unions, Nottingham riots, and in general whatever
208: required the calling out of the yeomanry. It was still easier to see
209: that, for the most part, they resisted the rotation of crops and stood
210: by their fallows: and the coachman would perhaps tell how in one parish
211: an innovating farmer, who talked of Sir Humphrey Davy, had been fairly
212: driven out by popular dislike, as if he had been a confounded Radical;
213: and how, the parson having one Sunday preached from the words, "Break up
214: your fallow-ground," the people thought he had made the text out of his
215: own head, otherwise it would never have come "so pat" on a matter of
216: business; but when they found it in the Bible at home, some said it was
217: an argument for fallows (else why should the Bible mention fallows?),
218: but a few of the weaker sort were shaken, and thought it was an argument
219: that fallows should be done away with, else the Bible would have said,
220: "Let your fallows lie"; and the next morning the parson had a stroke of
221: apoplexy, which, as coincident with a dispute about fallows, so set the
222: parish against the innovating farmer and the rotation of crops, that he
223: could stand his ground no longer, and transferred his lease.
224: 
225: The coachman was an excellent travelling companion and commentator on
226: the landscape: he could tell the names of sites and persons, and explain
227: the meaning of groups, as well as the shade of Virgil in a more
228: memorable journey; he had as many stories about parishes, and the men
229: and women in them, as the Wanderer in the "Excursion," only his style
230: was different. His view of life had originally been genial, such as
231: became a man who was well warmed within and without, and held a position
232: of easy, undisputed authority; but the recent initiation of railways had
233: embittered him: he now, as in a perpetual vision, saw the ruined country
234: strewn with shattered limbs, and regarded Mr. Huskisson's death as a
235: proof of God's anger against Stephenson. "Why, every inn on the road
236: would be shut up!" and at that word the coachman looked before him with
237: the blank gaze of one who had driven his coach to the outermost edge of
238: the universe, and saw his leaders plunging into the abyss. Still he
239: would soon relapse from the high prophetic strain to the familiar one of
240: narrative. He knew whose the land was wherever he drove; what noblemen
241: had half-ruined themselves by gambling; who made handsome returns of
242: rent; and who was at daggers-drawn with his eldest son. He perhaps
243: remembered the fathers of actual baronets, and knew stories of their
244: extravagant or stingy housekeeping; whom they had married, whom they had
245: horsewhipped, whether they were particular about preserving their game,
246: and whether they had had much to do with canal companies. About any
247: actual landed proprietor he could also tell whether he was a Reformer or
248: an Anti-Reformer. That was a distinction which had "turned up" in latter
249: times, and along with it the paradox, very puzzling to the coachman's
250: mind, that there were men of old family and large estate who voted for
251: the Bill. He did not grapple with the paradox; he let it pass, with all
252: the discreetness of an experienced theologian or learned scholiast,
253: preferring to point his whip at some object which could raise no
254: questions.
255: 
256: No such paradox troubled our coachman when, leaving the town of Treby
257: Magna behind him, he drove between the hedges for a mile or so, crossed
258: the queer long bridge over the river Lapp, and then put his horses to a
259: swift gallop up the hill by the low-nestled village of Little Treby,
260: till they were on the fine level road, skirted on one side by grand
261: larches, oaks, and wych elms, which sometimes opened so far as to let
262: the traveller see that there was a park behind them.
263: 
264: How many times in the year, as the coach rolled past the
265: neglected-looking lodges which interrupted the screen of trees, and
266: showed the river winding through a finely-timbered park, had the
267: coachman answered the same questions, or told the same things without
268: being questioned! That?--oh, that was Transome Court, a place there had
269: been a fine sight of lawsuits about. Generations back, the heir of the
270: Transome name had somehow bargained away the estate, and it fell to the
271: Durfeys, very distant connections, who only called themselves Transomes
272: because they had got the estate. But the Durfeys' claim had been
273: disputed over and over again; and the coachman, if he had been asked,
274: would have said, though he might have to fall down dead the next minute,
275: that property didn't always get into the right hands. However, the
276: lawyers had found their luck in it; and people who inherited estates
277: that were lawed about often lived in them as poorly as a mouse in a
278: hollow cheese; and, by what he could make out, that had been the way
279: with these present Durfeys, or Transomes, as they called themselves. As
280: for Mr. Transome, he was as poor, half-witted a fellow as you'd wish to
281: see; but _she_ was master, had come of a high family, and had a
282: spirit--you might see it in her eye and the way she sat her horse. Forty
283: years ago, when she came into this country, they said she was a pictur';
284: but her family was poor, and so she took up with a hatchet-faced fellow
285: like this Transome. And the eldest son had been just such another as his
286: father, only worse--a wild sort of half-natural, who got into bad
287: company. They said his mother hated him and wished him dead; for she'd
288: got another son, quite of a different cut, who had gone to foreign parts
289: when he was a youngster, and she wanted her favorite to be heir. But
290: heir or no heir, Lawyer Jermyn had had _his_ picking out of the estate.
291: Not a door in his big house but what was the finest polished oak, all
292: got off the Transome estate. If anybody liked to believe he paid for it,
293: they were welcome. However, Lawyer Jermyn had sat on that box-seat many
294: and many a time. He had made the wills of most people thereabout. The
295: coachman would not say that Lawyer Jermyn was not the man he would
296: choose to make his own will some day. It was not so well for a lawyer to
297: be over-honest, else he might not be up to other people's tricks. And as
298: for the Transome business, there had been ins and outs in time gone by,
299: so that you couldn't look into it straight backward. At this Mr. Sampson
300: (everybody in North Loamshire knew Sampson's coach) would screw his
301: features into a grimace expressive of entire neutrality, and appear to
302: aim his whip at a particular spot on the horse's flank. If the passenger
303: was curious for further knowledge concerning the Transome affairs,
304: Sampson would shake his head and say there had been fine stories in his
305: time; but he never condescended to state what the stories were. Some
306: attributed this reticence to a wise incredulity, others to a want of
307: memory, others to simple ignorance. But at least Sampson was right in
308: saying that there had been fine stories--meaning, ironically, stories
309: not altogether creditable to the parties concerned.
310: 
311: And such stories often come to be fine in a sense that is not ironical.
312: For there is seldom any wrong-doing which does not carry along with it
313: some downfall of blindly-climbing hopes, some hard entail of suffering,
314: some quickly-satiated desire that survives, with the life in death of
315: old paralytic vice, to see itself cursed by its woeful progeny--some
316: tragic mark of kinship in the one brief life to the far-stretching life
317: that went before, and to the life that is to come after, such as has
318: raised the pity and terror of men ever since they began to discern
319: between will and destiny. But these things are often unknown to the
320: world; for there is much pain that is quite noiseless; and vibrations
321: that make human agonies are often a mere whisper in the roar of hurrying
322: existence. There are glances of hatred that stab and raise no cry of
323: murder; robberies that leave man or woman forever beggared of peace and
324: joy, yet kept secret by the sufferer--committed to no sound except that
325: of low moans in the night, seen in no writing except that made on the
326: face by the slow months of suppressed anguish and early morning tears.
327: Many an inherited sorrow that has marred a life has been breathed into
328: no human ear.
329: 
330: The poets have told us of a dolorous enchanted forest in the under
331: world. The thorn-bushes there, and the thick-barked stems, have human
332: histories hidden in them; the power of unuttered cries dwells in the
333: passionless-seeming branches, and the red warm blood is darkly feeding
334: the quivering nerves of a sleepless memory that watches through all
335: dreams. These things are a parable.
336:

339: 
340: CHAPTER I.
341: 
342:     He left me when the down upon his lip
343:     Lay like the shadow of a hovering kiss.
344:     "Beautiful mother, do not grieve," he said;
345:     "I will be great, and build our fortunes high.
346:     And you shall wear the longest train at court,
347:     And look so queenly, all the lords shall say,
348:     'She is a royal changeling: there is some crown
349:     Lacks the right head, since hers wears naught but braids.'"
350:     O, he is coming now--but I am gray:
351:     And he----
352: 
353: 
354: On the first of September, in the memorable year 1832, some one was
355: expected at Transome Court. As early as two o'clock in the afternoon the
356: aged lodge-keeper had opened the heavy gate, green as the tree trunks
357: were green with nature's powdery paint, deposited year after year.
358: Already in the village of Little Treby, which lay on the side of a steep
359: hill not far off the lodge-gates, the elder matrons sat in their best
360: gowns at the few cottage doors bordering the road, that they might be
361: ready to get up and make their courtesy when a travelling carriage
362: should come in sight; and beyond the village several small boys were
363: stationed on the look-out, intending to run a race to the barn-like old
364: church, where the sexton waited in the belfry ready to set the one bell
365: in joyful agitation just at the right moment.
366: 
367: The old lodge-keeper had opened the gate and left it in the charge of
368: his lame wife, because he was wanted at the Court to sweep away the
369: leaves, and perhaps to help in the stables. For though Transome Court
370: was a large mansion, built in the fashion of Queen Anne's time, with a
371: park and grounds as fine as any to be seen in Loamshire, there were very
372: few servants about it. Especially, it seemed, there must be a lack of
373: gardeners; for, except on the terrace surrounded with a stone parapet in
374: front of the house, where there was a parterre, kept with some neatness,
375: grass had spread itself over the gravel walks, and over all the low
376: mounds once carefully cut as black beds for the shrubs and larger
377: plants. Many of the windows had the shutters closed, and under the grand
378: Scotch fir that stooped toward one corner, the brown fir-needles of many
379: years lay in a small stone balcony in front of two such darkened
380: windows. All round, both near and far, there were grand trees,
381: motionless in the still sunshine, and, like all large motionless things,
382: seemed to add to the stillness. Here and there a leaf fluttered down;
383: petals fell in a silent shower; a heavy moth fluttered by, and, when it
384: settled, seemed to fall wearily; the tiny birds alighted on the walks,
385: and hopped about in perfect tranquillity; even a stray rabbit sat
386: nibbling a leaf that was to its liking, in the middle of a grassy space,
387: with an air that seemed quite impudent in so timid a creature. No sound
388: was to be heard louder than a sleepy hum, and the soft monotony of
389: running water hurrying on to the river that divided the park. Standing
390: on the south or east side of the house, you would never have guessed
391: that an arrival was expected.
392: 
393: But on the west side, where the carriage entrance was, the gates under
394: the stone archway were thrown open; and so was the double door of the
395: entrance-hall, letting in the warm light on the scagliola pillars, the
396: marble statues, and the broad stone staircase, with its matting worn
397: into large holes. And, stronger sign of expectation than all, from one
398: of the doors that surrounded the entrance-hall, there came forth from
399: time to time a lady, who walked lightly over the polished stone floor,
400: and stood on the door-steps and watched and listened. She walked
401: lightly, for her figure was slim and finely formed, though she was
402: between fifty and sixty. She was a tall, proud-looking woman, with
403: abundant gray hair, dark eyes and eyebrows, and a somewhat eagle-like
404: yet not unfeminine face. Her tight-fitting black dress was much worn;
405: the fine lace of her cuffs and collar, and of the small veil that fell
406: backward over her high comb, was visibly mended; but rare jewels flashed
407: on her hands, which lay on her folded black-clad arms like finely-cut
408: onyx cameos.
409: 
410: Meantime Mrs. Transome went to the door-steps, watching and listening in
411: vain. Each time she returned to the same room; it was a moderate-sized
412: comfortable room, with low ebony bookshelves round it, and it formed an
413: ante-room to a large library, of which a glimpse could be seen through
414: an open doorway, partly obstructed by a heavy tapestry curtain drawn on
415: one side. There was a great deal of tarnished gilding and dinginess on
416: the walls and furniture of this smaller room, but the pictures above the
417: bookcases were all of a cheerful kind: portraits in pastel of
418: pearly-skinned ladies with hair-powder, blue ribbons, and low bodices; a
419: splendid portrait in oils of a Transome in the gorgeous dress of the
420: Restoration; another of a Transome in his boyhood, with his hand on the
421: neck of a small pony; and a large Flemish battle-piece, where war seemed
422: only a picturesque blue-and-red accident in a vast sunny expanse of
423: plain and sky. Probably such cheerful pictures had been chosen because
424: this was Mrs. Transome's usual sitting-room: it was certainly for this
425: reason that, near the chair in which she seated herself each time she
426: re-entered, there hung a picture of a youthful face which bore a strong
427: resemblance to her own: a beardless but masculine face, with rich brown
428: hair hanging low on the forehead, and undulating beside each cheek down
429: to the loose white cravat. Near this same chair were her writing table,
430: with vellum-covered account-books on it, the cabinet in which she kept
431: her neatly-arranged drugs, her basket for her embroidery, a folio volume
432: of architectural engravings from which she took her embroidery-patterns,
433: a number of the "North Loamshire Herald," and the cushion for her fat
434: Blenheim, which was too old and sleepy to notice its mistress's
435: restlessness. For, just now, Mrs. Transome could not abridge the sunny
436: tedium of the day by the feeble interest of her usual indoor
437: occupations. Her consciousness was absorbed by memories and prospects,
438: and except that she walked to the entrance-door to look out, she sat
439: motionless with folded arms, involuntarily from time to time turning
440: toward the portrait close by her, and as often, when its young brown
441: eyes met hers, turning away again with self-checking resolution.
442: 
443: At last, prompted by some sudden thought or by some sound, she rose and
444: went hastily beyond the tapestry curtain into the library. She paused
445: near the door without speaking: apparently she only wished to see that
446: no harm was being done. A man nearer seventy than sixty was in the act
447: of ranging on a large library-table a series of shallow drawers, some of
448: them containing dried insects, others mineralogical specimens. His pale
449: mild eyes, receding lower jaw, and slight frame, could never have
450: expressed much vigor, either bodily or mental; but he had now the
451: unevenness of gait and feebleness of gesture which tell of a past
452: paralytic seizure. His threadbare clothes were thoroughly brushed: his
453: soft white hair was carefully parted and arranged: he was not a
454: neglected-looking old man; and at his side a fine black retriever, also
455: old, sat on its haunches, and watched him as he went to and fro. But
456: when Mrs. Transome appeared within the doorway, her husband paused in
457: his work and shrank like a timid animal looked at in a cage where flight
458: was impossible. He was conscious of a troublesome intention, for which
459: he had been rebuked before--that of disturbing all his specimens with a
460: view to a new arrangement.
461: 
462: After an interval, in which his wife stood perfectly still, observing
463: him, he began to put back the drawers in their places in the row of
464: cabinets which extended under the bookshelves at one end of the
465: library. When they were all put back and closed, Mrs. Transome turned
466: away, and the frightened old man seated himself with Nimrod the
467: retriever on an ottoman. Peeping at him again, a few minutes after, she
468: saw that he had his arm round Nimrod's neck, and was uttering his
469: thoughts to the dog in a loud whisper, as little children do to any
470: object near them when they believe themselves unwatched.
471: 
472: At last the sound of the church-bell reached Mrs. Transome's ear, and
473: she knew that before long the sound of wheels must be within hearing;
474: but she did not at once start up and walk to the entrance-door. She sat
475: still, quivering and listening; her lips became pale, her hands were
476: cold and trembling. Was her son really coming? She was far beyond fifty;
477: and since her early gladness in this best-loved boy, the harvest of her
478: life had been scanty. Could it be that now--when her hair was gray, when
479: sight had become one of the day's fatigues, when her young
480: accomplishments seemed almost ludicrous, like the tone of her first
481: harpsichord and the words of the song long browned with age--she was
482: going to reap an assured joy? to feel that the doubtful deeds of her
483: life were justified by the result, since a kind Providence had
484: sanctioned them?--to be no longer tacitly pitied by her neighbors for
485: her lack of money, her imbecile husband, her graceless eldest-born, and
486: the loneliness of her life; but to have at her side a rich, clever,
487: possibly a tender, son? Yes; but there were the fifteen years of
488: separation, and all that had happened in that long time to throw her
489: into the background of her son's memory and affection. And yet--did not
490: men sometimes become more filial in their feeling when experience had
491: mellowed them, and they had themselves become fathers? Still, if Mrs.
492: Transome had expected only her son, she would have trembled less; she
493: expected a little grandson also: and there were reasons why she had not
494: been enraptured when her son had written to her only when he was on the
495: eve of returning that he already had an heir born to him.
496: 
497: But the facts must be accepted as they stood, and, after all, the chief
498: thing was to have her son back again. Such pride, such affection, such
499: hopes as she cherished in this fifty-sixth year of her life, must find
500: their gratification in him--or nowhere. Once more she glanced at the
501: portrait. The young brown eyes seemed to dwell on her pleasantly; but,
502: turning from it with a sort of impatience, and saying aloud, "Of course
503: he will be altered!" she rose almost with difficulty, and walked more
504: slowly than before across the hall to the entrance-door.
505: 
506: Already the sound of wheels was loud upon the gravel. The momentary
507: surprise of seeing that it was only a post-chaise, without a servant or
508: much luggage, that was passing under the stone archway and then wheeling
509: round against the flight of stone steps, was at once merged in the sense
510: that there was a dark face under a red travelling-cap looking at her
511: from the window. She saw nothing else; she was not even conscious that
512: the small group of her own servants had mustered, or that old Hickes the
513: butler had come forward to open the chaise door. She heard herself
514: called "Mother!" and felt a light kiss on each cheek; but stronger than
515: all that sensation was the consciousness which no previous thought could
516: prepare her for, that this son who had come back to her was a stranger.
517: Three minutes before, she had fancied that, in spite of all changes
518: wrought by fifteen years of separation, she should clasp her son again
519: as she had done at their parting; but in the moment when their eyes met,
520: the sense of strangeness came upon her like a terror. It was not hard to
521: understand that she was agitated, and the son led her across the hall to
522: the sitting-room, closing the door behind them. Then he turned toward
523: her and said, smiling--
524: 
525: "You would not have known me, eh, mother?"
526: 
527: It was perhaps the truth. If she had seen him in a crowd, she might have
528: looked at him without recognition--not, however, without startled
529: wonder; for though the likeness to herself was no longer striking, the
530: years had overlaid it with another likeness which would have arrested
531: her. Before she answered him, his eyes, with a keen restlessness, as
532: unlike as possible to the lingering gaze of the portrait, had travelled
533: quickly over the room, alighting on her as she said--
534: 
535: "Everything is changed, Harold. I am an old woman, you see."
536: 
537: "But straighter and more upright than some of the young ones!" said
538: Harold; inwardly, however, feeling that age had made his mother's face
539: very anxious and eager. "The old women at Smyrna are like sacks. You've
540: not got clumsy and shapeless. How is it I have the trick of getting
541: fat?" (Here Harold lifted his arm and spread out his plump hand.) "I
542: remember my father was as thin as a herring. How is my father? Where is
543: he?"
544: 
545: Mrs. Transome just pointed to the curtained doorway, and let her son
546: pass through it alone. She was not given to tears: but now, under the
547: pressure of emotion that could find no other vent, they burst forth. She
548: took care that they should be silent tears, and before Harold came out
549: of the library again they were dried. Mrs. Transome had not the feminine
550: tendency to seek influence through pathos; she had been used to rule in
551: virtue of acknowledged superiority. The consciousness that she had to
552: make her son's acquaintance, and that her knowledge of the youth of
553: nineteen might help her little in interpreting the man of thirty-four,
554: had fallen like lead on her soul; but in this new acquaintance of theirs
555: she cared especially that her son, who had seen a strange world, should
556: feel that he was come home to a mother who was to be consulted on all
557: things, and who could supply his lack of the local experience necessary
558: to an English landholder. Her part in life had been that of the clever
559: sinner, and she was equipped with the views, the reasons, and the habits
560: which belonged to that character; life would have little meaning for her
561: if she were to be gently thrust aside as a harmless elderly woman. And
562: besides, there were secrets which her son must never know. So, by the
563: time Harold came from the library again, the traces of tears were not
564: discernible, except to a very careful observer. And he did not observe
565: his mother carefully; his eyes only glanced at her on their way to the
566: _North Loamshire Herald_, lying on the table near her, which he took up
567: with his left hand, as he said--
568: 
569: "Gad! what a wreck poor father is! Paralysis, eh? Terribly shrunk and
570: shaken--crawls about among his books and beetles as usual, though. Well,
571: it's a slow and easy death. But he's not much over sixty-five, is he?"
572: 
573: "Sixty-seven, counting by birthdays; but your father was born old, I
574: think," said Mrs. Transome, a little flushed with the determination not
575: to show any unasked for feeling. Her son did not notice her. All the
576: time he had been speaking his eyes had been running down the columns of
577: the newspaper.
578: 
579: "But your little boy, Harold--where is he? How is it he has not come
580: with you?"
581: 
582: "Oh, I left him behind, in town," said Harold, still looking at the
583: paper. "My man Dominic will bring him, with the rest of the luggage. Ah,
584: I see it is young Debarry, and not my old friend Sir Maximus, who is
585: offering himself as candidate for North Loamshire."
586: 
587: "Yes. You did not answer me when I wrote to you to London about your
588: standing. There is no other Tory candidate spoken of, and you would
589: have all the Debarry interest."
590: 
591: "I hardly think that," said Harold, significantly.
592: 
593: "Why? Jermyn says a Tory candidate can never be got in without it."
594: 
595: "But I shall not be a Tory candidate."
596: 
597: Mrs. Transome felt something like an electric shock.
598: 
599: "What then?" she said, almost sharply. "You will not call yourself a
600: Whig?"
601: 
602: "God forbid! I'm a Radical."
603: 
604: Mrs. Transome's limbs tottered; she sank into a chair. Here was a
605: distinct confirmation of the vague but strong feeling that her son was a
606: stranger to her. Here was a revelation to which it seemed almost as
607: impossible to adjust her hopes and notions of a dignified life as if her
608: son had said that he had been converted to Mahometanism at Smyrna, and
609: had four wives, instead of one son, shortly to arrive under the care of
610: Dominic. For the moment she had a sickening feeling that it was of no
611: use that the long-delayed good fortune had come at last--all of no use
612: though the unloved Durfey was dead and buried, and though Harold had
613: come home with plenty of money. There were rich Radicals, she was aware,
614: as there were rich Jews and Dissenters, but she had never thought of
615: them as county people. Sir Francis Burdett had been generally regarded
616: as a madman. It was better to ask no questions, but silently to prepare
617: herself for anything else there might be to come.
618: 
619: "Will you go to your rooms, Harold, and see if there is anything you
620: would like to have altered?"
621: 
622: "Yes, let us go," said Harold, throwing down the newspaper, in which he
623: had been rapidly reading almost every advertisement while his mother had
624: been going through her sharp inward struggle. "Uncle Lingon is on the
625: bench still, I see," he went on, as he followed her across the hall; "is
626: he at home--will he be here this evening?"
627: 
628: "He says you must go to the rectory when you want to see him. You must
629: remember you have come back to a family with old-fashioned notions. Your
630: uncle thought I ought to have you to myself in the first hour or two. He
631: remembered that I had not seen my son for fifteen years."
632: 
633: "Ah, by Jove! fifteen years--so it is!" said Harold, taking his mother's
634: hand and drawing it under his arm; for he had perceived that her words
635: were charged with an intention. "And you are as straight as an arrow
636: still; you will carry the shawls I have brought you as well as ever."
637: 
638: They walked up the broad stone steps together in silence. Under the
639: shock of discovering her son's Radicalism, Mrs. Transome had no impulse
640: to say one thing rather than another; as in a man who had just been
641: branded on the forehead all wonted motives would be uprooted. Harold, on
642: his side, had no wish opposed to filial kindness, but his busy thoughts
643: were determined by habits which had no reference to any woman's
644: feelings; and even if he could have conceived what his mother's feeling
645: was, his mind, after that momentary arrest, would have darted forward on
646: its usual course.
647: 
648: "I have given you the south rooms, Harold," said Mrs. Transome, as they
649: passed along a corridor lit from above and lined with old family
650: pictures. "I thought they would suit you best, as they all open into
651: each other, and this middle one will make a pleasant sitting-room for
652: you."
653: 
654: "Gad! the furniture is in a bad state," said Harold, glancing around at
655: the middle room which they had just entered; "the moths seem to have got
656: into the carpets and hangings."
657: 
658: "I had no choice except moths or tenants who would pay rent," said Mrs.
659: Transome. "We have been too poor to keep servants for uninhabited
660: rooms."
661: 
662: "What! you've been rather pinched, eh?"
663: 
664: "You find us living as we have been living these twelve years."
665: 
666: "Ah, you've had Durfey's debts as well as the lawsuits--confound them!
667: It will make a hole in sixty thousand pounds to pay off the mortgages.
668: However, he's gone now, poor fellow; and I suppose I should have spent
669: more in buying an English estate some time or other. I always meant to
670: be an Englishman, and thrash a lord or two who thrashed me at Eton."
671: 
672: "I hardly thought you could have meant that, Harold, when I found you
673: had married a foreign wife."
674: 
675: "Would you have had me wait for a consumptive lackadaisical
676: Englishwoman, who would have hung all her relations around my neck? I
677: hate English wives; they want to give their opinion about everything.
678: They interfere with a man's life. I shall not marry again."
679: 
680: Mrs. Transome bit her lip, and turned away to draw up a blind. She would
681: not reply to words which showed how completely any conception of herself
682: and her feelings was excluded from her son's inward world.
683: 
684: As she turned round again she said, "I suppose you have been used to
685: great luxury; these rooms look miserable to you, but you can soon make
686: any alterations you like."
687: 
688: "Oh, I must have a private sitting-room fitted up for myself
689: down-stairs. And the rest are bedrooms, I suppose," he went on, opening
690: a side-door. "Ah, I can sleep here a night or two. But there's a bedroom
691: down-stairs, with an ante-room, I remember, that would do for my man
692: Dominic and the little boy. I should like to have that."
693: 
694: "Your father has slept there for years. He will be like a distracted
695: insect, and never know where to go, if you alter the track he has to
696: walk in."
697: 
698: "That's a pity. I hate going up-stairs."
699: 
700: "There is the steward's room: it is not used, and might be turned into a
701: bedroom. I can't offer you my room, for I sleep up-stairs." (Mrs.
702: Transome's tongue could be a whip upon occasion, but the lash had not
703: fallen on a sensitive spot.)
704: 
705: "No; I'm determined not to sleep up-stairs. We'll see about the
706: steward's room to-morrow, and I dare say I shall find a closet of some
707: sort for Dominic. It's a nuisance he had to stay behind, for I shall
708: have nobody to cook for me. Ah, there's the old river I used to fish in.
709: I often thought, when I was at Smyrna, that I would buy a park with a
710: river through it as much like the Lapp as possible. Gad, what fine oaks
711: those are opposite! Some of them must come down, though."
712: 
713: "I've held every tree sacred on the demesne, as I told you, Harold. I
714: trusted to your getting the estate some time, and releasing it; and I
715: determined to keep it worth releasing. A park without fine timber is no
716: better than a beauty without teeth and hair."
717: 
718: "Bravo, mother!" said Harold, putting his hand on her shoulder. "Ah,
719: you've had to worry yourself about things that don't properly belong to
720: a woman--my father being weakly. We'll set all that right. You shall
721: have nothing to do now but to be grandmamma on satin cushions."
722: 
723: "You must excuse me from the satin cushions. That is a part of the old
724: woman's duty I am not prepared for. I am used to be chief bailiff, and
725: to sit in the saddle two or three hours every day. There are two farms
726: on our hands besides the Home Farm."
727: 
728: "Phew-ew! Jermyn manages the estate badly, then. That will not last
729: under _my_ reign," said Harold, turning on his heel and feeling in his
730: pockets for the keys of his portmanteaus, which had been brought up.
731: 
732: "Perhaps when you've been in England a little longer," said Mrs.
733: Transome, coloring as if she had been a girl, "you will understand
734: better the difficulty there is in letting farms these times."
735: 
736: "I understand the difficulty perfectly, mother. To let farms, a man must
737: have the sense to see what will make them inviting to farmers, and to
738: get sense supplied on demand is just the most difficult transaction I
739: know of. I suppose if I ring there's some fellow who can act as valet
740: and learn to attend to my hookah?"
741: 
742: "There is Hickes the butler, and there is Jabez the footman; those are
743: all the men in the house. They were here when you left."
744: 
745: "Oh, I remember Jabez--he was a dolt. I'll have old Hickes. He was a
746: neat little machine of a butler; his words used to come like the clicks
747: of an engine. He must be an old machine now, though."
748: 
749: "You seem to remember some things about home wonderfully well, Harold."
750: 
751: "Never forget places and people--how they look and what can be done with
752: them. All the country round here lies like a map in my brain. A deuced
753: pretty country too; but the people were a stupid set of old Whigs and
754: Tories. I suppose they are much as they were."
755: 
756: "I am, at least, Harold. You are the first of your family that ever
757: talked of being a Radical. I did not think I was taking care of our old
758: oaks for that. I always thought Radicals' houses stood staring above
759: poor sticks of young trees and iron hurdles."
760: 
761: "Yes, but the Radical sticks are growing, mother, and half the Tory oaks
762: are rotting," said Harold, with gay carelessness. "You've arranged for
763: Jermyn to be early to-morrow?"
764: 
765: "He will be here to breakfast at nine. But I leave you to Hickes now; we
766: dine in an hour."
767: 
768: Mrs. Transome went away and shut herself in her own dressing-room. It
769: had come to pass now--this meeting with the son who had been the object
770: of so much longing; whom she had longed for before he was born, for whom
771: she had sinned, from whom she had wrenched herself with pain at their
772: parting, and whose coming again had been the one great hope of her
773: years. The moment was gone by; there had been no ecstasy, no gladness
774: even; hardly half an hour had passed, and few words had been spoken,
775: yet with that quickness in weaving new futures which belongs to women
776: whose actions have kept them in habitual fear of consequences, Mrs.
777: Transome thought she saw with all the clearness of demonstration that
778: her son's return had not been a good for her in the sense of making her
779: any happier.
780: 
781: She stood before a tall mirror, going close to it and looking at her
782: face with hard scrutiny, as if it were unrelated to herself. No elderly
783: face can be handsome, looked at in that way; every little detail is
784: startlingly prominent, and the effect of the whole is lost. She saw the
785: dried-up complexion, and the deep lines of bitter discontent about the
786: mouth.
787: 
788: "I am a hag!" she said to herself (she was accustomed to give her
789: thoughts a very sharp outline), "an ugly old woman who happens to be his
790: mother. That is what he sees in me, as I see a stranger in him. I shall
791: count for nothing. I was foolish to expect anything else."
792: 
793: She turned away from the mirror and walked up and down her room.
794: 
795: "What a likeness!" she said, in a loud whisper; "yet, perhaps, no one
796: will see it besides me."
797: 
798: She threw herself into a chair, and sat with a fixed look, seeing
799: nothing that was actually present, but inwardly seeing with painful
800: vividness what had been present with her a little more than thirty years
801: ago--the little round-limbed creature that had been leaning against her
802: knees, and stamping tiny feet, and looking up at her with gurgling
803: laughter. She had thought that the possession of this child would give
804: unity to her life, and make some gladness through the changing years
805: that would grow as fruit out of these early maternal caresses. But
806: nothing had come just as she had wished. The mother's early raptures had
807: lasted but a short time, and even while they lasted there had grown up
808: in the midst of them a hungry desire, like a black poisonous plant
809: feeding in the sunlight,--the desire that her first, rickety, ugly,
810: imbecile child should die, and leave room for her darling, of whom she
811: could be proud. Such desires make life a hideous lottery, where every day
812: may turn up a blank; where men and women who have the softest beds and
813: the most delicate eating, who have a very large share of that sky and
814: earth which some are born to have no more of than the fraction to be got
815: in a crowded entry, yet grow haggard, fevered, and restless, like those
816: who watch in other lotteries. Day after day, year after year, had
817: yielded blanks; new cares had come, bringing other desires for results
818: quite beyond her grasp, which must also be watched for in the lottery;
819: and all the while the round-limbed pet had been growing into a strong
820: youth, who liked many things better than his mother's caresses, and who
821: had a much keener consciousness of his independent existence than of his
822: relation to her: the lizard's egg, that white rounded passive
823: prettiness, had become a brown, darting, determined lizard. The mother's
824: love is at first an absorbing delight, blunting all other sensibilities;
825: it is an expansion of the animal existence; it enlarges the imagined
826: range for self to move in: but in after years it can only continue to be
827: joy on the same terms as other long-lived love--that is, by much
828: suppression of self, and power of living in the experience of another.
829: Mrs. Transome had darkly felt the pressure of that unchangeable fact.
830: Yet she had clung to the belief that somehow the possession of this son
831: was the best thing she lived for; to believe otherwise would have made
832: her memory too ghastly a companion. Some time or other, by some means,
833: the estate she was struggling to save from the grasp of the law would be
834: Harold's. Somehow the hated Durfey, the imbecile eldest, who seemed to
835: have become tenacious of a despicable squandering life, would be got rid
836: of; vice might kill him. Meanwhile the estate was burdened: there was no
837: good prospect for any heir. Harold must go and make a career for himself
838: and this was what he was bent on, with a precocious clearness of
839: perception as to the conditions on which he could hope for any
840: advantages in life. Like most energetic natures, he had a strong faith
841: in his luck; he had been gay at their parting, and had promised to make
842: his fortune; and in spite of past disappointments, Harold's possible
843: fortune still made some ground for his mother to plant her hopes in. His
844: luck had not failed him; yet nothing had turned out according to her
845: expectations. Her life had been like a spoiled shabby pleasure-day, in
846: which the music and the processions are all missed, and nothing is left
847: at evening but the weariness of striving after what has been failed of.
848: Harold had gone with the Embassy to Constantinople, under the patronage
849: of a high relative, his mother's cousin; he was to be diplomatist, and
850: work his way upward in public life. But his luck had taken another
851: shape: he had saved the life of an Armenian banker, who in gratitude had
852: offered him a prospect which his practical mind had preferred to the
853: problematic promises of diplomacy and high-born cousinship. Harold had
854: become a merchant and banker at Smyrna; and let the years pass without
855: caring to find the possibility of visiting his early home, and had shown
856: no eagerness to make his life at all familiar to his mother, asking for
857: letters about England, but writing scantily about himself. Mrs. Transome
858: had kept up the habit of writing to her son, but gradually the
859: unfruitful years had dulled her hopes and yearnings; increasing
860: anxieties about money had worried her, and she was more sure of being
861: fretted by bad news about her dissolute eldest son than of hearing
862: anything to cheer her from Harold. She had begun to live merely in small
863: immediate cares and occupations, and like all eager-minded women who
864: advance in life without any activity of tenderness or any large
865: sympathy, she had contracted small rigid habits of thinking and acting,
866: she had her "ways" which must not be crossed, and had learned to fill up
867: the great void of life with giving small orders to tenants, insisting on
868: medicines for infirm cottagers, winning small triumphs in bargains and
869: personal economies, and parrying ill-natured remarks of Lady Debarry's
870: by lancet-edged epigrams. So her life had gone on till more than a year
871: ago, when that desire which had been so hungry when she was a blooming
872: young mother, was at last fulfilled--at last, when her hair was gray,
873: and her face looked bitter, restless, and unenjoying, like her life. The
874: news came from Jersey that Durfey, the imbecile son, was dead. _Now_
875: Harold was heir to the estate; now the wealth he had gained could
876: release the land from its burdens; now he would think it worth while to
877: return home. A change had come over her life, and the sunlight breaking
878: the clouds at evening was pleasant, though the sun must sink before
879: long. Hopes, affections, the sweeter part of her memories, started from
880: their wintry sleep, and it once more seemed a great good to have had a
881: second son who in some ways had cost her dearly. But again there were
882: conditions she had not reckoned on. When the good tidings had been sent
883: to Harold, and he had announced that he would return so soon as he could
884: wind up his affairs, he had for the first time informed his mother that
885: he had been married, that his Greek wife was no longer living, but that
886: he should bring home a little boy, the finest and most desirable of
887: heirs and grandsons. Harold seated in his distant Smyrna home considered
888: that he was taking a rational view of what things must have become by
889: this time at the old place in England, when he figured his mother as a
890: good elderly lady, who would necessarily be delighted with the
891: possession on any terms of a healthy grandchild, and would not mind
892: much about the particulars of a long-concealed marriage.
893: 
894: Mrs. Transome had torn up that letter in a rage. But in the months which
895: had elapsed before Harold could actually arrive, she had prepared
896: herself as well as she could to suppress all reproaches or queries which
897: her son might resent, and to acquiesce in his evident wishes. The return
898: was still looked for with longing; affection and satisfied pride would
899: again warm her later years. She was ignorant what sort of man Harold had
900: become now, and of course he must be changed in many ways; but though
901: she told herself this, still the image that she knew, the image fondness
902: clung to, necessarily prevailed over the negatives insisted on by her
903: reason.
904: 
905: And so it was, that when she had moved to the door to meet him, she had
906: been sure that she should clasp her son again, and feel that he was the
907: same who had been her boy, her little one, the loved child of her
908: passionate youth. An hour seemed to have changed everything for her. A
909: woman's hopes are woven of sunbeams; a shadow annihilates them. The
910: shadow which had fallen over Mrs. Transome in this first interview with
911: her son was the presentiment of her powerlessness. If things went wrong,
912: if Harold got unpleasantly disposed in a certain direction where her
913: chief dread had always lain, she seemed to foresee that her words would
914: be of no avail. The keenness of her anxiety in this matter had served as
915: insight; and Harold's rapidity, decision, and indifference to any
916: impressions in others, which did not further or impede his own purposes,
917: had made themselves felt by her as much as she would have felt the
918: unmanageable strength of a great bird which had alighted near her, and
919: allowed her to stroke its wing for a moment because food lay near her.
920: 
921: Under the cold weight of these thoughts Mrs. Transome shivered. That
922: physical reaction roused her from her reverie, and she could now hear
923: the gentle knocking at the door to which she had been deaf before.
924: Notwithstanding her activity and the fewness of her servants, she had
925: never dressed herself without aid; nor would that small, neat,
926: exquisitely clean old woman who now presented herself have wished that
927: her labor should be saved at the expense of such a sacrifice on her
928: lady's part. The small old woman was Mrs. Hickes, the butler's wife, who
929: acted as housekeeper, lady's-maid, and superintendent of the
930: kitchen--the large stony scene of inconsiderable cooking. Forty years
931: ago she had entered Mrs. Transome's service, when that lady was
932: beautiful Miss Lingon, and her mistress still called her Denner, as she
933: had done in the old days.
934: 
935: "The bell has rung, then, Denner, without my hearing it?" said Mrs.
936: Transome, rising.
937: 
938: "Yes, madam," said Denner, reaching from a wardrobe an old black velvet
939: dress trimmed with much-mended point, in which Mrs. Transome was wont to
940: look queenly of an evening.
941: 
942: Denner had still strong eyes of that short-sighted kind which sees
943: through the narrowest chink between the eyelashes. The physical contrast
944: between the tall, eagle-faced, dark-eyed lady, and the little peering
945: waiting woman, who had been round-featured and of pale mealy complexion
946: from her youth up, had doubtless had a strong influence in determining
947: Denner's feeling toward her mistress, which was of that worshipful sort
948: paid to a goddess in ages when it was not thought necessary or likely
949: that a goddess should be very moral. There were different orders of
950: beings--so ran Denner's creed--and she belonged to another order than
951: that to which her mistress belonged. She had a mind as sharp as a
952: needle, and would have seen through and through the ridiculous
953: pretensions of a born servant who did not submissively accept the rigid
954: fate which had given her born superiors. She would have called such
955: pretensions the wrigglings of a worm that tried to walk on its tail.
956: There was a tacit understanding that Denner knew all her mistress's
957: secrets, and her speech was plain and unflattering; yet with wonderful
958: subtlety of instinct she never said anything which Mrs. Transome could
959: feel humiliated by, as by familiarity from a servant who knew too much.
960: Denner identified her own dignity with that of her mistress. She was a
961: hard-headed godless little woman, but with a character to be reckoned on
962: as you reckon on the qualities of iron.
963: 
964: Peering into Mrs. Transome's face she saw clearly that the meeting with
965: the son had been a disappointment in some way. She spoke with a refined
966: accent, in a low quick, monotonous tone--
967: 
968: "Mr. Harold is dressed; he shook me by the hand in the corridor, and was
969: very pleasant."
970: 
971: "What an alteration, Denner! No likeness to me now."
972: 
973: "Handsome, though, spite of his being so browned and stout. There's a
974: fine presence about Mr. Harold. I remember you used to say, madam, there
975: were some people you would always know were in the room though they
976: stood round a corner, and others you might never see till you ran
977: against them. That's as true as truth. And as for likenesses,
978: thirty-five and sixty are not much alike, only to people's memories."
979: 
980: Mrs. Transome knew perfectly that Denner had divined her thoughts.
981: 
982: "I don't know how things will go on now, but it seems something too good
983: to happen that they will go on well. I am afraid of ever expecting
984: anything good again."
985: 
986: "That's weakness, madam. Things don't happen because they're bad or
987: good, else all eggs would be addled or none at all, and at the most it
988: is but six to the dozen. There's good chances and bad chances, and
989: nobody's luck is pulled only by one string."
990: 
991: "What a woman you are, Denner! You talk like a French infidel. It seems
992: to me you are afraid of nothing. I have been full of fears all my
993: life--always seeing something or other hanging over me that I couldn't
994: bear to happen."
995: 
996: "Well, madam, put a good face on it, and don't seem to be on the look-out
997: for crows, else you'll set other people watching. Here you have a rich
998: son come home, and the debts will all be paid, and you have your health
999: and can ride about, and you've such a face and figure, and will have if
1000: you live to be eighty, that everybody is cap in hand to you before they
1001: know you who are; let me fasten up your veil a little higher: there's a
1002: good deal of pleasure in life for you yet."
1003: 
1004: "Nonsense! there's no pleasure for old women, unless they get it out of
1005: tormenting other people. What are your pleasures, Denner--besides being
1006: a slave to me?"
1007: 
1008: "Oh, there's pleasure in knowing one's not a fool, like half the people
1009: one sees about. And managing one's husband is some pleasure; and doing
1010: all one's business well. Why, if I've only got some orange flowers to
1011: candy, I shouldn't like to die till I see them all right. Then there's
1012: the sunshine now and then; I like that as the cats do. I look upon it,
1013: life is like our game at whist, when Banks and his wife come to the
1014: still-room of an evening. I don't enjoy the game much, but I like to
1015: play my cards well, and see what will be the end of it; and I want to
1016: see you make the best of your hand, madam, for your luck has been mine
1017: these forty years now. But I must go and see how Kitty dishes up the
1018: dinner, unless you have any more commands."
1019: 
1020: "No, Denner; I am going down immediately."
1021: 
1022: As Mrs. Transome descended the stone staircase in her old black velvet
1023: and point, her appearance justified Denner's personal compliment. She
1024: had that high-born, imperious air which would have marked her as an
1025: object of hatred and reviling by a revolutionary mob. Her person was too
1026: typical of social distinctions to be passed by with indifference by any
1027: one: it would have fitted an empress in her own right, who had had to
1028: rule in spite of faction, to dare the violation of treaties and dread
1029: retributive invasions, to grasp after new territories, to be defiant in
1030: desperate circumstances, and to feel a woman's hunger of the heart
1031: forever unsatisfied. Yet Mrs. Transome's cares and occupations had not
1032: been at all of an imperial sort. For thirty years she had led the
1033: monotonous, narrowing life which used to be the lot of our poorer
1034: gentry; who never went to town, and were probably not on speaking terms
1035: with two out of the five families whose parks lay within the distance of
1036: a drive. When she was young she had been thought wonderfully clever and
1037: accomplished, and had been rather ambitious of intellectual
1038: superiority--had secretly picked out for private reading the higher
1039: parts of dangerous French authors--and in company had been able to talk
1040: of Mr. Burke's style, or of Chateaubriand's eloquence--had laughed at
1041: the Lyrical Ballads, and admired Mr. Southey's Thalaba. She always
1042: thought that the dangerous French writers were wicked and that her
1043: reading of them was a sin; but many sinful things were highly agreeable
1044: to her, and many things which she did not doubt to be good and true were
1045: dull and meaningless. She found ridicule of Biblical characters very
1046: amusing, and she was interested in stories of illicit passion; but she
1047: believed all the while that truth and safety lay in due attendance on
1048: prayers and sermons, in the admirable doctrines and ritual of the Church
1049: of England, equally remote from Puritanism and Popery; in fact, in such
1050: a view of this world and the next as would preserve the existing
1051: arrangements of English society quite unshaken, keeping down the
1052: obtrusiveness of the vulgar and the discontent of the poor. The history
1053: of the Jews, she knew, ought to be preferred to any profane history; the
1054: Pagans, of course, were vicious, and their religions quite nonsensical,
1055: considered as religions--but classical learning came from the Pagans;
1056: the Greeks were famous for sculpture; the Italians for painting; the
1057: middle ages were dark and Papistical; but now Christianity went hand in
1058: hand with civilization, and the providential government of the world,
1059: though a little confused and entangled in foreign countries, in our
1060: favored land was clearly seen to be carried forward on Tory and Church
1061: of England principles, sustained by the succession of the House of
1062: Brunswick, and by sound English divines. For Miss Lingon had had a
1063: superior governess, who held that a woman should be able to write a good
1064: letter, and to express herself with propriety on general subjects. And
1065: it is astonishing how effective this education appeared in a handsome
1066: girl, who sat supremely well on horseback, sang and played a little,
1067: painted small figures in water-colors, had a naughty sparkle in her eyes
1068: when she made a daring quotation, and an air of serious dignity when she
1069: recited something from her store of correct opinions. But however such a
1070: stock of ideas may be made to tell in elegant society, and during a few
1071: seasons in town, no amount of bloom and beauty can make them a perennial
1072: source of interest in things not personal; and the notion that what is
1073: true and, in general, good for mankind, is stupid and drug-like, is not
1074: a safe theoretic basis in circumstances of temptation and difficulty.
1075: Mrs. Transome had been in her bloom before this century began, and in
1076: the long painful years since then, what she had once regarded as her
1077: knowledge and accomplishments had become as valueless as old-fashioned
1078: stucco ornaments, of which the substance was never worth anything, while
1079: the form is no longer to the taste of any living mortal. Crosses,
1080: mortifications, money-cares, conscious blame-worthiness, had changed the
1081: aspect of the world for her; there was anxiety in the morning sunlight;
1082: there was unkind triumph or disapproving pity in the glances of greeting
1083: neighbors; there was advancing age, and a contracting prospect in the
1084: changing seasons as they came and went. And what could then sweeten the
1085: days to a hungry, much-exacting self like Mrs. Transome's? Under
1086: protracted ill every living creature will find something that makes a
1087: comparative ease, and even when life seems woven of pain, will convert
1088: the fainter pang into a desire. Mrs. Transome, whose imperious will had
1089: availed little to ward off the great evils of her life, found the opiate
1090: for her discontent in the exertion of her will about smaller things. She
1091: was not cruel, and could not enjoy thoroughly what she called the old
1092: woman's pleasure of tormenting; but she liked every little sign of power
1093: her lot had left her. She liked that a tenant should stand bareheaded
1094: below her as she sat on horseback. She liked to insist that work done
1095: without her orders should be undone from beginning to end. She liked to
1096: be courtesied and bowed to by all the congregation as she walked up the
1097: little barn of a church. She liked to change a laborer's medicine
1098: fetched from the doctor, and substitute a prescription of her own. If
1099: she had only been more haggard and less majestic, those who had glimpses
1100: of her outward life might have said she was a tyrannical, griping
1101: harridan, with a tongue like a razor. No one said exactly that; but they
1102: never said anything like the full truth about her, or divined what was
1103: hidden under that outward life--a woman's keen sensibility and dread,
1104: which lay screened behind all her petty habits and narrow notions, as
1105: some quivering thing with eyes and throbbing heart may lie crouching
1106: behind withered rubbish. The sensibility and dread had palpitated all
1107: the faster in the prospect of her son's return; and now that she had
1108: seen him, she said to herself, in her bitter way, "It is a lucky eel
1109: that escapes skinning. The best happiness I shall ever know, will be to
1110: escape the worst misery."
1111: 
1112: 
1113: 
1114: 
1115: CHAPTER II.
1116: 
1117:     A jolly parson of the good old stock,
1118:     By birth a gentleman, yet homely too,
1119:     Suiting his phrase to Hodge and Margery
1120:     Whom he once christened, and has married since,
1121:     A little lax in doctrine and in life.
1122:     Not thinking God was captious in such things
1123:     As what a man might drink on holidays,
1124:     But holding true religion was to do
1125:     As you'd be done by--which could never mean
1126:     That he should preach three sermons in a week.
1127: 
1128: 
1129: Harold Transome did not choose to spend the whole evening with his
1130: mother. It was his habit to compress a great deal of effective
1131: conversation into a short space of time, asking rapidly all the
1132: questions he wanted to get answered, and diluting no subject with
1133: irrelevancies, paraphrase, or repetitions. He volunteered no information
1134: about himself and his past life at Smyrna, but answered pleasantly
1135: enough, though briefly, whenever his mother asked for any detail. He was
1136: evidently ill-satisfied as to his palate, trying red pepper to
1137: everything, then asking if there were any relishing sauces in the house,
1138: and when Hickes brought various home-filled bottles, trying several,
1139: finding them failures, and finally falling back from his plate in
1140: despair. Yet he remained good-humored, saying something to his father
1141: now and then for the sake of being kind, and looking on with a pitying
1142: shrug as he saw him watch Hickes cutting his food. Mrs. Transome thought
1143: with some bitterness that Harold showed more feeling for her feeble
1144: husband who had never cared in the least about him, than for her, who
1145: had given him more than the usual share of mother's love. An hour after
1146: dinner, Harold, who had already been turning over the leaves of his
1147: mother's account-books, said--
1148: 
1149: "I shall just cross the park to the parsonage to see my uncle Lingon."
1150: 
1151: "Very well. He can answer more questions for you."
1152: 
1153: "Yes," said Harold, quite deaf to the innuendo, and accepting the words
1154: as a simple statement of the fact. "I want to hear all about the game
1155: and the North Loamshire hunt. I'm fond of sport; we had a great deal of
1156: it at Smyrna, and it keeps down my fat."
1157: 
1158: The Reverend John Lingon became very talkative over his second bottle of
1159: port, which was opened on his nephew's arrival. He was not curious about
1160: the manners of Smyrna, or about Harold's experience, but he unbosomed
1161: himself very freely as to what he himself liked and disliked, which of
1162: the farmers he suspected of killing the foxes, what game he had bagged
1163: that very morning, what spot he would recommend as a new cover, and the
1164: comparative flatness of all existing sport compared with cock-fighting,
1165: under which Old England had been prosperous and glorious, while, so far
1166: as he could see, it had gained little by the abolition of a practice
1167: which sharpened the faculties of men, gratified the instincts of the
1168: fowl, and carried out the designs of heaven in its admirable device of
1169: spurs. From these main topics, which made his points of departure and
1170: return, he rambled easily enough at any new suggestion or query; so that
1171: when Harold got home at a late hour, he was conscious of having gathered
1172: from amidst the pompous full-toned triviality of his uncle's chat some
1173: impressions, which were of practical importance. Among the rector's
1174: dislikes, it appeared, was Mr. Matthew Jermyn.
1175: 
1176: "A fat-handed, glib-tongued fellow, with a scented cambric handkerchief;
1177: one of your educated low-bred fellows; a foundling who got his Latin for
1178: nothing at Christ's Hospital; one of your middle-class upstarts who want
1179: to rank with gentlemen, and think they'll do it with kid gloves and new
1180: furniture."
1181: 
1182: But since Harold meant to stand for the county, Mr. Lingon was equally
1183: emphatic as to the necessity of his not quarrelling with Jermyn till the
1184: election was over. Jermyn must be his agent; Harold must wink hard till
1185: he found himself safely returned; and even then it might be well to let
1186: Jermyn drop gently and raise no scandal. He himself had no quarrel with
1187: the fellow: a clergyman should have no quarrels, and he made it a point
1188: to be able to take wine with any man he met at table. And as to the
1189: estate, and his sister's going too much by Jermyn's advice, he never
1190: meddled with business: it was not his duty as a clergyman. That, he
1191: considered, was the meaning of Melchisedec and the tithe, a subject,
1192: into which he had gone to some depth thirty years ago, when he preached
1193: the Visitation sermon.
1194: 
1195: The discovery that Harold meant to stand on the Liberal side--nay, that
1196: he boldly declared himself a Radical--was rather startling; but to his
1197: uncle's good-humor, beatified by the sipping of port-wine, nothing could
1198: seem highly objectionable, provided it did not disturb that operation.
1199: In the course of half an hour he had brought himself to see that
1200: anything really worthy to be called British Toryism had been entirely
1201: extinct since the Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel had passed the
1202: Catholic Emancipation Bill; that Whiggery, with its rights of man
1203: stopping short at ten-pound householders, and its policy of pacifying a
1204: wild beast with a bite, was a ridiculous monstrosity; that therefore,
1205: since an honest man could not call himself a Tory, which it was, in
1206: fact, as impossible to be now as to fight for the old Pretender, and
1207: could still less become that execrable monstrosity a Whig, there
1208: remained but one course open to him. "Why, lad, if the world was turned
1209: into a swamp, I suppose we should leave off shoes and stockings, and
1210: walk about like cranes"--whence it followed plainly enough that, in
1211: these hopeless times, nothing was left to men of sense and good family
1212: but to retard the national ruin by declaring themselves Radicals, and
1213: take the inevitable process of changing everything out of the hands of
1214: beggarly demagogues and purse-proud tradesmen. It is true the rector was
1215: helped to this chain of reasoning by Harold's remarks; but he soon
1216: became quite ardent in asserting the conclusion.
1217: 
1218: "If the mob can't be turned back, a man of family must try and head the
1219: mob, and save a few homes and hearths, and keep the country up on its
1220: last legs as long as he can. And you're a man of family, my lad--dash
1221: it! You're a Lingon, whatever else you may be, and I'll stand by you.
1222: I've no great interest; I'm a poor parson. I've been forced to give up
1223: hunting; my pointers and a glass of good wine are the only decencies
1224: becoming my station that I can allow myself. But I'll give you my
1225: countenance--I'll stick to you as my nephew. There's no need for me to
1226: change sides exactly. I was born a Tory, and I shall never be a bishop.
1227: But if anybody says you're in the wrong, I shall say, 'My nephew is in
1228: the right; he has turned Radical to save his country. If William Pitt
1229: had been living now he'd have done the same; for what did he say when he
1230: was dying? Not 'Oh, save my party!' but 'Oh, save my country, heaven!'
1231: That was what they dinned in our ears about Peel and the Duke; and now
1232: I'll turn it round upon them. They shall be hoist with their own petard.
1233: Yes, yes, I'll stand by you."
1234: 
1235: Harold did not feel sure that his uncle would thoroughly retain this
1236: satisfactory thread of argument in the uninspired hours of the morning;
1237: but the old gentleman was sure to take the facts easily in the end, and
1238: there was no fear of family coolness or quarrelling on this side. Harold
1239: was glad of it. He was not to be turned aside from any course he had
1240: chosen; but he disliked all quarrelling as an unpleasant expenditure of
1241: energy that could have no good practical result. He was at once active
1242: and luxurious; fond of mastery, and good-natured enough to wish that
1243: every one about him should like his mastery; not caring greatly to know
1244: other people's thoughts, and ready to despise them as blockheads if
1245: their thoughts differed from his, and yet solicitous that they should
1246: have no colorable reason for slight thoughts about _him_. The blockheads
1247: must be forced to respect him. Hence, in proportion as he foresaw his
1248: equals in the neighborhood would be indignant with him for his political
1249: choice, he cared keenly about making a good figure before them in every
1250: other way. His conduct as a landholder was to be judicious, his
1251: establishment was to be kept up generously, his imbecile father treated
1252: with careful regard, his family relations entirely without scandal. He
1253: knew that affairs had been unpleasant in his youth--that there had been
1254: ugly lawsuits--and that his scapegrace brother Durfey had helped to
1255: lower still farther the depressed condition of the family. All this must
1256: be retrieved, now that events had made Harold the head of the Transome
1257: name.
1258: 
1259: Jermyn must be used for the election, and after that if he must be got
1260: rid of, it would be well to shake him loose quietly; his uncle was
1261: probably right on both these points. But Harold's expectation that he
1262: should want to get rid of Jermyn was founded on other reasons than his
1263: scented handkerchief and his charity-school Latin.
1264: 
1265: If the lawyer had been presuming on Mrs. Transome's ignorance as a
1266: woman, and on the stupid rakishness of the original heir, the new heir
1267: would prove to him that he had calculated rashly. Otherwise, Harold had
1268: no prejudice against him. In his boyhood and youth he had seen Jermyn
1269: frequenting Transome Court, but had regarded him with that total
1270: indifference with which youngsters are apt to view those who neither
1271: deny them pleasure nor give them any. Jermyn used to smile at him, and
1272: speak to him affably; but Harold, half proud, half shy, got away from
1273: such patronage as soon as possible; he knew Jermyn was a man of
1274: business; his father, his uncle, and Sir Maximus Debarry did not regard
1275: him as a gentleman and their equal. He had known no evil of the man; but
1276: he saw now that if he were really a covetous upstart, there had been a
1277: temptation for him in the management of the Transome affairs; and it was
1278: clear that the estate was in a bad condition.
1279: 
1280: When Mr. Jermyn was ushered into the breakfast-room the next morning,
1281: Harold found him surprisingly little altered by the fifteen years. He
1282: was gray, but still remarkably handsome; fat, but tall enough to bear
1283: that trial to man's dignity. There was as strong a suggestion of
1284: toilette about him as if he had been five-and-twenty instead of nearly
1285: sixty. He chose always to dress in black, and was especially addicted to
1286: black satin waistcoats, which carried out the general sleekness of his
1287: appearance; and this, together with his white, fat, but
1288: beautifully-shaped hands, which he was in the habit of rubbing gently on
1289: his entrance into a room, gave him very much the air of a lady's
1290: physician. Harold remembered with some amusement his uncle's dislike of
1291: those conspicuous hands; but as his own were soft and dimpled, and as he
1292: too was given to the innocent practice of rubbing those members, his
1293: suspicions were not yet deepened.
1294: 
1295: "I congratulate you, Mrs. Transome," said Jermyn, with a soft and
1296: deferential smile, "all the more," he added, turning toward Harold, "now
1297: I have the pleasure of actually seeing your son. I am glad to perceive
1298: that an Eastern climate has not been unfavorable to him."
1299: 
1300: "No," said Harold, shaking Jermyn's hand carelessly, and speaking with
1301: more than his usual brusqueness, "the question is, whether the English
1302: climate will agree with me. It's deuced shifting and damp; and as for
1303: the food, it would be the finest thing in the world for this country if
1304: the southern cooks would change their religion, get persecuted, and fly
1305: to England, as the old silk-weavers did."
1306: 
1307: "There are plenty of foreign cooks for those who are rich enough to pay
1308: for them, I suppose," said Mrs. Transome, "but they are unpleasant
1309: people to have about one's house."
1310: 
1311: "Gad! I don't think so," said Harold.
1312: 
1313: "The old servants are sure to quarrel with them."
1314: 
1315: "That's no concern of mine. The old servants will have to put up with my
1316: man Dominic, who will show them how to cook and do everything else in a
1317: way that will rather astonish them."
1318: 
1319: "Old people are not so easily taught to change all their ways, Harold."
1320: 
1321: "Well, they can give up and watch the young ones," said Harold, thinking
1322: only at that moment of old Mrs. Hickes and Dominic. But his mother was
1323: not thinking of them only.
1324: 
1325: "You have a valuable servant, it seems," said Jermyn, who understood
1326: Mrs. Transome better than her son did, and wished to smoothen the
1327: current of their dialogue.
1328: 
1329: "Oh, one of those wonderful southern fellows that make one's life easy.
1330: He's of no country in particular. I don't know whether he's most of a
1331: Jew, a Greek, an Italian, or a Spaniard. He speaks five or six
1332: languages, one as well as another. He's cook, valet, major-domo, and
1333: secretary all in one; and what's more, he's an affectionate fellow--I
1334: can trust to his attachment. That's a sort of human specimen that
1335: doesn't grow here in England, I fancy. I should have been badly off if I
1336: could not have brought Dominic."
1337: 
1338: They sat down to breakfast with such slight talk as this going on. Each
1339: of the party was preoccupied and uneasy. Harold's mind was busy
1340: constructing probabilities about what he should discover of Jermyn's
1341: mismanagement or dubious application of funds, and the sort of
1342: self-command he must in the worst case exercise in order to use the man
1343: as long as he wanted him. Jermyn was closely observing Harold with an
1344: unpleasant sense that there was an expression of acuteness and
1345: determination about him which would make him formidable. He would
1346: certainly have preferred at that moment that there had been no second
1347: heir of the Transome name to come back upon him from the East. Mrs.
1348: Transome was not observing the two men; rather, her hands were cold, and
1349: her whole person shaken by their presence; she seemed to hear and see
1350: what they said and did with preternatural acuteness, and yet she was
1351: also seeing and hearing what had been said and done many years before,
1352: and feeling a dim terror about the future. There were piteous
1353: sensibilities in this faded woman, who thirty-four years ago, in the
1354: splendor of her bloom, had been imperious to one of these men, and had
1355: rapturously pressed the other as an infant to her bosom, and now knew
1356: that she was of little consequence to either of them.
1357: 
1358: "Well, what are the prospects about election?" said Harold, as the
1359: breakfast was advancing. "There are two Whigs and one Conservative
1360: likely to be in the field, I know. What is your opinion of the chances?"
1361: 
1362: Mr. Jermyn had a copious supply of words which often led him into
1363: periphrase, but he cultivated a hesitating stammer, which, with a
1364: handsome impassiveness of face, except when he was smiling at a woman,
1365: or when the latent savageness of his nature was thoroughly roused, he
1366: had found useful in many relations, especially in business. No one could
1367: have found out that he was not at his ease. "My opinion," he replied,
1368: "is in a state of balance at present. This division of the county, you
1369: are aware, contains one manufacturing town of the first magnitude, and
1370: several smaller ones. The manufacturing interest is widely dispersed. So
1371: far--a--there is a presumption--a--in favor of the two Liberal
1372: candidates. Still, with a careful canvass of the agricultural districts,
1373: such as those we have round us at Treby Magna, I think--a--the
1374: auguries--a--would not be unfavorable to the return of a Conservative. A
1375: fourth candidate of good position, who should coalesce with Mr.
1376: Debarry--a----"
1377: 
1378: Here Mr. Jermyn hesitated for the third time, and Harold broke in.
1379: 
1380: "That will not be my line of action, so we need not discuss it. If I put
1381: up it will be as a Radical; and I fancy, in any county that would return
1382: Whigs there would be plenty of voters to be combed off by a Radical who
1383: offered himself with good pretensions."
1384: 
1385: There was the slightest possible quiver discernible across Jermyn's
1386: face. Otherwise he sat as he had done before, with his eyes fixed
1387: abstractedly on the frill of a ham before him, and his hand trifling
1388: with his fork. He did not answer immediately, but, when he did, he
1389: looked round steadily at Harold.
1390: 
1391: "I'm delighted to perceive that you have kept yourself so thoroughly
1392: acquainted with English politics."
1393: 
1394: "Oh, of course," said Harold, impatiently. "I'm aware how things have
1395: been going on in England. I always meant to come back ultimately. I
1396: suppose I know the state of Europe as well as if I'd been stationary at
1397: Little Treby for the last fifteen years. If a man goes to the East,
1398: people seem to think he gets turned into something like the one-eyed
1399: calender in the 'Arabian Nights!'"
1400: 
1401: "Yet I should think there are some things which people who have been
1402: stationary at Little Treby could tell you, Harold," said Mrs. Transome.
1403: "It did not signify about your holding Radical opinions at Smyrna; but
1404: you seem not to imagine how your putting up as a Radical will affect
1405: your position here, and the position of your family. No one will visit
1406: you. And then--the sort of people who will support you! You really have
1407: no idea what an impression it conveys when you say you are a Radical.
1408: There are none of our equals who will not feel that you have disgraced
1409: yourself."
1410: 
1411: "Pooh!" said Harold, rising and walking along the room.
1412: 
1413: But Mrs. Transome went on with growing anger in her voice--"It seems to
1414: me that a man owes something to his birth and station, and has no right
1415: to take up this notion or other, just as it suits his fancy; still less
1416: to work at the overthrow of his class. That was what every one said of
1417: Lord Grey, and my family at least is as good as Lord Grey's. You have
1418: wealth now, and might distinguish yourself in the county; and if you had
1419: been true to your colors as a gentleman, you would have had all the
1420: greater opportunity, because the times are so bad. The Debarrys and Lord
1421: Wyvern would have set all the more store by you. For my part, I can't
1422: conceive what good you propose to yourself. I only entreat you to think
1423: again before you take any decided step."
1424: 
1425: "Mother," said Harold, not angrily or with any raising of his voice, but
1426: in a quick, impatient manner, as if the scene must be got through as
1427: quickly as possible; "it is natural that you should think in this way.
1428: Women, very properly, don't change their views, but keep to the notions
1429: in which they have been brought up. It doesn't signify what they
1430: think--they are not called upon to judge or to act. You must leave me to
1431: take my own course in these matters, which properly belong to men.
1432: Beyond that, I will gratify any wish you may choose to mention. You
1433: shall have a new carriage and a pair of bays all to yourself; you shall
1434: have the house done up in first-rate style, and I am not thinking of
1435: marrying. But let us understand that there shall be no further collision
1436: between us on subjects on which I must be master of my own actions."
1437: 
1438: "And you will put the crown to the mortifications of my life, Harold. I
1439: don't know who would be a mother if she could foresee what a slight
1440: thing she will be to her son when she is old."
1441: 
1442: Mrs. Transome here walked out of the room by the nearest way--the glass
1443: door open toward the terrace. Mr. Jermyn had risen too, and his hands
1444: were on the back of his chair. He looked quite impassive: it was not the
1445: first time he had seen Mrs. Transome angry; but now, for the first time,
1446: he thought the outburst of her temper would be useful to him. She, poor
1447: woman, knew quite well that she had been unwise, and that she had been
1448: making herself disagreeable to Harold to no purpose. But half the
1449: sorrows of women would be averted if they could repress the speech they
1450: know to be useless--nay, the speech they have resolved not to utter.
1451: Harold continued his walking a moment longer, and then said to Jermyn--
1452: 
1453: "You smoke?"
1454: 
1455: "No, I always defer to the ladies. Mrs. Jermyn is peculiarly sensitive
1456: in such matters, and doesn't like tobacco."
1457: 
1458: Harold, who, underneath all the tendencies which had made him a Liberal,
1459: had intense personal pride, thought, "Confound the fellow--with his Mrs.
1460: Jermyn! Does he think we are on a footing for me to know anything about
1461: his wife?"
1462: 
1463: "Well, I took my hookah before breakfast," he said aloud, "so, if you
1464: like, we'll go into the library. My father never gets up till midday, I
1465: find."
1466: 
1467: "Sit down, sit down," said Harold, as they entered the handsome,
1468: spacious library. But he himself continued to stand before a map of the
1469: county which he had opened from a series of rollers occupying a
1470: compartment among the bookshelves. "The first question, Mr. Jermyn, now
1471: you know my intentions, is, whether you will undertake to be my agent in
1472: this election, and help me through? There's no time to be lost, and I
1473: don't want to lose my chance, as I may not have another for seven years.
1474: I understand," he went on, flashing a look straight at Jermyn, "that you
1475: have not taken any conspicuous course in politics, and I know that
1476: Labron is agent for the Debarrys."
1477: 
1478: "Oh--a--my dear sir--a man necessarily has his political convictions,
1479: but of what use is it for a professional man--a--of some education, to
1480: talk of them in a little country town? There really is no comprehension
1481: of public questions in such places. Party feeling, indeed, was quite
1482: asleep here before the agitation about the Catholic Relief Bill. It is
1483: true that I concurred with our incumbent in getting up a petition
1484: against the Reform Bill, but I did not state my reasons. The weak points
1485: in that Bill are--a--too palpable, and I fancy you and I should not
1486: differ much on that head. The fact is, when I knew that you were to come
1487: back to us, I kept myself in reserve, though I was much pressed by the
1488: friends of Sir James Clement, the Ministerial candidate, who is----"
1489: 
1490: "However, you will act for me--that's settled?" said Harold.
1491: 
1492: "Certainly," said Jermyn, inwardly irritated by Harold's rapid manner of
1493: cutting him short.
1494: 
1495: "Which of the Liberal candidates, as they call themselves, has the
1496: better chance, eh?"
1497: 
1498: "I was going to observe that Sir James Clement has not so good a
1499: chance as Mr. Garstin, supposing that a third Liberal candidate
1500: presents himself. There are two senses in which a politician can be
1501: liberal"--here Mr. Jermyn smiled--"Sir James Clement is a poor baronet,
1502: hoping for an appointment, and can't be expected to be liberal in that
1503: wider sense which commands majorities."
1504: 
1505: "I wish this man were not so much of a talker," thought Harold, "he'll
1506: bore me. We shall see," he said aloud, "what can be done in the way of
1507: combination. I'll come down to your office after one o'clock if it will
1508: suit you?"
1509: 
1510: "Perfectly."
1511: 
1512: "Ah, and you'll have all the lists and papers and necessary information
1513: ready for me there. I must get up a dinner for the tenants, and we can
1514: invite whom we like besides the tenants. Just now, I'm going over one of
1515: the farms on hand with the bailiff. By the way, that's a desperately bad
1516: business, having three farms unlet--how comes that about, eh?"
1517: 
1518: "That is precisely what I wanted to say a few words about to you. You
1519: have observed already how strongly Mrs. Transome takes certain things to
1520: heart. You can imagine that she has been severely tried in many ways.
1521: Mr. Transome's want of health; Mr. Durfey's habits--a----"
1522: 
1523: "Yes, yes."
1524: 
1525: "She is a woman for whom I naturally entertain the highest respect, and
1526: she has had hardly any gratification for many years, except the sense of
1527: having affairs to a certain extent in her own hands. She objects to
1528: changes; she will not have a new style of tenants; she likes the old
1529: stock of farmers who milk their own cows, and send their younger
1530: daughters out to service: all this makes it difficult to do the best
1531: with the estate. I am aware things are not as they ought to be, for, in
1532: point of fact, improved agricultural management is a matter in which I
1533: take considerable interest, and the farm which I myself hold on the
1534: estate you will see, I think, to be in a superior condition. But Mrs.
1535: Transome is a woman of strong feeling, and I would urge you, my dear
1536: sir, to make the changes which you have, but which I had not the right
1537: to insist on, as little painful to her as possible."
1538: 
1539: "I shall know what to do, sir, never fear," said Harold, much offended.
1540: 
1541: "You will pardon, I hope, a perhaps undue freedom of suggestion from a
1542: man of my age, who has been so long in a close connection with the
1543: family affairs--a--I have never considered that connection simply in a
1544: light of business--a----"
1545: 
1546: "Damn him, I'll soon let him know that _I_ do," thought Harold. But in
1547: proportion as he found Jermyn's manners annoying, he felt the necessity
1548: of controlling himself. He despised all persons who defeated their own
1549: projects by the indulgence of momentary impulses.
1550: 
1551: "I understand, I understand," he said aloud. "You've had more awkward
1552: business on your hands than usually falls to the share of a family
1553: lawyer. We shall set everything right by degrees. But now as to the
1554: canvassing. I've made arrangements with a first-rate man in London, who
1555: understands these matters thoroughly--a solicitor, of course--he has
1556: carried no end of men into Parliament. I'll engage him to meet us at
1557: Duffield--say when?"
1558: 
1559: The conversation after this was driven carefully clear of all angles,
1560: and ended with determined amicableness. When Harold, in his ride an hour
1561: or two afterward, encountered his uncle shouldering a gun, and followed
1562: by one black and one liver-spotted pointer, his muscular person with its
1563: red eagle face set off by a velveteen jacket and leather leggings, Mr.
1564: Lingon's first question was--
1565: 
1566: "Well, lad, how have you got on with Jermyn?"
1567: 
1568: "Oh, I don't think I shall like the fellow. He's a sort of amateur
1569: gentleman. But I must make use of him. I expect whatever I get out of
1570: him will only be something short of fair pay for what he has got out of
1571: us. But I shall see."
1572: 
1573: "Ay, ay, use his gun to bring down your game, and after that, beat the
1574: thief with the butt end. That's wisdom and justice and pleasure all in
1575: one--talking between ourselves as uncle and nephew. But I say, Harold, I
1576: was going to tell you, now I come to think of it, this is rather a
1577: nasty business, your calling yourself a Radical. I've been turning it
1578: over in after-dinner speeches, but it looks awkward--it's not what
1579: people are used to--it wants a good deal of Latin to make it go down. I
1580: shall be worried about it at the sessions, and I can think of nothing
1581: neat enough to carry about in my pocket by way of answer."
1582: 
1583: "Nonsense, uncle! I remember what a good speechifier you always were;
1584: you'll never be at a loss. You only want a few more evenings to think of
1585: it."
1586: 
1587: "But you'll not be attacking the Church and the institutions of the
1588: country--you'll not be going those lengths; you'll keep up the bulwarks,
1589: and so on, eh?"
1590: 
1591: "No, I shan't attack the Church, only the incomes of the bishops,
1592: perhaps, to make them eke out the incomes of the poor clergy."
1593: 
1594: "Well, well, I have no objection to that. Nobody likes our bishop: he's
1595: all Greek and greediness; too proud to dine with his own father. You may
1596: pepper the bishops a little. But you'll respect the constitution handed
1597: down, etc.--and you'll rally round the throne--and the King, God bless
1598: him, and the usual toasts, eh?"
1599: 
1600: "Of course, of course. I am a Radical only in rooting out abuses."
1601: 
1602: "That's the word I wanted, my lad!" said the vicar, slapping Harold's
1603: knee. "That's a spool to wind a speech on. Abuses is the very word; and
1604: if anybody shows himself offended, he'll put the cap on for himself."
1605: 
1606: "I remove the rotten timbers," said Harold, inwardly amused, "and
1607: substitute fresh oak, that's all."
1608: 
1609: "Well done, my boy! By George, you'll be a speaker! But I say, Harold, I
1610: hope you've got a little Latin left. This young Debarry is a tremendous
1611: fellow at the classics, and walks on stilts to any length. He's one of
1612: the new Conservatives. Old Sir Maximus doesn't understand him at all."
1613: 
1614: "That won't do at the hustings," said Harold. "He'll get knocked off his
1615: stilts pretty quickly there."
1616: 
1617: "Bless me! it's astonishing how well you're up in the affairs of the
1618: country, my boy. But rub up a few quotations--'_Quod turpe bonis decebat
1619: Crispinum_'--and that sort of thing--just to show Debarry what you could
1620: do if you liked. But you want to ride on?"
1621: 
1622: "Yes; I have an appointment at Treby. Good-bye."
1623: 
1624: "He's a cleverish chap," muttered the vicar, as Harold rode away. "When
1625: he's had plenty of English exercise, and brought out his knuckle a bit,
1626: he'll be a Lingon again as he used to be. I must go and see how Arabella
1627: takes his being a Radical. It's a little awkward; but a clergyman must
1628: keep peace in a family. Confound it! I'm not bound to love Toryism
1629: better than my own flesh and blood, and the manor I shoot over. That's a
1630: heathenish, Brutus-like sort of thing, as if Providence couldn't take
1631: care of the country without my quarrelling with my own sister's son!"
1632: 
1633: 
1634: 
1635: 
1636: CHAPTER III.
1637: 
1638:     'Twas town, yet country too: you felt the warmth
1639:     Of clustering houses in the wintry time:
1640:     Supped with a friend, and went by lantern home.
1641:     Yet from your chamber window you could hear
1642:     The tiny bleat of new-yeaned lambs, or see
1643:     The children bend beside the hedgerow banks
1644:     To pluck the primroses.
1645: 
1646: 
1647: Treby Magna, on which the Reform Bill had thrust the new honor of being
1648: a polling-place, had been, at the beginning of the century, quite a
1649: typical old market-town, lying in pleasant sleepiness among green
1650: pastures, with a rush-fringed river meandering through them. Its
1651: principal street had various handsome and tall-windowed brick houses
1652: with walled gardens behind them; and at the end, where it widened into
1653: the market-place, there was the cheerful rough-stuccoed front of that
1654: excellent inn, the Marquis of Granby, where the farmers put up their
1655: gigs, not only on fair and market days, but on exceptional Sundays when
1656: they came to church. And the church was one of those fine old English
1657: structures worth travelling to see, standing in a broad churchyard with
1658: a line of solemn yew-trees beside it, and lifting a majestic tower and
1659: spire far above the red-and-purple roofs of the town. It was not large
1660: enough to hold all the parishioners of a parish which stretched over
1661: distant villages and hamlets; but then they were never so unreasonable
1662: as to wish to be all in at once, and had never complained that the space
1663: of a large side-chapel was taken up by the tombs of the Debarrys, and
1664: shut in by a handsome iron screen. For when the black Benedictines
1665: ceased to pray and chant in this church, when the Blessed Virgin and St.
1666: Gregory were expelled, the Debarrys, as lords of the manor, naturally
1667: came next to Providence and took the place of the saints. Long before
1668: that time, indeed, there had been a Sir Maximus Debarry who had been at
1669: the fortifying of the old castle, which now stood in ruins in the midst
1670: of the green pastures, and with its sheltering wall toward the north
1671: made an excellent strawyard for the pigs of Wace & Co., brewers of the
1672: celebrated Treby beer. Wace & Co. did not stand alone in the town as
1673: prosperous traders on a large scale, to say nothing of those who had
1674: retired from business; and in no country town of the same small size as
1675: Treby was there a larger proportion of families who had handsome sets of
1676: china without handles, hereditary punch-bowls, and large silver ladles
1677: with a Queen Anne's guinea in the centre. Such people naturally took tea
1678: and supped together frequently; and as there was no professional man or
1679: tradesman in Treby who was not connected by business, if not by blood,
1680: with the farmers of the district, the richer sort of these were much
1681: invited, and gave invitations in their turn. They played at whist, ate
1682: and drank generously, praised Mr. Pitt and the war as keeping up prices
1683: and religion, and were very humorous about each other's property, having
1684: much the same coy pleasure in allusions to their secret ability to
1685: purchase, as blushing lasses sometimes have in jokes about their secret
1686: preferences. The rector was always of the Debarry family, associated
1687: only with county people, and was much respected for his affability; a
1688: clergyman who would have taken tea with the townspeople would have given
1689: a dangerous shock to the mind of a Treby churchman.
1690: 
1691: Such was the old-fashioned, grazing, brewing, wool-packing,
1692: cheese-loading life of Treby Magna, until there befell new conditions,
1693: complicating its relation with the rest of the world, and gradually
1694: awakening in it that higher consciousness which is known to bring higher
1695: pains. First came the canal; next, the working of the coal-mines at
1696: Sproxton, two miles off the town; and thirdly, the discovery of a saline
1697: spring, which suggested to a too constructive brain the possibility of
1698: turning Treby Magna into a fashionable watering-place. So daring an idea
1699: was not originated by a native Trebian, but by a young lawyer who came
1700: from a distance, knew the dictionary by heart, and was probably an
1701: illegitimate son of somebody or other. The idea, although it promised an
1702: increase of wealth to the town, was not well received at first; ladies
1703: objected to seeing "objects" drawn about in hand-carriages, the doctor
1704: foresaw the advent of unsound practitioners, and most retail tradesmen
1705: concurred with him that new doings were usually for the advantage of new
1706: people. The more unanswerable reasoners urged that Treby had prospered
1707: without baths, and it was yet to be seen how it would prosper with them;
1708: while a report that the proposed name for them was Bethesda Spa,
1709: threatened to give the whole affair a blasphemous aspect. Even Sir
1710: Maximus Debarry, who was to have an unprecedented return for the
1711: thousands he would lay out on a pump-room and hotel, regarded the thing
1712: as a little too new, and held back for some time. But the persuasive
1713: powers of the young lawyer, Mr. Matthew Jermyn, together with the
1714: opportune opening of a stone-quarry, triumphed at last; the handsome
1715: buildings were erected, an excellent guide-book and descriptive cards,
1716: surmounted by vignettes, were printed, and Treby Magna became conscious
1717: of certain facts in its own history of which it had previously been in
1718: contented ignorance.
1719: 
1720: But it was all in vain. The Spa, for some mysterious reason, did not
1721: succeed. Some attributed the failure to the coal-mines and the canal;
1722: others to the peace, which had had ruinous effects on the country; and
1723: others, who disliked Jermyn, to the original folly of the plan. Among
1724: these last was Sir Maximus himself, who never forgave the too persuasive
1725: attorney: it was Jermyn's fault not only that a useless hotel had been
1726: built, but that he, Sir Maximus, being straitened for money, had at last
1727: let the building, with the adjacent land lying on the river, on a long
1728: lease, on the supposition that it was to be turned into a tape
1729: manufactory--a bitter thing to any gentleman, and especially to the
1730: representative of one of the oldest families in England.
1731: 
1732: In this way it happened that Treby Magna gradually passed from being
1733: simply a respectable market town--the heart of a great rural district,
1734: where the trade was only such as had close relations with the local
1735: landed interest--and took on the more complex life brought by mines and
1736: manufactures, which belong more directly to the great circulating system
1737: of the nation than to the local system to which they had been
1738: superadded; and in this way it was that Trebian Dissent gradually
1739: altered its character. Formerly it had been of a quiescent, well-to-do
1740: kind, represented architecturally by a small, venerable, dark-pewed
1741: chapel, built by Presbyterians, but long occupied by a sparse
1742: congregation of Independents, who were as little moved by doctrinal zeal
1743: as their church-going neighbors, and did not feel themselves deficient
1744: in religious liberty, inasmuch as they were not hindered from
1745: occasionally slumbering in their pews, and were not obliged to go
1746: regularly to the weekly prayer-meeting. But when stone-pits and
1747: coal-pits made new hamlets that threatened to spread up to the very
1748: town, when the tape-weavers came with their news-reading inspectors and
1749: book-keepers, the Independent chapel began to be filled with eager men
1750: and women, to whom the exceptional possession of religious truth was the
1751: condition which reconciled them to a meagre existence, and made them
1752: feel in secure alliance with the unseen but supreme rule of a world in
1753: which their own visible part was small. There were Dissenters in Treby
1754: now who could not be regarded by the Church people in the light of old
1755: neighbors to whom the habit of going to chapel was an innocent,
1756: unenviable inheritance along with a particular house and garden, a
1757: tan-yard, or a grocery business--Dissenters who, in their turn, without
1758: meaning to be in the least abusive, spoke of the high-bred rector as a
1759: blind leader of the blind. And Dissent was not the only thing that the
1760: times had altered; prices had fallen, poor-rates had risen, rent and
1761: tithe were not elastic enough, and the farmer's fat sorrow had become
1762: lean; he began to speculate on causes, and to trace things back to that
1763: causeless mystery, the cessation of one-pound notes. Thus, when
1764: political agitation swept in a current through the country, Treby Magna
1765: was prepared to vibrate. The Catholic Emancipation Bill opened the eyes
1766: of neighbors and made them aware how very injurious they were to each
1767: other and to the welfare of mankind generally. Mr. Tiliot, the Church
1768: spirit-merchant, knew now that Mr. Nuttwood, the obliging grocer, was
1769: one of those Dissenters, Deists, Socinians, Papists, and Radicals, who
1770: were in league to destroy the Constitution. A retired old London
1771: tradesman, who was believed to understand politics, said that thinking
1772: people must wish George III were alive again in all his early vigor of
1773: mind: and even the farmers became less materialistic in their view of
1774: causes, and referred much to the agency of the devil and the Irish
1775: Romans. The rector, the Reverend Augustus Debarry, really a fine
1776: specimen of the old-fashioned aristocratic clergyman, preaching short
1777: sermons, understanding business, and acting liberally about his tithe,
1778: had never before found himself in collision with Dissenters; but now he
1779: began to feel that these people were a nuisance in the parish, that his
1780: brother Sir Maximus must take care lest they should get land to build
1781: more chapels, and that it might not have been a bad thing if the law had
1782: furnished him as a magistrate with a power of putting a stop to the
1783: political sermons of the Independent preacher, which, in their way,
1784: were as pernicious sources of intoxication as the beerhouses. The
1785: Dissenters, on their side, were not disposed to sacrifice the cause of
1786: truth and freedom to a temporizing mildness of language; but they
1787: defended themselves from the charge of religious indifference, and
1788: solemnly disclaimed any lax expectations that Catholics were likely to
1789: be saved--urging, on the contrary, that they were not too hopeful about
1790: Protestants who adhered to a bloated and worldly Prelacy. Thus Treby
1791: Magna, which had lived quietly through the great earthquakes of the
1792: French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars, which had remained unmoved by
1793: the "Rights of Man," and saw little in Mr. Cobbett's "Weekly Register"
1794: except that he held eccentric views about potatoes, began at last to
1795: know the higher pains of a dim political consciousness; and the
1796: development had been greatly helped by the recent agitation about the
1797: Reform Bill. Tory, Whig, and Radical did not perhaps become clearer in
1798: their definition of each other; but the names seemed to acquire so
1799: strong a stamp of honor or infamy, that definitions would only have
1800: weakened the impression. As to the short and easy method of judging
1801: opinions by the personal character of those who held them, it was liable
1802: to be much frustrated in Treby. It so happened in that particular town
1803: that the Reformers were not all of them large-hearted patriots or ardent
1804: lovers of justice; indeed, one of them, in the very midst of the
1805: agitation, was detected in using unequal scales--a fact to which many
1806: Tories pointed with disgust as showing plainly enough, without further
1807: argument, that the cry for a change in the representative system was
1808: hollow trickery. Again, the Tories were far from being all oppressors,
1809: disposed to grind down the working classes into serfdom; and it was
1810: undeniable that the inspector at the tape manufactory, who spoke with
1811: much eloquence on the extension of the suffrage, was a more tyrannical
1812: personage than open-handed Mr. Wace, whose chief political tenet was
1813: that it was all nonsense to give men votes when they had no stake in the
1814: country. On the other hand there were some Tories who gave themselves a
1815: great deal of leisure to abuse hypocrites, Radicals, Dissenters, and
1816: atheism generally, but whose inflamed faces, theistic swearing, and
1817: frankness in expressing a wish to borrow, certainly did not mark them
1818: out strongly as holding opinions likely to save society.
1819: 
1820: The Reformers had triumphed: it was clear that the wheels were going
1821: whither they were pulling, and they were in fine spirits for exertion.
1822: But if they were pulling toward the country's ruin, there was the more
1823: need for others to hang on behind and get the wheels to stick if
1824: possible. In Treby, as elsewhere, people were told they must "rally" at
1825: the coming election; but there was now a large number of waverers--men
1826: of flexible, practical minds, who were not such bigots as to cling to
1827: any views when a good tangible reason could be urged against them; while
1828: some regarded it as the most neighborly thing to hold a little with both
1829: sides, and were not sure that they should rally or vote at all. It
1830: seemed an invidious thing to vote for one gentleman rather than another.
1831: 
1832: These social changes in Treby parish are comparatively public matters,
1833: and this history is chiefly concerned with the private lot of a few men
1834: and women; but there is no private life which has not been determined by
1835: a wider public life, from the time when the primeval milkmaid had to
1836: wander with the wanderings of her clan, because the cow she milked was
1837: one of a herd which had made the pastures bare. Even in that
1838: conservatory existence where the fair Camellia is sighed for by the
1839: noble young Pine-apple, neither of them needing to care about the frost,
1840: or rain outside, there is a nether apparatus of hot water pipes liable
1841: to cool down on a strike of the gardeners or a scarcity of coal. And the
1842: lives we are about to look back upon do not belong to those conservatory
1843: species; they are rooted in the common earth, having to endure all the
1844: ordinary chances of past and present weather. As to the weather of 1832,
1845: the Zadkiel of that time had predicted that the electrical condition of
1846: the clouds in the political hemisphere would produce unusual
1847: perturbations in organic existence, and he would perhaps have seen a
1848: fulfillment of his remarkable prophecy in that mutual influence of
1849: dissimilar destinies which we shall see gradually unfolding itself. For
1850: if the mixed political conditions of Treby Magna had not been acted on
1851: by the passing of the Reform Bill, Mr. Harold Transome would not have
1852: presented himself as a candidate for North Loamshire, Treby would not
1853: have been a polling-place, Mr. Matthew Jermyn would not have been on
1854: affable terms with a Dissenting preacher and his flock, and the
1855: venerable town would not have been placarded with handbills, more or
1856: less complimentary and retrospective--conditions in this case essential
1857: to the "where," and the "what," without which, as the learned know,
1858: there can be no event whatever.
1859: 
1860: For example, it was through these conditions that a young man named
1861: Felix Holt made a considerable difference in the life of Harold
1862: Transome, though nature and fortune seemed to have done what they could
1863: to keep the lots of the two men quite aloof from each other. Felix was
1864: heir to nothing better than a quack medicine; his mother lived up a back
1865: street in Treby Magna, and her sitting-room was ornamented with her best
1866: tea-tray and several framed testimonials to the virtues of Holt's
1867: Cathartic Lozenges and Holt's Restorative Elixir. There could hardly
1868: have been a lot less like Harold Transome's than this of the quack
1869: doctor's son, except in the superficial facts that he called himself a
1870: Radical, that he was the only son of his mother, and that he had lately
1871: returned to his home with ideas and resolves not a little disturbing to
1872: that mother's mind.
1873: 
1874: But Mrs. Holt, unlike Mrs. Transome, was much disposed to reveal her
1875: troubles, and was not without a counsellor into whose ear she could pour
1876: them. On this second of September, when Mr. Harold Transome had had his
1877: first interview with Jermyn, and when the attorney went back to his
1878: office with new views of canvassing in his mind, Mrs. Holt had put on
1879: her bonnet as early as nine o'clock in the morning, and had gone to see
1880: the Reverend Rufus Lyon, minister of the Independent Chapel usually
1881: spoken of as "Malthouse Yard."
1882: 
1883: 
1884: 
1885: 
1886: CHAPTER IV.
1887: 
1888:     "A pious and painful preacher."--FULLER.
1889: 
1890: 
1891: Mr. Lyon lived in a small house, not quite so good as the parish
1892: clerk's, adjoining the entry which led to the Chapel Yard. The new
1893: prosperity of Dissent at Treby had led to an enlargement of the chapel,
1894: which absorbed all extra funds and left none for the enlargement of the
1895: minister's income. He sat this morning, as usual, in a low up-stairs
1896: room, called his study, which, by means of a closet capable of holding
1897: his bed, served also as a sleeping-room. The bookshelves did not suffice
1898: for his store of old books, which lay about him in piles so arranged as
1899: to leave narrow lanes between them; for the minister was much given to
1900: walking about during his hours of meditation, and very narrow passages
1901: would serve for his small legs, unencumbered by any other drapery than
1902: his black silk stockings and the flexible, though prominent, bows of
1903: black ribbon that tied his knee-breeches. He was walking about now, with
1904: his hands clasped behind him, an attitude in which his body seemed to
1905: bear about the same proportion to his head as the lower part of a stone
1906: Hermes bears to the carven image that crowns it. His face looked old and
1907: worn, yet the curtain of hair that fell from his bald crown and hung
1908: about his neck retained much of its original auburn tint, and his large,
1909: brown, short-sighted eyes were still clear and bright. At the first
1910: glance, every one thought him a very odd-looking rusty old man; the
1911: free-school boys often hooted after him, and called him "Revelations";
1912: and to many respectable Church people, old Lyon's little legs and large
1913: head seemed to make Dissent additionally preposterous. But he was too
1914: short-sighted to notice those who tittered at him--too absent from the
1915: world of small facts and petty impulses in which titterers live. With
1916: Satan to argue against on matters of vital experience as well as of
1917: church government, with great texts to meditate on, which seemed to get
1918: deeper as he tried to fathom them, it had never occurred to him to
1919: reflect what sort of image his small person made on the retina of a
1920: light-minded beholder. The good Rufus had his ire and his egoism; but
1921: they existed only as the red heat which gave force to his belief and his
1922: teaching. He was susceptible concerning the true office of deacons in
1923: the primitive Church, and his small nervous body was jarred from head to
1924: foot by the concussion of an argument to which he saw no answer. In
1925: fact, the only moments when he could be said to be really conscious of
1926: his body, were when he trembled under the pressure of some agitating
1927: thought.
1928: 
1929: He was meditating on the text for his Sunday morning sermon, "And all
1930: the people said, Amen"--a mere mustard-seed of a text, which had split
1931: at first only into two divisions, "What was said," and "Who said it";
1932: but these were growing into a many-branched discourse, and the
1933: preacher's eyes dilated, and a smile played about his mouth till, as his
1934: manner was, when he felt happily inspired, he had begun to utter his
1935: thoughts aloud in the varied measure and cadence habitual to him,
1936: changing from a rapid but distinct undertone to a loud emphatic
1937: _rallentando_.
1938: 
1939: "My brethren, do you think that great shout was raised in Israel by each
1940: man's waiting to say 'amen' till his neighbors had said amen? Do you
1941: think there will be a great shout for the right--the shout of a nation
1942: as of one man, rounded and whole, like the voice of the archangel that
1943: bound together all the listeners of earth and heaven--if every Christian
1944: of you peeps round to see what his neighbors in good coats are doing, or
1945: else puts his hat before his face that he may shout and never be heard?
1946: But this is what you do: when the servant of God stands up to deliver
1947: his message, do you lay your souls beneath the Word as you set out your
1948: plants beneath the falling rain? No; one of you sends his eyes to all
1949: corners, he smothers his soul with small questions, 'What does brother
1950: Y. think?' 'Is this doctrine high enough for brother Z.?' 'Will the
1951: church members be pleased?' And another----"
1952: 
1953: Here the door was opened, and old Lyddy, the minister's servant, put in
1954: her head to say, in a tone of despondency, finishing with a groan, "Here
1955: is Mrs. Holt wanting to speak to you; she says she comes out of season,
1956: but she's in trouble."
1957: 
1958: "Lyddy," said Mr. Lyon, falling at once into a quiet conversational
1959: tone, "if you are wrestling with the enemy, let me refer you to Ezekiel
1960: the thirteenth and twenty-second, and beg of you not to groan. It is a
1961: stumbling-block and offence to my daughter; she would take no broth
1962: yesterday, because she said you had cried into it. Thus you cause the
1963: truth to be lightly spoken of, and make the enemy rejoice. If your
1964: faceache gives him an advantage, take a little warm ale with your
1965: meat--I do not grudge the money."
1966: 
1967: "If I thought my drinking warm ale would hinder poor dear Miss Esther
1968: from speaking light--but she hates the smell of it."
1969: 
1970: "Answer not again, Lyddy, but send up Mistress Holt to me."
1971: 
1972: Lyddy closed the door immediately.
1973: 
1974: "I lack grace to deal with these weak sisters," said the minister, again
1975: thinking aloud, and walking. "Their needs lie too much out of the track
1976: of my meditations, and take me often unawares. Mistress Holt is another
1977: who darkens counsel by words without knowledge, and angers the reason of
1978: the natural man. Lord, give me patience. My sins were heavier to bear
1979: than this woman's folly. Come in, Mrs. Holt--come in."
1980: 
1981: He hastened to disencumber a chair of Matthew Henry's Commentary, and
1982: begged his visitor to be seated. She was a tall elderly woman, dressed
1983: in black, with a light-brown front and a black band over her forehead.
1984: She moved the chair a little and seated herself in it with some
1985: emphasis, looking fixedly at the opposite wall with a hurt and
1986: argumentative expression. Mr. Lyon had placed himself in the chair
1987: against his desk, and waited with the resolute resignation of a patient
1988: who is about to undergo an operation. But his visitor did not speak.
1989: 
1990: "You have something on your mind, Mrs. Holt?" he said, at last.
1991: 
1992: "Indeed I have, sir, else I shouldn't be here."
1993: 
1994: "Speak freely."
1995: 
1996: "It's well known to you, Mr. Lyon, that my husband, Mr. Holt, came from
1997: the north, and was a member in Malthouse Yard long before _you_ began
1998: to be pastor of it, which was seven year ago last Michaelmas. It's the
1999: truth, Mr. Lyon, and I'm not that woman to sit here and say it if it
2000: wasn't true."
2001: 
2002: "Certainly, it is true."
2003: 
2004: "And if my husband had been alive when you'd come to preach upon trial,
2005: he'd have been as good a judge of your gifts as Mr. Nuttwood or Mr.
2006: Muscat, though whether he'd have agreed with some that your doctrine
2007: wasn't high enough, I can't say. For myself, I've my opinion about high
2008: doctrine."
2009: 
2010: "Was it my preaching you came to speak about?" said the minister,
2011: hurrying in the question.
2012: 
2013: "No, Mr. Lyon, I'm not that woman. But this I _will_ say, for my husband
2014: died before your time, that he had a wonderful gift in prayer, as the
2015: old members well know, if anybody likes to ask 'em, not believing my
2016: words, and he believed himself that the receipt for the Cancer Cure,
2017: which I've sent out in bottles till this very last April before
2018: September as now is, and have bottles standing by me--he believed it was
2019: sent to him in answer to prayer; and nobody can deny it, for he prayed
2020: most regular, and read out of the green baize Bible."
2021: 
2022: Mrs. Holt paused, appearing to think that Mr. Lyon had been successfully
2023: confuted, and should show himself convinced.
2024: 
2025: "Has any one been aspersing your husband's character?" said Mr. Lyon,
2026: with a slight initiative toward that relief of groaning for which he had
2027: reproved Lyddy.
2028: 
2029: "Sir, they daredn't. For though he was a man of prayer, he didn't want
2030: skill and knowledge to find things out for himself; and that's what I
2031: used to say to _my_ friends when they wondered at my marrying a man from
2032: Lancashire, with no trade nor fortune, but what he'd got in his head.
2033: But my husband's tongue 'ud have been a fortune to anybody, and there
2034: was many a one said it was as good as a dose of physic to hear him talk;
2035: not but what that got him into trouble in Lancashire, but he always
2036: said, if the worst came to the worst, he could go and preach to the
2037: blacks. But he did better than that, Mr. Lyon, for he married me; and
2038: this I will say, that for age, and conduct, and managing----"
2039: 
2040: "Mistress Holt," interrupted the minister, "these are not the things
2041: whereby we may edify one another. Let me beg of you to be as brief as
2042: you can. My time is not my own."
2043: 
2044: "Well, Mr. Lyon, I've a right to my own character; and I'm one of your
2045: congregation, though I'm not a church member, for I was born in the
2046: General Baptist connection: and as for being saved without works,
2047: there's a many, I dare say, can't do without that doctrine; but I thank
2048: the Lord I never needed to put _my_self on a level with the thief on the
2049: cross. I've done _my_ duty, and more, if anybody comes to that; for I've
2050: gone without my bit of meat to make broth for a sick neighbor: and if
2051: there's any of the church members say they've done the same, I'd ask
2052: them if they had the sinking at the stomach as I have; for I've ever
2053: strove to do the right thing, and more, for good-natured I always was;
2054: and I little thought, after being respected by everybody, I should come
2055: to be reproached by my own son. And my husband said, when he was
2056: a-dying--'Mary,' he said, 'the Elixir, and the Pills, and the Cure will
2057: support you, for they've a great name in all the country round, and
2058: you'll pray for a blessing on them.' And so I've done, Mr. Lyon; and to
2059: say they're not good medicines, when they've been taken for fifty miles
2060: round by high and low, rich and poor, and nobody speaking against 'em
2061: but Dr. Lukin, it seems to me it's a flying in the face of Heaven; for
2062: if it was wrong to take the medicines, couldn't the blessed Lord have
2063: stopped it?"
2064: 
2065: Mrs. Holt was not given to tears; she was much sustained by conscious
2066: unimpeachableness, and by an argumentative tendency which usually checks
2067: the too great activity of the lachrymal gland; nevertheless her eyes had
2068: become moist, her fingers played on her knee in an agitated manner, and
2069: she finally plucked a bit of her gown and held it with great nicety
2070: between her thumb and finger. Mr. Lyon, however, by listening
2071: attentively, had begun partly to divine the source of her trouble.
2072: 
2073: "Am I wrong in gathering from what you say, Mistress Holt, that your son
2074: has objected in some way to your sale of your late husband's medicines?"
2075: 
2076: "Mr. Lyon, he's masterful beyond everything, and he talks more than his
2077: father did. I've got my reason, Mr. Lyon, and if anybody talks sense I
2078: can follow him; but Felix talks so wild, and contradicts his mother. And
2079: what do you think he says, after giving up his 'prenticeship, and going
2080: off to study at Glasgow, and getting through all the bit of money his
2081: father saved for his bringing-up--what has all his learning come to? He
2082: says I'd better never open my Bible, for it's as bad poison to me as the
2083: pills are to half the people as swallow 'em. You'll not speak of this
2084: again, Mr. Lyon--I don't think ill enough of you to believe _that_. For
2085: I suppose a Christian can understand the word o' God without going to
2086: Glasgow, and there's texts upon texts about ointment and medicine, and
2087: there's one as might have been for a receipt of my husband's--it's just
2088: as if it was a riddle, and Holt's Elixir was the answer."
2089: 
2090: "Your son uses rash words, Mistress Holt," said the minister, "but it is
2091: quite true that we may err in giving a too private interpretation to the
2092: Scripture. The word of God has to satisfy the larger needs of His
2093: people, like the rain and the sunshine--which no man must think to be
2094: meant for his own patch of seed-ground solely. Will it not be well that
2095: I should see your son, and talk with him on these matters? He was at
2096: chapel, I observe, and I suppose I am to be his pastor."
2097: 
2098: "That was what I wanted to ask you, Mr. Lyon. For perhaps he'll listen
2099: to you, and not talk you down as he does his poor mother. For after we'd
2100: been to chapel, he spoke better of you than he does of most: he said you
2101: was a fine old fellow, and an old-fashioned Puritan--he uses dreadful
2102: language, Mr. Lyon; but I saw he didn't mean you ill, for all that. He
2103: calls most folks's religion rottenness; and yet another time he'll tell
2104: me I ought to feel myself a sinner, and do God's will and not my own.
2105: But it's my belief he says first one thing and then another only to
2106: abuse his mother. Or else he's going off his head, and must be sent to a
2107: 'sylum. But if he writes to the _North Loamshire Herald_ first, to tell
2108: everybody the medicines are good for nothing, how can I ever keep him
2109: and myself?"
2110: 
2111: "Tell him I shall feel favored if he will come and see me this evening,"
2112: said Mr. Lyon, not without a little prejudice in favor of the young man,
2113: whose language about the preacher in Malthouse Yard did not seem to him
2114: to be altogether dreadful. "Meanwhile, my friend, I counsel you to send
2115: up a supplication, which I shall not fail to offer also, that you may
2116: receive a spirit of humility and submission, so that you may not be
2117: hindered from seeing and following the Divine guidance in this matter by
2118: any false lights of pride and obstinacy. Of this more when I have spoken
2119: with your son."
2120: 
2121: "I'm not proud or obstinate, Mr. Lyon. I never did say I was everything
2122: that was bad, and I never will. And why this trouble should be sent on
2123: me above everybody else--for I haven't told you all. He's made himself a
2124: journeyman to Mr. Prowd the watchmaker--after all this learning--and he
2125: says he'll go with patches on his knees, and he shall like himself the
2126: better. And as for him having little boys to teach, they'll come in all
2127: weathers with dirty shoes. If it's madness, Mr. Lyon, it's no use your
2128: talking to him."
2129: 
2130: "We shall see. Perhaps it may even be the disguised working of grace
2131: within him. We must not judge rashly. Many eminent servants of God have
2132: been led by ways as strange."
2133: 
2134: "Then I'm sorry for their mothers, that's all, Mr. Lyon; and all the
2135: more if they'd been well-spoken-on women. For not my biggest enemy,
2136: whether it's he or she, if they'll speak the truth, can turn round and
2137: say I've deserved this trouble. And when everybody gets their due, and
2138: people's doings are spoke of on the house-tops, as the Bible says they
2139: will be, it'll be known what I've gone through with those medicines--the
2140: pounding and the pouring, and the letting stand, and the weighing--up
2141: early and down late--there's nobody knows yet but One that's worthy to
2142: know; and the pasting o' the printed labels right side upwards. There's
2143: few women would have gone through with it; and it's reasonable to think
2144: it'll be made up to me; for if there's promised and purchased blessings,
2145: I should think this trouble is purchasing 'em. For if my son Felix
2146: doesn't have a strait-waistcoat put on him, he'll have his way. But I
2147: say no more. I wish you good-morning, Mr. Lyon, and thank you, though I
2148: well know it's your duty to act as you're doing. And I never troubled
2149: you about my own soul, as some do who look down on me for not being a
2150: church member."
2151: 
2152: "Farewell, Mistress Holt, farewell. I pray that a more powerful teacher
2153: than I am may instruct you."
2154: 
2155: The door was closed, and the much-tried Rufus walked about again, saying
2156: aloud, groaningly--
2157: 
2158: "This woman has sat under the Gospel all her life, and she is as blind
2159: as a heathen, and as proud and stiff-necked as a Pharisee; yet she is
2160: one of the souls I watch for. 'Tis true that even Sara, the chosen
2161: mother of God's people, showed a spirit of unbelief, and perhaps of
2162: selfish anger; and it is a passage that bears the unmistakable signet,
2163: 'doing honor to the wife or woman, as unto the weaker vessel.' For
2164: therein is the greatest check put on the ready scorn of the natural
2165: man."
2166: 
2167: 
2168: 
2169: 
2170: CHAPTER V.
2171: 
2172:     1ST CITIZEN. Sir, there's a hurry in the veins of youth
2173:                  That makes a vice of virtue by excess.
2174: 
2175:     2D CITIZEN.  What if the coolness of our tardier veins
2176:                  Be loss of virtue?
2177: 
2178:     1ST CITIZEN.                      All things cool with time--
2179:                  The sun itself, they say, till heat shall find
2180:                  A general level, nowhere in excess.
2181: 
2182:     2D CITIZEN.  'Tis a poor climax, to my weaker thought,
2183:                  That future middlingness.
2184: 
2185: 
2186: In the evening, when Mr. Lyon was expecting the knock at the door that
2187: would announce Felix Holt, he occupied his cushionless arm-chair in the
2188: sitting-room, and was skimming rapidly, in his short-sighted way, by the
2189: light of one candle, the pages of a missionary report, emitting
2190: occasionally a slight "Hm-m" that appeared to be expressive of criticism
2191: rather than of approbation. The room was dismally furnished, the only
2192: objects indicating an intention of ornament being a bookcase, a map of
2193: the Holy Land, an engraved portrait of Dr. Doddridge, and a black bust
2194: with a colored face, which for some reason or other was covered with
2195: green gauze. Yet any one whose attention was quite awake must have been
2196: aware, even on entering, of certain things that were incongruous with
2197: the general air of sombreness and privation. There was a delicate scent
2198: of dried rose-leaves; the light by which the minister was reading was a
2199: wax-candle in a white earthenware candle-stick, and the table on the
2200: opposite side of the fireplace held a dainty work-basket frilled with
2201: blue satin.
2202: 
2203: Felix Holt, when he entered, was not in an observant mood; and when,
2204: after seating himself, at the minister's invitation, near the little
2205: table which held the work-basket, he stared at the wax-candle opposite
2206: to him, he did so without any wonder or consciousness that the candle
2207: was not of tallow. But the minister's sensitiveness gave another
2208: interpretation to the gaze which he divined rather than saw; and in
2209: alarm lest this inconsistent extravagance should obstruct his
2210: usefulness, he hastened to say--
2211: 
2212: "You are doubtless amazed to see me with a wax-light, my young friend;
2213: but this undue luxury is paid for with the earnings of my daughter, who
2214: is so delicately framed that the smell of tallow is loathsome to her."
2215: 
2216: "I heeded not the candle, sir. I thank Heaven I am not a mouse to have a
2217: nose that takes note of wax or tallow."
2218: 
2219: The loud abrupt tones made the old man vibrate a little. He had been
2220: stroking his chin gently before, with a sense that he must be very
2221: quiet and deliberate in his treatment of the eccentric young man; but
2222: now, quite unreflectingly, he drew forth a pair of spectacles, which he
2223: was in the habit of using when he wanted to observe his interlocutor
2224: more closely than usual.
2225: 
2226: "And I myself, in fact, am equally indifferent," he said, as he opened
2227: and adjusted his glasses, "so that I have a sufficient light on my
2228: book." Here his large eyes looked discerningly through the spectacles.
2229: 
2230: "'Tis the quality of the page you care about, not of the candle," said
2231: Felix, smiling pleasantly enough at his inspector. "You're thinking that
2232: you have a roughly-written page before you now."
2233: 
2234: That was true. The minister, accustomed to the respectable air of
2235: provincial townsmen, and especially to the sleek well-clipped gravity of
2236: his own male congregation, felt a slight shock as his glasses made
2237: perfectly clear to him the shaggy-headed, large-eyed, strong-limbed
2238: person of this questionable young man, without waistcoat or cravat. But
2239: the possibility, supported by some of Mrs. Holt's words, that a
2240: disguised work of grace might be going on in the son of whom she
2241: complained so bitterly, checked any hasty interpretations.
2242: 
2243: "I abstain from judging by the outward appearance only," he answered,
2244: with his usual simplicity. "I myself have experienced that when the
2245: spirit is much exercised it is difficult to remember neck-bands and
2246: strings and such small accidents of our vesture, which are nevertheless
2247: decent and needful so long as we sojourn in the flesh. And you, too, my
2248: young friend, as I gather from your mother's troubled and confused
2249: report, are undergoing some travail of mind. You will not, I trust,
2250: object to open yourself fully to me, as to an aged pastor who has
2251: himself had much inward wrestling, and has especially known much
2252: temptation from doubt."
2253: 
2254: "As to doubt," said Felix, loudly and brusquely as before, "if it is
2255: those absurd medicines and gulling advertisements that my mother has
2256: been talking of to you--and I suppose it is--I've no more doubt about
2257: _them_ than I have about pocket-picking. I know there's a stage of
2258: speculation in which a man may doubt whether a pickpocket is
2259: blameworthy--but I'm not one of your subtle fellows who keep looking at
2260: the world through their own legs. If I allowed the sale of those
2261: medicines to go on, and my mother to live out of the proceeds when I can
2262: keep her by the honest labor of my hands, I've not the least doubt that
2263: I should be a rascal."
2264: 
2265: "I would fain enquire more particularly into your objection to these
2266: medicines," said Mr. Lyon, gravely. Notwithstanding his
2267: conscientiousness and a certain originality in his own mental
2268: disposition, he was too little used to high principle quite dissociated
2269: from sectarian phraseology to be as immediately in sympathy with it as
2270: he would otherwise have been. "I know they have been well reported of,
2271: and many wise persons have tried remedies providentially discovered by
2272: those who are not regular physicians, and have found a blessing in the
2273: use of them. I may mention the eminent Mr. Wesley, who, though I hold
2274: not altogether with his Arminian doctrine, nor with the usages of his
2275: institutions, was nevertheless a man of God; and the journals of various
2276: Christians whose names have left a sweet savor, might be cited in the
2277: same sense. Moreover, your father, who originally concocted these
2278: medicines and left them as a provision for your mother, was, as I
2279: understand, a man whose walk was not unfaithful."
2280: 
2281: "My father was ignorant," said Felix, bluntly. "He knew neither the
2282: complication of the human system, nor the way in which drugs counteract
2283: each other. Ignorance is not so damnable as humbug, but when it
2284: prescribes pills it may happen to do more harm. I know something about
2285: these things. I was 'prentice for five miserable years to a stupid brute
2286: of a country apothecary--my poor father left money for that--he thought
2287: nothing could be finer for me. No matter: I know that the Cathartic
2288: Pills are a drastic compound which may be as bad as poison to half the
2289: people who swallow them; that the Elixir is an absurd farrago of a dozen
2290: incompatible things; and that the Cancer Cure might as well be bottled
2291: ditch-water."
2292: 
2293: Mr. Lyon rose and walked up and down the room. His simplicity was
2294: strongly mixed with sagacity as well as sectarian prejudice, and he did
2295: not rely at once on a loud-spoken integrity--Satan might have flavored
2296: it with ostentation. Presently he asked, in a rapid, low tone, "How long
2297: have you known this, young man?"
2298: 
2299: "Well put, sir," said Felix. "I've known it a good deal longer than I
2300: have acted upon it, like plenty of other things. But you believe in
2301: conversion?"
2302: 
2303: "Yea, verily."
2304: 
2305: "So do I. I was converted by six weeks' debauchery."
2306: 
2307: The minister started. "Young man," he said, solemnly, going up close to
2308: Felix and laying a hand on his shoulder, "speak not lightly of the
2309: Divine operations, and restrain unseemly words."
2310: 
2311: "I'm not speaking lightly," said Felix. "If I had not seen that I was
2312: making a hog of myself very fast, and that pig-wash, even if I could
2313: have got plenty of it, was a poor sort of thing, I should never have
2314: looked life fairly in the face to see what was to be done with it. I
2315: laughed out loud at last to think that a poor devil like me, in a Scotch
2316: garret, with my stockings out at heel and a shilling or two to be
2317: dissipated upon, with a smell of raw haggis mounting from below, and old
2318: women breathing gin as they passed me on the stairs--wanting to turn my
2319: life into easy pleasure. Then I began to see what else it could be
2320: turned into. Not much, perhaps. This world is not a very fine place for
2321: a good many of the people in it. But I've made up my mind it shan't be
2322: the worse for me, if I can help it. They may tell me I can't alter the
2323: world--that there must be a certain number of sneaks and robbers in it,
2324: and if I don't lie and filch somebody else will. Well then, somebody
2325: else shall, for I won't. That's the upshot of my conversion, Mr. Lyon,
2326: if you want to know it."
2327: 
2328: Mr. Lyon removed his hand from Felix's shoulder and walked about again.
2329: "Did you sit under any preacher at Glasgow, young man?"
2330: 
2331: "No: I heard most of the preachers once, but I never wanted to hear them
2332: twice."
2333: 
2334: The good Rufus was not without a slight rising of resentment at this
2335: young man's want of reverence. It was not yet plain whether he wanted to
2336: hear twice the preacher in Malthouse Yard. But the resentful feeling was
2337: carefully repressed: a soul in so peculiar a condition must be dealt
2338: with delicately.
2339: 
2340: "And now, may I ask," he said, "what course you mean to take, after
2341: hindering your mother from making and selling these drugs? I speak no
2342: more in their favor after what you have said. God forbid that I should
2343: strive to hinder you from seeking whatsoever things are honest and
2344: honorable. But your mother is advanced in years; she needs comfortable
2345: sustenance; you have doubtless considered how you may make her amends?
2346: 'He that provideth not for his own----' I trust you respect the
2347: authority that so speaks. And I will not suppose that, after being
2348: tender of conscience toward strangers, you will be careless toward your
2349: mother. There be indeed some who, taking a mighty charge on their
2350: shoulder, must perforce leave their households to Providence, and to the
2351: care of humbler brethren, but in such a case the call must be clear."
2352: 
2353: "I shall keep my mother as well--nay, better--than she has kept herself.
2354: She has always been frugal. With my watch and clock cleaning, and
2355: teaching one or two little chaps that I've got to come to me, I can earn
2356: enough. As for me, I can live on bran porridge. I have the stomach of a
2357: rhinoceros."
2358: 
2359: "But for a young man so well furnished as you, who can questionless
2360: write a good hand and keep books, were it not well to seek some higher
2361: situation as clerk or assistant? I could speak to Brother Muscat, who is
2362: well acquainted with all such openings. Any place in Pendrell's Bank, I
2363: fear, is now closed against such as are not Churchmen. It used not to be
2364: so, but a year ago he discharged Brother Bodkin, although he was a
2365: valuable servant. Still, something might be found. There are ranks and
2366: degrees--and those who can serve in the higher must not unadvisedly
2367: change what seems to be a providential appointment. Your poor mother is
2368: not altogether----"
2369: 
2370: "Excuse me, Mr. Lyon; I've had all that out with my mother, and I may as
2371: well save you any trouble by telling you that my mind has been made up
2372: about that a long while ago. I'll take no employment that obliges me to
2373: prop up my chin with a high cravat, and wear straps, and pass the
2374: livelong day with a set of fellows who spend their spare money on shirt
2375: pins. That sort of work is really lower than many handicrafts; it only
2376: happens to be paid out of proportion. That's why I set myself to learn
2377: the watchmaking trade. My father was a weaver first of all. It would
2378: have been better for him if he had remained a weaver. I came home
2379: through Lancashire and saw an uncle of mine who is a weaver still. I
2380: mean to stick to the class I belong to--people who don't follow the
2381: fashions."
2382: 
2383: Mr. Lyon was silent a few moments. This dialogue was far from plain
2384: sailing; he was not certain of his latitude and longitude. If the
2385: despiser of Glasgow preachers had been arguing in favor of gin and
2386: Sabbath-breaking, Mr. Lyon's course would have been clearer. "Well,
2387: well," he said, deliberately, "it is true that St. Paul exercised the
2388: trade of tent-making, though he was learned in all the wisdom of the
2389: Rabbis."
2390: 
2391: "St. Paul was a wise man," said Felix. "Why should I want to get into
2392: the middle class because I have some learning? The most of the middle
2393: class are as ignorant as the working people about everything that
2394: doesn't belong to their own Brummagem life. That's how the workingmen
2395: are left to foolish devices and keep worsening themselves: the best
2396: heads among them forsake their boon comrades, and go in for a house with
2397: a high door-step and a brass knocker."
2398: 
2399: Mr. Lyon stroked his mouth and chin, perhaps because he felt some
2400: disposition to smile; and it would not be well to smile too readily at
2401: what seemed but a weedy resemblance of Christian unworldliness. On the
2402: contrary, there might be a dangerous snare in an unsanctified
2403: outstepping of average Christian practice.
2404: 
2405: "Nevertheless," he observed, gravely, "it is by such self-advancement
2406: that many have been enabled to do good service to the cause of liberty
2407: and to the public well-being. The ring and the robe of Joseph were no
2408: objects for a good man's ambition, but they were the signs of that
2409: credit which he won by his divinely-inspired skill, and which enabled
2410: him to act as a saviour to his brethren."
2411: 
2412: "Oh, yes, your ringed and scented men of the people!--I won't be one of
2413: them. Let a man once throttle himself with a satin stock, and he'll get
2414: new wants and new motives. Metamorphosis will have begun at his
2415: neck-joint, and it will go on till it has changed his likings first and
2416: then his reasoning, which will follow his likings as the feet of a
2417: hungry dog follow his nose. I'll have none of your clerkly gentility. I
2418: might end by collecting greasy pence from poor men to buy myself a fine
2419: coat and a glutton's dinner, on pretence of serving the poor men. I'd
2420: sooner be Paley's fat pigeon than a demagogue all tongue and stomach,
2421: though"--here Felix changed his voice a little--"I should like well
2422: enough to be another sort of demagogue, if I could."
2423: 
2424: "Then you have a strong interest in the great political movements of
2425: these times?" said Mr. Lyon, with a perceptible flashing of the eyes.
2426: 
2427: "I should think so. I despise every man who has not--or, having it,
2428: doesn't try to rouse it in other men."
2429: 
2430: "Right, my young friend, right," said the minister, in a deep cordial
2431: tone. Inevitably his mind was drawn aside from the immediate
2432: consideration of Felix Holt's spiritual interest by the prospect of
2433: political sympathy. In those days so many instruments of God's cause in
2434: the fight for religious and political liberty held creeds that were
2435: painfully wrong, and, indeed, irreconcilable with salvation! "That is
2436: my own view, which I maintain in the face of some opposition from
2437: brethren who contend that a share in public movements is a hindrance to
2438: the closer walk, and that the pulpit is no place for teaching men their
2439: duties as members of the commonwealth. I have had much puerile blame
2440: cast upon me because I have uttered such names as Brougham and
2441: Wellington in the pulpit. Why not Wellington as well as Rabshakeh? and
2442: why not Brougham as well as Balaam? Does God know less of men than He
2443: did in the days of Hezekiah and Moses?--is His arm shortened, and is the
2444: world become too wide for His providence? But, they say, there are no
2445: politics in the New Testament----"
2446: 
2447: "Well, they're right enough there," said Felix, with his usual
2448: unceremoniousness.
2449: 
2450: "What! you are of those who hold that a Christian minister should not
2451: meddle with public matters in the pulpit?" said Mr. Lyon, coloring. "I
2452: am ready to join issue on that point."
2453: 
2454: "Not I, sir," said Felix; "I should say, teach any truth you can,
2455: whether it's in the Testament or out of it. It's little enough anybody
2456: can get hold of, and still less what he can drive into the skulls of a
2457: pence-counting, parcel-tying generation, such as mostly fill your
2458: chapels."
2459: 
2460: "Young man," said Mr. Lyon, pausing in front of Felix. He spoke rapidly,
2461: as he always did, except when his words were specially weighted with
2462: emotion: he overflowed with matter, and in his mind matter was always
2463: completely organized into words. "I speak not on my own behalf, for not
2464: only have I no desire that any man should think of me above that which
2465: he seeth me to be, but I am aware of much that should make me patient
2466: under a disesteem resting even on too hasty a construction. I speak not
2467: as claiming reverence for my own age and office--not to shame you, but
2468: to warn you. It is good that you should use plainness of speech, and I
2469: am not of those who would enforce a submissive silence on the young,
2470: that they themselves, being elders, may be heard at large; but Elihu was
2471: the youngest of Job's friends, yet was there a wise rebuke in his words;
2472: and the aged Eli was taught by a revelation to the boy Samuel. I have to
2473: keep a special watch over myself in this matter, inasmuch as I have need
2474: of utterance which makes the thought within me seem as a pent-up fire,
2475: until I have shot it forth, as it were, in arrowy words, each one
2476: hitting its mark. Therefore I pray for a listening spirit, which is a
2477: great mark of grace. Nevertheless, my young friend, I am bound, as I
2478: said, to warn you. The temptations that most beset those who have great
2479: natural gifts, and are wise after the flesh, are pride and scorn, more
2480: particularly toward those weak things of the world which have been
2481: chosen to confound the things which are mighty. The scornful nostril and
2482: the high head gather not the odors that lie on the track of truth. The
2483: mind that is too ready at contempt and reprobation is----"
2484: 
2485: Here the door opened, and Mr. Lyon paused to look around, but seeing
2486: only Lyddy with the tea-tray, he went on--
2487: 
2488: "Is, I may say, as a clenched fist that can give blows, but is shut up
2489: from receiving and holding aught that is precious--though it were
2490: heaven-sent manna."
2491: 
2492: "I understand you, sir," said Felix, good-humoredly, putting out his
2493: hand to the little man, who had come close to him as he delivered the
2494: last sentence with sudden emphasis and slowness. "But I'm not inclined
2495: to clench my fist at you."
2496: 
2497: "Well, well," said Mr. Lyon, shaking the proffered hand, "we shall see
2498: more of each other, and I trust shall have much profitable communing.
2499: You will stay and have a dish of tea with us: we take the meal late on
2500: Thursdays, because my daughter is detained by giving a lesson in the
2501: French tongue. But she is doubtless returned now, and will presently
2502: come and pour out tea for us."
2503: 
2504: "Thank you, I'll stay," said Felix, not from any curiosity to see the
2505: minister's daughter, but from a liking for the society of the minister
2506: himself--for his quaint looks and ways, and the transparency of his
2507: talk, which gave a charm even to his weakness. The daughter was probably
2508: some prim Miss, neat, sensible, pious, but all in a small feminine way,
2509: in which Felix was no more interested than in Dorcas meetings,
2510: biographies of devout women, and that amount of ornamental knitting
2511: which was not inconsistent with Non-conforming seriousness.
2512: 
2513: "I'm perhaps a little too fond of banging and smashing," he went on: "a
2514: phrenologist at Glasgow told me I had large veneration; another man
2515: there, who knew me, laughed out and said I was the most blasphemous
2516: iconoclast living. 'That,' says my phrenologist, 'is because of his
2517: large ideality, which prevents him from finding anything perfect enough
2518: to be venerated.' Of course I put my ears down and wagged my tail at
2519: that stroking."
2520: 
2521: "Yes, yes; I have had my own head explored with somewhat similar
2522: results. It is, I fear, but a vain show of fulfilling the heathen
2523: precept, 'Know thyself,' and too often leads to a self-estimate which
2524: will subsist in the absence of that fruit by which alone the quality of
2525: the tree is made evident. Nevertheless----Esther, my dear, this is Mr.
2526: Holt, whose acquaintance I have now been making with more than ordinary
2527: interest. He will take tea with us."
2528: 
2529: Esther bowed slightly as she walked across the room to fetch the candle
2530: and place it near her tray. Felix rose and bowed, also with an air of
2531: indifference, which was perhaps exaggerated by the fact that he was
2532: inwardly surprised. The minister's daughter was not the sort of person
2533: he expected. She was quite incongruous with his notion of ministers'
2534: daughters in general; and though he had expected something nowise
2535: delightful, the incongruity repelled him. A very delicate scent, the
2536: faint suggestion of a garden, was wafted as she went. He would not
2537: observe her, but he had a sense of an elastic walk, the tread of small
2538: feet, a long neck and a high crown of shining brown plaits and curls
2539: that floated backward--things, in short, that suggested a fine lady to
2540: him, and determined him to notice her as little as possible. A fine lady
2541: was always a sort of spun-glass affair--not natural, and with no beauty
2542: for him as art; but a fine lady as the daughter of this rusty old
2543: Puritan was especially offensive.
2544: 
2545: "Nevertheless," continued Mr. Lyon, who rarely let drop any thread of
2546: discourse, "that phrenological science is not irreconcilable with the
2547: revealed dispensations. And it is undeniable that we have our varying
2548: native dispositions which even grace will not obliterate. I myself, from
2549: my youth up, have been given to question too curiously concerning the
2550: truth--to examine and sift the medicine of the soul rather than to apply
2551: it."
2552: 
2553: "If your truth happens to be such medicine as Holt's Pills and Elixir,
2554: the less you swallow of it the better," said Felix. "But truth-vendors
2555: and medicine-vendors usually recommend swallowing. When a man sees his
2556: livelihood in a pill or a proposition, he likes to have orders for the
2557: dose, and not curious enquiries."
2558: 
2559: This speech verged on rudeness, but it was delivered with a brusque
2560: openness that implied the absence of any personal intention. The
2561: minister's daughter was now for the first time startled into looking at
2562: Felix. But her survey of this unusual speaker was soon made, and she
2563: relieved her father from the need to reply by saying--
2564: 
2565: "The tea is poured out, father."
2566: 
2567: That was the signal for Mr. Lyon to advance toward the table, raise his
2568: right hand, and ask a blessing at sufficient length for Esther to glance
2569: at the visitor again. There seemed to be no danger of his looking at
2570: her: he was observing her father. She had time to remark that he was a
2571: peculiar looking person, but not insignificant, which was the quality
2572: that most hopelessly consigned a man to perdition. He was massively
2573: built. The striking points in his face were large clear gray eyes and
2574: full lips.
2575: 
2576: "Will you draw up to the table, Mr. Holt?" said the minister.
2577: 
2578: In the act of rising, Felix pushed back his chair too suddenly against
2579: the rickety table close by him, and down went the blue-frilled
2580: work-basket, flying open, and dispersing on the floor reels, thimble,
2581: muslin-work, a small sealed bottle of attar of rose, and something
2582: heavier than these--a duodecimo volume which fell near him between the
2583: table and the fender.
2584: 
2585: "Oh, my stars!" said Felix, "I beg your pardon." Esther had already
2586: started up, and with wonderful quickness had picked up half the small
2587: rolling things while Felix was lifting the basket and the book. This
2588: last had opened, and had its leaves crushed in falling; and, with the
2589: instinct of a bookish man, he saw nothing more pressing to be done than
2590: to flatten the corners of the leaves.
2591: 
2592: "Byron's Poems!" he said, in a tone of disgust, while Esther was
2593: recovering all the other articles. "'The Dream'--he'd better have been
2594: asleep and snoring. What! do you stuff your memory with Byron, Miss
2595: Lyon?"
2596: 
2597: Felix on his side, was led at last to look straight at Esther, but it
2598: was with a strong denunciatory and pedagogic intention. Of course he saw
2599: more clearly than ever that she was a fine lady.
2600: 
2601: She reddened, drew up her long neck, and said, as she retreated to her
2602: chair again--
2603: 
2604: "I have a great admiration for Byron."
2605: 
2606: Mr. Lyon had paused in the act of drawing his chair to the tea table,
2607: and was looking on at this scene, wrinkling the corners of his eyes with
2608: a perplexed smile. Esther would not have wished him to know anything
2609: about the volume of Byron, but she was too proud to show any concern.
2610: 
2611: "He is a worldly and vain writer, I fear," said Mr. Lyon. He knew
2612: scarcely anything of the poet, whose books embodied the faith and ritual
2613: of many young ladies and gentlemen.
2614: 
2615: "A misanthropic debauchee," said Felix, lifting a chair with one hand,
2616: and holding the book open in the other, "whose notion of a hero was
2617: that he should disorder his stomach and despise mankind. His corsairs
2618: and renegades, his Alps and Manfreds, are the most paltry puppets that
2619: were ever pulled by the strings of lust and pride."
2620: 
2621: "Hand the book to me," said Mr. Lyon.
2622: 
2623: "Let me beg of you to put it aside till after tea, father," said Esther.
2624: "However objectionable Mr. Holt may find its pages, they would certainly
2625: be made worse by being greased with bread-and-butter."
2626: 
2627: "That is true, my dear," said Mr. Lyon, laying down the book on the
2628: small table behind him. He saw that his daughter was angry.
2629: 
2630: "Ho, ho!" thought Felix, "her father is frightened at her. How came he
2631: to have such a nice-stepping, long-necked peacock for his daughter? but
2632: she shall see that I am not frightened." Then he said aloud, "I should
2633: like to know how you will justify your admiration for such a writer,
2634: Miss Lyon."
2635: 
2636: "I should not attempt it with you, Mr. Holt," said Esther. "You have
2637: such strong words at command that they make the smallest argument seem
2638: formidable. If I had ever met the giant Cormoran, I should have made a
2639: point of agreeing with him in his literary opinions."
2640: 
2641: Esther had that excellent thing in woman, a soft voice with clear fluent
2642: utterance. Her sauciness was always charming because it was without
2643: emphasis, and was accompanied with graceful little turns of the head.
2644: 
2645: Felix laughed at her thrust with young heartiness.
2646: 
2647: "My daughter is a critic of words, Mr. Holt," said the minister, smiling
2648: complacently, "and often corrects mine on the ground of niceties, which
2649: I profess are as dark to me as if they were the reports of a sixth sense
2650: which I possess not. I am an eager seeker for precision, and would fain
2651: find language subtle enough to follow the utmost intricacies of the
2652: soul's pathways, but I see not why a round word that means some object,
2653: made and blessed by the Creator, should be branded and banished as a
2654: malefactor."
2655: 
2656: "Oh, your niceties--I know what they are," said Felix, in his usual
2657: _fortissimo_. "They'll go on your system of make-believe. 'Rottenness'
2658: may suggest what is unpleasant, so you'd better say 'sugar-plums,' or
2659: something else such a long way off the fact that nobody is obliged to
2660: think of it. Those are your roundabout euphuisms that dress up swindling
2661: till it looks as well as honesty, and shoot with boiled peas instead of
2662: bullets. I hate your gentlemanly speakers."
2663: 
2664: "Then you would not like Mr. Jermyn, I think," said Esther. "That
2665: reminds me, father, that to-day, when I was giving Miss Louisa Jermyn
2666: her lesson, Mr. Jermyn came in and spoke to me with grand politeness,
2667: and asked me at what times you were likely to be disengaged, because he
2668: wished to make your better acquaintance, and consult you on matters of
2669: importance. He never took the least notice of me before. Can you guess
2670: the reason of his sudden ceremoniousness?"
2671: 
2672: "Nay, child," said the minister, ponderingly.
2673: 
2674: "Politics, of course," said Felix. "He's on some committee. An election
2675: is coming. Universal peace is declared, and the foxes have a sincere
2676: interest in prolonging the lives of the poultry. Eh, Mr. Lyon? Isn't
2677: that it?"
2678: 
2679: "Nay, not so. He is the close ally of the Transome family, who are blind
2680: hereditary Tories like the Debarrys, and will drive their tenants to the
2681: poll as if they were sheep, and it has even been hinted that the heir
2682: who is coming from the East may be another Tory candidate, and coalesce
2683: with the younger Debarry. It is said that he has enormous wealth, and
2684: could purchase every vote in the county that has a price."
2685: 
2686: "He is come," said Esther. "I heard Miss Jermyn tell her sister that she
2687: had seen him going out of her father's room."
2688: 
2689: "'Tis strange," said Mr. Lyon.
2690: 
2691: "Something extraordinary must have happened," said Esther, "for Mr.
2692: Jermyn to intend courting us. Miss Jermyn said to me only the other day
2693: that she could not think how I came to be so well educated and ladylike.
2694: She always thought Dissenters were ignorant, vulgar people. I said, so
2695: they were, usually, and Church people also in small towns. She considers
2696: herself a judge of what is ladylike, and she is vulgarity
2697: personified--with large feet, and the most odious scent on her
2698: handkerchief, and a bonnet that looks like 'The Fashion' printed in
2699: capital letters."
2700: 
2701: "One sort of fine-ladyism is as good as another," said Felix.
2702: 
2703: "No, indeed. Pardon me," said Esther. "A real fine-lady does not wear
2704: clothes that flare in people's eyes, or use importunate scents, or make
2705: a noise as she moves: she is something refined and graceful, and
2706: charming, and never obtrusive."
2707: 
2708: "Oh, yes," said Felix, contemptuously. "And she reads Byron also, and
2709: admires Childe Harold--gentlemen of unspeakable woes, who employ a
2710: hairdresser, and look seriously at themselves in the glass."
2711: 
2712: Esther reddened, and gave a little toss. Felix went on triumphantly. "A
2713: fine-lady is a squirrel-headed thing, with small airs, and small
2714: notions, about as applicable to the business of life as a pair of
2715: tweezers to the clearing of a forest. Ask your father what those old
2716: persecuted emigrant Puritans would have done with fine-lady wives and
2717: daughters."
2718: 
2719: "Oh, there is no danger of such _mésalliances_," said Esther. "Men who
2720: are unpleasant companions and make frights of themselves, are sure to
2721: get wives tasteless enough to suit them."
2722: 
2723: "Esther, my dear," said Mr. Lyon, "let not your playfulness betray you
2724: into disrespect toward those venerable pilgrims. They struggled and
2725: endured in order to cherish and plant anew the seeds of a scriptural
2726: doctrine and of a pure discipline."
2727: 
2728: "Yes, I know," said Esther, hastily, dreading a discourse on the pilgrim
2729: fathers.
2730: 
2731: "Oh, they were an ugly lot!" Felix burst in, making Mr. Lyon start.
2732: "Miss Medora wouldn't have minded if they had all been put into the
2733: pillory and lost their ears. She would have said, 'Their ears did stick
2734: out so.' I shouldn't wonder if that's a bust of one of them." Here
2735: Felix, with sudden keenness of observation, nodded at the black bust
2736: with the gauze over its colored face.
2737: 
2738: "No," said Mr. Lyon, "that is the eminent George Whitfield, who, you
2739: well know, had a gift of oratory as of one on whom the tongue of flame
2740: had rested visibly. But Providence--doubtless for wise ends in relation
2741: to the inner man, for I would not enquire too closely into minutiæ which
2742: carry too many plausible interpretations for any one of them to be
2743: stable--Providence, I say, ordained that the good man should squint; and
2744: my daughter has not yet learned to bear with his infirmity."
2745: 
2746: "She has put a veil over it. Suppose you had squinted yourself?" said
2747: Felix, looking at Esther.
2748: 
2749: "Then, doubtless, you could have been more polite to me, Mr. Holt," said
2750: Esther, rising and placing herself at her work-table. "You seem to
2751: prefer what is unusual and ugly."
2752: 
2753: "A peacock!" thought Felix. "I should like to come and scold her every
2754: day, and make her cry and cut her fine hair off."
2755: 
2756: Felix rose to go, and said, "I will not take up any more of your
2757: valuable time, Mr. Lyon. I know that you have not many spare evenings."
2758: 
2759: "That is true, my young friend; for I now go to Sproxton one evening in
2760: the week. I do not despair that we may some day need a chapel there,
2761: though the hearers do not multiply save among the women, and there is no
2762: work as yet begun among the miners themselves. I shall be glad of your
2763: company in my walk thither to-morrow at five o'clock, if you would like
2764: to see how that population has grown of late years."
2765: 
2766: "Oh, I've been to Sproxton already several times. I had a congregation
2767: of my own there last Sunday evening."
2768: 
2769: "What! do you preach?" said Mr. Lyon, with brightened glance.
2770: 
2771: "Not exactly. I went to the ale-house."
2772: 
2773: Mr. Lyon started. "I trust you are putting a riddle to me, young man,
2774: even as Samson did to his companions. From what you said but lately, it
2775: cannot be that you are given to tippling and to taverns."
2776: 
2777: "Oh, I don't drink much. I order a pint of beer, and I get into talk
2778: with the fellows over their pots and pipes. Somebody must take a little
2779: knowledge and common-sense to them in this way, else how are they to get
2780: it? I go for educating the non-electors, so I put myself in the way of
2781: my pupils--my academy is the beer-house. I'll walk with you to-morrow
2782: with pleasure."
2783: 
2784: "Do so, do so," said Mr. Lyon, shaking hands with his odd acquaintance.
2785: "We shall understand each other better by-and-by, I doubt not."
2786: 
2787: "I wish you good-evening, Miss Lyon."
2788: 
2789: Esther bowed very slightly, without speaking.
2790: 
2791: "That is a singular young man, Esther," said the minister, walking about
2792: after Felix was gone. "I discern in him a love for whatsoever things are
2793: honest and true, which I would fain believe to be an earnest of further
2794: endowment with the wisdom that is from on high. It is true that, as the
2795: traveller in the desert is often lured, by a false vision of water and
2796: freshness, to turn aside from the track which leads to the tried and
2797: established fountains, so the Evil One will take advantage of a natural
2798: yearning toward the better, to delude the soul with a self-flattering
2799: belief in a visionary virtue, higher than the ordinary fruits of the
2800: Spirit. But I trust it is not so here. I feel a great enlargement in
2801: this young man's presence, notwithstanding a certain license in his
2802: language, which I shall use my efforts to correct."
2803: 
2804: "I think he is very coarse and rude," said Esther, with a touch of
2805: temper in her voice. "But he speaks better English than most of our
2806: visitors. What is his occupation?"
2807: 
2808: "Watch and clock making, by which, together with a little teaching, as I
2809: understand, he hopes to maintain his mother, not thinking it right that
2810: he should live by the sale of medicines whose virtues he distrusts. It
2811: is no common scruple."
2812: 
2813: "Dear me," said Esther, "I thought he was something higher than that."
2814: She was disappointed.
2815: 
2816: Felix, on his side, as he strolled out in the evening air, said to
2817: himself: "Now by what fine meshes of circumstance did that queer devout
2818: old man, with his awful creed, which makes this world a vestibule with
2819: double doors to hell, and a narrow stair on one side whereby the thinner
2820: sort may mount to heaven--by what subtle play of flesh and spirit did he
2821: come to have a daughter so little in his own likeness? Married
2822: foolishly, I suppose. I'll never marry, though I should have to live on
2823: raw turnips to subdue my flesh. I'll never look back and say, 'I had a
2824: fine purpose once--I meant to keep my hands clean and my soul upright,
2825: and to look truth in the face; but pray excuse me, I have a wife and
2826: children--I must lie and simper a little, else they'll starve'; or 'My
2827: wife is nice, she must have her bread well buttered, and her feelings
2828: will be hurt if she is not thought genteel.' That is the lot Miss Esther
2829: is preparing for some man or other. I could grind my teeth at such
2830: self-satisfied minxes, who think they can tell everybody what is the
2831: correct thing, and the utmost stretch of their ideas will not place them
2832: on a level with the intelligent fleas. I should like to see if she could
2833: be made ashamed of herself."

2838: CHAPTER VI.
2839: 
2840:     Though she be dead, yet let me think she lives,
2841:     And feed my mind, that dies for want of her.

2844: 
2845: 
2846: Hardly any one in Treby who thought at all of Mr. Lyon and his daughter
2847: had not felt the same sort of wonder about Esther as Felix felt. She was
2848: not much liked by her father's church and congregation. The less serious
2849: observed that she had too many airs and graces and held her head much
2850: too high; the stricter sort feared greatly that Mr. Lyon had not been
2851: sufficiently careful in placing his daughter among God-fearing people,
2852: and that, being led astray by the melancholy vanity of giving her
2853: exceptional accomplishments, he had sent her to a French school, and
2854: allowed her to take situations where she had contracted notions not
2855: only above her own rank, but of too worldly a kind to be safe in any
2856: rank. But no one knew what sort of woman her mother had been, for Mr.
2857: Lyon never spoke of his past domesticities. When he was chosen as pastor
2858: at Treby in 1825, it was understood that he had been a widower many
2859: years, and he had no companion but the tearful and much-exercised Lyddy,
2860: his daughter being still at school. It was only two years ago that
2861: Esther had come home to live permanently with her father, and take
2862: pupils in the town. Within that time she had excited a passion in two
2863: young Dissenting breasts that were clad in the best style of Treby
2864: waistcoat--a garment which at that period displayed much design both in
2865: the stuff and the wearer; and she had secured an astonished admiration
2866: of her cleverness from the girls of various ages who were her pupils;
2867: indeed, her knowledge of French was generally held to give a distinction
2868: to Treby itself as compared with other market-towns. But she had won
2869: little regard of any other kind. Wise Dissenting matrons were divided
2870: between fear lest their sons should want to marry her and resentment
2871: that she should treat those "undeniable" young men with a distant scorn
2872: which was hardly to be tolerated in a minister's daughter; not only
2873: because that parentage appeared to entail an obligation to show an
2874: exceptional degree of Christian humility, but because, looked at from a
2875: secular point of view, a poor minister must be below the substantial
2876: householders who keep him. For at that time the preacher who was paid
2877: under the Voluntary system was regarded by his flock with feelings not
2878: less mixed than the spiritual person who still took his tithe-pig or his
2879: _modus_. His gifts were admired, and tears were shed under best bonnets
2880: at his sermons; but the weaker tea was thought good enough for him; and
2881: even when he went to preach a charity sermon in a strange town, he was
2882: treated with home-made wine and the smaller bedroom. As the good
2883: Churchman's reverence was often mixed with growling, and was apt to be
2884: given chiefly to an abstract parson who was what a parson ought to be,
2885: so the good Dissenter sometimes mixed his approval of ministerial gifts
2886: with considerable criticism and cheapening of the human vessel which
2887: contained those treasures. Mrs. Muscat and Mrs. Nuttwood applied the
2888: principle of Christian equality by remarking that Mr. Lyon had his
2889: oddities, and that he ought not to allow his daughter to indulge in such
2890: unbecoming expenditure on her gloves, shoes, and hosiery, even if she
2891: did pay for them out of her earnings. As for the Church people who
2892: engaged Miss Lyon to give lessons in their families, their imaginations
2893: were altogether prostrated by the incongruity between accomplishments
2894: and Dissent, between weekly prayer-meetings and a conversance with so
2895: lively and altogether worldly a language as the French. Esther's own
2896: mind was not free from a sense of irreconcilableness between the objects
2897: of her taste and the conditions of her lot. She knew that Dissenters
2898: were looked down upon by those whom she regarded as the most refined
2899: classes; her favorite companions, both in France and at an English
2900: school where she had been a junior teacher, had thought it quite
2901: ridiculous to have a father who was a Dissenting preacher; and when an
2902: ardently admiring school-fellow induced her parents to take Esther as a
2903: governess to the younger children, all her native tendencies toward
2904: luxury, fastidiousness, and scorn of mock gentility, were strengthened
2905: by witnessing the habits of a well-born and wealthy family. Yet the
2906: position of servitude was irksome to her, and she was glad at last to
2907: live at home with her father, for though, throughout her girlhood, she
2908: had wished to avoid this lot, a little experience had taught her to
2909: prefer its comparative independence. But she was not contented with her
2910: life; she seemed to herself to be surrounded with ignoble, uninteresting
2911: conditions, from which there was no issue; for even if she had been
2912: unamiable enough to give her father pain deliberately, it would have
2913: been no satisfaction to her to go to Treby church, and visibly turn her
2914: back on Dissent. It was not religious differences, but social
2915: differences, that Esther was concerned about, and her ambitious taste
2916: would have been no more gratified in the society of the Waces than in
2917: that of the Muscats. The Waces spoke imperfect English and played whist;
2918: the Muscats spoke the same dialect and took in the "Evangelical
2919: Magazine." Esther liked neither of these amusements. She had one of
2920: those exceptional organizations which are quick and sensitive without
2921: being in the least morbid; she was alive to the finest shades of manner,
2922: to the nicest distinctions of tone and accent; she had a little code of
2923: her own about scents and colors, textures and behavior, by which she
2924: secretly condemned or sanctioned all things and persons. And she was
2925: well satisfied with herself for her fastidious taste, never doubting
2926: that hers was the highest standard. She was proud that the best-born
2927: and handsomest girls at school had always said that she might be taken
2928: for a born lady. Her own pretty instep, clad in a silk stocking, her
2929: little heel, just rising from a kid slipper, her irreproachable nails
2930: and delicate wrist, were the objects of delighted consciousness to her;
2931: and she felt that it was her superiority which made her unable to use
2932: without disgust any but the finest cambric handkerchiefs and freshest
2933: gloves. Her money all went in the gratification of these nice tastes,
2934: and she saved nothing from her earnings. I can not say that she had
2935: pangs of conscience on this score; for she felt sure that she was
2936: generous: she hated all meanness, would empty her purse impulsively on
2937: some sudden appeal to her pity, and if she found out that her father had
2938: a want, she would supply it with some pretty device of a surprise. But
2939: then the good man so seldom had a want--except the perpetual desire,
2940: which she could never gratify, of seeing her under convictions, and fit
2941: to become a member of the church.
2942: 
2943: As for little Mr. Lyon, he loved and admired this unregenerate child
2944: more, he feared, than was consistent with the due preponderance of
2945: impersonal and ministerial regards: he prayed and pleaded for her with
2946: tears, humbling himself for her spiritual deficiencies in the privacy of
2947: his study; and then came down stairs to find himself in timorous
2948: subjection to her wishes, lest, as he inwardly said, he should give his
2949: teaching an ill savor, by mingling it with outward crossing. There will
2950: be queens in spite of Salic or other laws of later date than Adam and
2951: Eve; and here in this small dingy house of the minister in Malthouse
2952: Yard, there was a light-footed, sweet-voiced Queen Esther.
2953: 
2954: The stronger will always rule, say some, with an air of confidence which
2955: is like a lawyer's flourish, forbidding exceptions or additions. But
2956: what is strength? Is it blind wilfulness that sees no terrors, no
2957: many-linked consequences, no bruises and wounds of those whose cords it
2958: tightens? Is it the narrowness of a brain that conceives no needs
2959: differing from its own, and looks to no results beyond the bargains of
2960: to-day; that tugs with emphasis for every small purpose, and thinks it
2961: weakness to exercise the sublime power of resolved renunciation? There
2962: is a sort of subjection which is the peculiar heritage of largeness and
2963: of love; and strength is often only another name for willing bondage to
2964: irremediable weakness.
2965: 
2966: Esther had affection for her father: she recognized the purity of his
2967: character, and a quickness of intellect in him which responded to her
2968: own liveliness, in spite of what seemed a dreary piety, which selected
2969: everything that was least interesting and romantic in life and history.
2970: But his old clothes had a smoky odor, and she did not like to walk with
2971: him, because, when people spoke to him in the street, it was his wont,
2972: instead of remarking on the weather and passing on, to pour forth in an
2973: absent manner some reflections that were occupying his mind about the
2974: traces of the Divine government, or about a peculiar incident narrated
2975: in the life of the eminent Mr. Richard Baxter. Esther had a horror of
2976: appearing ridiculous even in the eyes of vulgar Trebians. She fancied
2977: that she should have loved her mother better than she was able to love
2978: her father; and she wished she could have remembered that mother more
2979: thoroughly.
2980: 
2981: But she had no more than a broken vision of the time before she was five
2982: years old--the time when the word oftenest on her lips was "Mamma"; when
2983: a low voice spoke caressing French words to her, and she in her turn
2984: repeated the words to her rag doll; when a very small white hand,
2985: different from any that came after, used to pat her, and stroke her, and
2986: tie on her frock and pinafore, and when at last there was nothing but
2987: sitting with a doll on a bed where mamma was lying, till her father once
2988: carried her away. Where distinct memory began, there was no longer the
2989: low caressing voice and the small white hand. She knew that her mother
2990: was a Frenchwoman, that she had been in want and distress, and that her
2991: maiden name was Annette Ledru. Her father had told her no more than
2992: this; and once, he had said, "My Esther, until you are a woman, we will
2993: only think of your mother: when you are about to be married and leave
2994: me, we will speak of her, and I will deliver to you her ring and all
2995: that was hers; but, without a great command laid upon me, I cannot
2996: pierce my heart by speaking of that which was and is not." Esther had
2997: never forgotten these words, and the older she became, the more
2998: impossible she felt it that she should urge her father with questions
2999: about the past.
3000: 
3001: His inability to speak of that past to her depended on manifold causes.
3002: Partly it came from an initial concealment. He had not the courage to
3003: tell Esther that he was not really her father: he had not the courage to
3004: renounce that hold on her tenderness which the belief in his natural
3005: fatherhood must help to give him, or to incur any resentment that her
3006: quick spirit might feel at having been brought up under a false
3007: supposition. But there were other things yet more difficult for him to
3008: be quite open about--deep sorrows of his life as a Christian minister
3009: that were hardly to be told to a girl.
3010: 
3011: Twenty-two years ago, when Rufus Lyon was no more than thirty-six years
3012: old, he was the admired pastor of a large Independent congregation in
3013: one of our southern seaport towns. He was unmarried, and had met all
3014: exhortations of friends who represented to him that a bishop, _i.e._,
3015: the overseer of an Independent church and congregation--should be the
3016: husband of one wife, by saying that St. Paul meant this particular as a
3017: limitation, and not as an injunction; that a minister was permitted to
3018: have one wife, but that he, Rufus Lyon, did not wish to avail himself of
3019: that permission, finding his studies and other labors of his vocation
3020: all-absorbing, and seeing that mothers in Israel were sufficiently
3021: provided by those who had not been set apart for a more special work.
3022: His church and congregation were proud of him: he was put forward on
3023: platforms, was made a "deputation," and was requested to preach
3024: anniversary sermons in far-off towns. Wherever noteworthy preachers were
3025: discussed, Rufus Lyon was almost sure to be mentioned as one who did
3026: honor to the Independent body; his sermons were said to be full of fire;
3027: and while he had more of human knowledge than many of his brethren, he
3028: showed in an eminent degree the marks of a true ministerial vocation.
3029: But on a sudden this burning and shining light seemed to be quenched:
3030: Mr. Lyon voluntarily resigned his charge and withdrew from the town.
3031: 
3032: A terrible crisis had come upon him; a moment in which religious doubt
3033: and newly-awakened passion had rushed together in a common flood, and
3034: had paralyzed his ministerial gifts. His thirty-six years had been a
3035: story of purely religious and studious fervor; his passion had been for
3036: doctrines, for argumentative conquest on the side of right; the sins he
3037: had chiefly to pray against had been those of personal ambition (under
3038: such forms as ambition takes in the mind of a man who has chosen the
3039: career of an Independent preacher), and those of a too restless
3040: intellect, ceaselessly urging questions concerning the mystery of that
3041: which was assuredly revealed, and thus hindering the due nourishment of
3042: the soul on the substance of the truth delivered. Even at that time of
3043: comparative youth, his unworldliness and simplicity in small matters
3044: (for he was keenly awake to the larger affairs of this world) gave a
3045: certain oddity to his manners and appearance; and though his sensitive
3046: face had much beauty, his person altogether seemed so irrelevant to a
3047: fashionable view of things, that well-dressed ladies and gentlemen
3048: usually laughed at him, as they probably did at Mr. John Milton after
3049: the Restoration and ribbons had come in, and still more at that apostle,
3050: of weak bodily presence, who preached in the back streets of Ephesus and
3051: elsewhere, a new view of a religion that hardly anybody believed in.
3052: Rufus Lyon was the singular-looking apostle of the Meeting in Skipper's
3053: Lane. Was it likely that any romance should befall such a man? Perhaps
3054: not; but romance did befall him.
3055: 
3056: One winter's evening in 1812, Mr. Lyon was returning from a village
3057: preaching. He walked at his usual rapid rate, with busy thoughts
3058: undisturbed by any sight more distinct than the bushes and the hedgerow
3059: trees, black beneath a faint moonlight, until something suggested to him
3060: that he had perhaps omitted to bring away with him a thin account-book
3061: in which he recorded certain subscriptions. He paused, unfastened his
3062: outer coat, and felt in all his pockets, then he took off his hat and
3063: looked inside it. The book was not to be found, and he was about to walk
3064: on, when he was startled by hearing a low, sweet voice, say, with a
3065: strong foreign accent--
3066: 
3067: "Have pity on me, sir."
3068: 
3069: Searching with his short-sighted eyes, he perceived some one on a
3070: side-bank; and approaching, he found a young woman with a baby on her
3071: lap. She spoke again more faintly than before.
3072: 
3073: "Sir, I die with hunger; in the name of God take the little one."
3074: 
3075: There was no distrusting the pale face and the sweet low voice. Without
3076: pause, Mr. Lyon took the baby in his arms and said, "Can you walk by my
3077: side, young woman?"
3078: 
3079: She rose, but seemed tottering. "Lean on me," said Mr. Lyon, and so they
3080: walked slowly on, the minister for the first time in his life carrying a
3081: baby.
3082: 
3083: Nothing better occurred to him than to take his charge to his own house;
3084: it was the simplest way of relieving the woman's wants, and finding out
3085: how she could be helped further; and he thought of no other
3086: possibilities. She was too feeble for more words to be spoken between
3087: them till she was seated by his fireside. His elderly servant was not
3088: easily amazed at anything her master did in the way of charity, and at
3089: once took the baby, while Mr. Lyon unfastened the mother's damp bonnet
3090: and shawl, and gave her something warm to drink. Then, waiting by her
3091: till it was time to offer her more, he had nothing to do but to notice
3092: the loveliness of her face, which seemed to him as that of an angel,
3093: with a benignity in its repose that carried a more assured sweetness
3094: than any smile. Gradually she revived, lifted up her delicate hands
3095: between her face and the firelight, and looked at the baby which lay
3096: opposite to her on the old servant's lap, taking in spoonfuls with much
3097: content, and stretching out naked feet toward the warmth. Then, as her
3098: consciousness of relief grew into contrasting memory, she lifted up her
3099: eyes to Mr. Lyon, who stood close by her, and said, in her pretty broken
3100: way:
3101: 
3102: "I knew you had a good heart when you took your hat off. You seemed to
3103: me as the image of the _bien-amié Saint Jean_."
3104: 
3105: The grateful glance of those blue-gray eyes, with their long
3106: shadow-making eyelashes, was a new kind of good to Rufus Lyon; it seemed
3107: to him as if a woman had never really looked at him before. Yet this
3108: poor thing was apparently a blind French Catholic--of delicate nurture,
3109: surely, judging from her hands. He was in a tremor; he felt that it
3110: would be rude to question her, and he only urged her now to take a
3111: little food. She accepted it with evident enjoyment, looking at the
3112: child continually, and then, with a fresh burst of gratitude, leaning
3113: forward to press the servant's hand and say, "Oh, you are good!" Then
3114: she looked up at Mr. Lyon again and said, "Is there in the world a
3115: prettier _marmot?_"
3116: 
3117: The evening passed; a bed was made up for the strange woman, and Mr.
3118: Lyon had not asked her so much as her name. He never went to bed himself
3119: that night. He spent it in misery, enduring a horrible assault of Satan.
3120: He thought a frenzy had seized him. Wild visions of an impossible future
3121: thrust themselves upon him. He dreaded lest the woman had a husband; he
3122: wished that he might call her his own, that he might worship her beauty,
3123: that she might love and caress him. And what to the mass of men would
3124: have been only one of many allowable follies--a transient fascination,
3125: to be dispelled by daylight and contact with those common facts of which
3126: common-sense is the reflex--was to him a spiritual convulsion. He was as
3127: one who raved, and knew that he raved. These mad wishes were
3128: irreconcilable with what he was, and must be, as a Christian minister,
3129: nay, penetrating his soul as tropic heat penetrates the frame, and
3130: changes for it all aspects and all flavors, they were irreconcilable
3131: with that conception of the world which made his faith. All the busy
3132: doubt which had before been mere impish shadows flitting around a belief
3133: that was strong with the strength of an unswerving moral bias, had now
3134: gathered blood and substance. The questioning spirit had become suddenly
3135: bold and blasphemous; it no longer insinuated scepticism--it prompted
3136: defiance; it no longer expressed cool, inquisitive thought, but was the
3137: voice of a passionate mood. Yet he never ceased to regard it as the
3138: voice of the tempter: the conviction which had been the law of his
3139: better life remained within him as a conscience.
3140: 
3141: The struggle of that night was an abridgment of all the struggles that
3142: came after. Quick souls have their intensest life in the first
3143: anticipatory sketch of what may or will be, and the pursuit of their
3144: wish is the pursuit of that paradisiacal vision which only impelled
3145: them, and is left farther and farther behind, vanishing forever even out
3146: of hope in the moment which is called success.
3147: 
3148: The next morning Mr. Lyon heard his guest's history. She was the
3149: daughter of a French officer of considerable rank, who had fallen in the
3150: Russian campaign. She had escaped from France to England with much
3151: difficulty in order to rejoin her husband, a young Englishman, to whom
3152: she had become attached during his detention as a prisoner of war on
3153: parole at Vesoul, where she was living under the charge of some
3154: relatives, and to whom she had been married without the consent of her
3155: family. Her husband had served in the Hanoverian army, had obtained his
3156: discharge in order to visit England on some business, with the nature of
3157: which she was not acquainted, and had been taken prisoner as a suspected
3158: spy. A short time after their marriage he and his fellow-prisoners had
3159: been moved to a town nearer the coast, and she had remained in wretched
3160: uncertainty about him, until at last a letter had come from him telling
3161: her that an exchange of prisoners had occurred, that he was in England,
3162: that she must use her utmost effort to follow him, and that on arriving
3163: on English ground she must send him word under a cover which he
3164: enclosed, bearing an address in London. Fearing the opposition of her
3165: friends, she started unknown to them, with a very small supply of money;
3166: and after enduring much discomfort and many fears in waiting for a
3167: passage which she at last got in a small trading smack, she arrived at
3168: Southampton--ill. Before she was able to write, her baby was born; and
3169: before her husband's answer came, she had been obliged to pawn some
3170: clothes and trinkets. He desired her to travel to London where he would
3171: meet her at the Belle Sauvage, adding that he was himself in distress,
3172: and unable to come to her: when once she was in London they would take
3173: ship and quit the country. Arrived at the Belle Sauvage, the poor thing
3174: waited three days in vain for her husband: on the fourth a letter came
3175: in a strange hand, saying that in his last moments he had desired this
3176: letter to be written to inform her of his death, and recommend her to
3177: return to her friends. She could choose no other course, but she had
3178: soon been reduced to walking, that she might save her pence to buy bread
3179: with: and on the evening when she made her appeal to Mr. Lyon, she had
3180: pawned the last thing, over and above needful clothing, that she could
3181: persuade herself to part with. The things she had not borne to part with
3182: were her marriage-ring, and a locket containing her husband's hair, and
3183: bearing his baptismal name. This locket, she said, exactly resembled one
3184: worn by her husband on his watch-chain, only that his bore the name
3185: Annette, and contained a lock of her hair. The precious trifle now hung
3186: round her neck by a cord, for she had sold the small gold chain which
3187: formerly held it.
3188: 
3189: The only guarantee of this story, besides the exquisite candor of her
3190: face, was a small packet of papers which she carried in her pocket,
3191: consisting of her husband's few letters, the letter which announced his
3192: death, and her marriage certificate. It was not so probable a story as
3193: that of many an inventive vagrant; but Mr. Lyon did not doubt it for a
3194: moment. It was impossible to him to suspect this angelic-faced woman,
3195: but he had strong suspicions concerning her husband. He could not help
3196: being glad that she had not retained the address he had desired her to
3197: send to in London, as that removed any obvious means of learning
3198: particulars about him. But enquiries might have been made at Vesoul by
3199: letter, and her friends there might have been appealed to. A
3200: consciousness, not to be quite silenced, told Mr. Lyon that this was the
3201: course he ought to take, but it would have required an energetic
3202: self-conquest, and he was excused from it by Annette's own
3203: disinclination to return to her relatives, if any other acceptable
3204: possibility could be found.
3205: 
3206: He dreaded, with a violence of feeling which surmounted all struggles,
3207: lest anything should take her away, and place such barriers between them
3208: as would make it unlikely or impossible that she should ever love him
3209: well enough to become his wife. Yet he saw with perfect clearness that
3210: unless he tore up his mad passion by the roots, his ministerial
3211: usefulness would be frustrated, and the repose of his soul would be
3212: destroyed. This woman was an unregenerate Catholic; ten minutes'
3213: listening to her artless talk made that plain to him: even if her
3214: position had been less equivocal, to unite himself to such a woman was
3215: nothing less than a spiritual fall. It was already a fall that he had
3216: wished there was no high purpose to which he owed an allegiance--that he
3217: had longed to fly to some backwoods where there was no church to
3218: reproach him, and where he might have this sweet woman to wife, and to
3219: know the joys of tenderness. Those sensibilities which in most lives are
3220: diffused equally through the youthful years, were aroused suddenly in
3221: Mr. Lyon, as some men have their special genius revealed to them by a
3222: tardy concurrence of conditions. His love was the first love of a fresh
3223: young heart full of wonder and worship. But what to one man is the
3224: virtue which he has sunk below the possibility of aspiring to, is to
3225: another the backsliding by which he forfeits his spiritual crown.
3226: 
3227: The end was, that Annette remained in his house. He had striven against
3228: himself so far as to represent her position to some chief matrons in his
3229: congregation, praying and yet dreading that they would so take her by
3230: the hand as to impose on him that denial of his own longing not to let
3231: her go out of his sight, which he found it too hard to impose on
3232: himself. But they regarded the case coldly; the woman was, after all, a
3233: vagrant. Mr. Lyon was observed to be surprisingly weak on the
3234: subject--his eagerness seemed disproportionate and unbecoming; and this
3235: young Frenchwoman, unable to express herself very clearly, was no more
3236: interesting to those matrons and their husbands than other pretty young
3237: women suspiciously circumstanced. They were willing to subscribe
3238: something to carry her on her way, or if she took some lodgings they
3239: would give her a little sewing, and endeavor to convert her from
3240: Papistry. If, however, she was a respectable person, as she said, the
3241: only proper thing for her was to go back to her own country and friends.
3242: In spite of himself, Mr. Lyon exulted. There seemed a reason now that he
3243: should keep Annette under his own eyes. He told himself that no real
3244: object would be served by his providing food and lodging for her
3245: elsewhere--an expense which he could ill afford. And she was apparently
3246: so helpless, except as to the one task of attending to her baby, that it
3247: would have been folly to think of her exerting herself for her own
3248: support.
3249: 
3250: But this course of his was severely disapproved by his church. There
3251: were various signs that the minister was under some evil influence: his
3252: preaching wanted its old fervor, he seemed to shun the intercourse of
3253: his brethren, and very mournful suspicions were entertained. A formal
3254: remonstrance was presented to him, but he met it as if he had already
3255: determined to act in anticipation of it. He admitted that external
3256: circumstances, conjoined with a peculiar state of mind, were likely to
3257: hinder the fruitful exercise of his ministry, and he resigned it. There
3258: was much sorrowing, much expostulation, but he declared that for the
3259: present he was unable to unfold himself more fully; he only wished to
3260: state solemnly that Annette Ledru, though blind in spiritual things, was
3261: in a worldly sense a pure and virtuous woman. No more was to be said,
3262: and he departed to a distant town. Here he maintained himself, Annette
3263: and the child, with the remainder of his stipend, and with the wages he
3264: earned as a printer's reader. Annette was one of those angelic-faced
3265: helpless women who take all things as manna from heaven: the good image
3266: of the well-beloved Saint John wished her to stay with him, and there
3267: was nothing else that she wished for except the unattainable. Yet for a
3268: whole year Mr. Lyon never dared to tell Annette that he loved her: he
3269: trembled before this woman; he saw that the idea of his being her lover
3270: was too remote from her mind for her to have any idea that she ought not
3271: to live with him. She had never known, never asked the reason why he
3272: gave up his ministry. She seemed to entertain as little concern about
3273: the strange world in which she lived as a bird in its nest: an avalanche
3274: had fallen over the past, but she sat warm and uncrushed--there was food
3275: for many morrows, and her baby flourished. She did not seem even to care
3276: about a priest, or about having her child baptized; and on the subject
3277: of religion Mr. Lyon was as timid, and shrank as much from speaking to
3278: her, as on the subject of his love. He dreaded anything that might cause
3279: her to feel a sudden repulsion toward him. He dreaded disturbing her
3280: simple gratitude and content. In these days his religious faith was not
3281: slumbering; it was awake and achingly conscious of having fallen in a
3282: struggle. He had had a great treasure committed to him, and had flung it
3283: away: he held himself a backslider. His unbelieving thoughts never
3284: gained the full ear and consent of his soul. His prayers had been
3285: stifled by the sense that there was something he preferred to complete
3286: obedience; they had ceased to be anything but intermittent cries and
3287: confessions, and a submissive presentiment, rising at times even to an
3288: entreaty, that some great discipline might come, that the dull spiritual
3289: sense might be roused to full vision and hearing as of old, and the
3290: supreme facts become again supreme in his soul. Mr. Lyon will perhaps
3291: seem a very simple personage, with pitiably narrow theories; but none of
3292: our theories are quite large enough for all the disclosures of time, and
3293: to the end of men's struggles a penalty will remain for those who sink
3294: from the ranks of the heroes into the crowd for whom the heroes fight
3295: and die.
3296: 
3297: One day, however, Annette learned Mr. Lyon's secret. The baby had a
3298: tooth coming, and being large and strong now, was noisily fretful. Mr.
3299: Lyon, though he had been working extra hours and was much in need of
3300: repose, took the child from its mother immediately on entering the house
3301: and walked about with it, patting and talking soothingly to it. The
3302: stronger grasp, the new sensations, were a successful anodyne, and baby
3303: went to sleep on his shoulder. But fearful lest any movement should
3304: disturb it, he sat down, and endured the bondage of holding it still
3305: against his shoulder.
3306: 
3307: "You do nurse baby well," said Annette, approvingly. "Yet you never
3308: nursed before I came?"
3309: 
3310: "No," said Mr. Lyon. "I had no brothers and sisters."
3311: 
3312: "Why were you not married?" Annette had never thought of asking that
3313: question before.
3314: 
3315: "Because I never loved any woman--till now. I thought I should never
3316: marry. Now I wish to marry."
3317: 
3318: Annette started. She did not see at once that she was the woman he
3319: wanted to marry; what had flashed on her mind was, that there might be a
3320: great change in Mr. Lyon's life. It was as if the lightning had entered
3321: into her dream and half awaked her.
3322: 
3323: "Do you think it foolish, Annette, that I should wish to marry?"
3324: 
3325: "I did not expect it," she said, doubtfully. "I did not know you thought
3326: about it."
3327: 
3328: "You know the woman I should like to marry?"
3329: 
3330: "I know her?" she said, interrogatively, blushing deeply.
3331: 
3332: "It is you, Annette--you whom I have loved better than my duty. I
3333: forsook everything for you."
3334: 
3335: Mr. Lyon paused: he was about to do what he felt would be ignoble--to
3336: urge what seemed like a claim.
3337: 
3338: "Can you love me, Annette? Will you be my wife?" Annette trembled and
3339: looked miserable.
3340: 
3341: "Do not speak--forget it," said Mr. Lyon, rising suddenly and speaking
3342: with loud energy. "No, no--I do not want it--I do not wish it."
3343: 
3344: The baby awoke as he started up; he gave the child into Annette's arms,
3345: and left her.
3346: 
3347: His work took him away early the next morning and the next again. They
3348: did not need to speak much to each other. The third day Mr. Lyon was too
3349: ill to go to work. His frame had been overwrought; he had been too poor
3350: to have sufficiently nourishing food, and under the shattering of his
3351: long deferred hope his health had given away. They had no regular
3352: servant--only occasional help from an old woman, who lit the fires and
3353: put on the kettles. Annette was forced to be the sick-nurse, and this
3354: sudden demand on her shook away some of her torpor. The illness was a
3355: serious one, and the medical man one day hearing Mr. Lyon in his
3356: delirium raving with an astonishing fluency in Biblical language,
3357: suddenly looked round with increased curiosity at Annette, and asked if
3358: she were the sick man's wife, or some other relative.
3359: 
3360: "No--no relation," said Annette, shaking her head. "He has been good to
3361: me."
3362: 
3363: "How long have you lived with him?"
3364: 
3365: "More than a year."
3366: 
3367: "Was he a preacher once?"
3368: 
3369: "Yes."
3370: 
3371: "When did he leave off being a preacher?"
3372: 
3373: "Soon after he took care of me."
3374: 
3375: "Is that his child?"
3376: 
3377: "Sir," said Annette, coloring indignantly, "I am a widow."
3378: 
3379: The doctor, she thought, looked at her oddly, but he asked no more
3380: questions.
3381: 
3382: When the sick man was getting better, and able to enjoy invalid's food,
3383: he observed one day, while he was taking some broth, that Annette was
3384: looking at him; he paused to look at her in return, and was struck with
3385: a new expression in her face, quite distinct from the merely passive
3386: sweetness which usually characterized it. She laid her little hand on
3387: his, which was now transparently thin, and said, "I am getting very
3388: wise; I have sold some of the books to make money--the doctor told me
3389: where; and I have looked into the shops where they sell caps and bonnets
3390: and pretty things, and I can do all that, and get more money to keep
3391: us. And when you are well enough to get up, we will go out and be
3392: married--shall we not? See! and _la petite_" (the baby had never
3393: been named anything else) "shall call you Papa--and then we shall never
3394: part."
3395: 
3396: Mr. Lyon trembled. This illness--something else, perhaps--had made a
3397: great change in Annette. A fortnight after that they were married. The
3398: day before he had ventured to ask her if she felt any difficulty about
3399: her religion, and if she would consent to have _la petite_ baptized and
3400: brought up as a Protestant. She shook her head and said very simply--
3401: 
3402: "No: in France, in other days, I would have minded; but all is changed.
3403: I never was fond of religion, but I knew it was right. _J'aimais les
3404: fleurs, les bals, la musique, et mon mari qui était beau_. But all that
3405: is gone away. There is nothing of my religion in this country. But the
3406: good God must be here, for you are good; I leave all to you."
3407: 
3408: It was clear that Annette regarded her present life as a sort of death
3409: to the world--an existence on a remote island where she had been saved
3410: from wreck. She was too indolent mentally, too little interested, to
3411: acquaint herself with any secrets of the isle. The transient energy, the
3412: more vivid consciousness and sympathy which had been stirred in her
3413: during Mr. Lyon's illness, had soon subsided into the old apathy to
3414: everything except her child. She withered like a plant in strange air,
3415: and the three years of life that remained were but a slow and gentle
3416: death. Those three years were to Mr. Lyon a period of such
3417: self-suppression and life in another as few men know. Strange! that the
3418: passion for this woman, which he felt to have drawn him aside from the
3419: right as much as if he had broken the most solemn vows--for that only
3420: was right to him which he held the best and highest--the passion for a
3421: being who had no glimpse of his thoughts induced a more thorough
3422: renunciation than he had ever known in the time of his complete devotion
3423: to his ministerial career. He had no flattery now, either from himself
3424: or the world; he knew that he had fallen, and _his_ world had forgotten
3425: him, or shook their heads at his memory. The only satisfaction he had
3426: was the satisfaction of his tenderness--which meant untiring work,
3427: untiring patience, untiring wakefulness even to the dumb signs of
3428: feeling in a creature whom he alone cared for.
3429: 
3430: The day of parting came, and he was left with little Esther as the one
3431: visible sign of that four years' break in his life. A year afterward he
3432: entered the ministry again, and lived with the utmost sparingness that
3433: Esther might be so educated as to be able to get her own bread in case
3434: of his death. Her probable facility in acquiring French naturally
3435: suggested his sending her to a French school, which would give her a
3436: special advantage as a teacher. It was a Protestant school, and French
3437: Protestantism had the high recommendation of being non-Prelatical. It
3438: was understood that Esther would contract no Papistical superstitions;
3439: and this was perfectly true; but she contracted, as we see, a good deal
3440: of non-Papistical vanity.
3441: 
3442: Mr. Lyon's reputation as a preacher and devoted pastor had revived; but
3443: some dissatisfaction beginning to be felt by his congregation at a
3444: certain laxity detected by them in his views as to the limits of
3445: salvation, which he had in one sermon even hinted might extend to
3446: unconscious recipients of mercy, he had found it desirable seven years
3447: ago to quit this ten years' pastorate and accept a call from the less
3448: important church in Malthouse Yard, Treby Magna.
3449: 
3450: This was Rufus Lyon's history, at that time unknown in its fullness to
3451: any human being besides himself. We can perhaps guess what memories they
3452: were that relaxed the stringency of his doctrine on the point of
3453: salvation. In the deepest of all senses his heart said--
3454: 
3455:     "Though she be dead, yet let me think she lives,
3456:     And feed my mind, that dies for want of her."
3457: 
3458: 
3459: 
3460: 
3461: CHAPTER VII.
3462: 
3463:     _M._  It was but yesterday you spoke him well--
3464:           You've changed your mind so soon?
3465: 
3466:     _N._                    Not I--'tis he
3467:           That, changing to my thought, has changed my mind.
3468:           No man puts rotten apples in his pouch
3469:           Because their upper side looked fair to him.
3470:           Constancy in mistake is constant folly.
3471: 
3472: 
3473: The news that the rich heir of the Transomes was actually come back, and
3474: had been seen at Treby, was carried to some one else who had more
3475: reasons for being interested in it than the Reverend Rufus Lyon was yet
3476: conscious of having. It was owing to this that at three o'clock, two
3477: days afterward, a carriage and pair, with coachman and footman in
3478: crimson and drab, passed through the lodge gates at Transome Court.
3479: Inside there was a hale, good-natured-looking man of sixty, whose hands
3480: rested on a knotted stick held between his knees; and a blue-eyed,
3481: well-featured lady, fat and middle-aged--a mountain of satin, lace, and
3482: exquisite muslin embroidery. They were not persons of a highly
3483: remarkable appearance, but to most Trebians they seemed absolutely
3484: unique, and likely to be known anywhere. If you had looked down upon
3485: them from the box of Sampson's coach, he would have said, after lifting
3486: his hat, "Sir Maximus and his lady--did you see?" thinking it needless
3487: to add the surname.
3488: 
3489: "We shall find her greatly elated, doubtless," Lady Debarry was saying.
3490: "She has been in the shade so long."
3491: 
3492: "Ah, poor thing!" said Sir Maximus. "A fine woman she was in her bloom.
3493: I remember the first county ball she attended we were all ready to fight
3494: for the sake of dancing with her. I always liked her from that time--I
3495: never swallowed the scandal about her myself."
3496: 
3497: "If we are to be intimate with her," said Lady Debarry, "I wish you
3498: would avoid making such allusions, Sir Maximus. I should not like Selina
3499: and Harriet to hear them."
3500: 
3501: "My dear, I should have forgotten all about the scandal, only you remind
3502: me of it sometimes," retorted the baronet, smiling and taking out his
3503: snuff-box.
3504: 
3505: "These sudden turns of fortune are often dangerous to an excitable
3506: constitution," said Lady Debarry, not choosing to notice her husband's
3507: epigram. "Poor Lady Alicia Methurst got heart-disease from a sudden
3508: piece of luck--the death of her uncle, you know. If Mrs. Transome was
3509: wise she would go to town--she can afford it now, and consult Dr.
3510: Truncheon. I should say myself he would order her digitalis: I have
3511: often guessed exactly what a prescription would be. But it certainly was
3512: one of her weak points to think she understood medicine better than
3513: other people."
3514: 
3515: "She's a healthy woman enough, surely: see how upright she is, and she
3516: rides about like a girl of twenty."
3517: 
3518: "She is so thin that she makes me shudder."
3519: 
3520: "Pooh! she's slim and active; women are not bid for by the pound."
3521: 
3522: "Pray don't be so coarse."
3523: 
3524: Sir Maximus laughed and showed his good teeth, which made his laughter
3525: very becoming. The carriage stopped, and they were soon ushered to Mrs.
3526: Transome's sitting-room, where she was working at her worsted
3527: embroidery. A little daily embroidery had been a constant element in
3528: Mrs. Transome's life; but that soothing occupation of taking stitches to
3529: produce what neither she nor any one else wanted, was then the resource
3530: of many a well-born and unhappy woman.
3531: 
3532: She received much warm congratulation and pressure of her hand with
3533: perfect composure of manner; but she became paler than usual, and her
3534: hands turned quite cold. The Debarrys did not yet know what Harold's
3535: politics were.
3536: 
3537: "Well, our lucky youngster is come in the nick of time," said Sir
3538: Maximus: "if he'll stand, he and Philip can run in harness together and
3539: keep out both the Whigs."
3540: 
3541: "It is really quite a providential thing--his returning just now," said
3542: Lady Debarry. "I couldn't help thinking that something would occur to
3543: prevent Philip from having such a man as Peter Garstin for his
3544: colleague."
3545: 
3546: "I call my friend Harold a youngster," said Sir Maximus, "for, you know,
3547: I remember him only as he was when that portrait was taken."
3548: 
3549: "That is a long while ago," said Mrs. Transome. "My son is much altered,
3550: as you may imagine."
3551: 
3552: There was a confused sound of voices in the library while this talk was
3553: going on. Mrs. Transome chose to ignore that noise, but her face, from
3554: being pale, began to flush a little.
3555: 
3556: "Yes, yes, on the outside, I dare say. But he was a fine fellow--I
3557: always liked him. And if anybody should ask me what I should choose for
3558: the good of the country, I couldn't have thought of anything better than
3559: having a young Transome for a neighbor who will take an active part. The
3560: Transomes and the Debarrys were always on the right side together in old
3561: days. Of course he'll stand--he has made up his mind to it?"
3562: 
3563: The need for an answer to this embarrassing question was deferred by the
3564: increase of inarticulate sounds accompanied by a bark from the library,
3565: and the sudden appearance at the tapestry-hung doorway of old Mr.
3566: Transome with a cord around his waist, playing a very poor-paced horse
3567: for a black-maned little boy about three years old, who was urging him
3568: on with loud encouraging noises and occasional thumps from a stick which
3569: he wielded with difficulty. The old man paused with a vague smile at the
3570: doorway while the baronet got up to speak to him. Nimrod snuffed at his
3571: master's legs to ascertain that he was not hurt, and the little boy,
3572: finding something new to be looked at, let go the cord and came round in
3573: front of the company, dragging his stick, and standing at a safe
3574: war-dancing distance as he fixed his great black eyes on Lady Debarry.
3575: 
3576: "Dear me, what a splendid little boy, Mrs. Transome! why--it cannot
3577: be--can it be--that you have the happiness to be a grandmamma?"
3578: 
3579: "Yes; that is my son's little boy."
3580: 
3581: "Indeed!" said Lady Debarry, really amazed. "I never heard you speak of
3582: his marriage. He has brought you home a daughter-in-law, then?"
3583: 
3584: "No," said Mrs. Transome, coldly; "she is dead."
3585: 
3586: "O--o--oh!" said Lady Debarry, in a tone ludicrously undecided between
3587: condolence, satisfaction, and general mistiness. "How very singular--I
3588: mean that we should not have heard of Mr. Harold's marriage. But he's a
3589: charming little fellow: come to me, you round-cheeked cherub."
3590: 
3591: The black eyes continued fixed as if by a sort of fascination on Lady
3592: Debarry's face, and her affable invitation was unheeded. At last,
3593: putting his head forward and pouting his lips, the cherub gave forth
3594: with marked intention the sounds, "Nau-o-oom," many times repeated:
3595: apparently they summed up his opinion of Lady Debarry, and may perhaps
3596: have meant "naughty old woman," but his speech was a broken lisping
3597: polyglot of hazardous interpretation. Then he turned to pull at the
3598: Blenheim spaniel, which, being old and peevish, gave a little snap.
3599: 
3600: "Go, go, Harry; let poor Puff alone--he'll bite you," said Mrs.
3601: Transome, stooping to release her aged pet.
3602: 
3603: Her words were too suggestive, for Harry immediately laid hold of her
3604: arm with his teeth, and bit with all his might. Happily the stuffs upon
3605: it were some protection, but the pain forced Mrs. Transome to give a low
3606: cry; and Sir Maximus, who had now turned to reseat himself, shook the
3607: little rascal off, whereupon he burst away and trotted into the library
3608: again.
3609: 
3610: "I fear you are hurt," said Lady Debarry, with sincere concern. "What a
3611: little savage! Do have your arm attended to, my dear--I recommend
3612: fomentation--don't think of me."
3613: 
3614: "Oh, thank you, it is nothing," said Mrs. Transome, biting her lip and
3615: smiling alternately; "it will soon go off. The pleasures of being a
3616: grandmamma, you perceive. The child has taken a dislike to me; but he
3617: makes quite a new life for Mr. Transome; they were playfellows at once."
3618: 
3619: "Bless my heart!" said Sir Maximus, "it is odd to think of Harold having
3620: been a family man so long. I made up my mind he was a young bachelor.
3621: What an old stager I am, to be sure! And whom has he married? I hope we
3622: shall soon have the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Harold Transome." Sir
3623: Maximus, occupied with old Mr. Transome, had not overheard the previous
3624: conversation on that subject.
3625: 
3626: "She is no longer living," Lady Debarry hastily interposed; "but now, my
3627: dear Sir Maximus, we must not hinder Mrs. Transome from attending to her
3628: arm. I am sure she is in pain. Don't say another word, my dear--we shall
3629: see you again--you and Mr. Harold will come and dine with us on
3630: Thursday--say yes, only yes. Sir Maximus is longing to see him: and
3631: Philip will be down."
3632: 
3633: "Yes, yes!" said Sir Maximus; "he must lose no time in making Philip's
3634: acquaintance. Tell him Philip is a fine fellow--carried everything
3635: before him at Oxford. And your son must be returned along with him for
3636: North Loamshire. You said he meant to stand?"
3637: 
3638: "I will write and let you know if Harold has any engagement for
3639: Thursday; he would of course be happy otherwise," said Mrs. Transome,
3640: evading the question.
3641: 
3642: "If not Thursday, the next day--the very first day he can."
3643: 
3644: The visitors left, and Mrs. Transome was almost glad of the painful bite
3645: which had saved her from being questioned further about Harold's
3646: politics. "This is the last visit I shall receive from them," she said
3647: to herself as the door closed behind them, and she rang for Denner.
3648: 
3649: "That poor creature is not happy, Sir Maximus," said Lady Debarry as
3650: they drove along. "Something annoys her about her son. I hope there is
3651: nothing unpleasant in his character. Either he kept his marriage a
3652: secret from her, or she was ashamed of it. He is thirty-four at least by
3653: this time. After living in the East so long he may have become a sort of
3654: person one would not care to be intimate with, and that savage boy--he
3655: doesn't look like a lady's child."
3656: 
3657: "Pooh, my dear," said Sir Maximus, "women think so much of those
3658: minutiæ. In the present state of the country it is our duty to look at a
3659: man's position and politics. Philip and my brother are both of that
3660: opinion, and I think they know what's right, if any man does. We are
3661: bound to regard every man of our party as a public instrument, and to
3662: pull all together. The Transomes have always been a good Tory family,
3663: but it has been a cipher of late years. This young fellow coming back
3664: with a fortune to give the family a head and a position is a clear gain
3665: to the county; and with Philip he'll get into the right hands--of course
3666: he wants guiding, having been out of the country so long. All we have to
3667: ask is, whether a man's a Tory, and will make a stand for the good of
3668: the country?--that's the plain English of the matter. And I do beg of
3669: you, my dear, to set aside all these gossiping niceties, and exert
3670: yourself, like a woman of sense and spirit as you are, to bring the
3671: right people together."
3672: 
3673: Here Sir Maximus gave a deep cough, took out his snuff-box, and tapped
3674: it: he had made a serious marital speech, an exertion to which he was
3675: rarely urged by anything smaller than a matter of conscience. And this
3676: outline of the whole duty of a Tory was a matter of conscience with him;
3677: though the _Duffield Watchman_ had pointed expressly to Sir Maximus
3678: Debarry amongst others, in branding the co-operation of the Tories as a
3679: conscious selfishness and reckless immorality, which, however, would be
3680: defeated by the co-operation of all the friends of truth and liberty,
3681: who, the _Watchman_ trusted, would subordinate all non-political
3682: differences in order to return representatives pledged to support the
3683: present government.
3684: 
3685: "I am sure, Sir Maximus," Lady Debarry answered, "you could not have
3686: observed that anything was wanting in my manners to Mrs. Transome."
3687: 
3688: "No, no, my dear; but I say this by way of caution. Never mind what was
3689: done at Smyrna, or whether Transome likes to sit with his heels tucked
3690: up. We may surely wink at a few things for the sake of the public
3691: interest, if God Almighty does; and if He didn't, I don't know what
3692: would have become of the country--Government could never have been
3693: carried on, and many a good battle would have been lost. That's the
3694: philosophy of the matter, and common-sense too."
3695: 
3696: Good Sir Maximus gave a deep cough and tapped his box again, inwardly
3697: remarking, that if he had not been such a lazy fellow he might have made
3698: as good a figure as his son Philip.
3699: 
3700: But at this point the carriage, which was rolling by a turn toward Treby
3701: Magna, passed a well-dressed man, who raised his hat to Sir Maximus, and
3702: called to the coachman to stop.
3703: 
3704: "Excuse me, Sir Maximus," said this personage, standing uncovered at the
3705: carriage-door, "but I have just learned something of importance at
3706: Treby, which I thought you would like to know as soon as possible."
3707: 
3708: "Ah! what's that? Something about Garstin or Clement?" said Sir Maximus,
3709: seeing the other draw a poster from his pocket.
3710: 
3711: "No; rather worse, I fear you will think. A new Radical candidate. I got
3712: this by a stratagem from the printer's boy. They're not posted yet."
3713: 
3714: "A Radical!" said Sir Maximus, in a tone of incredulous disgust, as he
3715: took the folded bill. "What fool is he?--he'll have no chance."
3716: 
3717: "They say he's richer than Garstin."
3718: 
3719: "Harold Transome!" shouted Sir Maximus, as he read the name in
3720: three-inch letters. "I don't believe it--it's a trick--it's a squib:
3721: why--why--we've just been to his place--eh? do you know any more? Speak,
3722: sir--speak; don't deal out your story like a damned mountebank, who
3723: wants to keep people gaping."
3724: 
3725: "Sir Maximus, pray don't give way so," said Lady Debarry.
3726: 
3727: "I'm afraid there's no doubt about it, sir," said Christian. "After
3728: getting the bill, I met Mr. Labron's clerk, and he said he had just had
3729: the whole story from Jermyn's clerk. The Ram Inn is engaged already, and
3730: a committee is being made up. He says Jermyn goes like a steam engine,
3731: when he has a mind, although he makes such long-winded speeches."
3732: 
3733: "Jermyn be hanged for a two-faced rascal! Tell Mitchell to drive on.
3734: It's of no use to stay chattering here. Jump up on the box and go home
3735: with us. I may want you."
3736: 
3737: "You see I was right, Sir Maximus," said the baronet's wife. "I had an
3738: instinct that we should find him an unpleasant person."
3739: 
3740: "Fudge! if you had such a fine instinct, why did you let us go to
3741: Transome Court and make fools of ourselves?"
3742: 
3743: "Would you have listened to me? But of course you will not have him to
3744: dine with you?"
3745: 
3746: "Dine with me? I should think not. I'd sooner he should dine off me. I
3747: see how it is clearly enough. He has become a regular beast among those
3748: Mahometans--he's got neither religion nor morals left. He can't know any
3749: thing about English politics. He'll go and cut his own nose off as a
3750: landholder, and never know. However, he won't get in--he'll spend his
3751: money for nothing."
3752: 
3753: "I fear he is a very licentious man," said Lady Debarry. "We know now
3754: why his mother seemed so uneasy. I should think she reflects a little,
3755: poor creature."
3756: 
3757: "It's a confounded nuisance we didn't meet Christian on our way, instead
3758: of coming back; but better now than later. He's an uncommonly adroit,
3759: useful fellow, that factotum of Philip's. I wish Phil would take my man
3760: and give me Christian. I'd make him house-steward: he might reduce the
3761: accounts a little."
3762: 
3763: Perhaps Sir Maximus would not have been so sanguine as to Mr.
3764: Christian's economical virtues if he had seen that gentleman relaxing
3765: himself the same evening among the other distinguished dependents of the
3766: family and frequenters of the steward's room. But a man of Sir Maximus's
3767: rank is like those antediluvian animals whom the system of things
3768: condemned to carry such a huge bulk that they really could not inspect
3769: their bodily appurtenance, and had no conception of their own tails:
3770: their parasites doubtless had a merry time of it, and often did
3771: extremely well when the high-bred saurian himself was ill at ease. Treby
3772: Manor, measured from the front saloon to the remotest shed, was as large
3773: as a moderate-sized village, and there were certainly more lights
3774: burning in it every evening, more wine, spirits, and ale drunk, more
3775: waste and more folly, than could be found in some large villages. There
3776: was fast revelry in the steward's room, and slow revelry in the Scotch
3777: bailiff's room; short whist, costume, and flirtation in the
3778: housekeeper's room, and the same at a lower price in the servants' hall;
3779: a select Olympian feast in the private apartment of the cook, who was a
3780: much grander person than her ladyship, and wore gold and jewelry to a
3781: vast amount of suet; a gambling group in the stables, and the coachman,
3782: perhaps the most innocent member of the establishment, tippling in
3783: majestic solitude by a fire in the harness-room. For Sir Maximus, as
3784: every one said, was a gentleman of the right sort, condescended to no
3785: mean enquiries, greeted his head-servants with a "good-evening,
3786: gentlemen," when he met them in the park, and only snarled in a subdued
3787: way when he looked over the accounts, willing to endure some personal
3788: inconvenience in order to keep up the institutions of the country, to
3789: maintain his hereditary establishment, and do his duty in that station
3790: of life--the station of the long-tailed saurian--to which it had pleased
3791: Providence to call him.
3792: 
3793: The focus of brilliancy at Treby Manor that evening was in no way the
3794: dining-room, where Sir Maximus sipped his port under some mental
3795: depression, as he discussed with his brother, the Reverend Augustus, the
3796: sad fact that one of the oldest names in the county was to be on the
3797: wrong side--not in the drawing-room, where Miss Debarry and Miss Selina,
3798: quietly elegant in their dress and manners, were feeling rather dull
3799: than otherwise, having finished Mr. Bulwer's "Eugene Aram," and being
3800: thrown back on the last great prose work of Mr. Southey, while their
3801: mamma slumbered a little on the sofa. No; the centre of eager talk and
3802: enjoyment was the steward's room, where Mr. Scales, house-steward and
3803: head-butler, a man most solicitous about his boots, wristbands, the roll
3804: of his whiskers, and other attributes of a gentleman, distributed
3805: cigars, cognac, and whiskey, to various colleagues and guests who were
3806: discussing, with that freedom of conjecture which is one of our
3807: inalienable privileges as Britons, the probable amount of Harold
3808: Transome's fortune, concerning which fame had already been busy long
3809: enough to have acquired vast magnifying power.
3810: 
3811: The chief part in this scene was undoubtedly Mr. Christian's, although
3812: he had hitherto been comparatively silent; but he occupied two chairs
3813: with so much grace, throwing his right leg over the seat of the second,
3814: and resting his right hand on the back; he held his cigar and displayed
3815: a splendid seal-ring with such becoming nonchalance, and had his gray
3816: hair arranged with so much taste, that experienced eyes would at once
3817: have seen even the great Scales himself to be but a secondary character.
3818: 
3819: "Why," said Mr. Crowder, an old respectable tenant, though much in
3820: arrear as to his rent, who condescended frequently to drink in the
3821: steward's room for the sake of the conversation; "why, I suppose they
3822: get money so fast in the East--it's wonderful. Why," he went on, with a
3823: hesitating look toward Mr. Scales, "this Transome p'r'aps got a matter
3824: of a hundred thousand."
3825: 
3826: "A hundred thousand, my dear sir! fiddle-stick's end of a hundred
3827: thousand," said Mr. Scales, with a contempt very painful to be borne by
3828: a modest man.
3829: 
3830: "Well," said Mr. Crowder, giving way under torture, as the all-knowing
3831: butler puffed and stared at him, "perhaps not so much as that."
3832: 
3833: "Not so much, sir! I tell you that a hundred thousand pounds is a
3834: bagatelle."
3835: 
3836: "Well, I know it's a big sum," said Mr. Crowder, deprecatingly.
3837: 
3838: Here there was a general laugh. All the other intellects present were
3839: more cultivated than Mr. Crowder's.
3840: 
3841: "Bagatelle is the French for trifle, my friend," said Mr. Christian.
3842: "Don't talk over people's heads so, Scales. I shall have hard work to
3843: understand you myself soon."
3844: 
3845: "Come, that's a good one," said the head-gardener, who was a ready
3846: admirer; "I should like to hear the thing you don't understand,
3847: Christian."
3848: 
3849: "He's a first-rate hand at sneering," said Mr. Scales, rather nettled.
3850: 
3851: "Don't be waspie, man. I'll ring the bell for lemons, and make some
3852: punch. That's the thing for putting people up to the unknown tongues,"
3853: said Mr. Christian, starting up and slapping Scales's shoulder as he
3854: passed him.
3855: 
3856: "What I mean, Mr. Crowder, is this." Here Mr. Scales paused to puff,
3857: and pull down his waistcoat in a gentlemanly manner, and drink. He was
3858: wont in this way to give his hearers time for meditation.
3859: 
3860: "Come, then, speak English; I'm not against being taught," said the
3861: reasonable Crowder.
3862: 
3863: "What I mean is, that in a large way of trade a man turns his capital
3864: over almost as soon as he can turn himself. Bless your soul! I know
3865: something about these matters, eh, Brent?"
3866: 
3867: "To be sure you do--few men more," said the gardener, who was the person
3868: appealed to.
3869: 
3870: "Not that I've had anything to do with commercial families myself. I've
3871: those feelings that I look to other things besides lucre. But I can't
3872: say that I've not been intimate with parties who have been less nice
3873: than I am myself; and knowing what I know, I shouldn't wonder if
3874: Transome had as much as five hundred thousand. Bless your soul, sir!
3875: people who get their money out of land are as long scraping five pounds
3876: together as your trading men are in turning five pounds into a hundred."
3877: 
3878: "That's a wicked thing, though," said Mr. Crowder, meditatively.
3879: "However," he went on, retreating from this difficult ground, "trade or
3880: no trade, the Transomes have been poor enough this many a long year.
3881: I've a brother a tenant on their estate--I ought to know a little bit
3882: about that."
3883: 
3884: "They've kept up no establishment at all," said Mr. Scales, with
3885: disgust. "They've even let their kitchen gardens. I suppose it was the
3886: son's gambling. I've seen something of that. A man who has always lived
3887: in first-rate families is likely to know a thing or two on that
3888: subject."
3889: 
3890: "Ah, but it wasn't gambling did the first mischief," said Mr. Crowder,
3891: with a slight smile, feeling that it was his turn to have some
3892: superiority. "New-comers don't know what happened in this country twenty
3893: and thirty years ago. I'm turned fifty myself, and my father lived under
3894: Sir Maximus's father. But if anybody from London can tell me more than I
3895: know about this country-side, I'm willing to listen."
3896: 
3897: "What was it, then, if it wasn't gambling?" said Mr. Scales, with some
3898: impatience. "_I_ don't pretend to know."
3899: 
3900: "It was law--law--that's what it was. Not but what the Transomes always
3901: won."
3902: 
3903: "And always lost," said the too-ready Scales. "Yes, yes; I think we all
3904: know the nature of law."
3905: 
3906: "There was the last suit of all made the most noise, as I understood,"
3907: continued Mr. Crowder; "but it wasn't tried hereabout. They said there
3908: was a deal o' false swearing. Some young man pretended to be the true
3909: heir--let me see--I can't justly remember the names--he'd got two. _He_
3910: swore he was one man, and _they_ swore he was another. However Lawyer
3911: Jermyn won it--they say he'd win a game against the Old One himself--and
3912: the young fellow turned out to be a scamp. Stop a bit--his name was
3913: Scaddon--Henry Scaddon."
3914: 
3915: Mr. Christian here let a lemon slip from his hand into the punch-bowl
3916: with a splash which sent some of the nectar into the company's faces.
3917: 
3918: "Hallo! What a bungler I am!" he said, looking as if he were quite
3919: jarred by this unusual awkwardness of his. "Go on with your tale, Mr.
3920: Crowder--a scamp named Henry Scaddon."
3921: 
3922: "Well, that's the tale," said Mr. Crowder. "He was never seen nothing of
3923: anymore. It was a deal talked of at the time--and I've sat by; and my
3924: father used to shake his head; and always when this Mrs. Transome was
3925: talked of, he used to shake his head, and say she carried things with a
3926: high hand once. But, Lord! it was before the battle of Waterloo, and I'm
3927: a poor hand at tales; I don't see much good in 'em myself--but if
3928: anybody'll tell me a cure for the sheep-rot, I'll thank him."
3929: 
3930: Here Mr. Crowder relapsed into smoking and silence, a little discomfited
3931: that the knowledge of which he had been delivered had turned out rather
3932: a shapeless and insignificant birth.
3933: 
3934: "Well, well, bygones should be bygones; there are secrets in most good
3935: families," said Mr. Scales, winking, "and this young Transome, coming
3936: back with a fortune to keep up the establishment, and have things done
3937: in a decent and gentlemanly way--it would all have been right if he'd
3938: not been this sort of Radical madman. But now he's done for himself. I
3939: heard Sir Maximus say at dinner that he would be excommunicated; and
3940: that's a pretty strong word, I take it."
3941: 
3942: "What does it mean, Scales?" said Mr. Christian, who loved tormenting.
3943: 
3944: "Ay, what's the meaning?" insisted Mr. Crowder, encouraged by finding
3945: that even Christian was in the dark.
3946: 
3947: "Well, it's a law term--speaking in a figurative sort of way--meaning
3948: that a Radical was no gentleman."
3949: 
3950: "Perhaps it's partly accounted for by his getting his money so fast, and
3951: in foreign countries," said Mr. Crowder, tentatively. "It's reasonable
3952: to think he'd be against the land and this country--eh, Sircome?"
3953: 
3954: Sircome was an eminent miller who had considerable business transactions
3955: at the Manor, and appreciated Mr. Scales's merits at a handsome
3956: percentage on the yearly account. He was a highly honorable tradesman,
3957: but in this and in other matters submitted to the institutions of his
3958: country; for great houses, as he observed, must have great butlers. He
3959: replied to his friend Crowder sententiously.
3960: 
3961: "I say nothing. Before I bring words to market, I should like to see 'em
3962: a bit scarcer. There's the land and there's trade--I hold with both. I
3963: swim with the stream."
3964: 
3965: "Hey-day, Mr. Sircome! that's a Radical maxim," said Mr. Christian, who
3966: knew that Mr. Sircome's last sentence was his favorite formula. "I
3967: advise you to give it up, else it will injure the quality of your
3968: flour."
3969: 
3970: "A Radical maxim!" said Mr. Sircome, in a tone of angry astonishment. "I
3971: should like to hear you prove that. It's as old as my grandfather,
3972: anyhow."
3973: 
3974: "I'll prove it in one minute," said the glib Christian. "Reform has set
3975: in by the will of the majority--that's the rabble, you know; and the
3976: respectability and good sense of the country, which are in the minority,
3977: are afraid of Reform running on too fast. So the stream must be running
3978: toward Reform and Radicalism; and if you swim with it, Mr. Sircome,
3979: you're a Reformer and a Radical, and your flour is objectionable, and
3980: not full weight--and being tried by Scales, will be found wanting."
3981: 
3982: There was a roar of laughter. This pun upon Scales was highly
3983: appreciated by every one except the miller and butler. The latter pulled
3984: down his waistcoat, and puffed and stared in rather an excited manner.
3985: Mr. Christian's wit, in general, seemed to him a poor kind of quibbling.
3986: 
3987: "What a fellow you are for fence, Christian," said the gardener. "Hang
3988: me, if I don't think you're up to everything."
3989: 
3990: "That's a compliment you might pay Old Nick, if you come to that," said
3991: Mr. Sircome, who was in the painful position of a man deprived of his
3992: formula.
3993: 
3994: "Yes, yes," said Mr. Scales; "I'm no fool myself, and could parry a
3995: thrust if I liked, but I shouldn't like it to be said of me that I was
3996: up to everything. I'll keep a little principle if you please."
3997: 
3998: "To be sure," said Christian, ladling out the punch. "What would justice
3999: be without Scales?"
4000: 
4001: The laughter was not quite so full-throated as before. Such excessive
4002: cleverness _was_ a little Satanic.
4003: 
4004: "A joke's a joke among gentlemen," said the butler, getting exasperated;
4005: "I think there has been quite liberties enough taken with my name. But
4006: if you must talk about names, I've heard of a party before now calling
4007: himself a Christian, and being anything _but_ it."
4008: 
4009: "Come, that's beyond a joke," said the surgeon's assistant, a fast man,
4010: whose chief scene of dissipation was the manor. "Let it drop, Scales."
4011: 
4012: "Yes, I dare say it's beyond a joke. I'm not a harlequin to talk nothing
4013: but jokes. I leave that to other Christians, who are up to everything,
4014: and have been everywhere--to the hulks, for what I know; and more than
4015: that, they come from nobody knows where, and try to worm themselves into
4016: gentlemen's confidence, to the prejudice of their betters."
4017: 
4018: There was a stricter sequence in Mr. Scales's angry eloquence than was
4019: apparent--some chief links being confined to his own breast, as is often
4020: the case in energetic discourse. The company were in a state of
4021: expectation. There was something behind worth knowing, and something
4022: before them worth seeing. In the general decay of other fine British
4023: pugnacious sports, a quarrel between gentlemen was all the more
4024: exciting, and though no one would himself have liked to turn on Scales,
4025: no one was sorry for the chance of seeing him put down. But the amazing
4026: Christian was unmoved. He had taken out his handkerchief and was rubbing
4027: his lips carefully. After a slight pause, he spoke with perfect
4028: coolness.
4029: 
4030: "I don't intend to quarrel with you, Scales. Such talk as this is not
4031: profitable to either of us. It makes you purple in the face--you _are_
4032: apoplectic, you know--and it spoils good company. Better tell a few fibs
4033: about me behind my back--it will heat you less, and do me more harm.
4034: I'll leave you to it; I shall go and have a game of whist with the
4035: ladies."
4036: 
4037: As the door closed behind the questionable Christian, Mr. Scales was in
4038: a state of frustration that prevented speech. Every one was rather
4039: embarrassed.
4040: 
4041: "That's an uncommon sort o' fellow," said Mr. Crowder, in an undertone,
4042: to his next neighbor, the gardener. "Why, Mr. Philip picked him up in
4043: foreign parts, didn't he?"
4044: 
4045: "He was a courier," said the gardener. "He's had a deal of experience.
4046: And I believe, by what I can make out--for he's been pretty free with me
4047: sometimes--there was a time when he was in that rank of life that he
4048: fought a duel."
4049: 
4050: "Ah! that makes him such a cool chap," said Mr. Crowder.
4051: 
4052: "He's what I call an overbearing fellow," said Mr. Sircome, also _sotto
4053: voce_, to his next neighbor, Mr. Filmore, the surgeon's assistant. "He
4054: runs you down with a sort of talk that's neither here nor there. He's
4055: got a deal too many samples in his pocket for me."
4056: 
4057: "All I know is, he's a wonderful hand at cards," said Mr. Filmore, whose
4058: whiskers and shirt-pin were quite above the average. "I wish I could
4059: play _écarté_ as he does; it's beautiful to see him; he can make a man
4060: look pretty blue; he'll empty his pocket for him in no time."
4061: 
4062: "That's none to his credit," said Mr. Sircome.
4063: 
4064: The conversation had in this way broken up into _tête-à-tête_, and the
4065: hilarity of the evening might be considered a failure. Still the punch
4066: was drunk, the accounts were duly swelled, and, notwithstanding the
4067: innovating spirit of the time, Sir Maximus Debarry's establishment was
4068: kept up in sound hereditary British manner.
4069:

4073: CHAPTER VIII.
4074: 
4075:     "Rumor doth double like the voice and echo."--_Shakespeare._
4076: 
4077:     The mind of a man is as a country which was once open to squatters,
4078:     who have bred and multiplied and become masters of the land. But
4079:     then happeneth a time when new and hungry comers dispute the land;
4080:     and there is trial of strength, and the stronger wins. Nevertheless
4081:     the first squatters be they who have prepared the ground, and the
4082:     crops to the end will be sequent (though chiefly on the nature of
4083:     the soil, as of light sand, mixed loam, or heavy clay, yet)
4084:     somewhat on the primal labor and sowing.
4085: 
4086: 
4087: That talkative maiden, Rumor, though in the interest of art she is
4088: figured as a youthful, winged beauty with flowing garments, soaring
4089: above the heads of men, and breathing world-thrilling news through a
4090: gracefully-curved trumpet, is in fact a very old maid, who puckers her
4091: silly face by the fireside, and really does no more than chirp a wrong
4092: guess or a lame story into the ear of a fellow gossip; all the rest of
4093: the work attributed to her is done by the ordinary working of those
4094: passions against which men pray in the Litany, with the help of a
4095: plentiful stupidity against which we have never yet had any authorized
4096: form of prayer.
4097: 
4098: When Mr. Scales's strong need to make an impressive figure in
4099: conversation, together with his very slight need of any other premise
4100: than his own sense of his wide general knowledge and probable
4101: infallibility, led him to specify five hundred thousand as the lowest
4102: admissible amount of Harold Transome's commercially-acquired fortune, it
4103: was not fair to put this down to poor old Miss Rumor, who had only told
4104: Scales that the fortune was considerable. And again, when the curt Mr.
4105: Sircome found occasion at Treby to mention the five hundred thousand as
4106: a fact that folks seemed pretty sure about, this expansion of the butler
4107: into "folks" was entirely due to Mr. Sircome's habitual preference for
4108: words which could not be laid hold of or give people a handle over him.
4109: It was in this simple way that the report of Harold Transome's fortune
4110: spread and was magnified, adding much lustre to his opinion in the eyes
4111: of Liberals, and compelling even men of the opposite party to admit that
4112: it increased his eligibility as a member for North Loamshire. It was
4113: observed by a sound thinker in these parts that property was ballast;
4114: and when once the aptness of that metaphor had been perceived, it
4115: followed that a man was not fit to navigate the sea of politics without
4116: a great deal of such ballast; and that, rightly understood, whatever
4117: increased the expense of election, inasmuch as it virtually raised the
4118: property qualification, was an unspeakable boon to the country.
4119: 
4120: Meanwhile the fortune that was getting larger in the imagination of
4121: constituents was shrinking a little in the imagination of its owner. It
4122: was hardly more than a hundred and fifty thousand; and there were not
4123: only the heavy mortgages to be paid off, but also a large amount of
4124: capital was needed in order to repair the farm-buildings all over the
4125: estate, to carry out extensive drainage, and make allowances to
4126: in-coming tenants, which might remove the difficulties of newly letting
4127: the farms in a time of agricultural depression. The farms actually
4128: tenanted were held by men who had begged hard to succeed their fathers
4129: in getting a little poorer every year, on land which was also getting
4130: poorer, where the highest rate of increase was in the arrears of rent,
4131: and where the master, in crushed hat and corduroys, looked pitiably lean
4132: and care-worn by the side of pauper laborers, who showed that superior
4133: assimilating power often observed to attend nourishment by the public
4134: money. Mr. Goffe, of Rabbit's End, had never had it explained to him
4135: that, according to the true theory of rent, land must inevitably be
4136: given up when it would not yield a profit equal to the ordinary rate of
4137: interest; so that from want of knowing what was inevitable, and not from
4138: a Titanic spirit of opposition, he kept on his land. He often said to
4139: himself, with a melancholy wipe of his sleeve across his brow, that he
4140: "didn't know which-a-way to turn"; and he would have been still more at
4141: a loss on the subject if he had quitted Rabbit's End with a wagonful of
4142: furniture and utensils, a file of receipts, a wife with five children,
4143: and a shepherd dog in low spirits.
4144: 
4145: It took no long time for Harold Transome to discover this state of
4146: things, and to see, moreover, that, except on the demesne immediately
4147: around the house, the timber had been mismanaged. The woods had been
4148: recklessly thinned, and there had been insufficient planting. He had not
4149: yet thoroughly investigated the various accounts kept by his mother, by
4150: Jermyn, and by Banks the bailiff; but what had been done with the large
4151: sums which had been received for timber was a suspicious mystery to him.
4152: He observed that the farm held by Jermyn was in first-rate order, that a
4153: good deal had been spent on the buildings, and that the rent had stood
4154: unpaid. Mrs. Transome had taken an opportunity of saying that Jermyn had
4155: had some of the mortgage deeds transferred to him, and that his rent was
4156: set against so much interest. Harold had only said, in his careless yet
4157: decisive way, "Oh, Jermyn be hanged! It seems to me if Durfey hadn't
4158: died and made room for me, Jermyn would have ended by coming to live
4159: here, and you would have had to keep the lodge and open the gate for his
4160: carriage. But I shall pay him off--mortgages and all--by-and-by. I'll
4161: owe him nothing--not even a curse!" Mrs. Transome said no more. Harold
4162: did not care to enter fully into the subject with his mother. The fact
4163: that she had been active in the management of the estate--had ridden
4164: about it continually, had busied herself with accounts, had been
4165: head-bailiff of the vacant farms, and had yet allowed things to go
4166: wrong--was set down by him simply to the general futility of women's
4167: attempts to transact men's business. He did not want to say anything to
4168: annoy her: he was only determined to let her understand, as quietly as
4169: possible, that she had better cease all interference.
4170: 
4171: Mrs. Transome did understand this; and it was very little that she dared
4172: to say on business, though there was a fierce struggle of her anger and
4173: pride with a dread which was nevertheless supreme. As to the old
4174: tenants, she only observed, on hearing Harold burst forth about their
4175: wretched condition, "that with the estate so burdened, the yearly loss
4176: by arrears could better be borne than the outlay and sacrifice necessary
4177: in order to let the farms anew."
4178: 
4179: "I was really capable of calculating, Harold," she ended, with a touch
4180: of bitterness. "It seems easy to deal with farmers and their affairs
4181: when you only see them in print, I dare say; but it's not quite so easy
4182: when you live among them. You have only to look at Sir Maximus's estate:
4183: you will see plenty of the same thing. The times have been dreadful and
4184: old families like to keep their old tenants. But I dare say that is
4185: Toryism."
4186: 
4187: "It's a hash of odds and ends, if that is Toryism, my dear mother.
4188: However, I wish you had kept three more old tenants; for then I should
4189: have had three more fifty-pound voters. And, in a hard run, one may be
4190: beaten by a head. But," Harold added, smiling and handing her a ball of
4191: worsted which had fallen, "a woman ought to be a Tory, and graceful, and
4192: handsome, like you. I should hate a woman who took up my opinions and
4193: talked for me. I'm an Oriental, you know. I say, mother, shall we have
4194: this room furnished with rose-color? I notice that it suits your bright
4195: gray hair."
4196: 
4197: Harold thought it was only natural that his mother should have been in a
4198: sort of subjection to Jermyn throughout the awkward circumstances of the
4199: family. It was the way of women, and all weak minds, to think that what
4200: they had been used to was unalterable, and any quarrel with a man who
4201: managed private affairs was necessarily a formidable thing. He himself
4202: was proceeding very cautiously, and preferred not even to know too much
4203: just at present, lest a certain personal antipathy he was conscious of
4204: toward Jermyn, and an occasional liability to exasperation, should get
4205: the better of a calm and clear-sighted resolve not to quarrel with the
4206: man while he could be of use. Harold would have been disgusted with
4207: himself if he had helped to frustrate his own purpose. And his strongest
4208: purpose now was to get returned for Parliament, to make a figure there
4209: as a Liberal member, and to become on all grounds a personage of weight
4210: in North Loamshire.
4211: 
4212: How Howard Transome came to be a Liberal in opposition to all the
4213: traditions of his family, was a more subtle enquiry than he had ever
4214: cared to follow out. The newspapers undertook to explain it. The _North
4215: Loamshire Herald_ witnessed with a grief and disgust certain to be
4216: shared by all persons who were actuated by wholesome British feeling, an
4217: example of defection in the inheritor of a family name which in times
4218: past had been associated with attachment to right principle, and with
4219: the maintenance of our constitution in Church and State; and pointed to
4220: it as an additional proof that men who had passed any large portion of
4221: their lives beyond the limits of our favored country, usually contracted
4222: not only a laxity of feeling toward Protestantism, nay, toward religion
4223: itself--a latitudinarian spirit hardly distinguishable from atheism--but
4224: also a levity of disposition, inducing them to tamper with those
4225: institutions by which alone Great Britain had risen to her pre-eminence
4226: among the nations. Such men, infected with outlandish habits,
4227: intoxicated with vanity, grasping at momentary power by flattery of the
4228: multitude, fearless because godless, Liberal because un-English, were
4229: ready to pull one stone from under another in the national edifice, till
4230: the great structure tottered to its fall. On the other hand, the
4231: _Duffield Watchman_ saw in this signal instance of self-liberation from
4232: the trammels of prejudice, a decisive guarantee of intellectual
4233: pre-eminence, united with a generous sensibility to the claims of man as
4234: man, which had burst asunder, and cast off, by a spontaneous exertion of
4235: energy, the cramping out-worn shell of hereditary bias and class
4236: interest.
4237: 
4238: But these large-minded guides of public opinion argued from wider data
4239: than could be furnished by any knowledge of the particular case
4240: concerned. Harold Transome was neither the dissolute cosmopolitan so
4241: vigorously sketched by the Tory _Herald_, nor the intellectual giant and
4242: moral lobster suggested by the Liberal imagination of the _Watchman_.
4243: Twenty years ago he had been a bright, active, good-tempered lad, with
4244: sharp eyes and a good aim; he delighted in success and in predominance;
4245: but he did not long for an impossible predominance, and become sour and
4246: sulky because it was impossible. He played at the games he was clever
4247: in, and usually won; all other games he let alone, and thought them of
4248: little worth. At home and at Eton he had been side by side with his
4249: stupid elder brother Durfey, whom he despised; and he very early began
4250: to reflect that since this Caliban in miniature was older than himself,
4251: he must carve out his own fortune. That was a nuisance; and on the whole
4252: the world seemed rather ill-arranged, at Eton especially, where there
4253: were many reasons why Harold made no great figure. He was not sorry the
4254: money was wanting to send him to Oxford; he did not see the good of
4255: Oxford; he had been surrounded by many things during his short life, of
4256: which he had distinctly said to himself that he did not see the good,
4257: and he was not disposed to venerate on the strength of any good that
4258: others saw. He turned his back on home very cheerfully, though he was
4259: rather fond of his mother, and very fond of Transome Court, and the
4260: river where he had been used to fish; but he said to himself as he
4261: passed the lodge-gates, "I'll get rich somehow, and have an estate of my
4262: own, and do what I like with it." This determined aiming at something
4263: not easy but clearly possible, marked the direction in which Harold's
4264: nature was strong; he had the energetic will and muscle, the
4265: self-confidence, the quick perception, and the narrow imagination which
4266: make what is admiringly called the practical mind.
4267: 
4268: Since then his character had been ripened by a various experience, and
4269: also by much knowledge which he had set himself deliberately to gain.
4270: But the man was no more than the boy writ large, with an extensive
4271: commentary. The years had nourished an inclination to as much opposition
4272: as would enable him to assert his own independence and power without
4273: throwing himself into that tabooed condition which robs power of its
4274: triumph. And this inclination had helped his shrewdness in forming
4275: judgments which were at once innovating and moderate. He was addicted at
4276: once to rebellion and to conformity, and only an intimate personal
4277: knowledge could enable any one to predict where his conformity would
4278: begin. The limit was not defined by theory, but was drawn in an
4279: irregular zigzag by early disposition and association; and his
4280: resolution, of which he had never lost hold, to be a thorough Englishman
4281: again some day, had kept up the habit of considering all his conclusions
4282: with reference to English politics and English social conditions. He
4283: meant to stand up for every change that the economical condition of the
4284: country required, and he had an angry contempt for men with coronets on
4285: their coaches, but too small a share of brains to see when they had
4286: better make a virtue of necessity. His respect was rather for men who
4287: had no coronets, but who achieved a just influence by furthering all
4288: measures which the common-sense of the country, and the increasing
4289: self-assertion of the majority, peremptorily demanded. He could be such
4290: a man himself.
4291: 
4292: In fact Harold Transome was a clever, frank, good-natured egoist; not
4293: stringently consistent, but without any disposition to falsity; but with
4294: a pride that was moulded in an individual rather than an hereditary
4295: form; unspeculative, unsentimental, unsympathetic; fond of sensual
4296: pleasures, but disinclined to all vice, and attached as a healthy,
4297: clear-sighted person, to all conventional morality, construed with a
4298: certain freedom, like doctrinal articles to which the public order may
4299: require subscription. A character is apt to look but indifferently,
4300: written out in this way. Reduced to a map, our premises seem
4301: insignificant, but they make, nevertheless, a very pretty freehold to
4302: live in and walk over; and so, if Harold Transome had been among your
4303: acquaintances, and you had observed his qualities through the medium of
4304: his agreeable person, bright smile, and a certain easy charm which
4305: accompanies sensuousness when unsullied by coarseness--through the
4306: medium also of the many opportunities in which he would have made
4307: himself useful or pleasant to you--you would have thought him a good
4308: fellow, highly acceptable as a guest, a colleague, or a brother-in-law.
4309: Whether all mothers would have liked him as a son is another question.
4310: 
4311: It is a fact perhaps kept a little too much in the background, that
4312: mothers have a self larger than their maternity, and that when their
4313: sons have become taller than themselves, and are gone from them to
4314: college or into the world, there are wide spaces of their time which are
4315: not filled with praying for their boys, reading old letters, and envying
4316: yet blessing those who are attending to their shirt-buttons. Mrs.
4317: Transome was certainly not one of those bland, adoring, and gently
4318: tearful women. After sharing the common dream that when a beautiful
4319: man-child was born to her, her cup of happiness would be full, she had
4320: travelled through long years apart from that child to find herself at
4321: last in the presence of a son of whom she was afraid, who was utterly
4322: unmanageable by her, and to whose sentiments in any given case she
4323: possessed no key. Yet Harold was a kind son: he kissed his mother's
4324: brow, offered her his arm, let her choose what she liked for the house
4325: and garden, asked her whether she would have bays or grays for her new
4326: carriage, and was bent on seeing her make as good a figure in the
4327: neighborhood as any other woman of her rank. She trembled under this
4328: kindness: it was not enough to satisfy her; still, if it should ever
4329: cease and give place to something else--she was too uncertain about
4330: Harold's feelings to imagine clearly what that something would be. The
4331: finest threads, such as no eye sees, if bound cunningly about the
4332: sensitive flesh, so that the movement to break them would bring torture,
4333: may make a worse bondage than any fetters. Mrs. Transome felt the fatal
4334: thread about her, and the bitterness of this helpless bondage mingled
4335: itself with the new elegancies of the dining and drawing-rooms, and all
4336: the household changes which Harold had ordered to be brought about with
4337: magical quickness. Nothing was as she had once expected it would be. If
4338: Harold had shown the least care to have her stay in the room with
4339: him--if he had really cared for her opinion--if he had been what she had
4340: dreamed he would be in the eyes of those people who had made her
4341: world--if all the past could be dissolved, and leave no solid trace of
4342: itself--mighty _ifs_ that were all impossible--she would have tasted
4343: some joy; but now she began to look back with regret to the days when
4344: she sat in loneliness among the old drapery, and still longed for
4345: something that might happen. Yet, save in a bitter little speech, or in
4346: a deep sigh, heard by no one besides Denner, she kept all these things
4347: hidden in her heart, and went out in the autumn sunshine to overlook the
4348: alterations in the pleasure-grounds very much as a happy woman might
4349: have done. One day, however, when she was occupied in this way, an
4350: occasion came on which she chose to express indirectly a part of her
4351: inward care.
4352: 
4353: She was standing on the broad gravel in the afternoon; the long shadows
4354: lay on the grass; the light seemed the more glorious because of the
4355: reddened and golden trees. The gardeners were busy at their pleasant
4356: work; the newly-turned soil gave out an agreeable fragrance; and little
4357: Harry was playing with Nimrod round old Mr. Transome, who sat placidly
4358: on a low garden-chair. The scene would have made a charming picture of
4359: English domestic life, and the handsome, majestic, gray-haired woman
4360: (obviously grandmamma) would have been especially admired. But the
4361: artist would have felt it requisite to turn her face toward her husband
4362: and little grandson, and to have given her an elderly amiability of
4363: expression which would have divided remark with his exquisite rendering
4364: of her Indian shawl. Mrs. Transome's face was turned the other way, and
4365: for this reason she only heard an approaching step, and did not see
4366: whose it was; yet it startled her: it was not quick enough to be her
4367: son's step, and besides, Harold was away at Duffield. It was Mr.
4368: Jermyn's.
4369: 
4370: 
4371: 
4372: 
4373: CHAPTER IX.
4374: 
4375:     "A woman naturally born to fears."--_King John._
4376: 
4377:                                      "Methinks,
4378:     Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,
4379:     Is coming toward me; and my inward soul
4380:     With nothing trembles."--_King Richard II._
4381: 
4382: 
4383: Matthew Jermyn approached Mrs. Transome taking off his hat and smiling.
4384: She did not smile, but said--
4385: 
4386: "You knew Harold was not at home?"
4387: 
4388: "Yes; I came to see you, to know if you had any wishes that I could
4389: further, since I have not had an opportunity of consulting you since he
4390: came home."
4391: 
4392: "Let us walk toward the Rookery, then."
4393: 
4394: They turned together, Mr. Jermyn still keeping his hat off and holding
4395: it behind him; the air was so soft and agreeable that Mrs. Transome had
4396: nothing but a large veil over her head.
4397: 
4398: They walked for a little while in silence till they were out of sight,
4399: under tall trees, and treading noiselessly on falling leaves. What
4400: Jermyn was really most anxious about, was to learn from Mrs. Transome
4401: whether anything had transpired that was significant of Harold's
4402: disposition toward him, which he suspected to be very far from friendly.
4403: Jermyn was not naturally flinty-hearted: at five-and-twenty he had
4404: written verses, and had got himself wet through in order not to
4405: disappoint a dark-eyed woman whom he was proud to believe in love with
4406: him; but a family man with grown up sons and daughters, a man with a
4407: professional position and complicated affairs that make it hard to
4408: ascertain the exact relation between property and liabilities,
4409: necessarily thinks of himself and what may be impending.
4410: 
4411: "Harold is remarkably acute and clever," he began at last, since Mrs.
4412: Transome did not speak. "If he gets into Parliament, I have no doubt he
4413: will distinguish himself. He has a quick eye for business of all kinds."
4414: 
4415: "That is no comfort to me," said Mrs. Transome. To-day she was more
4416: conscious than usual of that bitterness which was always in her mind in
4417: Jermyn's presence, but which was carefully suppressed:--suppressed
4418: because she could not endure that the degradation she inwardly felt
4419: should ever become visible or audible in acts or words of her
4420: own--should ever be reflected in any word or look of his. For years
4421: there had been a deep silence about the past between them; on her side
4422: because she remembered; on his, because he more and more forgot.
4423: 
4424: "I trust he is not unkind to you in any way. I know his opinions pain
4425: you; but I trust you find him in everything else disposed to be a good
4426: son."
4427: 
4428: "Oh, to be sure--good as men are disposed to be to women, giving them
4429: cushions and carriages, and recommending them to enjoy themselves, and
4430: then expecting them to be contented under contempt and neglect. I have
4431: no power over him--remember that--none."
4432: 
4433: Jermyn turned to look in Mrs. Transome's face: it was long since he had
4434: heard her speak to him as if she were losing her self-command.
4435: 
4436: "Has he shown any unpleasant feeling about your management of affairs?"
4437: 
4438: "_My_ management!" Mrs. Transome said, with concentrated rage, flashing
4439: a fierce look at Jermyn. She checked herself: she felt as if she were
4440: lighting a torch to flare on her own past folly and misery. It was a
4441: resolve which had become a habit, that she would never quarrel with this
4442: man--never tell him what she saw him to be. She had kept her woman's
4443: pride and sensibility intact: through all her life there had vibrated
4444: the maiden need to have her hand kissed and be the object of chivalry.
4445: And so she sank into silence again, trembling.
4446: 
4447: Jermyn felt annoyed--nothing more. There was nothing in his mind
4448: corresponding to the intricate meshes of sensitiveness in Mrs.
4449: Transome's. He was anything but stupid; yet he always blundered when he
4450: wanted to be delicate or magnanimous; he constantly sought to soothe
4451: others by praising himself. Moral vulgarity cleaved to him like an
4452: hereditary odor. He blundered now.
4453: 
4454: "My dear Mrs. Transome," he said, in a tone of bland kindness, "you are
4455: agitated--you appear angry with me. Yet I think, if you consider, you
4456: will see that you have nothing to complain of in me, unless you will
4457: complain of the inevitable course of man's life. I have always met your
4458: wishes both in happy circumstances and in unhappy ones. I should be
4459: ready to do so now, if it were possible."
4460: 
4461: Every sentence was as pleasant to her as if it had been cut in her bared
4462: arm. Some men's kindness and love-making are more exasperating, more
4463: humiliating than others' derision; but the pitiable woman who has once
4464: made herself secretly dependent on a man who is beneath her in feeling,
4465: must bear that humiliation for fear of worse. Coarse kindness is at
4466: least better than coarse anger; and in all private quarrels the duller
4467: nature is triumphant by reason of its dullness. Mrs. Transome knew in
4468: her inmost soul that those relations which had sealed her lips on
4469: Jermyn's conduct in business matters, had been with him a ground for
4470: presuming that he should have impunity in any lax dealing into which
4471: circumstances had led him. She knew that she herself had endured all the
4472: more privation because of his dishonest selfishness. And now, Harold's
4473: long-deferred heirship, and his return with startlingly unexpected
4474: penetration, activity, and assertion of mastery, had placed them both in
4475: the full presence of a difficulty which had been prepared by the years
4476: of vague uncertainty as to issues. In this position, with a great dread
4477: hanging over her, which Jermyn knew, and ought to have felt that he had
4478: caused her, she was inclined to lash him with indignation, to scorch him
4479: with the words that were just the fit names for his doings--inclined all
4480: the more when he spoke with an insolent blandness, ignoring all that was
4481: truly in her heart. But no sooner did the words "You have brought it on
4482: me" rise within her than she heard within also the retort, "You brought
4483: it on yourself." Not for all the world beside could she bear to hear
4484: that retort uttered from without. What did she do? With strange sequence
4485: to all that rapid tumult, after a few moments' silence she said--
4486: 
4487: "Let me take your arm."
4488: 
4489: He gave it immediately, putting on his hat and wondering. For more than
4490: twenty years Mrs. Transome had never chosen to take his arm.
4491: 
4492: "I have but one thing to ask. Make me a promise."
4493: 
4494: "What is it?"
4495: 
4496: "That you will never quarrel with Harold."
4497: 
4498: "You must know that it is my wish not to quarrel with him."
4499: 
4500: "But make a vow--fix it in your mind as a thing not to be done. Bear
4501: anything from him rather than quarrel with him."
4502: 
4503: "A man can't make a vow not to quarrel," said Jermyn, who was already a
4504: little irritated by the implication that Harold might be disposed to use
4505: him roughly. "A man's temper may get the better of him at any moment. I
4506: am not prepared to bear _anything_."
4507: 
4508: "Good God!" said Mrs. Transome, taking her hand from his arm, "is it
4509: possible you don't feel how horrible it would be?"
4510: 
4511: As she took away her hand, Jermyn let his arm fall, put both his hands
4512: in his pockets, and shrugging his shoulders said, "I shall use him as he
4513: uses me."
4514: 
4515: Jermyn had turned round his savage side, and the blandness was out of
4516: sight. It was this that had always frightened Mrs. Transome: there was a
4517: possibility of fierce insolence in this man who was to pass with those
4518: nearest to her as her indebted servant, but whose brand she secretly
4519: bore. She was as powerless with him as she was with her own son.
4520: 
4521: This woman, who loved rule, dared not speak another word of attempted
4522: persuasion. They were both silent, taking the nearest way into the
4523: sunshine again. There was a half-formed wish in both their minds--even
4524: in the mother's--that Harold Transome had never been born.
4525: 
4526: "We are working hard for the election," said Jermyn, recovering
4527: himself, as they turned into the sunshine again. "I think we shall get
4528: him returned, and in that case he will be in high good-humor. Everything
4529: will be more propitious than you are apt to think. You must persuade
4530: yourself," he added, smiling at her, "that it is better for a man of his
4531: position to be in Parliament on the wrong side than not to be in at
4532: all."
4533: 
4534: "Never," said Mrs. Transome. "I am too old to learn to call bitter sweet
4535: and sweet bitter. But what I may think or feel is of no consequence now.
4536: I am as unnecessary as a chimney ornament."
4537: 
4538: And in this way they parted on the gravel, in that pretty scene where
4539: they had met. Mrs. Transome shivered as she stood alone: all around her,
4540: where there had once been brightness and warmth, there were white ashes,
4541: and the sunshine looked dreary as it fell on them.
4542: 
4543: Mr. Jermyn's heaviest reflections in riding homeward turned on the
4544: possibility of incidents between himself and Harold Transome which would
4545: have disagreeable results, requiring him to raise money, and perhaps
4546: causing scandal, which in its way might also help to create a monetary
4547: deficit. A man of sixty, with a wife whose Duffield connections were of
4548: the highest respectability, with a family of tall daughters, an
4549: expensive establishment, and a large professional business, owed a great
4550: deal more to himself as the mainstay of all those solidities, than to
4551: feelings and ideas which were quite unsubstantial. There were many
4552: unfortunate coincidences which placed Mr. Jermyn in an uncomfortable
4553: position just now; he had not been much to blame, he considered; if it
4554: had not been for a sudden turn of affairs no one would have complained.
4555: He defied any man to say that he had intended to wrong people; he was
4556: able to refund, to make reprisals, if they could be fairly demanded.
4557: Only he would certainly have preferred that they should not be demanded.
4558: 
4559: A German poet was entrusted with a particularly fine sausage, which he
4560: was to convey to the donor's friend at Paris. In the course of a long
4561: journey he smelled the sausage; he got hungry, and desired to taste it;
4562: he pared a morsel off, then another, and another, in successive moments
4563: of temptation, till at last the sausage was, humanly speaking, at an
4564: end. The offence had not been premeditated. The poet had never loved
4565: meanness, but he loved sausage; and the result was undeniably awkward.
4566: 
4567: So it was with Matthew Jermyn. He was far from liking that ugly
4568: abstraction rascality, but he had liked other things which had suggested
4569: nibbling. He had to do many things in law and in daily life which, in
4570: the abstract, he would have condemned; and indeed he had never been
4571: tempted by them in the abstract. Here, in fact, was the inconvenience:
4572: he had sinned for the sake of particular concrete things, and particular
4573: concrete consequences were likely to follow.
4574: 
4575: But he was a man of resolution, who, having made out what was the best
4576: course to take under a difficulty, went straight to his work. The
4577: election must be won: that would put Harold in good-humor, give him
4578: something to do, and leave himself more time to prepare for any crisis.
4579: 
4580: He was in anything but low spirits that evening. It was his eldest
4581: daughter's birthday, and the young people had a dance. Papa was
4582: delightful--stood up for a quadrille and a country-dance, told stories
4583: at supper, and made humorous quotations from his early readings: if
4584: these were Latin, he apologized, and translated to the ladies; so that a
4585: deaf lady-visitor from Duffield kept her trumpet up continually, lest
4586: she should lose any of Mr. Jermyn's conversation, and wished that her
4587: niece Maria had been present, who was young and had a good memory.
4588: 
4589: Still the party was smaller than usual, for some families in Treby
4590: refused to visit Jermyn, now that he was concerned for a Radical
4591: candidate.
4592: 
4593: 
4594: 
4595: 
4596: CHAPTER X.
4597: 
4598:     "He made love neither with roses, nor with apples, nor with locks
4599:     of hair."--THEOCRITUS.
4600: 
4601: 
4602: One Sunday afternoon Felix Holt rapped at the door of Mr. Lyon's house,
4603: although he could hear the voice of the minister preaching in the
4604: chapel. He stood with a book under his arm, apparently confident that
4605: there was someone in the house to open the door for him. In fact, Esther
4606: never went to chapel in the afternoon: that "exercise" made her head
4607: ache.
4608: 
4609: In these September weeks Felix had got rather intimate with Mr. Lyon.
4610: They shared the same political sympathies; and though, to Liberals who
4611: had neither freehold nor copyhold nor leasehold, the share in a county
4612: election consisted chiefly of that prescriptive amusement of the
4613: majority known as "looking on," there was still something to be said on
4614: the occasion, if not to be done. Perhaps the most delightful friendships
4615: are those in which there is much agreement, much disputation, and yet
4616: more personal liking; and the advent of the public-spirited,
4617: contradictory, yet affectionate Felix, into Treby life, had made a
4618: welcome epoch to the minister. To talk with this young man, who, though
4619: hopeful, had a singularity which some might at once have pronounced
4620: heresy, but which Mr. Lyon persisted in regarding as orthodoxy "in the
4621: making," was like a good bite to strong teeth after a too plentiful
4622: allowance of spoon meat. To cultivate his society with a view to
4623: checking his erratic tendencies was a laudable purpose; but perhaps if
4624: Felix had been rapidly subdued and reduced to conformity, little Mr.
4625: Lyon would have found the conversation much flatter.
4626: 
4627: Esther had not seen so much of their new acquaintance as her father had.
4628: But she had begun to find him amusing, and also rather irritating to her
4629: woman's love of conquest. He always opposed and criticised her; and
4630: besides that, he looked at her as if he never saw a single detail about
4631: her person--quite as if she were a middle-aged woman in a cap. She did
4632: not believe that he had ever admired her hands, or her long neck, or her
4633: graceful movements, which had made all the girls at school call her
4634: Calypso (doubtless from their familiarity with "Telémaque"). Felix ought
4635: properly to have been a little in love with her--never mentioning it, of
4636: course, because that would have been disagreeable, and his being a
4637: regular lover was out of the question. But it was quite clear that,
4638: instead of feeling any disadvantage on his own side, he held himself to
4639: be immeasurably her superior: and, what was worse, Esther had a secret
4640: consciousness that he was her superior. She was all the more vexed at
4641: the suspicion that he thought slightly of her; and wished in her
4642: vexation that she could have found more fault with him--that she had not
4643: been obliged to admire more and more the varying expressions of his open
4644: face and his deliciously good-humored laugh, always loud at a joke
4645: against himself. Besides, she could not help having her curiosity roused
4646: by the unusual combinations both in his mind and in his outward
4647: position, and she had surprised herself as well as her father one day by
4648: suddenly starting up and proposing to walk with him when he was going to
4649: pay an afternoon visit to Mrs. Holt, to try and soothe her concerning
4650: Felix. "What a mother he has!" she said to herself when they came away
4651: again; "but, rude and queer as he is, I cannot say there is anything
4652: vulgar about him. Yet--I don't know--if I saw him by the side of a
4653: finished gentleman." Esther wished that finished gentleman were among
4654: her acquaintances: he would certainly admire her, and make her aware of
4655: Felix's inferiority.
4656: 
4657: On this particular Sunday afternoon, when she heard the knock at the
4658: door, she was seated in the kitchen corner between the fire and the
4659: window reading "Réné." Certainly in her well-fitting light-blue
4660: dress--she almost always wore some shade of blue--with her delicate
4661: sandaled slipper stretched toward the fire, her little gold watch, which
4662: had cost her nearly a quarter's earnings, visible at her side, her
4663: slender fingers playing with a shower of brown curls, and a coronet of
4664: shining plaits, at the summit of her head, she was a remarkable
4665: Cinderella. When the rap came, she colored, and was going to shut her
4666: book and put it out of the way on the window ledge behind her; but she
4667: desisted with a little toss, laid it open on the table beside her, and
4668: walked to the outer door, which opened into the kitchen. There was
4669: rather a mischievous gleam in her face: the rap was not a small one; it
4670: came probably from a large personage with a vigorous arm.
4671: 
4672: "Good afternoon, Miss Lyon," said Felix, taking off his cloth cap: he
4673: resolutely declined the expensive ugliness of a hat, and in a poked cap
4674: and without a cravat, made a figure at which his mother cried every
4675: Sunday, and thought of with a slow shake of the head at several passages
4676: in the minister's prayer.
4677: 
4678: "Dear me, it is you, Mr. Holt! I fear you will have to wait some time
4679: before you can see my father. The sermon is not ended yet, and there
4680: will be the hymn and the prayer, and perhaps other things to detain
4681: him."
4682: 
4683: "Well, will you let me sit down in the kitchen? I don't want to be a
4684: bore."
4685: 
4686: "Oh, no," said Esther, with her pretty light laugh, "I always give you
4687: credit for not meaning it. Pray come in, if you don't mind waiting. I
4688: was sitting in the kitchen: the kettle is singing quite prettily. It is
4689: much nicer than the parlor--not half so ugly."
4690: 
4691: "There I agree with you."
4692: 
4693: "How very extraordinary! But if you prefer the kitchen, and don't want
4694: to sit with me, I can go into the parlor."
4695: 
4696: "I came on purpose to sit with you," said Felix, in his blunt way, "but
4697: I thought it likely you might be vexed at seeing me. I wanted to talk to
4698: you, but I've got nothing pleasant to say. As your father would have it,
4699: I'm not given to prophesy smooth things--to prophesy deceit."
4700: 
4701: "I understand," said Esther, sitting down. "Pray be seated. You thought
4702: I had no afternoon sermon, so you came to give me one."
4703: 
4704: "Yes," said Felix, seating himself sideways in a chair not far off her,
4705: and leaning over the back to look at her with his large, clear, gray
4706: eyes, "and my text is something you said the other day. You said you
4707: didn't mind about people having right opinions so that they had good
4708: taste. Now I want you to see what shallow stuff that is."
4709: 
4710: "Oh, I don't doubt it if you say so. I know you are a person of right
4711: opinions."
4712: 
4713: "But by opinions you mean men's thoughts about great subjects, and by
4714: taste you mean their thoughts about small ones: dress, behavior,
4715: amusements, ornaments."
4716: 
4717: "Well--yes--or rather, their sensibilities about those things."
4718: 
4719: "It comes to the same thing; thoughts, opinions, knowledge, are only a
4720: sensibility to facts and ideas. If I understand a geometrical problem,
4721: it is because I have a sensibility to the way in which lines and figures
4722: are related to each other; and I want you to see that the creature who
4723: has the sensibilities that you call taste, and not the sensibilities
4724: that you call opinions, is simply a lower, pettier sort of thing--an
4725: insect that notices the shaking of the table, but never notices the
4726: thunder."
4727: 
4728: "Very well, I am an insect; yet I notice that you are thundering at me."
4729: 
4730: "No, you are not an insect. That is what exasperates me at your making a
4731: boast of littleness. You have enough understanding to make it wicked
4732: that you should add one more to the women who hinder men's lives from
4733: having any nobleness in them."
4734: 
4735: Esther colored deeply: she resented this speech, yet she disliked it
4736: less than many Felix had addressed to her.
4737: 
4738: "What is my horrible guilt?" she said, rising and standing, as she was
4739: wont, with one foot on the fender, and looking at the fire. If it had
4740: been any one but Felix who was near her, it might have occurred to her
4741: that this attitude showed her to advantage; but she had only a mortified
4742: sense that he was quite indifferent to what others praised her for.
4743: 
4744: "Why do you read this mawkish stuff on a Sunday, for example?" he said,
4745: snatching up "Réné," and running his eye over the pages.
4746: 
4747: "Why don't you always go to chapel, Mr. Holt, and read Howe's 'Living
4748: Temple,' and join the church?"
4749: 
4750: "There's just the difference between us--I know why I don't do those
4751: things. I distinctly see that I can do something better. I have other
4752: principles, and should sink myself by doing what I don't recognize as
4753: the best."
4754: 
4755: "I understand," said Esther, as lightly as she could, to conceal her
4756: bitterness. "I am a lower kind of being, and could not so easily sink
4757: myself."
4758: 
4759: "Not by entering into your father's ideas. If a woman really believes
4760: herself to be a lower kind of being, she should place herself in
4761: subjection: she should be ruled by the thoughts of her father or
4762: husband. If not, let her show her power of choosing something better.
4763: You must know that your father's principles are greater and worthier
4764: than what guides your life. You have no reason but idle fancy and
4765: selfish inclination for shirking his teaching and giving your soul up to
4766: trifles."
4767: 
4768: "You are kind enough to say so. But I am not aware that I have ever
4769: confided my reasons to you."
4770: 
4771: "Why, what worth calling a reason could make any mortal hang over this
4772: trash?--idiotic immorality dressed up to look fine, with a little bit of
4773: doctrine tacked to it, like a hare's foot on a dish, to make believe the
4774: mess is not cat's flesh. Look here! 'Est-ce ma faute, si je trouve
4775: partout les bornes, si ce qui est fini n'a pour moi aucune valeur?' Yes,
4776: sir, distinctly your fault, because you're an ass. Your dunce who can't
4777: do his sums always has a taste for the infinite. Sir, do you know what a
4778: rhomboid is? Oh, no, I don't value these things with limits. 'Cependant,
4779: j'aime la monotonie des sentimens de la vie, et si j'avais encore la
4780: folie de croire au bonheur----'"
4781: 
4782: "Oh, pray, Mr. Holt, don't go on reading with that dreadful accent; it
4783: sets one's teeth on edge." Esther, smarting helplessly under the
4784: previous lashes, was relieved by this diversion of criticism.
4785: 
4786: "There it is!" said Felix, throwing the book on the table, and getting
4787: up to walk about. "You are only happy when you can spy a tag or a tassel
4788: loose to turn the talk, and get rid of any judgment that must carry
4789: grave action after it."
4790: 
4791: "I think I have borne a great deal of talk without turning it."
4792: 
4793: "Not enough, Miss Lyon--not all that I came to say. I want you to
4794: change. Of course I am a brute to say so. I ought to say you are
4795: perfect. Another man would, perhaps. But I say I want you to change."
4796: 
4797: "How am I to oblige you? By joining the Church?"
4798: 
4799: "No; but by asking yourself whether life is not as solemn a thing as
4800: your father takes it to be--in which you may be either a blessing or a
4801: curse to many. You know you have never done that. You don't care to be
4802: better than a bird trimming its feathers, and pecking about after what
4803: pleases it. You are discontented with the world because you can't get
4804: just the small things that suit your pleasure, not because it's a world
4805: where myriads of men and women are ground by wrong and misery, and
4806: tainted with pollution."
4807: 
4808: Esther felt her heart swelling with mingled indignation at this liberty,
4809: wounded pride at this depreciation, and acute consciousness that she
4810: could not contradict what Felix said. He was outrageously ill-bred; but
4811: she felt that she should be lowering herself by telling him so, and
4812: manifesting her anger; in that way she would be confirming his
4813: accusation of a littleness that shrank from severe truth; and, besides,
4814: through all her mortification there pierced a sense that this
4815: exasperation of Felix against her was more complimentary than anything
4816: in his previous behavior. She had self-command enough to speak with her
4817: usual silvery voice.
4818: 
4819: "Pray go on, Mr. Holt. Relieve yourself of these burning truths. I am
4820: sure they must be troublesome to carry unuttered."
4821: 
4822: "Yes, they are," said Felix, pausing, and standing not far off her. "I
4823: can't bear to see you going the way of the foolish women who spoil men's
4824: lives. Men can't help loving them, and so they make themselves slaves to
4825: the petty desires of petty creatures. That's the way those who might do
4826: better spend their lives for nought--get checked in every great
4827: effort--toil with brain and limb for things that have no more to do with
4828: a manly life than tarts and confectionery. That's what makes women a
4829: curse; and life is stunted to suit their littleness. That's why I'll
4830: never love, if I can help it; and if I love, I'll bear it, and never
4831: marry."
4832: 
4833: The tumult of feeling in Esther's mind--mortification, anger, the sense
4834: of a terrible power over her that Felix seemed to have as his angry
4835: words vibrated through her--was getting almost too much for her
4836: self-control. She felt her lips quivering; but her pride, which feared
4837: nothing so much as the betrayal of her emotion, helped her to a
4838: desperate effort. She pinched her own hand hard to overcome her tremor,
4839: and said, in a tone of scorn--
4840: 
4841: "I ought to be very much obliged to you for giving me your confidence so
4842: freely."
4843: 
4844: "Ah! now you are offended with me, and disgusted with me. I expected it
4845: would be so. A woman doesn't like a man who tells her the truth."
4846: 
4847: "I think you boast a little too much of your truth-telling, Mr. Holt,"
4848: said Esther, flashing out at last. "That virtue is apt to be easy to
4849: people when they only wound others and not themselves. Telling the truth
4850: often means no more than taking a liberty."
4851: 
4852: "Yes, I suppose I should have been taking a liberty if I had tried to
4853: drag you back by the skirt when I saw you running into a pit."
4854: 
4855: "You should really found a sect. Preaching is your vocation. It is a
4856: pity you should ever have an audience of only one."
4857: 
4858: "I see I have made a fool of myself. I thought you had a more generous
4859: mind--that you might be kindled to a better ambition. But I've set your
4860: vanity aflame--nothing else. I'm going. Good-bye."
4861: 
4862: "Good-bye," said Esther, not looking at him. He did not open the door
4863: immediately. He seemed to be adjusting his cap and pulling it down.
4864: Esther longed to be able to throw a lasso round him and compel him to
4865: stay, that she might say what she chose to him; her very anger made this
4866: departure irritating, especially as he had the last word, and that a
4867: very bitter one. But soon the latch was lifted and the door closed
4868: behind him. She ran up to her bedroom and burst into tears. Poor maiden!
4869: There was a strange contradiction of impulses in her mind in those first
4870: moments. She could not bear that Felix should not respect her, yet she
4871: could not bear that he should see her bend before his denunciation. She
4872: revolted against his assumption of superiority, yet she felt herself in
4873: a new kind of subjection to him. He was ill-bred, he was rude, he had
4874: taken an unwarrantable liberty; yet his indignant words were a tribute
4875: to her: he thought she was worth more pains than the women of whom he
4876: took no notice. It was excessively impertinent in him to tell her of his
4877: resolving not to love--not to marry--as if she cared about that; as if
4878: he thought himself likely to inspire an affection that would incline any
4879: woman to marry him after such eccentric steps as he had taken. Had he
4880: ever for a moment imagined that she had thought of him in the light of a
4881: man who would make love to her?----But did he love her one little bit,
4882: and was that the reason why he wanted her to change? Esther felt less
4883: angry at that form of freedom; though she was quite sure that she did
4884: not love him, and that she could never love any one who was so much of a
4885: pedagogue and master, to say nothing of his oddities. But he wanted her
4886: to change. For the first time in her life Esther felt herself seriously
4887: shaken in her self-contentment. She knew there was a mind to which she
4888: appeared trivial, narrow, selfish. Every word Felix had said to her
4889: seemed to have burned itself into her memory. She felt as if she should
4890: forevermore be haunted by self-criticism, and never do anything to
4891: satisfy those fancies on which she had simply piqued herself before
4892: without being dogged by inward questions. Her father's desire for her
4893: conversion had never moved her; she saw that he adored her all the
4894: while, and he never checked her unregenerate acts as if they degraded
4895: her on earth, but only mourned over them as unfitting her for heaven.
4896: Unfitness for heaven (spoken of as "Jerusalem" and "glory"), the prayers
4897: of a good little father, whose thoughts and motives seemed to her like
4898: the "Life of Dr. Doddridge," which she was content to leave unread, did
4899: not attack her self-respect and self-satisfaction. But now she had been
4900: stung--stung even into a new consciousness concerning her father. Was it
4901: true that his life was so much worthier than her own? She could not
4902: change for anything Felix said, but she told herself he was mistaken if
4903: he supposed her incapable of generous thoughts.
4904: 
4905: She heard her father coming into the house. She dried her tears, tried
4906: to recover herself hurriedly, and went down to him.
4907: 
4908: "You want your tea, father; how your forehead burns!" she said gently,
4909: kissing his brow, and then putting her cool hand on it.
4910: 
4911: Mr. Lyon felt a little surprise; such spontaneous tenderness was not
4912: quite common with her; it reminded him of her mother.
4913: 
4914: "My sweet child," he said gratefully, thinking with wonder of the
4915: treasures still left in our fallen nature.
4916: 
4917: 
4918: 
4919: 
4920: CHAPTER XI.
4921: 
4922:     Truth is the precious harvest of the earth.
4923:     But once, when harvest waved upon a land,
4924:     The noisome cankerworm and caterpillar,
4925:     Locusts, and all the swarming foul-born broods,
4926:     Fastened upon it with swift, greedy jaws,
4927:     And turned the harvest into pestilence,
4928:     Until men said, What profits it to sow?
4929: 
4930: 
4931: Felix was going to Sproxton that Sunday afternoon. He always enjoyed his
4932: walk to that outlying hamlet; it took him (by a short cut) through a
4933: corner of Sir Maximus Debarry's park; then across a piece of common,
4934: broken here and there into red ridges below dark masses of furze; and
4935: for the rest of the way alongside of the canal, where the Sunday
4936: peacefulness that seemed to rest on the bordering meadows and pastures
4937: was hardly broken if a horse pulled into sight along the towing-path,
4938: and a boat, with a little curl of blue smoke issuing from its tin
4939: chimney, came slowly gliding behind. Felix retained something of his
4940: boyish impression that the days in a canal-boat were all like Sundays;
4941: but the horse, if it had been put to him, would probably have preferred
4942: a more Judaic or Scotch rigor with regard to canal-boats, or at least
4943: that the Sunday towing should be done by asses, as a lower order.
4944: 
4945: This canal was only a branch of the grand trunk, and ended among the
4946: coal-pits, where Felix, crossing a network of black tram-roads, soon
4947: came to his destination--that public institute of Sproxton, known to its
4948: frequenters chiefly as Chubb's, but less familiarly as the Sugar Loaf,
4949: or the New Pits; this last being the name for the more modern and lively
4950: nucleus of the Sproxton hamlet. The other nucleus, known as the Old
4951: Pits, also supported its "public," but it had something of the forlorn
4952: air of an abandoned capital; and the company at the Blue Cow was of an
4953: inferior kind--equal, of course, in the fundamental attributes of
4954: humanity, such as desire for beer, but not equal in ability to pay for
4955: it.
4956: 
4957: When Felix arrived, the great Chubb was standing at the door. Mr. Chubb
4958: was a remarkable publican; none of your stock Bonifaces, red, bloated,
4959: jolly, and joking. He was thin and sallow, and was never, as his
4960: constant guests observed, seen to be the worse (or the better) for
4961: liquor; indeed, as among soldiers an eminent general was held to have a
4962: charmed life, Chubb was held by the members of the Benefit Club to have
4963: a charmed sobriety, a vigilance over his own interest that resisted all
4964: narcotics. His very dreams, as stated by himself, had a method in them
4965: beyond the waking thoughts of other men. Pharaoh's dream, he observed,
4966: was nothing to them; and, as lying so much out of ordinary experience,
4967: they were held particularly suitable for narration on Sunday evenings,
4968: when the listening colliers, well washed and in their best coats, shook
4969: their heads with a sense of peculiar edification which belongs to the
4970: inexplicable. Mr. Chubb's reasons for becoming landlord of the Sugar
4971: Loaf, were founded on the severest calculation. Having an active mind,
4972: and being averse to bodily labor, he had thoroughly considered what
4973: calling would yield him the best livelihood with the least possible
4974: exertion, and in that sort of line he had seen that a "public" amongst
4975: miners who earned high wages was a fine opening. He had prospered
4976: according to the merits of such judicious calculation, was already a
4977: forty-shilling freeholder, and was conscious of a vote for the county.
4978: He was not one of those mean-spirited men who found the franchise
4979: embarrassing, and would rather have been without it: he regarded his
4980: vote as part of his investment, and meant to make the best of it. He
4981: called himself a straight-forward man, and at suitable moments expressed
4982: his views freely; in fact, he was known to have one fundamental division
4983: for all opinion--"my idee" and "humbug."
4984: 
4985: When Felix approached, Mr. Chubb was standing, as usual, with his hands
4986: nervously busy in his pockets, his eyes glancing around with a detective
4987: expression at the black landscape, and his lipless mouth compressed, yet
4988: in constant movement. On a superficial view it might be supposed that so
4989: eager-seeming a personality was unsuited to the publican's business; but
4990: in fact, it was a great provocative to drinking. Like the shrill biting
4991: talk of a vixenish wife, it would have compelled you to "take a little
4992: something" by way of dulling your sensibility.
4993: 
4994: Hitherto, notwithstanding Felix drank so little ale, the publican
4995: treated him with high civility. The coming election was a great
4996: opportunity for applying his political "idee," which was, that society
4997: existed for the sake of the individual, and that the name of that
4998: individual was Chubb. Now, for a conjunction of absurd circumstances
4999: inconsistent with that idea, it happened that Sproxton hereto had been
5000: somewhat neglected in the canvass. The head member of the company that
5001: worked the mines was Mr. Peter Garstin, and the same company received
5002: the rent from the Sugar Loaf. Hence, as the person who had the most
5003: power of annoying Mr. Chubb, and being of detriment to him, Mr. Garstin
5004: was naturally the candidate for whom he had reserved his vote. But where
5005: there is this intention of ultimately gratifying a gentleman by voting
5006: for him in an open British manner on the day of the poll, a man, whether
5007: Publican or Pharisee (Mr. Chubb used this generic classification of
5008: mankind as one that was sanctioned by Scripture), is all the freer in
5009: his relation with those deluded persons who take him for what he is not,
5010: and imagine him to be a waverer. But for some time opportunity had
5011: seemed barren. There were but three dubious votes besides Mr. Chubb's
5012: in the small district of which the Sugar Loaf could be regarded as the
5013: centre of intelligence and inspiration: the colliers, of course, had no
5014: votes, and did not need political conversion; consequently, the
5015: interests of Sproxton had only been tacitly cherished in the breasts of
5016: candidates. But ever since it had been known that a Radical candidate
5017: was in the field, that in consequence of this Mr. Debarry had coalesced
5018: with Mr. Garstin, and that Sir James Clement, the poor baronet, had
5019: retired, Mr. Chubb had been occupied with the most ingenious mental
5020: combinations in order to ascertain what possibilities of profit to the
5021: Sugar Loaf might lie in this altered state of the canvass.
5022: 
5023: He had a cousin in another county, also a publican, but in a larger way,
5024: and resident in a borough, and from him Mr. Chubb had gathered more
5025: detailed political information than he could find in the Loamshire
5026: newspapers. He was now enlightened enough to know that there was a way
5027: of using voteless miners and navvies at nominations and elections. He
5028: approved of that; it entered into his political "idee"; and indeed he
5029: would have been for extending the franchise to this class--at least in
5030: Sproxton. If any one had observed that you must draw a line somewhere,
5031: Mr. Chubb would have concurred at once, and would have given permission
5032: to draw it at a radius of two miles from his own tap.
5033: 
5034: From the first Sunday evening when Felix had appeared at the Sugar Loaf,
5035: Mr. Chubb had made up his mind that this 'cute man who kept himself
5036: sober was an electioneering agent. That he was hired for some purpose or
5037: other there was not a doubt; a man didn't come and drink nothing without
5038: a good reason. In proportion as Felix's purpose was not obvious to
5039: Chubb's mind, it must be deep; and this growing conviction had even led
5040: the publican on the last Sunday evening privately to urge his mysterious
5041: visitor to let a little ale be chalked up for him--it was of no
5042: consequence. Felix knew his man, and had taken care not to betray too
5043: soon that his real object was so to win the ear of the best fellows
5044: about him as to induce them to meet him on a Saturday evening in the
5045: room where Mr. Lyon, or one of his deacons, habitually held his
5046: Wednesday preachings. Only women and children, three old men, a
5047: journeyman tailor, and a consumptive youth, attended those preachings;
5048: not a collier had been won from the strong ale of the Sugar Loaf, not
5049: even a navvy from the muddier drink of the Blue Cow. Felix was sanguine;
5050: he saw some pleasant faces among the miners when they were washed on
5051: Sundays; they might be taught to spend their wages better. At all
5052: events, he was going to try: he had great confidence in his powers of
5053: appeal, and it was quite true that he never spoke without arresting
5054: attention. There was nothing better than a dame school in the hamlet; he
5055: thought that if he could move the fathers, whose blackened week-day
5056: persons and flannel caps, ornamented with tallow candles by way of
5057: plume, were a badge of hard labor, for which he had a more sympathetic
5058: fibre than for any ribbon in the buttonhole--if he could move these men
5059: to save something from their drink and pay a school-master for their
5060: boys, a greater service would be done them than if Mr. Garstin and his
5061: company were persuaded to establish a school.
5062: 
5063: "I'll lay hold of them by their fatherhood," said Felix; "I'll take one
5064: of their little fellows and set him in the midst. Till they can show
5065: there's something they love better than swilling themselves with ale,
5066: extension of the suffrage can never mean anything for them but extension
5067: of boozing. One must begin somewhere: I'll begin at what is under my
5068: nose. I'll begin at Sproxton. That's what a man would do if he had a
5069: red-hot superstition. Can't one work for sober truth as hard as for
5070: megrims?"
5071: 
5072: Felix Holt had his illusions, like other young men, though they were not
5073: of a fashionable sort; referring neither to the impression his costume
5074: and horsemanship might make on beholders, nor to the ease with which he
5075: would pay the Jews when he gave a loose to his talents and applied
5076: himself to work. He had fixed his choice on a certain Mike Brindle (not
5077: that Brindle was his real name--each collier had his _sobriquet_) as the
5078: man whom he would induce to walk part of the way home with him this very
5079: evening, and get to invite some of his comrades for the next Saturday.
5080: Brindle was one of the head miners: he had a bright good-natured face,
5081: and had given especial attention to certain performances with a magnet
5082: which Felix carried in his pocket.
5083: 
5084: Mr. Chubb, who had also his illusions, smiled graciously as the
5085: enigmatic customer came up to the door-step.
5086: 
5087: "Well, sir, Sunday seems to be your day: I begin to look for you on a
5088: Sunday now."
5089: 
5090: "Yes, I'm a workingman; Sunday is my holiday," said Felix, pausing at
5091: the door since the host seemed to expect this.
5092: 
5093: "Ah, sir, there's many ways of working. I look at it you're one of those
5094: as work with your brains. That's what I do myself."
5095: 
5096: "One may do a good deal of that and work with one's hands too."
5097: 
5098: "Ah, sir," said Mr. Chubb, with a certain bitterness in his smile, "I've
5099: that sort of head that I've often wished I was stupider. I use things
5100: up, sir; I see into things a deal too quick. I eat my dinner, as you may
5101: say, at breakfast-time. That's why I hardly ever smoke a pipe. No sooner
5102: do I stick a pipe in my mouth than I puff and puff till it's gone before
5103: other folks' are well lit; and then, where am I? I might as well have
5104: let it alone. In this world it's better not to be too quick. But you
5105: know what it is, sir."
5106: 
5107: "Not I," said Felix, rubbing the back of his head, with a grimace. "I
5108: generally feel myself rather a blockhead. The world's a largish place,
5109: and I haven't turned everything inside out yet."
5110: 
5111: "Ah, that's your deepness. I think we understand one another. And about
5112: this here election, I lay two to one we should agree if we was to come
5113: to talk about it."
5114: 
5115: "Ah!" said Felix, with an air of caution.
5116: 
5117: "You're none of a Tory, eh, sir? You won't go to vote for Debarry? That
5118: was what I said at the very first go-off. Says I, he's no Tory. I think
5119: I was right, sir--eh?"
5120: 
5121: "Certainly; I'm no Tory."
5122: 
5123: "No, no, you don't catch me wrong in a hurry. Well, between you and me,
5124: I care no more for the Debarrys than I care for Johnny Groats. I live on
5125: none o' their land, and not a pot's-worth did they ever send to the
5126: Sugar Loaf. I'm not frightened at the Debarrys: there's no man more
5127: independent than me. I'll plump or I'll split for them as treat me the
5128: handsomest and are the most of what I call gentlemen; that's my idee.
5129: And in the way of hatching for any man, them are fools that don't employ
5130: me."
5131: 
5132: We mortals sometimes cut a pitiable figure in our attempts at display.
5133: We may be sure of our own merits, yet fatally ignorant of the point of
5134: view from which we are regarded by our neighbor. Our fine patterns in
5135: tattooing may be far from throwing him into a swoon of admiration,
5136: though we turn ourselves all round to show them. Thus it was with Mr.
5137: Chubb.
5138: 
5139: "Yes," said Felix, dryly; "I should think there are some sorts of work
5140: for which you are just fitted."
5141: 
5142: "Ah, you see that? Well, we understand one another. You're no Tory; no
5143: more am I. And if I'd got four hands to show at a nomination, the
5144: Debarrys shouldn't have one of 'em. My idee is, there's a deal too much
5145: of their scutchins and their moniments in Treby Church. What's their
5146: scutchins mean? They're a sign with little liquor behind 'em; that's how
5147: I take it. There's nobody can give account of 'em as I ever heard."
5148: 
5149: Mr. Chubb was hindered from further explaining his views as to the
5150: historical element in society by the arrival of new guests, who
5151: approached in two groups. The foremost group consisted of well-known
5152: colliers, in their good Sunday beavers and colored handkerchiefs serving
5153: as cravats, with the long ends floating. The second group was a more
5154: unusual one, and caused Mr. Chubb to compress his mouth and agitate the
5155: muscles about it in rather an excited manner.
5156: 
5157: First came a smartly-dressed personage on horseback, with a conspicuous
5158: expansive shirt-front and figured satin stock. He was a stout man, and
5159: gave a strong sense of broadcloth. A wild idea shot through Mr. Chubb's
5160: brain; could this grand visitor be Harold Transome? Excuse him: he had
5161: been given to understand by his cousin from the distant borough that a
5162: Radical candidate in the condescension of canvassing had even gone the
5163: length of eating bread-and-treacle with the children of an honest
5164: freeman, and declaring his preference for that simple fare. Mr. Chubb's
5165: notion of a Radical was that he was a new and agreeable kind of
5166: lick-spittle who fawned on the poor instead of on the rich, and so was
5167: likely to send customers to a "public"; so that he argued well enough
5168: from the premises at his command.
5169: 
5170: The mounted man of broadcloth had followers: several shabby-looking men,
5171: and Sproxton boys of all sizes, whose curiosity had been stimulated by
5172: unexpected largesse. A stranger on horseback scattering half-pence on a
5173: Sunday was so unprecedented that there was no knowing what he might do
5174: next; and the smallest hindmost fellows in sealskin caps were not
5175: without hope that an entirely new order of things had set in.
5176: 
5177: Everyone waited outside for the stranger to dismount, and Mr. Chubb
5178: advanced to take the bridle.
5179: 
5180: "Well, Mr. Chubb," were the first words when the great man was safely
5181: out of the saddle, "I've often heard of your fine tap, and I'm come to
5182: taste it."
5183: 
5184: "Walk in, sir--pray walk in," said Mr. Chubb, giving the horse to the
5185: stable-boy. "I shall be proud to draw for you. If anybody's been
5186: praising me, I think my ale will back him."
5187: 
5188: All entered in the rear of the stranger except the boys, who peeped in
5189: at the window.
5190: 
5191: "Won't you please to walk into the parlor, sir," said Mr. Chubb,
5192: obsequiously.
5193: 
5194: "No, no, I'll sit down here. This is what I like to see," said the
5195: stranger, looking round at the colliers, who eyed him rather shyly--"a
5196: bright hearth where workingmen can enjoy themselves. However, I'll step
5197: into the other room for three minutes, just to speak half a dozen words
5198: with you."
5199: 
5200: Mr. Chubb threw open the parlor door, and then stepping back, took the
5201: opportunity of saying, in a low tone, to Felix, "Do you know this
5202: gentleman?"
5203: 
5204: "Not I; no."
5205: 
5206: Mr. Chubb's opinion of Felix Holt sank from that moment. The parlor door
5207: was closed, but no one sat down or ordered beer.
5208: 
5209: "I say, master," said Mike Brindle, going up to Felix, "don't you think
5210: that's one o' the 'lection men?"
5211: 
5212: "Very likely."
5213: 
5214: "I heared a chap say they're up and down everywhere," said Brindle; "and
5215: now's the time, they say, when a man can get beer for nothing."
5216: 
5217: "Ay, that's sin' the Reform," said a big, red-whiskered man, called
5218: Dredge. "That's brought the 'lections and the drink into these parts;
5219: for afore that, it was all kep' up the Lord knows wheer."
5220: 
5221: "Well, but the Reform's niver come anigh Sprox'on," said a gray-haired
5222: but stalwart man called Old Sleck. "I don't believe nothing about'n, I
5223: don't."
5224: 
5225: "Don't you?" said Brindle, with some contempt. "Well, I do. There's
5226: folks won't believe beyond the end o' their own pickaxes. You can't
5227: drive nothing into 'em, not if you split their skulls. I know for
5228: certain sure, from a chap in the cartin' way, as he's got money and
5229: drink too, only for hollering. Eh, master, what do _you_ say?" Brindle
5230: ended, turning with some deference to Felix.
5231: 
5232: "Should you like to know all about the Reform?" said Felix, using his
5233: opportunity. "If you would, I can tell you."
5234: 
5235: "Ay, ay--tell's; you know I'll be bound," said several voices at once.
5236: 
5237: "Ah, but it will take some little time. And we must be quiet. The
5238: cleverest of you--those who are looked up to in the Club--must come and
5239: meet me at Peggy Button's cottage next Saturday, at seven o'clock, after
5240: dark. And, Brindle, you must bring that little yellow-haired lad of
5241: yours. And anybody that's got a little boy--a very little fellow, who
5242: won't understand what is said--may bring him. But you must keep it
5243: close, you know. We don't want fools there. But everybody who hears me
5244: may come. I shall be at Peggy Button's."
5245: 
5246: "Why, that's where the Wednesday preachin' is," said Dredge. "I've been
5247: aforced to give my wife a black eye to hinder her from going to the
5248: preachin'. Lors-a-massy, she thinks she knows better nor me, and I can't
5249: make head nor tail of her talk."
5250: 
5251: "Why can't you let the woman alone?" said Brindle, with some disgust.
5252: "I'd be ashamed to beat a poor crawling thing 'cause she likes
5253: preaching."
5254: 
5255: "No more I did beat her afore, not if she scrat' me," said Dredge, in
5256: vindication; "but if she jabbers at me, I can't abide it. Howsomever,
5257: I'll bring my Jack to Peggy's o' Saturday. His mother shall wash him. He
5258: is but four year old, and he'll swear and square at me a good un, if I
5259: set him on."
5260: 
5261: "There you go blatherin'," said Brindle, intending a mild rebuke.
5262: 
5263: This dialogue, which was in danger of becoming too personal, was
5264: interrupted by the reopening of the parlor door, and the reappearance of
5265: the impressive stranger with Mr. Chubb, whose countenance seemed
5266: unusually radiant.
5267: 
5268: "Sit you down here, Mr. Johnson," said Chubb, moving an arm-chair. "This
5269: gentleman is kind enough to treat the company," he added, looking round,
5270: "and what's more, he'll take a cup with 'em; and I think there's no man
5271: but what'll say that's a honor."
5272: 
5273: The company had nothing equivalent to a "hear, hear," at command, but
5274: they perhaps felt the more, as they seated themselves with an
5275: expectation unvented by utterance. There was a general satisfactory
5276: sense that the hitherto shadowy Reform had at length come to Sproxton in
5277: a good round shape, with broadcloth and pockets. Felix did not intend to
5278: accept the treating, but he chose to stay and hear, taking his pint as
5279: usual.
5280: 
5281: "Capital ale, capital ale," said Mr. Johnson, as he set down his glass,
5282: speaking in a quick, smooth treble. "Now," he went on, with a certain
5283: pathos in his voice, looking at Mr. Chubb, who sat opposite, "there's
5284: some satisfaction to me in finding an establishment like this at the
5285: Pits. For what would higher wages do for the workingman if he couldn't
5286: get a good article for his money? Why, gentlemen"--here he looked
5287: round--"I've been into ale-houses where I've seen a fine fellow of a
5288: miner or a stone-cutter come in and have to lay down money for beer that
5289: I should be sorry to give to my pigs!" Here Mr. Johnson leaned forward
5290: with squared elbows, hands placed on his knees, and a defiant shake of
5291: the head.
5292: 
5293: "Aw, like at the Blue Cow," fell in the irrepressible Dredge, in a deep
5294: bass; but he was rebuked by a severe nudge from Brindle.
5295: 
5296: "Yes, yes, you know what it is, my friend," said Mr. Johnson, looking at
5297: Dredge, and restoring his self-satisfaction. "But it won't last much
5298: longer, that's one good thing. Bad liquor will be swept away with other
5299: bad articles. Trade will prosper--and what's trade now without steam?
5300: and what is steam without coal? And mark you this, gentlemen--there's no
5301: man and no government can make coal."
5302: 
5303: A loud "Haw, haw," showed that this fact was appreciated.
5304: 
5305: "Nor freeston', nayther," said a wide-mouthed wiry man called Gills, who
5306: wished for an exhaustive treatment of the subject, being a stone-cutter.
5307: 
5308: "Nor freestone, as you say; else, I think, if coal could be made
5309: above-ground, honest fellows who are the pith of our population would
5310: not have to bend their backs and sweat in a pit six days out of the
5311: seven. No, no; I say, as this country prospers it has more and more need
5312: of you, sirs. It can do without a pack of lazy lords and ladies, but it
5313: can never do without brave colliers. And the country _will_ prosper. I
5314: pledge you my word, sirs, this country will rise to the tiptop of
5315: everything, and there isn't a man in it but what shall have his joint in
5316: the pot, and his spare money jingling in his pocket, if we only exert
5317: ourselves to send the right men to Parliament--men who will speak up for
5318: the collier, and the stone-cutter, and the navvy" (Mr. Johnson waved his
5319: hand liberally), "and will stand no nonsense. This is a crisis, and we
5320: must exert ourselves. We've got Reform, gentlemen, but now the thing is
5321: to make Reform work. It's a crisis--I pledge you my word it's a crisis."
5322: 
5323: Mr. Johnson threw himself back as if from the concussion of that great
5324: noun. He did not suppose that one of his audience knew what a crisis
5325: meant; but he had large experience in the effect of uncomprehended
5326: words; and in this case the colliers were thrown into a state of
5327: conviction concerning they did not know what, which was a fine
5328: preparation for "hitting out," or any other act carrying a due sequence
5329: to such a conviction.
5330: 
5331: Felix felt himself in danger of getting into a rage. There is hardly any
5332: mental misery worse than that of having our own serious phrases, our own
5333: rooted beliefs, caricatured by a charlatan or a hireling. He began to
5334: feel the sharp lower edge of his tin pint-measure, and to think it a
5335: tempting missile.
5336: 
5337: Mr. Johnson certainly had some qualifications as an orator. After this
5338: impressive pause he leaned forward again, and said, in a lowered tone,
5339: looking round--
5340: 
5341: "I think you all know the good news."
5342: 
5343: There was a movement of shoe-soles on the quarried floor, and a scrape
5344: of some chair legs, but no other answer.
5345: 
5346: "The good news I mean is, that a first-rate man, Mr. Transome, of
5347: Transome Court, has offered himself to represent you in Parliament,
5348: sirs. I say you in particular, for what he has at heart is the welfare
5349: of the workingman--of the brave fellows that wield the pickaxe, and the
5350: saw, and the hammer. He's rich--has more money than Garstin--but he
5351: doesn't want to keep it to himself. What he wants is, to make a good use
5352: of it, gentlemen. He's come back from foreign parts with his pockets
5353: full of gold. He could buy up the Debarrys, if they were worth buying,
5354: but he's got something better to do with his money. He means to use it
5355: for the good of the workingmen in these parts. I know there are some men
5356: who put up for Parliament and talk a little too big. They may say they
5357: want to befriend the colliers, for example. But I should like to put a
5358: question to them. I should like to ask them, 'What colliers?' There are
5359: colliers up at Newcastle, and there are colliers down in Wales. Will it
5360: do any good to honest Tom, who is hungry in Sproxton, to hear that Jack
5361: at Newcastle has his belly full of beef and pudding?"
5362: 
5363: "It ought to do him good," Felix burst in, with his loud, abrupt voice,
5364: in odd contrast with glib Mr. Johnson's. "If he knows it's a bad thing
5365: to be hungry and not have enough to eat, he ought to be glad that
5366: another fellow, who is not idle, is not suffering in the same way."
5367: 
5368: Every one was startled. The audience was much impressed with the
5369: grandeur, the knowledge, and the power of Mr. Johnson. His brilliant
5370: promises confirmed the impression that Reform had at length reached the
5371: New Pits; and Reform, if it were good for anything, must at last resolve
5372: itself into spare money--meaning "sport" and drink, and keeping away
5373: from work for several days in the week. These "brave" men of Sproxton
5374: liked Felix as one of themselves, only much more knowing--as a
5375: workingman who had seen many distant parts, but who must be very poor,
5376: since he never drank more than a pint or so. They were quite inclined to
5377: hear what he had got to say on another occasion, but they were rather
5378: irritated by his interruption at the present moment. Mr. Johnson was
5379: annoyed, but he spoke with the same glib quietness as before, though
5380: with an expression of contempt.
5381: 
5382: "I call it a poor-spirited thing to take up a man's straight-forward
5383: words and twist them. What I meant to say was plain enough--that no man
5384: can be saved from starving by looking on while others eat. I think
5385: that's common-sense, eh, sirs?"
5386: 
5387: There was again an approving "Haw, haw." To hear anything said, and
5388: understand it, was a stimulus that had the effect of wit. Mr. Chubb cast
5389: a suspicious and viperous glance at Felix, who felt that he had been a
5390: simpleton for his pains.
5391: 
5392: "Well, then," continued Mr. Johnson, "I suppose I may go on. But if
5393: there is any one here better able to inform the company than I am, I
5394: give way--I give way."
5395: 
5396: "Sir," said Mr. Chubb, magisterially, "no man shall take the words out
5397: of _your_ mouth in this house. And," he added, looking pointedly at
5398: Felix, "company that's got no more orders to give, and wants to turn up
5399: rusty to them that has, had better be making room than filling it. Love
5400: an' 'armony's the word on our Club's flag, an' love an' 'armony's the
5401: meaning of 'The Sugar Loaf, William Chubb.' Folks of a different mind
5402: had better seek another house of call."
5403: 
5404: "Very good," said Felix, laying down his money and taking his cap. "I'm
5405: going." He saw clearly enough that if he said more, there would be a
5406: disturbance which could have no desirable end.
5407: 
5408: When the door had closed behind him, Mr. Johnson said, "What is that
5409: person's name?"
5410: 
5411: "Does anybody know it?" said Mr. Chubb.
5412: 
5413: A few noes were heard.
5414: 
5415: "I've heard him speak like a downright Reformer, else I should have
5416: looked a little sharper after him. But you may see he's nothing
5417: partic'lar."
5418: 
5419: "It looks rather bad that no one knows his name," said Mr. Johnson.
5420: "He's most likely a Tory in disguise--a Tory spy. You must be careful,
5421: sirs, of men who come to you and say they're Radicals, and yet do
5422: nothing for you. They'll stuff you with words--no lack of words--but
5423: words are wind. Now, a man like Transome comes forward and says to the
5424: workingmen of this country: 'Here I am, ready to serve you and speak for
5425: you in Parliament, and to get the laws made all right for you; and in
5426: the meanwhile, if there's any of you who are my neighbors who want a
5427: day's holiday, or a cup to drink with friends, or a copy of the King's
5428: likeness--why, I'm your man. I'm not a paper handbill--all words and no
5429: substance--nor a man with land and nothing else; I've got bags of gold
5430: as well as land.' I think you know what I mean by the King's likeness."
5431: 
5432: Here Mr. Johnson took a half-crown out of his pocket and held the head
5433: toward the company.
5434: 
5435: "Well, sirs, there are some men who like to keep this pretty picture a
5436: great deal too much to themselves. I don't know whether I'm right, but I
5437: think I've heard of such a one not a hundred miles from here. I think
5438: his name was Spratt, and he managed some company's coal-pits."
5439: 
5440: "Haw, haw! Spratt--Spratt's his name," was rolled forth to an
5441: accompaniment of scraping shoe-soles.
5442: 
5443: "A screwing fellow, by what I understand--a domineering fellow--who
5444: would expect men to do as he liked without paying them for it. I think
5445: there's not an honest man wouldn't like to disappoint such an upstart."
5446: 
5447: There was a murmur which was interpreted by Mr. Chubb. "I'll answer for
5448: 'em, sir."
5449: 
5450: "Now, listen to me. Here's Garstin: he's one of the company you work
5451: under. What's Garstin to you? who sees him? and when they do see him
5452: they see a thin miserly fellow who keeps his pockets buttoned. He calls
5453: himself a Whig, yet he'll split votes with a Tory--he'll drive with the
5454: Debarrys. Now, gentlemen, if I said I'd got a vote, and anybody asked me
5455: what I should do with it, I should say, 'I'll plump for Transome.'
5456: You've got no votes, and that's a shame. But you _will_ have some day,
5457: if such men as Transome are returned; and then you'll be on a level with
5458: the first gentleman in the land, and if he wants to sit in Parliament,
5459: he must take off his hat and ask your leave. But though you haven't got
5460: a vote you can give a cheer for the right man, and Transome's not a man
5461: like Garstin; if you lost a day's wages by giving a cheer for Transome,
5462: he'll make you amends. That's the way a man who has no vote can serve
5463: himself and his country; he can lift up his hand and shout 'Transome
5464: forever!'--'hurray for Transome!' Let the workingmen--let the colliers
5465: and navvies and stone-cutters, who between you and me have a good deal
5466: too much the worst of it, as things are now--let them join together and
5467: give their hands and voices for the right man, and they'll make the
5468: great people shake in their shoes a little; and when you shout for
5469: Transome, remember you shout for more wages, and more of your rights,
5470: and you shout to get rid of rats and _sprats_ and such small animals,
5471: who are the tools the rich make use of to squeeze the blood out of the
5472: poor man."
5473: 
5474: "I wish there'd be a row--I'd pommel him," said Dredge, who was
5475: generally felt to be speaking to the question.
5476: 
5477: "No, no, my friend--there you're a little wrong. No pommelling--no
5478: striking first. There you have the law and the constable against you. A
5479: little rolling in the dust and knocking hats off, a little pelting with
5480: soft things that'll stick and not bruise--all that doesn't spoil the
5481: fun. If a man is to speak when you don't like to hear him, it is but
5482: fair you should give him something he doesn't like in return. And the
5483: same if he's got a vote and doesn't use it for the good of the country;
5484: I see no harm in splitting his coat in a quiet way. A man must be taught
5485: what's right if he doesn't know it. But no kicks, no knocking down, no
5486: pommelling."
5487: 
5488: "It 'ud be good fun, though, if so-_be_," said Old Sleck, allowing
5489: himself an imaginative pleasure.
5490: 
5491: "Well, well, if a Spratt wants you to say Garstin, it's some pleasure to
5492: think you can say Transome. Now, my notion is this. You are men who can
5493: put two and two together--I don't know a more solid lot of fellows than
5494: you are; and what I say is, let the honest men in this country who've
5495: got no vote show themselves in a body when they have got the chance.
5496: Why, sirs, for every Tory sneak that's got a vote, there's fifty-five
5497: fellows who must stand by and be expected to hold their tongues. But I
5498: say let 'em hiss the sneaks, let 'em groan at the sneaks, and the sneaks
5499: will be ashamed of themselves. The men who've got votes don't know how
5500: to use them. There's many a fool with a vote, who is not sure in his
5501: mind whether he shall poll, say for Debarry, or Garstin, or
5502: Transome--whether he'll plump or whether he'll split; a straw will turn
5503: him. Let him know your mind if he doesn't know his own. What's the
5504: reason Debarry gets returned? Because people are frightened at the
5505: Debarrys. What's that to you? You don't care for the Debarrys. If people
5506: are frightened at the Tories, we'll turn round and frighten _them_. You
5507: know what a Tory is--one who wants to drive the workingman as he'd drive
5508: cattle. That's what a Tory is; and a Whig is no better, if he's like
5509: Garstin. A Whig wants to knock the Tory down and get the whip, that's
5510: all. But Transome's neither Whig nor Tory; he's the workingman's friend,
5511: the collier's friend, the friend of the honest navvy. And if he gets
5512: into Parliament, let me tell you it will be better for you. I don't say
5513: it will be the better for overlookers and screws, and rats and _sprats_;
5514: but it will be the better for every good fellow who takes his pot at the
5515: Sugar Loaf."
5516: 
5517: Mr. Johnson's exertions for the political education of the Sproxton men
5518: did not stop here, which was the more disinterested in him as he did not
5519: expect to see them again, and could only set on foot an organization by
5520: which their instruction could be continued without him. In this he was
5521: quite successful. A man known among the "butties" as Pack, who had
5522: already been mentioned by Mr. Chubb, presently joined the party, and had
5523: a private audience of Mr. Johnson, that he might be instituted as the
5524: "shepherd" of this new flock.
5525: 
5526: "That's a right down genelman," said Pack, as he took the seat vacated
5527: by the orator, who had ridden away.
5528: 
5529: "What's his trade, think you?" said Gills, the wiry stone-cutter.
5530: 
5531: "Trade?" said Mr. Chubb. "He one of the top sawyers of the country. He
5532: works with his head, you may see that."
5533: 
5534: "Let's have our pipes, then," said Old Sleck; "I'm pretty well tired o'
5535: jaw."
5536: 
5537: "So am I," said Dredge. "It's wriggling work--like follering a stoat. It
5538: makes a man dry. I'd as lief hear preaching, on'y there's naught to be
5539: got by't. I shouldn't know which end I stood on if it wasn't for the
5540: tickets and the treatin'."

5545: CHAPTER XII.
5546: 
5547:     "Oh, sir, 'twas that mixture of spite and over-fed merriment
5548:     which passes for humor with the vulgar. In their fun, they have
5549:     much resemblance to a turkey-cock. It has a cruel beak, and
5550:     a silly iteration of ugly sounds; it spreads its tail in
5551:     self-glorification, but shows you the wrong side of the
5552:     ornament--liking admiration, but knowing not what is admirable."
5553: 
5554: 
5555: This Sunday evening, which promised to be so memorable in the experience
5556: of the Sproxton miners, had its drama also for those unsatisfactory
5557: objects to Mr. Johnson's moral sense, the Debarrys. Certain incidents
5558: occurring at Treby Manor caused an excitement there which spread from
5559: the dining-room to the stables; but no one underwent such agitating
5560: transitions of feeling as Mr. Scales. At six o'clock that superior
5561: butler was chuckling in triumph at having played a fine and original
5562: practical joke on his rival, Mr. Christian. Some two hours after that
5563: time he was frightened, sorry, and even meek; he was on the brink of a
5564: humiliating confession; his cheeks were almost livid; his hair was
5565: flattened for want of due attention from his fingers; and the fine roll
5566: of his whiskers, which was too firm to give way, seemed only a sad
5567: reminiscence of past splendor and felicity. His sorrow came about in
5568: this wise.
5569: 
5570: After service on that Sunday morning, Mr. Philip Debarry had left the
5571: rest of the family to go home in the carriage, and had remained at the
5572: rectory to lunch with his uncle Augustus, that he might consult him
5573: touching some letters of importance. He had returned the letters to his
5574: pocket-book but had not returned the book to his pocket, and he finally
5575: walked away leaving the enclosure of private papers and bank-notes on
5576: his uncle's escritoire. After his arrival at home he was reminded of his
5577: omission, and immediately dispatched Christian with a note begging his
5578: uncle to seal up the pocket-book and send it by the bearer. This
5579: commission, which was given between three and four o'clock, happened to
5580: be very unwelcome to the courier. The fact was that Mr. Christian, who
5581: had been remarkable through life for that power of adapting himself to
5582: circumstances which enables a man to fall safely on all-fours in the
5583: most hurried expulsions and escapes, was not exempt from bodily
5584: suffering--a circumstance to which there is no known way of adapting
5585: one's self so as to be perfectly comfortable under it, or to push it off
5586: on to other people's shoulders. He did what he could: he took doses of
5587: opium when he had an access of nervous pains, and he consoled himself as
5588: to future possibilities by thinking that if the pains ever became
5589: intolerably frequent, a considerable increase in the dose might put an
5590: end to them altogether. He was neither Cato nor Hamlet, and though he
5591: had learned their soliloquies at his first boarding-school, he would
5592: probably have increased his dose without reciting those master-pieces.
5593: Next to the pain itself he disliked that any one should know of it:
5594: defective health diminished a man's market value; he did not like to be
5595: the object of the sort of pity he himself gave to a poor devil who was
5596: forced to make a wry face or "give in" altogether.
5597: 
5598: He had felt it expedient to take a slight dose this afternoon, and still
5599: he was not altogether relieved at the time he set off for the rectory.
5600: On returning with the valuable case safely deposited in his hind
5601: pocket, he felt increasing bodily uneasiness, and took another dose.
5602: Thinking it likely that he looked rather pitiable, he chose not to
5603: proceed to the house by the carriage-road. The servants often walked in
5604: the park on a Sunday, and he wished to avoid any meeting. He would make
5605: a circuit, get into the house privately, and after delivering his packet
5606: to Mr. Debarry, shut himself up till the ringing of the half-hour bell.
5607: But when he reached an elbowed seat under some sycamores, he felt so ill
5608: at ease that he yielded to the temptation of throwing himself on it to
5609: rest a little. He looked at his watch: it was but five; he had done his
5610: errand quickly hitherto, and Mr. Debarry had not urged haste. But in
5611: less than ten minutes he was in a sound sleep. Certain conditions of his
5612: system had determined a stronger effect than usual from the opium.
5613: 
5614: As he had expected, there were servants strolling in the park, but they
5615: did not all choose the most frequented part. Mr. Scales, in pursuit of a
5616: light flirtation with the younger lady's maid, had preferred a more
5617: sequestered walk in the company of that agreeable nymph. And it happened
5618: to be this pair, of all others, who alighted on the sleeping
5619: Christian--a sight which at the very first moment caused Mr. Scales a
5620: vague pleasure as at an incident that must lead to something clever on
5621: his part. To play a trick, and make some one or other look foolish, was
5622: held the most pointed form of wit throughout the back regions of the
5623: Manor, and served as a constant substitute for theatrical entertainment:
5624: what the farce wanted in costume or "make up" it gained in the reality
5625: of the mortification which excited the general laughter. And lo! here
5626: was the offensive, the exasperatingly cool and superior Christian,
5627: caught comparatively helpless, with his head hanging on his shoulder,
5628: and one coat-tail hanging out heavily below the elbow of the rustic
5629: seat. It was this coat-tail which served as a suggestion to Mr. Scales's
5630: genius. Putting his finger up in warning to Mrs. Cherry, and saying,
5631: "Hush--be quiet--I see a fine bit of fun"--he took a knife from his
5632: pocket, stepped behind the unconscious Christian, and quickly cut off
5633: the pendent coat-tail. Scales knew nothing of the errand to the rectory;
5634: and as he noticed that there was something in the pocket, thought it was
5635: probably a large cigar-case. So much the better--he had no time to
5636: pause. He threw the coat-tail as far as he could, and noticed that it
5637: fell among the elms under which they had been walking. Then, beckoning
5638: to Mrs Cherry, he hurried away with her toward the more open part of
5639: the park, not daring to explode in laughter until it was safe from the
5640: chance of waking the sleeper. And then the vision of the graceful,
5641: well-appointed Mr. Christian, who sneered at Scales about his "get up,"
5642: having to walk back to the house with only one tail to his coat, was a
5643: source of so much enjoyment to the butler, that the fair Cherry began to
5644: be quite jealous of the joke. Still she admitted that it really was
5645: funny, tittered intermittently, and pledged herself to secrecy. Mr.
5646: Scales explained to her that Christian would try to creep in unobserved,
5647: but that this must be made impossible; and he requested her to imagine
5648: the figure this interloping fellow would cut when everybody was asking
5649: what had happened. "Hallo, Christian! where's your coat tail?" would
5650: become a proverb at the Manor, where jokes kept remarkably well without
5651: the aid of salt; and Mr. Christian's comb would be cut so effectually
5652: that it would take a long time to grow again. Exit Scales, laughing, and
5653: presenting a fine example of dramatic irony to any one in the secret of
5654: Fate.
5655: 
5656: When Christian awoke, he was shocked to find himself in the twilight. He
5657: started up, shook himself, missed something, and soon became aware what
5658: it was he missed. He did not doubt that he had been robbed, and he at
5659: once foresaw that the consequences would be highly unpleasant. In no way
5660: could the cause of the accident be so represented to Mr. Philip Debarry
5661: as to prevent him from viewing his hitherto unimpeachable factotum in a
5662: new and unfavorable light. And though Mr. Christian did not regard his
5663: present position as brilliant, he did not see his way to anything
5664: better. A man nearly fifty who is not always quite well is seldom
5665: ardently hopeful: he is aware that this is a world in which merit is
5666: often overlooked. With the idea of robbery in full possession of his
5667: mind, to peer about and search in the dimness, even if it had occurred
5668: to him, would have seemed a preposterous waste of time and energy. He
5669: knew it was likely that Mr. Debarry's pocket-book had important and
5670: valuable contents, and that he should deepen his offence by deferring
5671: his announcement of the unfortunate fact. He hastened back to the house,
5672: relieved by the obscurity from that mortification of his vanity on which
5673: the butler had counted. Indeed, to Scales himself the affair had already
5674: begun to appear less thoroughly jocose than he had anticipated. For he
5675: observed that Christian's non-appearance before dinner had caused Mr.
5676: Debarry some consternation; and he had gathered that the courier had
5677: been sent on a commission to the rectory. "My uncle must have detained
5678: him for some reason or other," he heard Mr. Philip say; "but it is odd.
5679: If he were less trusty about commissions, or had ever seemed to drink
5680: too much, I should be uneasy." Altogether the affair was not taking the
5681: turn Mr. Scales had intended. At last, when dinner had been removed, and
5682: the butler's chief duties were at an end, it was understood that
5683: Christian had entered without his coat tail, looking serious and even
5684: agitated; that he had asked leave at once to speak to Mr. Debarry, and
5685: that he was even then in parley with the gentleman in the dining-room.
5686: Scales was in alarm; it must have been some property of Mr. Debarry's
5687: that had weighted the pocket. He took a lantern, got a groom to
5688: accompany him with another lantern, and with the utmost practical speed
5689: reached the fatal spot in the park. He searched under the elms--he was
5690: certain that the pocket had fallen there--and he found the pocket; but
5691: he found it empty, and, in spite of further search, did not find the
5692: contents, though he had first consoled himself with thinking that they
5693: had fallen out, and would be lying not far off. He returned with the
5694: lanterns and the coat tail and a most uncomfortable consciousness in
5695: that great seat of a butler's emotion, the stomach. He had no sooner
5696: re-entered than he was met by Mrs. Cherry, pale and anxious, who drew
5697: him aside to say that if he didn't tell everything she would; that the
5698: constables were to be sent for; that there had been no end of bank-notes
5699: and letters and things in Mr. Debarry's pocket-book, which Christian was
5700: carrying in that very pocket Scales had cut off; that the rector was
5701: sent for, the constable was coming, and they should all be hanged. Mr.
5702: Scales's own intellect was anything but clear as to the possible issues.
5703: Crest-fallen, and with the coat-tail in his hands as an attestation that
5704: he was innocent of anything more than a joke, he went and made his
5705: confession. His story relieved Christian a little, but did not relieve
5706: Mr. Debarry, who was more annoyed at the loss of the letters, and the
5707: chance of their getting into hands that might make use of them, than at
5708: the loss of the bank-notes. Nothing could be done for the present, but
5709: that the rector, who was a magistrate, should instruct the constables,
5710: and that the spot in the park indicated by Scales should again be
5711: carefully searched. This was done, but in vain; and many of the family
5712: at the Manor had disturbed sleep that night.
5713:

5717: CHAPTER XIII.
5718: 
5719:     "Give sorrow leave awhile, to tutor me
5720:     To this submission."--_Richard II._
5721: 
5722: 
5723: Meanwhile Felix Holt had been making his way back from Sproxton to Treby
5724: in some irritation and bitterness of spirit. For a little while he
5725: walked slowly along the direct road, hoping that Mr. Johnson would
5726: overtake him, in which case he would have the pleasure of quarrelling
5727: with him, and telling him what he thought of his intentions in coming to
5728: cant at the Sugar Loaf. But he presently checked himself in this folly
5729: and turned off again toward the canal, that he might avoid the
5730: temptation of getting into a passion to no purpose.
5731: 
5732: "Where's the good," he thought, "of pulling at such a tangled skein as
5733: this electioneering trickery? As long as three-fourths of the men in
5734: this country see nothing in an election but self-interest, and nothing
5735: in self-interest but some form of greed, one might as well try to purify
5736: the proceedings of the fishes, and say to a hungry cod-fish--'My good
5737: friend, abstain; don't goggle your eyes so, or show such a stupid
5738: gluttonous mouth, or think the little fishes are worth nothing except in
5739: relation to your own inside.' He'd be open to no argument short of
5740: crimping him. I should get into a rage with this fellow, and perhaps end
5741: by thrashing him. There's some reason in me as long as I keep my temper,
5742: but my rash humor is drunkenness without wine. I shouldn't wonder if he
5743: upsets all my plans with these colliers. Of course he's going to treat
5744: them for the sake of getting up a posse at the nomination and
5745: speechifyings. They'll drink double, and never come near me on a
5746: Saturday evening. I don't know what sort of man Transome really is. It's
5747: no use my speaking to anybody else, but if I could get at him, he might
5748: put a veto on this thing. Though, when once the men have been promised
5749: and set a-going, the mischief is likely to be past mending. Hang the
5750: Liberal cod-fish! I shouldn't have minded so much if he'd been a Tory!"
5751: 
5752: Felix went along in the twilight struggling in this way with the
5753: intricacies of life, which would certainly be greatly simplified if
5754: corrupt practices were the invariable mark of wrong opinions. When he
5755: had crossed the common and had entered the park, the overshadowing trees
5756: deepened the gray gloom of the evening; it was useless to try and keep
5757: the blind path, and he could only be careful that his steps should be
5758: bent in the direction of the park gate. He was striding along rapidly
5759: now, whistling "Bannockburn" in a subdued way as an accompaniment to
5760: his inward discussion, when something smooth and soft on which his foot
5761: alighted arrested him with an unpleasant startling sensation, and made
5762: him stoop to examine the object he was treading on. He found it to be a
5763: large leather pocket-book swelled by its contents, and fastened with a
5764: sealed ribbon as well as a clasp. In stooping he saw about a yard off
5765: something whitish and square lying on the dark grass. This was an
5766: ornamental note-book of pale leather stamped with gold. Apparently it
5767: had burst open in falling, and out of the pocket formed by the cover,
5768: there protruded a small gold chain about four inches long, with various
5769: seals and other trifles attached to it by a ring at the end. Felix
5770: thrust the chain back, and finding that the clasp of the note-book was
5771: broken, he closed it and thrust it into his side-pocket, walking along
5772: under some annoyance that fortune had made him the finder of articles
5773: belonging most probably to one of the family at Treby Manor. He was much
5774: too proud a man to like any contact with the aristocracy, and he could
5775: still less endure coming within speech of their servants. Some plan must
5776: be devised by which he could avoid carrying these things up to the Manor
5777: himself: he thought at first of leaving them at the lodge, but he had a
5778: scruple against placing property, of which the ownership was after all
5779: uncertain, in the hands of persons unknown to him. It was possible that
5780: the large pocket-book contained papers of high importance, and that it
5781: did not belong to any of the Debarry family. He resolved at last to
5782: carry his findings to Mr. Lyon, who would perhaps be good-natured enough
5783: to save him from the necessary transactions with the people at the Manor
5784: by undertaking those transactions himself. With this determination he
5785: walked straight to Malthouse Yard, and waited outside the chapel until
5786: the congregation was dispersing, when he passed along the aisle to the
5787: vestry in order to speak to the minister in private.
5788: 
5789: But Mr. Lyon was not alone when Felix entered. Mr. Nuttwood, the grocer,
5790: who was one of the deacons, was complaining to him about the obstinate
5791: demeanor of the singers, who had declined to change the tunes in
5792: accordance with a change in the selection of hymns, and had stretched
5793: short metre into long out of pure wilfulness and defiance, irreverently
5794: adapting the most sacred monosyllables to a multitude of quavers,
5795: arranged, it was to be feared, by some musician who was inspired by
5796: conceit rather than by the true spirit of psalmody.
5797: 
5798: "Come in, my friend," said Mr. Lyon, smiling at Felix, and then
5799: continuing in a faint voice, while he wiped the perspiration from his
5800: brow and bald crown, "Brother Nuttwood, we must be content to carry a
5801: thorn in our sides while the necessities of our imperfect state demand
5802: that there should be a body set apart and called a choir, whose special
5803: office it is to lead the singing, not because they are more disposed to
5804: the devout uplifting of praise, but because they are endowed with better
5805: vocal organs, and have attained more of the musician's art. For all
5806: office, unless it be accompanied by peculiar grace, becomes, as it were,
5807: a diseased organ, seeking to make itself too much of a centre. Singers,
5808: specially so called, are, it must be confessed, an anomaly among us who
5809: seek to reduce the Church to its primitive simplicity, and to cast away
5810: all that may obstruct the direct communion of spirit with spirit."
5811: 
5812: "They are so headstrong," said Mr. Nuttwood, in a tone of sad
5813: perplexity, "that if we dealt not warily with them they might end in
5814: dividing the church, even now that we have had the chapel enlarged.
5815: Brother Kemp would side with them, and draw the half part of the members
5816: after him. I cannot but think it a snare when a professing Christian has
5817: a bass voice like Brother Kemp's. It makes him desire to be heard of
5818: men; but the weaker song of the humble may have more power in the ear of
5819: God."
5820: 
5821: "Do you think it any better vanity to flatter yourself that God likes to
5822: hear you, though men don't?" said Felix, with unwarrantable bluntness.
5823: 
5824: The civil grocer was prepared to be scandalized by anything that came
5825: from Felix. In common with many hearers in Malthouse Yard, he already
5826: felt an objection to a young man who was notorious for having interfered
5827: in a question of wholesale and retail, which should have been left to
5828: Providence. Old Mr. Holt, being a church member, had probably had
5829: "leadings" which were more to be relied on than his son's boasted
5830: knowledge. In any case, a little visceral disturbance and inward
5831: chastisement to the consumers of questionable medicines would tend less
5832: to obscure the divine glory than a show of punctilious morality in one
5833: who was not a "professor." Besides, how was it to be known that the
5834: medicines would not be blessed, if taken with due trust in a higher
5835: influence? A Christian must consider not the medicines alone in their
5836: relation to our frail bodies (which are dust), but the medicines with
5837: Omnipotence behind them. Hence a pious vendor will look for "leadings,"
5838: and he is likely to find them in the cessation of demand and the
5839: disproportion of expenses and returns. The grocer was thus on his guard
5840: against the presumptuous disputant.
5841: 
5842: "Mr. Lyon may understand you, sir," he replied. "He seems to be fond of
5843: your conversation. But you have too much of the pride of human learning
5844: for me. I follow no new lights."
5845: 
5846: "Then follow an old one," said Felix, mischievously disposed toward a
5847: sleek tradesman. "Follow the light of the old-fashioned Presbyterians
5848: that I've heard sing at Glasgow. The preacher gives out the psalm, and
5849: then everybody sings a different tune, as it happens to turn up in their
5850: throats. It's a domineering thing to set a tune and expect everybody
5851: else to follow it. It's a denial of private judgment."
5852: 
5853: "Hush, hush, my young friend," said Mr. Lyon, hurt by this levity, which
5854: glanced at himself as well as at the deacon. "Play not with paradoxes.
5855: That caustic which you handle in order to scorch others, may happen to
5856: sear your own fingers and make them dead to the quality of things. 'Tis
5857: difficult enough to see our way and keep our torch steady in this dim
5858: labyrinth: to whirl the torch and dazzle the eyes of our fellow-seekers
5859: is a poor daring, and may end in total darkness. You yourself are a
5860: lover of freedom, and a bold rebel against usurping authority. But the
5861: right to rebellion is the right to seek a higher rule, and not to wander
5862: in mere lawlessness. Wherefore, I beseech you, seem not to say that
5863: liberty is license. And I apprehend--though I am not endowed with an ear
5864: to seize those earthly harmonies, which to some devout souls have
5865: seemed, as it were, the broken echoes of the heavenly choir--I apprehend
5866: that there is a law in music, disobedience whereunto would bring us in
5867: our singing to the level of shrieking maniacs or howling beasts: so that
5868: herein we are well instructed how true liberty can be nought but the
5869: transfer of obedience from the will of one or of a few men to that will
5870: which is the norm or rule for all men. And though the transfer may
5871: sometimes be but an erroneous direction of search, yet is the search
5872: good and necessary to the ultimate finding. And even as in music, where
5873: all obey and concur to one end, so that each has the joy of contributing
5874: to a whole whereby he is ravished and lifted up into the courts of
5875: heaven, so will it be in that crowning time of the millennial reign,
5876: when our daily prayer will be fulfilled, and one law shall be written on
5877: all hearts, and be the very structure of all thought, and be the
5878: principle of all action."
5879: 
5880: Tired, even exhausted, as the minister had been when Felix Holt entered,
5881: the gathering excitement of speech gave more and more energy to his
5882: voice and manner; he walked away from the vestry table, he paused, and
5883: came back to it; he walked away again, then came back, and ended with
5884: his deepest toned largo, keeping his hands clasped behind him, while his
5885: brown eyes were bright with the lasting youthfulness of enthusiastic
5886: thought and love. But to any one who had no share in the energies that
5887: were thrilling his little body, he would have looked queer enough. No
5888: sooner had he finished his eager speech, than he held out his hand to
5889: the deacon, and said, in his former faint tone of fatigue--
5890: 
5891: "God be with you, brother. We shall meet to-morrow, and we will see what
5892: can be done to subdue these refractory spirits."
5893: 
5894: When the deacon was gone, Felix said, "Forgive me, Mr. Lyon; I was
5895: wrong, and you are right."
5896: 
5897: "Yes, yes, my friend, you have that mark of grace within you, that you
5898: are ready to acknowledge the justice of a rebuke. Sit down; you have
5899: something to say--some packet there."
5900: 
5901: They sat down at a corner of the small table, and Felix drew the
5902: note-book from his pocket to lay it down with the pocket-book, saying--
5903: 
5904: "I've had the ill-luck to be the finder of these things in the Debarrys'
5905: park. Most likely they belong to one of the family at the Manor, or to
5906: some grandee who is staying there. I hate having anything to do with
5907: such people. They'll think me a poor rascal, and offer me money. You are
5908: a known man, and I thought you would be kind enough to relieve me by
5909: taking charge of these things, and writing to Debarry, not mentioning
5910: me, and asking him to send some one for them. I found them on the grass
5911: in the park this evening about half-past seven, in the corner we cross
5912: going to Sproxton."
5913: 
5914: "Stay," said Mr. Lyon, "this little book is open; we may venture to look
5915: in it for some sign of ownership. There be others who possess property,
5916: and might be crossing that end of the park, besides the Debarrys."
5917: 
5918: As he lifted the note-book close to his eyes, the chain again slipped
5919: out. He arrested it and held it in his hand, while he examined some
5920: writing, which appeared to be a name on the inner leather. He looked
5921: long, as if he were trying to decipher something that was partly rubbed
5922: out; and his hands began to tremble noticeably. He made a movement in an
5923: agitated manner, as if he were going to examine the chain and seals,
5924: which he held in his hand. But he checked himself, closed his hand
5925: again, and rested it on the table, while with the other hand he pressed
5926: the sides of the note-book together.
5927: 
5928: Felix observed his agitation, and was much surprised; but with a
5929: delicacy of which he was capable under all his abruptness, he said, "You
5930: are overcome with fatigue, sir. I was thoughtless to tease you with
5931: these matters at the end of Sunday, when you have been preaching three
5932: sermons."
5933: 
5934: Mr. Lyon did not speak for a few moments, but at last he said--
5935: 
5936: "It is true. I am overcome. It was a name I saw--a name that called up a
5937: past sorrow. Fear not; I will do what is needful with these things. You
5938: may trust them to me."
5939: 
5940: With trembling fingers he replaced the chain, and tied both the large
5941: pocket-book and the note-book in his handkerchief. He was evidently
5942: making a great effort over himself. But when he had gathered the knot of
5943: the handkerchief in his hand he said--
5944: 
5945: "Give me your arm to the door, my friend. I feel ill. Doubtless I am
5946: over-wearied."
5947: 
5948: The door was already open, and Lyddy was watching for her master's
5949: return. Felix therefore said good-night and passed on, sure that this
5950: was what Mr. Lyon would prefer. The minister's supper of warm porridge
5951: was ready by the kitchen-fire, where he always took it on a Sunday
5952: evening, and afterward smoked his weekly pipe up the broad chimney--the
5953: one great relaxation he allowed himself. Smoking, he considered, was a
5954: recreation of the travailled spirit, which, if indulged in, might endear
5955: this world to us by the ignoble bonds of mere sensuous ease. Daily
5956: smoking might be lawful, but it was not expedient. And in this Esther
5957: concurred with a doctrinal eagerness that was unusual in her. It was her
5958: habit to go to her own room, professedly to bed, very early on
5959: Sundays--immediately on her return from chapel--that she might avoid her
5960: father's pipe. But this evening she had remained at home, under a true
5961: plea of not feeling well; and when she heard him enter, she ran out of
5962: the parlor to meet him.
5963: 
5964: "Father, you are ill," she said, as he tottered to the wicker-bottomed
5965: arm-chair, while Lyddy stood by, shaking her head.
5966: 
5967: "No, my dear," he answered feebly, as she took off his hat and looked in
5968: his face enquiringly; "I am weary."
5969: 
5970: "Let me lay these things down for you," said Esther, touching the bundle
5971: in the handkerchief.
5972: 
5973: "No; they are matters which I have to examine," he said, laying them on
5974: the table, and putting his arm across them. "Go you to bed, Lyddy."
5975: 
5976: "Not me, sir. If ever a man looked as if he was struck with death, it's
5977: you, this very night as here is."
5978: 
5979: "Nonsense, Lyddy," said Esther, angrily. "Go to bed when my father
5980: desires it. I will stay with him."
5981: 
5982: Lyddy was electrified by surprise at this new behavior of Miss Esther's.
5983: She took her candle silently and went.
5984: 
5985: "Go you too, my dear," said Mr. Lyon, tenderly, giving his hand to
5986: Esther, when Lyddy was gone. "It is your wont to go early. Why are you
5987: up?"
5988: 
5989: "Let me lift your porridge from before the fire, and stay with you,
5990: father. You think I'm so naughty that I don't like doing anything for
5991: you," said Esther, smiling rather sadly at him.
5992: 
5993: "Child, what has happened? You have become the image of your mother
5994: to-night," said the minister, in a loud whisper. The tears came and
5995: relieved him while Esther, who had stooped to lift the porridge from the
5996: fender, paused on one knee and looked up at him.
5997: 
5998: "She was very good to you?" asked Esther, softly.
5999: 
6000: "Yes, dear. She did not reject my affection. She thought not scorn of my
6001: love. She would have forgiven me, if I had erred against her, from very
6002: tenderness. Could you forgive me, child?"
6003: 
6004: "Father, I have not been good to you; but I will be, I will be," said
6005: Esther, laying her head on his knee.
6006: 
6007: He kissed her head. "Go to bed, dear; I would be alone."
6008: 
6009: When Esther was lying down that night, she felt as if the little
6010: incidents between herself and her father on this Sunday had made it an
6011: epoch. Very slight words and deeds may have a sacramental efficacy, if
6012: we can cast our self-love behind us, in order to say or do them. And it
6013: has been well believed through many ages that the beginning of
6014: compunction is the beginning of a new life; that the mind which sees
6015: itself blameless may be called dead in trespasses--in trespasses on the
6016: love of others, in trespasses on their weakness, in trespasses on all
6017: those great claims which are the image of our own need.
6018: 
6019: But Esther persisted in assuring herself that she was not bending to any
6020: criticism from Felix. She was full of resentment against his rudeness,
6021: and yet more against his too harsh conception of her character. She was
6022: determined to keep as much at a distance from him as possible.
6023: 
6024: 
6025: 
6026: 
6027: CHAPTER XIV.
6028: 
6029:     This man's metallic; at a sudden blow
6030:     His soul rings hard. I cannot lay my palm,
6031:     Trembling with life, upon that jointed brass.
6032:     I shudder at the cold unanswering touch;
6033:     But if it press me in response, I'm bruised.
6034: 
6035: 
6036: The next morning, when the Debarrys, including the rector, who had
6037: ridden over to the Manor early, were still seated at breakfast,
6038: Christian came in with a letter, saying that it had been brought by a
6039: man employed at the chapel in Malthouse Yard, who had been ordered by
6040: the minister to use all speed and care in the delivery.
6041: 
6042: The letter was addressed to Sir Maximus.
6043: 
6044: "Stay, Christian, it may possibly refer to the lost pocket-book," said
6045: Philip Debarry, who was beginning to feel rather sorry for his factotum,
6046: as a reaction from previous suspicions and indignation.
6047: 
6048: Sir Maximus opened the letter and felt for his glasses, but then said,
6049: "Here, you read it, Phil: the man writes a hand like small print."
6050: 
6051: Philip cast his eyes over it, and then read aloud in a tone of
6052: satisfaction:--
6053: 
6054:     SIR,--I send this letter to apprise you that I have now in my
6055:     possession certain articles, which, last evening, at about
6056:     half-past seven o'clock, were found lying on the grass at the
6057:     western extremity of your park. The articles are =1=, a well-filled
6058:     pocket-book, of brown leather, fastened with a black ribbon and
6059:     with a seal of red wax; =2=, a small note-book, covered with gilded
6060:     vellum, whereof the clasp was burst, and from out whereof had
6061:     partly escaped a small chain, with seals and a locket attached, the
6062:     locket bearing on the back a device, and round the face a female
6063:     name.
6064: 
6065:     Whereof I request that you will further my effort to place these
6066:     articles in the right hands, by ascertaining whether any person
6067:     within your walls claims them as his property, and by sending that
6068:     person to me (if such be found); for I will on no account let them
6069:     pass from my care save into that of one who, declaring himself to
6070:     be the owner, can state to me what is the impression on the seal,
6071:     and what the device and name upon the locket.
6072: 
6073:     I am, sir, yours to command in all right dealing,
6074: 
6075:     Malthouse Yard. Oct. 3, 1832.                    RUFUS LYON.
6076: 
6077: "Well done, old Lyon," said the rector; "I didn't think that any
6078: composition of his would ever give me so much pleasure."
6079: 
6080: "What an old fox it is!" said Sir Maximus. "Why couldn't he send the
6081: things to me at once along with the letter?"
6082: 
6083: "No, no, Max; he uses a justifiable caution," said the rector, a refined
6084: and rather severe likeness of his brother, with a ring of fearlessness
6085: and decision in his voice which startled all flaccid men and unruly
6086: boys. "What are you going to do, Phil?" he added, seeing his nephew
6087: rise.
6088: 
6089: "To write, of course. Those other matters are yours, I suppose?" said
6090: Mr. Debarry, looking at Christian.
6091: 
6092: "Yes, sir."
6093: 
6094: "I shall send you with a letter to the preacher. You can describe your
6095: own property. And the seal, uncle--was it your coat-of-arms?"
6096: 
6097: "No, it was this head of Achilles. Here, I can take it off the ring, and
6098: you can carry it, Christian. But don't lose that, for I've had it ever
6099: since eighteen hundred. I should like to send my compliments with it,"
6100: the rector went on, looking at his brother, "and beg that since he has
6101: so much wise caution at command, he would exercise a little in more
6102: public matters, instead of making himself a firebrand in my parish, and
6103: teaching hucksters and tape-weavers that it's their business to dictate
6104: to statesmen."
6105: 
6106: "How did Dissenters, and Methodists, and Quakers, and people of that
6107: sort first come up, uncle?" said Miss Selina, a radiant girl of
6108: twenty, who had given much time to the harp.
6109: 
6110: "Dear me, Selina," said her elder sister, Harriet, whose forte was
6111: general knowledge, "don't you remember 'Woodstock'? They were in
6112: Cromwell's time."
6113: 
6114: "Oh! Holdenough, and those people? Yes; but they preached in the
6115: churches; they had no chapels. Tell me, uncle Gus; I like to be wise,"
6116: said Selina, looking up at the face which was smiling down on her with a
6117: sort of severe benignity. "Phil says I'm an ignorant puss."
6118: 
6119: "The seeds of Nonconformity were sown at the Reformation, my dear, when
6120: some obstinate man made scruples about surplices and the place of the
6121: communion-table, and other trifles of that sort. But the Quakers came up
6122: about Cromwell's time, and the Methodists only in the last century. The
6123: first Methodists were regular clergymen, the more's the pity."
6124: 
6125: "But all those wrong things, why didn't government put them down?"
6126: 
6127: "Ah, to be sure," fell in Sir Maximus, in a cordial tone of
6128: corroboration.
6129: 
6130: "Because error is often strong, and government is often weak, my dear.
6131: Well, Phil, have you finished your letter?"
6132: 
6133: "Yes, I will read it to you," said Philip, turning and leaning over the
6134: back of his chair with the letter in his hand.
6135: 
6136: There is a portrait of Mr. Philip Debarry still to be seen at Treby
6137: Manor, and a very fine bust of him at Rome, where he died fifteen years
6138: later, a convert to Catholicism. His face would have been plain but for
6139: the exquisite setting of his hazel eyes, which fascinated even the dogs
6140: of the household. The other features, though slight and irregular, were
6141: redeemed from triviality by the stamp of gravity and intellectual
6142: preoccupation in his face and bearing. As he read aloud, his voice was
6143: what his uncle's might have been if it had been modulated by delicate
6144: health and a visitation of self-doubt.
6145: 
6146:     SIR,--In reply to the letter with which you have favored me this
6147:     morning, I beg to state that the articles you describe were lost
6148:     from the pocket of my servant, who is the bearer of this letter to
6149:     you, and is the claimant of the vellum note-book and the gold
6150:     chain. The large leathern pocket-book is my own property and the
6151:     impression on the wax, a helmeted head of Achilles, was made by my
6152:     uncle, the Reverend Augustus Debarry, who allows me to forward this
6153:     seal to you in proof that I am not making a mistaken claim.
6154: 
6155:     I feel myself under deep obligation to you, sir, for the care and
6156:     trouble you have taken in order to restore to its right owner a
6157:     piece of property which happens to be of particular importance to
6158:     me. And I shall consider myself doubly fortunate if at any time you
6159:     can point out to me some method by which I may procure you as
6160:     lively a satisfaction as I am now feeling, in that full and speedy
6161:     relief from anxiety which I owe to your considerate conduct.
6162: 
6163:    I remain, sir, your obliged and faithful servant,
6164:                                                  PHILIP DEBARRY.
6165: 
6166: "You know best, Phil, of course," said Sir Maximus, pushing his plate
6167: from him, by way of interjection. "But it seems to me you exaggerate
6168: preposterously every little service a man happens to do for you. Why
6169: should you make a general offer of that sort? How do you know what he
6170: will be asking you to do? Stuff and nonsense! Tell Willis to send him a
6171: few head of game. You should think twice before you give a blank check
6172: of that sort to one of these quibbling, meddlesome Radicals."
6173: 
6174: "You are afraid of my committing myself to 'the bottomless perjury of an
6175: et cetera,'" said Philip, smiling, as he turned to fold his letter. "But
6176: I think I am not doing any mischief; at all events I could not be
6177: content to say less. And I have a notion that he would regard a present
6178: of game just now as an insult. I should, in his place."
6179: 
6180: "Yes, yes, you; but you don't make yourself a measure of Dissenting
6181: preachers, I hope," said Sir Maximus, rather wrathfully. "What do you
6182: say, Gus?"
6183: 
6184: "Phil is right," said the rector, in an absolute tone. "I would not deal
6185: with a Dissenter, or put profits into the pocket of a Radical which I
6186: might put into the pocket of a good Churchman and a quiet subject. But
6187: if the greatest scoundrel in the world made way for me, or picked my hat
6188: up, I would thank him. So would you, Max."
6189: 
6190: "Pooh! I didn't mean that one shouldn't behave like a gentleman," said
6191: Sir Maximus, in some vexation. He had great pride in his son's
6192: superiority even to himself; but he did not quite trust the dim vision
6193: opened by Phil's new words and new notions. He could only submit in
6194: silence while the letter was delivered to Christian, with the order to
6195: start for Malthouse Yard immediately.
6196: 
6197: Meanwhile, in that somewhat dim locality the possible claimant of the
6198: note-book and the chain was thought of and expected with palpitating
6199: agitation. Mr. Lyon was seated in his study, looking haggard and already
6200: aged from a sleepless night. He was so afraid lest his emotion should
6201: deprive him of the presence of mind necessary to the due attention to
6202: particulars in the coming interview, that he continued to occupy his
6203: sight and touch with the objects which had stirred the depths, not only
6204: of memory, but of dread. Once again he unlocked a small box which stood
6205: beside his desk, and took from it a little oval locket, and compared
6206: this with one which hung with the seals on the stray gold chain. There
6207: was the same device in enamel on the back of both: clasped hands
6208: surrounded with blue flowers. Both had round the face a name in gold
6209: italics on a blue ground: the name on the locket taken from the drawer
6210: was _Maurice_; the name on the locket which hung with the seals was
6211: _Annette_, and within the circle of this name there was a lover's knot
6212: of light brown hair, which matched a curl that lay in the box. The hair
6213: in the locket which bore the name of Maurice was of a very dark brown,
6214: and before returning it to the drawer Mr. Lyon noted the color and
6215: quality of this hair more carefully than ever. Then he recurred to the
6216: note-book: undoubtedly there had been something, probably a third name,
6217: beyond the names _Maurice Christian_, which had themselves been rubbed
6218: and slightly smeared as if by accident; and from the very first
6219: examination in the vestry, Mr. Lyon could not prevent himself from
6220: transferring the mental image of the third name in faint lines to the
6221: rubbed leather. The leaves of the note-book seemed to have been recently
6222: inserted; they were of fresh white paper, and only bore some
6223: abbreviations in pencil with a notation of small sums. Nothing could be
6224: gathered from the comparison of the writing in the book with that of the
6225: yellow letters which lay in the box; the smeared name had been carefully
6226: printed, and so bore no resemblance to the signature of those letters;
6227: and the pencil abbreviations and figures had been made too hurriedly to
6228: bear any decisive witness. "I will ask him to write--to write a
6229: description of the locket," had been one of Mr. Lyon's thoughts; but he
6230: faltered in that intention. His power of fulfilling it must depend on
6231: what he saw in this visitor, of whose coming he had a horrible dread, at
6232: the very time he was writing to demand it. In that demand he was obeying
6233: the voice of his rigid conscience, which had never left him perfectly at
6234: rest under his one act of deception--the concealment from Esther that he
6235: was not her natural father, the assertion of a false claim upon her.
6236: "Let my path be henceforth simple," he had said to himself in the
6237: anguish of that night; "let me seek to know what is, and if possible to
6238: declare it." If he was really going to find himself face to face with
6239: the man who had been Annette's husband, and who was Esther's father--if
6240: that wandering of his from the light had brought the punishment of a
6241: blind sacrilege as the issue of a conscious transgression,--he prayed
6242: that he might be able to accept all consequences of pain to himself. But
6243: he saw other possibilities concerning the claimant of the book and
6244: chain. His ignorance and suspicions as to the history and character of
6245: Annette's husband made it credible that he had laid a plan for
6246: convincing her of his death as a means of freeing himself from a
6247: burdensome tie; but it seemed equally probable that he was really dead,
6248: and that these articles of property had been a bequest, or a payment, or
6249: even a sale, to their present owner. Indeed, in all these years there was
6250: no knowing into how many hands such pretty trifles might have passed.
6251: And the claimant might, after all, have no connection with the Debarrys;
6252: he might not come on this day or the next. There might be more time left
6253: for reflection and prayer.
6254: 
6255: All these possibilities, which would remove the pressing need for
6256: difficult action, Mr. Lyon represented to himself, but he had no
6257: effective belief in them; his belief went with his strongest feeling,
6258: and in these moments his strongest feeling was dead. He trembled under
6259: the weight that seemed already added to his own sin; he felt himself
6260: already confronted by Annette's husband and Esther's father. Perhaps the
6261: father was a gentleman on a visit to the Debarrys. There was no
6262: hindering the pang with which the old man said to himself--
6263: 
6264: "The child will not be sorry to leave this poor home, and I shall be
6265: guilty in her sight."
6266: 
6267: He was walking about among the rows of books when there came a loud rap
6268: at the outer door. The rap shook him so that he sank into his chair,
6269: feeling almost powerless. Lyddy presented herself.
6270: 
6271: "Here's ever such a fine man from the Manor wants to see you, sir. Dear
6272: heart, dear heart! shall I tell him you're too bad to see him?"
6273: 
6274: "Show him up," said Mr. Lyon, making an effort to rally. When Christian
6275: appeared, the minister half rose, leaning on an arm of his chair, and
6276: said, "Be seated, sir," seeing nothing but that a tall man was entering.
6277: 
6278: "I've brought you a letter from Mr. Debarry," said Christian, in an
6279: off-hand manner. The rusty little man, in his dismal chamber, seemed to
6280: the Ulysses of the steward's room a pitiable sort of human curiosity, to
6281: whom a man of the world would speak rather loudly, in accommodation to
6282: an eccentricity which was likely to be accompanied with deafness. One
6283: cannot be eminent in everything; and if Mr. Christian had dispersed his
6284: faculties in study that would have enabled him to share unconventional
6285: points of view, he might have worn a mistaken kind of boot, and been
6286: less competent to win at _écarté_, or at betting, or in any other
6287: contest suitable to a person of figure.
6288: 
6289: As he seated himself, Mr. Lyon opened the letter, and held it close to
6290: his eyes, so that his face was hidden. But at the word "servant" he
6291: could not avoid starting, and looking off the letter toward the bearer.
6292: Christian, knowing what was in the letter, conjectured that the old man
6293: was amazed to learn that so distinguished-looking a personage was a
6294: servant; he leaned forward with his elbows on his knees, balanced his
6295: cane on his fingers, and began a whispering whistle. The minister
6296: checked himself, finished the reading of the letter, and then slowly and
6297: nervously put on his spectacles to survey this man, between whose fate
6298: and his own there might be a terrible collision. The word "servant" had
6299: been a fresh caution to him. He must do nothing rashly. Esther's lot was
6300: deeply concerned.
6301: 
6302: "Here is the seal mentioned in the letter," said Christian.
6303: 
6304: Mr. Lyon drew the pocket-book from his desk, and after comparing the
6305: seal with the impression, said, "It is right, sir: I deliver the
6306: pocket-book to you."
6307: 
6308: He held it out with the seal, and Christian rose to take them, saying
6309: carelessly, "The other things--the chain and the little book--are mine."
6310: 
6311: "Your name then is----"
6312: 
6313: "Maurice Christian."
6314: 
6315: A spasm shot through Mr. Lyon. It had seemed possible that he might hear
6316: another name, and be freed from the worse half of his anxiety. His next
6317: words were not wisely chosen, but escaped him impulsively.
6318: 
6319: "And you have no other name?"
6320: 
6321: "What do you mean?" said Christian, sharply.
6322: 
6323: "Be so good as to reseat yourself."
6324: 
6325: Christian did not comply. "I'm rather in a hurry, sir," he said,
6326: recovering his coolness. "If it suits you to restore to me those small
6327: articles of mine, I shall be glad; but I would rather leave them behind
6328: than be detained." He had reflected that the minister was simply a
6329: punctilious old bore. The question meant nothing else. But Mr. Lyon had
6330: wrought himself up to the task of finding out, then and there, if
6331: possible, whether or not this were Annette's husband. How could he lay
6332: himself and his sin before God if he wilfully declined to learn the
6333: truth? "Nay, sir, I will not detain you unreasonably," he said, in a
6334: firmer tone than before. "How long have these articles been your
6335: property?"
6336: 
6337: "Oh, for more than twenty years," said Christian, carelessly.
6338: 
6339: He was not altogether easy under the minister's persistence, but for
6340: that very reason he showed no more impatience.
6341: 
6342: "You have been in France and in Germany?"
6343: 
6344: "I have been in most countries on the continent."
6345: 
6346: "Be so good as to write me your name," said Mr. Lyon, dipping a pen in
6347: ink, and holding it out with a piece of paper.
6348: 
6349: Christian was much surprised, but not now greatly alarmed. In his rapid
6350: conjectures as to the explanation of the minister's curiosity, he had
6351: alighted on one which might carry advantage rather than inconvenience.
6352: But he was not going to commit himself.
6353: 
6354: "Before I oblige you there, sir," he said, laying down the pen, and
6355: looking straight at Mr. Lyon, "I must know exactly the reasons you have
6356: for putting these questions to me. You are a stranger to me--an
6357: excellent person, I dare say--but I have no concern about you farther
6358: than to get from you those small articles. Do you still doubt that they
6359: are mine? You wished, I think, that I should tell you what the locket is
6360: like. It has a pair of hands and blue flowers on one side and the name
6361: Annette round the hair on the other side. That is all I have to say. If
6362: you wish for anything more from me, you will be good enough to tell me
6363: why you wish it. Now then, sir, what is your concern with me?"
6364: 
6365: The cool stare, the hard challenging voice, with which these words were
6366: uttered, made them fall like the beating cutting chill of heavy hail on
6367: Mr. Lyon. He sank back in his chair in utter irresolution and
6368: helplessness. How was it possible to lay bare the sad and sacred past in
6369: answer to such a call as this? The dread with which he had thought of
6370: this man's coming, the strongly-confirmed suspicion that he was really
6371: Annette's husband, intensified the antipathy created by his gestures and
6372: glances. The sensitive little minister knew instinctively that words
6373: which would cost him efforts as painful as the obedient footsteps of a
6374: wounded bleeding hound that wills a foreseen throe, would fall on this
6375: man as the pressure of tender fingers falls on a brazen glove. And
6376: Esther--if this man was her father, every additional word might help to
6377: bring down irrevocable, perhaps cruel consequences on her. A thick mist
6378: seemed to have fallen where Mr. Lyon was looking for the track of duty:
6379: the difficult question, how far he was to care for consequences in
6380: seeking and avowing the truth, seemed anew obscured. All these things,
6381: like the vision of a coming calamity, were compressed into a moment of
6382: consciousness. Nothing could be done to-day; everything must be
6383: deferred. He answered Christian in a low apologetic tone.
6384: 
6385: "It is true, sir; you have told me all I can demand. I have no
6386: sufficient reason for detaining your property further."
6387: 
6388: He handed the note-book and chain to Christian, who had been observing
6389: him narrowly, and now said, in a tone of indifference, as he pocketed
6390: the articles--
6391: 
6392: "Very good, sir. I wish you a good-morning."
6393: 
6394: "Good-morning," said Mr. Lyon, feeling, while the door closed behind his
6395: guest, that mixture of uneasiness and relief which all procrastination
6396: of difficulty produces in minds capable of strong forecast. The work
6397: was still to be done. He had still before him the task of learning
6398: everything that could be learned about this man's relation to himself
6399: and Esther.
6400: 
6401: Christian, as he made his way back along Malthouse Lane, was thinking,
6402: "This old fellow has got some secret in his head. It's not likely he can
6403: know anything about me: it must be about Bycliffe. But Bycliffe was a
6404: gentleman: how should he ever have had anything to do with such a seedy
6405: old ranter as that?"
6406: 
6407: 
6408: 
6409: 
6410: CHAPTER XV.
6411: 
6412:     And doubt shall be as lead upon the feet
6413:     Of thy most anxious will.
6414: 
6415: 
6416: Mr. Lyon was careful to look in at Felix as soon as possible after
6417: Christian's departure, to tell him that his trust was discharged. During
6418: the rest of the day he was somewhat relieved from agitating reflections
6419: by the necessity of attending to his ministerial duties, the rebuke of
6420: rebellious singers being one of them; and on his return from the Monday
6421: evening prayer-meeting he was so overcome with weariness that he went to
6422: bed without taking note of any objects in his study. But when he rose
6423: the next morning, his mind, once more eagerly active, was arrested by
6424: Philip Debarry's letter, which still lay open on his desk, and was
6425: arrested by precisely that portion which had been unheeded the day
6426: before:--"_I shall consider myself doubly fortunate if at any time you
6427: can point out to me some method by which I may procure you as lively a
6428: satisfaction as I am now feeling, in that full and speedy relief from
6429: anxiety which I owe to your considerate conduct_."
6430: 
6431: To understand how these words could carry the suggestion they actually
6432: had for the minister in a crisis of peculiar personal anxiety and
6433: struggle, we must bear in mind that for many years he had walked through
6434: life with the sense of having for a space been unfaithful to what he
6435: esteemed the highest trust ever committed to man--the ministerial
6436: vocation. In a mind of any nobleness, a lapse into transgression against
6437: an object still regarded as supreme, issues in a new and purer
6438: devotedness, chastised by humility and watched over by a passionate
6439: regret. So it was with that ardent spirit which animated the little body
6440: of Rufus Lyon. Once in his life he had been blinded, defeated, hurried
6441: along by rebellious impulse; he had gone astray after his own desires,
6442: and had let the fire die out on the altar; and as the true penitent,
6443: hating his self-besotted error, asks from all coming life duty instead
6444: of joy, and service instead of ease, so Rufus was perpetually on the
6445: watch lest he should ever again postpone to some private affection a
6446: great public opportunity which to him was equivalent to a command.
6447: 
6448: Now here was an opportunity brought by a combination of that unexpected
6449: incalculable kind which might be regarded as the Divine emphasis
6450: invoking especial attention to trivial events--an opportunity of
6451: securing what Rufus Lyon had often wished for as a means of honoring
6452: truth, and exhibiting error in the character of a stammering, halting,
6453: short-breathed usurper of office and dignity. What was more exasperating
6454: to a zealous preacher, with whom copious speech was not a difficulty but
6455: a relief--who never lacked argument, but only combatants and
6456: listeners--than to reflect that there were thousands on thousands of
6457: pulpits in this kingdom, supplied with handsome sounding-boards, and
6458: occupying an advantageous position in buildings far larger than the
6459: chapel in Malthouse Yard--buildings sure to be places of resort, even as
6460: the markets were, if only from habit and interest; and that these
6461: pulpits were filled, or rather made vacuous, by men whose privileged
6462: education in the ancient centres of instruction issued in twenty
6463: minutes' formal reading of tepid exhortation or probably infirm
6464: deductions from premises based on rotten scaffolding? And it is in the
6465: nature of exasperation gradually to concentrate itself. The sincere
6466: antipathy of a dog toward cats in general, necessarily takes the form of
6467: indignant barking at the neighbor's black cat which makes daily
6468: trespass; the bark at imagined cats, though a frequent exercise of the
6469: canine mind, is yet comparatively feeble. Mr. Lyon's sarcasm was not
6470: without an edge when he dilated in general on an elaborate education for
6471: teachers which issued in the minimum of teaching, but it found a
6472: whetstone in the particular example of that bad system known as the
6473: rector of Treby Magna. There was nothing positive to be said against the
6474: Rev. Augustus Debarry; his life could not be pronounced blameworthy
6475: except for its negatives. And the good Rufus was too pure-minded not to
6476: be glad of that. He had no delight in vice as discrediting wicked
6477: opponents; he shrank from dwelling on the images of cruelty or
6478: grossness, and his indignation was habitually inspired only by those
6479: moral and intellectual mistakes which darken the soul but do not injure
6480: or degrade the temple of the body. If the rector had been a less
6481: respectable man, Rufus would have more reluctantly made him an object
6482: of antagonism; but as an incarnation of soul-destroying error,
6483: dissociated from those baser sins which have no good repute even with
6484: the worldly, it would be an argumentative luxury to get into close
6485: quarters with him, and fight with a dialectic short-sword in the eyes of
6486: the Treby world (sending also a written account thereof to the chief
6487: organs of Dissenting opinion). Vice was essentially stupid--a deaf and
6488: eyeless monster, insusceptible to demonstration: the Spirit might work
6489: on it by unseen ways, and the unstudied sallies of sermons were often as
6490: the arrows which pierced and awakened the brutified conscience; but
6491: illuminated thought, finely divided speech, were the choicer weapons of
6492: the Divine armory, which whoso could wield must be careful not to leave
6493: idle.
6494: 
6495: Here, then, was the longed-for opportunity. Here was an engagement--an
6496: expression of a strong wish--on the part of Philip Debarry, if it were
6497: in his power, to procure a satisfaction to Rufus Lyon. How had that man
6498: of God and exemplary Independent minister, Mr. Ainsworth, of persecuted
6499: sanctity, conducted himself when a similar occasion had befallen him at
6500: Amsterdam? He had thought of nothing but the glory of the highest cause,
6501: and had converted the offer of recompense into a public debate with a
6502: Jew on the chief mysteries of the faith. Here was a model: the case was
6503: nothing short of a heavenly indication, and he, Rufus Lyon, would seize
6504: the occasion to demand a public debate with the rector on the
6505: constitution of the true Church.
6506: 
6507: What if he were inwardly torn by doubt and anxiety concerning his own
6508: private relations and the facts of his past life? That danger of
6509: absorption within the narrow bounds of self only urged him the more
6510: toward action which had a wider bearing, and might tell on the welfare
6511: of England at large. It was decided. Before the minister went down to
6512: breakfast that morning he had written the following letter to Mr. Philip
6513: Debarry:--
6514: 
6515:     SIR,--Referring to your letter of yesterday, I find the following
6516:     words: "I shall consider myself doubly fortunate if at any time you
6517:     can point out to me some method by which I may procure you as
6518:     lively a satisfaction as I am now feeling, in that full and speedy
6519:     relief from anxiety which I owe to your considerate conduct."
6520: 
6521:     I am not unaware, sir, that, in the usage of the world, there are
6522:     words of courtesy (so called) which are understood, by those
6523:     amongst whom they are current, to have no precise meaning, and to
6524:     constitute no bond of obligation. I will not now insist that this
6525:     is an abuse of language, wherein our fallible nature requires the
6526:     strictest safeguards against laxity and misapplication, for I do
6527:     not apprehend that in writing the words I have above quoted, you
6528:     were open to the reproach of using phrases which, while seeming to
6529:     carry a specific meaning, were really no more than what is called a
6530:     polite form. I believe, sir, that you used these words advisedly,
6531:     sincerely, and with an honorable intention of acting on them as a
6532:     pledge, should such action be demanded. No other supposition on my
6533:     part would correspond to the character you bear as a young man who
6534:     aspires (albeit mistakenly) to engraft the finest fruits of public
6535:     virtue on a creed and institutions, whereof the sap is composed
6536:     rather of human self-seeking than of everlasting truth.
6537: 
6538:     Wherefore I act on this my belief in the integrity of your written
6539:     word; I beg you to procure for me (as it is doubtless in your
6540:     power) that I may be allowed a public discussion with your near
6541:     relative, the rector of this parish, the Reverend Augustus Debarry,
6542:     to be held in the large room of the Free School, or in the Assembly
6543:     Room of the Marquis of Granby, these being the largest covered
6544:     spaces at our command. For I presume he would neither allow me to
6545:     speak within his church, nor would consent himself to speak within
6546:     my chapel; and the probable inclemency of the approaching season
6547:     forbids an assured expectation that we could discourse in the open
6548:     air. The subjects I desire to discuss are--first, the Constitution
6549:     of the true Church; and secondly, the bearing thereupon of the
6550:     English Reformation. Confidently expecting that you will comply
6551:     with this request, which is the sequence of your expressed desire,
6552:     I remain, sir, yours, with the respect offered to a sincere
6553:     withstander,
6554:                                                      RUFUS LYON,
6555:     Malthouse Yard.
6556: 
6557: After writing this letter, the good Rufus felt that serenity and
6558: elevation of mind which is infallibly brought by a preoccupation with
6559: the wider relations of things. Already he was beginning to sketch the
6560: course his argument might most judiciously take in the coming debate;
6561: his thoughts were running into sentences, and marking off careful
6562: exceptions in parentheses; and he had come down and seated himself at
6563: the breakfast-table quite automatically, without expectation of toast or
6564: coffee, when Esther's voice and touch recalled to him an inward debate
6565: of another kind, in which he felt himself much weaker. Again there arose
6566: before him the image of that cool, hard-eyed, worldly man, who might be
6567: this dear child's father, and one against whose rights he had himself
6568: grievously offended. Always as the image recurred to him Mr. Lyon's
6569: heart sent forth a prayer for guidance, but no definite guidance had yet
6570: made itself visible for him. It could not be guidance--it was a
6571: temptation--that said, "Let the matter rest: seek to know no more; know
6572: only what is thrust upon you." The remembrance that in his time of
6573: wandering he had wilfully remained in ignorance of facts which he might
6574: have enquired after, deepened the impression that it was now an
6575: imperative duty to seek the fullest attainable knowledge. And the
6576: enquiry might possibly issue in a blessed repose, by putting a negative
6577: on all his suspicions. But the more vividly all the circumstances became
6578: present to him, the more unfit he felt himself to set about any
6579: investigation concerning this man who called himself Maurice Christian.
6580: He could seek no confidant or helper among "the brethren"; he was
6581: obliged to admit to himself that the members of his church, with whom he
6582: hoped to go to heaven, were not easy to converse with on earth touching
6583: the deeper secrets of his experience, and were still less able to advise
6584: him as to the wisest procedure in a case of high delicacy, with a
6585: worldling who had a carefully-trimmed whisker and a fashionable costume.
6586: For the first time in his life it occurred to the minister that he
6587: should be glad of an adviser who had more worldly than spiritual
6588: experience, and that it might not be inconsistent with his principles to
6589: seek some light from one who had studied human law. But it was a thought
6590: to be paused upon, and not followed out rashly; some other guidance
6591: might intervene.
6592: 
6593: Esther noticed that her father was in a fit of abstraction, that he
6594: seemed to swallow his coffee and toast quite unconsciously, and that he
6595: vented from time to time a low guttural interjection, which was habitual
6596: with him when he was absorbed by an inward discussion. She did not
6597: disturb him by remarks, and only wondered whether anything unusual had
6598: occurred on Sunday evening. But at last she thought it needful to say,
6599: "You recollect what I told you yesterday, father?"
6600: 
6601: "Nay, child; what?" said Mr. Lyon, rousing himself.
6602: 
6603: "That Mr. Jermyn asked me if you would probably be at home this morning
6604: before one o'clock."
6605: 
6606: Esther was surprised to see her father start and change color as if he
6607: had been shaken by some sudden collision before he answered--
6608: 
6609: "Assuredly; I do not intend to move from my study after I have once been
6610: out to hand this letter to Zachary."
6611: 
6612: "Shall I tell Lyddy to take him up at once to your study if he comes? If
6613: not, I shall have to stay in my own room, because I shall be at home all
6614: this morning, and it is rather cold now to sit without a fire."
6615: 
6616: "Yes, my dear, let him come up to me; unless, indeed, he should bring a
6617: second person, which might happen, seeing that in all likelihood he is
6618: coming, as hitherto, on electioneering business. And I could not well
6619: accommodate two visitors up-stairs."
6620: 
6621: When Mr. Lyon went out to Zachary, the pew-opener, to give him a second
6622: time the commission of carrying a letter to Treby Manor, Esther gave her
6623: injunction to Lyddy that if one gentleman came he was to be shown
6624: up-stairs--if two, they were to be shown into the parlor. But she had to
6625: resolve several questions before Lyddy clearly saw what was before
6626: her--as that, "if it was the gentleman as came on Thursday in the
6627: pepper-and-salt coat, was he to be shown up-stairs? And the gentleman
6628: from the Manor yesterday as went out whistling--had Miss Esther heard
6629: about him? There seemed no end of these great folks coming to Malthouse
6630: Yard since there was talk of the election; but they might be poor lost
6631: creatures the most of 'em." Whereupon Lyddy shook her head and groaned,
6632: under an edifying despair as to the future lot of gentlemen callers.
6633: 
6634: Esther always avoided asking questions of Lyddy, who found an answer as
6635: she found a key, by pouring out a pocketful of miscellanies. But she had
6636: remarked so many indications that something had happened to cause her
6637: father unusual excitement and mental preoccupation, that she could not
6638: help connecting with them the fact of this visit from the Manor, which
6639: he had not mentioned to her.
6640: 
6641: She sat down in the dull parlor and took up her netting; for since
6642: Sunday she had felt unable to read when she was alone, being obliged, in
6643: spite of herself, to think of Felix Holt--to imagine what he would like
6644: her to be, and what sort of views he took of life so as to make it seem
6645: valuable in the absence of all elegance, luxury, gayety, or romance. Had
6646: he yet reflected that he had behaved very rudely to her on Sunday?
6647: Perhaps not. Perhaps he had dismissed her from his mind with contempt.
6648: And at that thought Esther's eyes smarted unpleasantly. She was fond of
6649: netting, because it showed to advantage both her hand and her foot; and
6650: across this image of Felix Holt's indifference and contempt there passed
6651: the vaguer image of a possible somebody who would admire her hands and
6652: feet, and delight in looking at their beauty, and long, yet not dare, to
6653: kiss them. Life would be much easier in the presence of such a love. But
6654: it was precisely this longing after her own satisfaction that Felix had
6655: reproached her with. Did he want her to be heroic? That seemed
6656: impossible without some great occasion. Her life was a heap of
6657: fragments, and so were her thoughts: some great energy was needed to
6658: bind them together. Esther was beginning to lose her complacency at her
6659: own wit and criticism; to lose the sense of superiority in an awakening
6660: need of reliance on one whose vision was wider, whose nature was purer
6661: and stronger than her own. But then, she said to herself, that "one"
6662: must be tender to her, not rude and predominating in his manners. A man
6663: with any chivalry in him could never adopt a scolding tone toward a
6664: woman--that is, toward a charming woman. But Felix had no chivalry in
6665: him. He loved lecturing and opinion too well ever to love any woman.
6666: 
6667: In this way Esther strove to see that Felix was thoroughly in the
6668: wrong--at least, if he did not come again expressly to show that he was
6669: sorry.
6670: 
6671: 
6672: 
6673: 
6674: CHAPTER XVI.
6675: 
6676:     _Trueblue._ These men have no votes. Why should I court them?
6677: 
6678:     _Grayfox._ No votes, but power.
6679: 
6680:     _Trueblue._ What! over charities?
6681: 
6682:     _Grayfox._ No, over brains: which disturbs the canvass. In a
6683:     natural state of things the average price of a vote at Paddlebrook
6684:     is nine-and-sixpence, throwing the fifty pound tenants, who cost
6685:     nothing, into the divisor. But these talking men cause an
6686:     artificial rise of prices.
6687: 
6688: 
6689: The expected important knock at the door came about twelve o'clock, and
6690: Esther could hear that there were two visitors. Immediately the parlor
6691: door was opened and the shaggy-haired, cravatless image of Felix Holt,
6692: which was just then full in the mirror of Esther's mind, was displaced
6693: by the highly-contrasted appearance of a personage whose name she
6694: guessed before Mr. Jermyn had announced it. The perfect morning costume
6695: of that day differed much from our present ideal: it was essential that
6696: a gentleman's chin should be well propped, that his collar should have a
6697: voluminous roll, that his waistcoat should imply much discrimination,
6698: and that his buttons should be arranged in a manner which would now
6699: expose him to general contempt. And it must not be forgotten that at the
6700: distant period when Treby Magna first knew the excitements of an
6701: election, there existed many other anomalies now obsolete, besides
6702: short-waisted coats and broad stiffeners.
6703: 
6704: But we have some notions of beauty and fitness which withstand the
6705: centuries; and quite irrespective of dates, it would be pronounced that
6706: at the age of thirty-four Harold Transome was a striking and handsome
6707: man. He was one of those people, as Denner remarked, to whose presence
6708: in the room you could not be indifferent; if you do not hate or dread
6709: them, you must find the touch of their hands, nay, their very shadows,
6710: agreeable.
6711: 
6712: Esther felt a pleasure quite new to her as she saw his finely-embrowned
6713: face and full bright eyes turned toward her with an air of deference by
6714: which gallantry must commend itself to a refined woman who is not
6715: absolutely free from vanity. Harold Transome regarded women as slight
6716: things, but he was fond of slight things in the intervals of business;
6717: and he held it among the chief arts of life to keep these pleasant
6718: diversions within such bounds that they should never interfere with the
6719: course of his serious ambition. Esther was perfectly aware, as he took a
6720: chair near her, that he was under some admiring surprise at her
6721: appearance and manner. How could it be otherwise? She believed that in
6722: the eyes of a well-bred man no young lady in Treby could equal her: she
6723: felt a glow of delight at the sense that she was being looked at.
6724: 
6725: "My father expected you," she said to Mr. Jermyn. "I delivered your
6726: letter to him yesterday. He will be down immediately."
6727: 
6728: She disentangled her foot from her netting and wound it up.
6729: 
6730: "I hope you are not going to let us disturb you," said Harold, noticing
6731: her action. "We come to discuss election affairs, and we particularly
6732: desire to interest the ladies."
6733: 
6734: "I have no interest with any one who is not already on the right side,"
6735: said Esther smiling.
6736: 
6737: "I am happy to see at least that you wear the Liberal colors."
6738: 
6739: "I fear I must confess that it is more from love of blue than from love
6740: of Liberalism. Yellow opinions could only have brunettes on their side."
6741: Esther spoke with her usual pretty fluency, but she had no sooner
6742: uttered the words than she thought how angry they would have made Felix.
6743: 
6744: "If my cause is to be recommended by the becomingness of my colors, then
6745: I am sure you are acting in my interest by wearing them."
6746: 
6747: Esther rose to leave the room.
6748: 
6749: "Must you really go?" said Harold, preparing to open the door for her.
6750: 
6751: "Yes, I have an engagement--a lesson at half past twelve," said Esther,
6752: bowing and floating out like a blue-robed Naïad, but not without a
6753: suffused blush as she passed through the doorway.
6754: 
6755: It was a pity the room was so small, Harold Transome thought: this girl
6756: ought to walk in a house where there were halls and corridors. But he
6757: had soon dismissed this chance preoccupation with Esther; for before the
6758: door was closed again Mr. Lyon had entered, and Harold was entirely bent
6759: on what had been the object of his visit. The minister, though no
6760: elector himself, had considerable influence over Liberal electors, and
6761: it was the part of wisdom in a candidate to cement all political
6762: adhesion by a little personal regard, if possible. Garstin was a harsh
6763: and wiry fellow; he seemed to suggest that sour whey, which some say was
6764: the original meaning of Whig in the Scottish, and it might suggest the
6765: theoretic advantages of Radicalism if it could be associated with a more
6766: generous presence. What would conciliate the personal regard of old Mr.
6767: Lyon became a curious problem to Harold, now the little man made his
6768: appearance. But canvassing makes a gentleman acquainted with many
6769: strange animals; together with the ways of catching and taming them; and
6770: thus the knowledge of natural history advances amongst the aristocracy
6771: and wealthy commoners of our land.
6772: 
6773: "I am very glad to have secured this opportunity of making your personal
6774: acquaintance, Mr. Lyon," said Harold, putting out his hand to the
6775: minister when Jermyn had mentioned his name. "I am to address the
6776: electors here, in the Market-Place, to-morrow; and I should have been
6777: sorry to do so without first paying my respects privately to my chief
6778: friends, as there may be points on which they particularly wish me to
6779: explain myself."
6780: 
6781: "You speak civilly, sir, and reasonably," said Mr. Lyon, with a vague
6782: short-sighted gaze, in which a candidate's appearance evidently went for
6783: nothing. "Pray be seated, gentlemen. It is my habit to stand."
6784: 
6785: He placed himself at a right angle with his visitors, his worn look of
6786: intellectual eagerness, slight frame, and rusty attire, making an odd
6787: contrast with their flourishing persons, unblemished costume, and
6788: comfortable freedom from excitement. The group was fairly typical of the
6789: difference between the men who are animated by ideas and the men who are
6790: expected to apply them. Then he drew forth his spectacles, and began to
6791: rub them with the thin end of his coat tail. He was inwardly exercising
6792: great self-mastery--suppressing the thought of his personal needs, which
6793: Jermyn's presence tended to suggest, in order that he might be equal to
6794: the larger duties of this occasion.
6795: 
6796: "I am aware--Mr. Jermyn has told me," said Harold, "what good service
6797: you have done me already, Mr. Lyon. The fact is, a man of intellect like
6798: you was especially needed in my case. The race I am running is really
6799: against Garstin only, who calls himself a Liberal, though he cares for
6800: nothing, and understands nothing, except the interests of the wealthy
6801: traders. And you have been able to explain the difference between
6802: Liberal and Liberal, which, as you and I know, is something like the
6803: difference between fish and fish."
6804: 
6805: "Your comparison is not unapt, sir," said Mr. Lyon, still holding his
6806: spectacles in his hand, "at this epoch, when the mind of the nation has
6807: been strained on the passing of one measure. Where a great weight has to
6808: be moved, we require not so much selected instruments as abundant
6809: horse-power. But it is an unavoidable evil of these massive achievements
6810: that they encourage a coarse undiscriminatingness obstructive of more
6811: nicely-wrought results, and an exaggerated expectation inconsistent with
6812: the intricacies of our fallen and struggling condition. I say not that
6813: compromise is unnecessary, but it is an evil attendant on our
6814: imperfection; and I would pray every one to mark that, where compromise
6815: broadens, intellect and conscience are thrust into narrower room.
6816: Wherefore it has been my object to show our people that there are many
6817: who have helped to draw the car of Reform, whose ends are but partial,
6818: and who forsake not the ungodly principle of selfish alliances, but
6819: would only substitute Syria for Egypt--thinking chiefly of their own
6820: share in peacocks, gold and ivory."
6821: 
6822: "Just so," said Harold, who was quick at new languages, and still
6823: quicker at translating other men's generalities into his own special and
6824: immediate purposes, "men who will be satisfied if they can only bring in
6825: a plutocracy, buy up the land, and stick the old crests on their new
6826: gateways. Now the practical point to secure against these false Liberals
6827: at present is, that our electors should not divide their votes. As it
6828: appears that many who vote for Debarry are likely to split their votes
6829: in favor of Garstin, it is of the first consequence that my voters
6830: should give me plumpers. If they divide their votes they can't keep out
6831: Debarry, and they may help to keep out me. I feel some confidence in
6832: asking you to use your influence in this direction, Mr. Lyon. We
6833: candidates have to praise ourselves more than is graceful; but you are
6834: aware that, while I belong by my birth to the classes that have their
6835: roots in tradition and all the old loyalties, my experience has lain
6836: chiefly among those who make their own career, and depend on the new
6837: rather than the old. I have had the advantage of considering the
6838: national welfare under varied lights: I have wider views than those of a
6839: mere cotton lord. On questions connected with religious liberty I would
6840: stop short at no measure that was not thorough."
6841: 
6842: "I hope not, sir--I hope not," said Mr. Lyon, gravely; finally putting
6843: on his spectacles and examining the face of the candidate, whom he was
6844: preparing to turn into a catechumen. For the good Rufus, conscious of
6845: his political importance as an organ of persuasion, felt it his duty to
6846: catechise a little, and also to do his part toward impressing a probable
6847: legislator with a sense of his responsibility. But the latter branch of
6848: duty somewhat obstructed the catechising, for his mind was so urged by
6849: considerations which he held in danger of being overlooked, that the
6850: questions and answers bore a very slender proportion to his exposition.
6851: It was impossible to leave the question of church-rates without noting
6852: the grounds of their injustice, and without a brief enumeration of
6853: reasons why Mr. Lyon, for his own part, would not present that passive
6854: resistance to a legal imposition which had been adopted by the Friends
6855: (whose heroism in this regard was nevertheless worthy of all honor).
6856: 
6857: Comprehensive talkers are apt to be tiresome when we are not athirst for
6858: information, but, to be quite fair, we must admit that superior
6859: reticence is a good deal due to the lack of matter. Speech is often
6860: barren; but silence also does not necessarily brood over a full nest.
6861: Your still fowl, blinking at you without remark, may all the while be
6862: sitting on one addled nest-egg; and when it takes to cackling, will have
6863: nothing to announce but that addled delusion.
6864: 
6865: Harold Transome was not at all a patient man, but in matters of business
6866: he was quite awake to his cue, and in this case it was perhaps easier to
6867: listen than to answer questions. But Jermyn, who had plenty of work on
6868: his hands, took an opportunity of rising, and saying, as he looked at
6869: his watch--
6870: 
6871: "I must really be at the office in five minutes. You will find me there,
6872: Mr. Transome; you have probably still many things to say to Mr. Lyon."
6873: 
6874: "I beseech you, sir," said the minister, changing color, and by a quick
6875: movement laying his hand on Jermyn's arm--"I beseech you to favor me
6876: with an interview on some private business--this evening, if it were
6877: possible."
6878: 
6879: Mr. Lyon, like others who are habitually occupied with impersonal
6880: subjects, was liable to this impulsive sort of action. He snatched at
6881: the details of life as if they were darting past him--as if they were
6882: like the ribbons at his knees, which would never be tied all day if they
6883: were not tied on the instant. Through these spasmodic leaps out of his
6884: abstractions into real life, it constantly happened that he suddenly
6885: took a course which had been the subject of too much doubt with him ever
6886: to have been determined on by continuous thought. And if Jermyn had not
6887: startled him by threatening to vanish just when he was plunged in
6888: politics, he might never have made up his mind to confide in a worldly
6889: attorney.
6890: 
6891: ("An odd man," as Mrs. Muscat observed, "to have such a gift in the
6892: pulpit. But there's One knows better than we do----" which, in a lady
6893: who rarely felt her judgment at a loss, was a concession that showed
6894: much piety.)
6895: 
6896: Jermyn was surprised at the little man's eagerness. "By all means," he
6897: answered, quite cordially. "Could you come to my office at eight
6898: o'clock?"
6899: 
6900: "For several reasons, I must beg you to come to me."
6901: 
6902: "Oh, very good. I'll walk out and see you this evening, if possible. I
6903: shall have much pleasure in being of any use to you." Jermyn felt that
6904: in the eyes of Harold he was appearing all the more valuable when his
6905: services were thus in request. He went out, and Mr. Lyon easily relapsed
6906: into politics, for he had been on the brink of a favorite subject on
6907: which he was at issue with his fellow-Liberals.
6908: 
6909: At that time, when faith in the efficacy of political change was at
6910: fever-heat in ardent Reformers, many measures which men are still
6911: discussing with little confidence on either side, were then talked about
6912: and disposed of like property in near reversion. Crying abuses--"bloated
6913: paupers," "bloated pluralists," and other corruptions hindering men from
6914: being wise and happy--had to be fought against and slain. Such a time is
6915: a time of hope. Afterward when the corpses of those monsters have been
6916: held up to the public wonder and abhorrence, and yet wisdom and
6917: happiness do not follow, but rather a more abundant breeding of the
6918: foolish and unhappy, comes a time of doubt and despondency. But in the
6919: great Reform-year Hope was mighty: the prospect of Reform had even
6920: served the voters instead of drink; and in one place, at least, there
6921: had been "a dry election." And now the speakers at Reform banquets were
6922: exuberant in congratulation and promise: Liberal clergymen of the
6923: Establishment toasted Liberal Catholic clergymen without any allusion to
6924: scarlet, and Catholic clergymen replied with a like tender reserve.
6925: Some dwelt on the abolition of all abuses, and on millennial blessedness
6926: generally; others, whose imaginations were less suffused with
6927: exhalations of the dawn insisted chiefly on the ballot-box.
6928: 
6929: Now on this question of the ballot the minister strongly took the
6930: negative side. Our pet opinions are usually those which place us in a
6931: minority of a minority amongst our own party:--very happily, else those
6932: poor opinions, born with no silver spoon in their mouths--how would they
6933: get nourished and fed? So it was with Mr. Lyon and his objection to the
6934: ballot. But he had thrown out a remark on the subject which was not
6935: quite clear to his hearer, who interpreted it according to his best
6936: calculation of probabilities.
6937: 
6938: "I have no objection to the ballot," said Harold, "but I think that is
6939: not the sort of thing we have to work at just now. We shouldn't get it.
6940: And other questions are imminent."
6941: 
6942: "Then, sir, you would vote for the ballot?" said Mr. Lyon, stroking his
6943: chin.
6944: 
6945: "Certainly, if the point came up. I have too much respect for the
6946: freedom of the voter to oppose anything which offers a chance of making
6947: that freedom more complete."
6948: 
6949: Mr. Lyon looked at the speaker with a pitying smile and a subdued
6950: "h'm--m--m," which Harold took for a sign of satisfaction. He was soon
6951: undeceived.
6952: 
6953: "You grieve me, sir; you grieve me much. And I pray you to reconsider
6954: this question, for it will take you to the root, as I think, of
6955: political morality. I engage to show to any impartial mind, duly
6956: furnished with the principles of public and private rectitude, that the
6957: ballot would be pernicious, and that if it were not pernicious, it would
6958: still be futile. I will show, first, that it would be futile as a
6959: preservative from bribery and illegitimate influence; and, secondly,
6960: that it would be in the worst kind pernicious, as shutting the door
6961: against those influences whereby the soul of a man and the character of
6962: a citizen are duly educated for their great functions. Be not alarmed if
6963: I detain you, sir. It is well worth the while."
6964: 
6965: "Confound this old man," thought Harold. "I'll never make a canvassing
6966: call on a preacher again, unless he has lost his voice from a cold." He
6967: was going to excuse himself as prudently as he could, by deferring the
6968: subject till the morrow, and inviting Mr. Lyon to come to him in the
6969: committee-room before the time appointed for his public speech; but he
6970: was relieved by the opening of the door. Lyddy put in her head to say--
6971: 
6972: "If you please, sir, here's Mr. Holt wants to know if he may come in and
6973: speak to the gentleman. He begs your pardon, but you're to say 'no' if
6974: you don't like him to come."
6975: 
6976: "Nay, show him in at once, Lyddy. A young man," Mr. Lyon went on,
6977: speaking to Harold, "whom a representative ought to know--no voter, but
6978: a man of ideas and study."
6979: 
6980: "He is thoroughly welcome," said Harold, truthfully enough, though he
6981: felt little interest in the voteless man of ideas except as a diversion
6982: from the subject of the ballot. He had been standing for the last minute
6983: or two, feeling less of a victim in that attitude, and more able to
6984: calculate on means of escape.
6985: 
6986: "Mr. Holt, sir," said the minister, as Felix entered, "is a young friend
6987: of mine, whose opinions on some points I hope to see altered, but who
6988: has a zeal for public justice which I trust he will never lose."
6989: 
6990: "I am glad to see Mr. Holt," said Harold, bowing. He perceived from the
6991: way in which Felix bowed to him and turned to the most distant spot in
6992: the room, that the candidate's shake of the hand would not be welcome
6993: here. "A formidable fellow," he thought, "capable of mounting a cart in
6994: the market-place to-morrow and cross-examining me, if I say anything
6995: that doesn't please him."
6996: 
6997: "Mr. Lyon," said Felix, "I have taken a liberty with you in asking to
6998: see Mr. Transome when he is engaged with you. But I have to speak to him
6999: on a matter which I shouldn't care to make public at present, and it is
7000: one on which I am sure you will back me. I heard that Mr. Transome was
7001: here, so I ventured to come. I hope you will both excuse me, as my
7002: business refers to some electioneering measures which are being taken by
7003: Mr. Transome's agents."
7004: 
7005: "Pray go on," said Harold, expecting something unpleasant.
7006: 
7007: "I'm not going to speak against treating voters," said Felix; "I suppose
7008: buttered ale, and grease of that sort to make the wheels go, belong to
7009: the necessary humbug of representation. But I wish to ask you, Mr.
7010: Transome, whether it is with your knowledge that agents of yours are
7011: bribing rough fellows who are no voters--the colliers and navvies at
7012: Sproxton--with the chance of extra drunkenness, that they may make a
7013: posse on your side at the nomination and polling?"
7014: 
7015: "Certainly not," said Harold. "You are aware, my dear sir, that a
7016: candidate is very much at the mercy of his agents as to the means by
7017: which he is returned, especially when many years' absence has made him a
7018: stranger to the men actually conducting business. But are you sure of
7019: your facts?"
7020: 
7021: "As sure as my senses can make me," said Felix, who then briefly
7022: described what had happened on Sunday. "I believed that you were
7023: ignorant of all this, Mr. Transome," he ended, "and that was why I
7024: thought some good might be done by speaking to you. If not, I should be
7025: tempted to expose the whole affair as a disgrace to the Radical party.
7026: I'm a Radical myself, and mean to work all my life long against
7027: privilege, monopoly, and oppression. But I would rather be a
7028: livery-servant proud of my master's title, than I would seem to make
7029: common cause with scoundrels who turn the best hopes of men into
7030: by-words for cant and dishonesty."
7031: 
7032: "Your energetic protest is needless here, sir," said Harold, offended at
7033: what sounded like a threat, and was certainly premature enough to be in
7034: bad taste. In fact, this error of behavior in Felix proceeded from a
7035: repulsion which was mutual. It was a constant source of irritation to
7036: him that the public men on his side were, on the whole, not
7037: conspicuously better than the public men on the other side; that the
7038: spirit of innovation, which with him was a part of religion, was in many
7039: of its mouthpieces no more of a religion than the faith in rotten
7040: boroughs; and he was thus predisposed to distrust Harold Transome.
7041: Harold, in his turn, disliked impracticable notions of loftiness and
7042: purity--disliked all enthusiasm; and he thought he saw a very
7043: troublesome, vigorous incorporation of that nonsense in Felix. But it
7044: would be foolish to exasperate him in any way.
7045: 
7046: "If you choose to accompany me to Jermyn's office," he went on, "the
7047: matter shall be enquired into in your presence. I think you will agree
7048: with me, Mr. Lyon, that this will be the most satisfactory course."
7049: 
7050: "Doubtless," said the minister, who liked the candidate very well, and
7051: believed that he would be amenable to argument; "and I would caution my
7052: young friend against a too great hastiness of words and action. David's
7053: cause against Saul was a righteous one; nevertheless not all who clave
7054: unto David were righteous men."
7055: 
7056: "The more was the pity, sir," said Felix. "Especially if he winked at
7057: their malpractices."
7058: 
7059: Mr. Lyon smiled, shook his head, and stroked his favorite's arm
7060: deprecatingly.
7061: 
7062: "It is rather too much for any man to keep the consciences of all his
7063: party," said Harold. "If you had lived in the East, as I have, you would
7064: be more tolerant, for example, of an active industrious selfishness,
7065: such as we have here, though it may not always be quite scrupulous: you
7066: would see how much better it is than an idle selfishness. I have heard
7067: it said, a bridge is a good thing--worth helping to make, though half
7068: the men who worked at it were rogues."
7069: 
7070: "Oh, yes!" said Felix, scornfully, "give me a handful of generalities
7071: and analogies, and I'll undertake to justify Burke and Hare, and prove
7072: them benefactors of their species. I'll tolerate no nuisances but such
7073: as I can't help; and the question now is, not whether we can do away
7074: with all the nuisances in the world, but with a particular nuisance
7075: under our noses."
7076: 
7077: "Then we had better cut the matter short, as I propose, by going at once
7078: to Jermyn's," said Harold. "In that case, I must bid you good-morning,
7079: Mr. Lyon."
7080: 
7081: "I would fain," said the minister, looking uneasy--"I would fain have
7082: had a further opportunity of considering that question of the ballot
7083: with you. The reasons against it need not be urged lengthily; they only
7084: require complete enumeration to prevent any seeming hiatus, where an
7085: opposing fallacy might thrust itself in."
7086: 
7087: "Never fear, sir," said Harold, shaking Mr. Lyon's hand cordially,
7088: "there will be opportunities. Shall I not see you in the committee-room
7089: to-morrow?"
7090: 
7091: "I think not," said Mr. Lyon, rubbing his brow, with a sad remembrance
7092: of his personal anxieties. "But I will send you, if you will permit me,
7093: a brief writing, on which you can meditate at your leisure."
7094: 
7095: "I shall be delighted. Good-bye."
7096: 
7097: Harold and Felix went out together; and the minister, going up to his
7098: dull study, asked himself whether, under the pressure of conflicting
7099: experience, he had faithfully discharged the duties of the past
7100: interview?
7101: 
7102: If a cynical sprite were present, riding on one of the motes in that
7103: dusty room, he may have made himself merry at the illusions of the
7104: little minister who brought so much conscience to bear on the production
7105: of so slight an effect. I confess to smiling myself, being sceptical as
7106: to the effect of ardent appeals and nice distinctions on gentlemen who
7107: are got up, both inside and out, as candidates in the style of the
7108: period; but I never smiled at Mr. Lyon's trustful energy without falling
7109: to penitence and veneration immediately after. For what we call
7110: illusions are often, in truth, a wider vision of past and recent
7111: realities--a willing movement of a man's soul with the larger sweep of
7112: the world's forces--a movement toward a more assured end than the
7113: chances of a single life. We see human heroism broken into units and
7114: say, this unit did little--might as well not have been. But in this way
7115: we might break up a great army into units; in this way we might break
7116: the sunlight into fragments, and think that this and the other might be
7117: cheaply parted with. Let us rather raise a monument to the soldiers
7118: whose brave hearts only kept the ranks unbroken and met death--a
7119: monument to the faithful who were not famous, and who are precious as
7120: the continuity of the sunbeams is precious, though some of them fall
7121: unseen and on barrenness.
7122: 
7123: At present, looking back on that day at Treby, it seem to me that the
7124: sadder illusion lay with Harold Transome, who was trusting in his own
7125: skill to shape the success of his own morrows, ignorant of what many
7126: yesterdays had determined for him beforehand.
7127: 
7128: 
7129: 
7130: 
7131: CHAPTER XVII.
7132: 
7133:     It is a good and soothfast saw;
7134:     Half-roasted never will be raw;
7135:     No dough is dried once more to meal,
7136:     No crock new-shapen by the wheel;
7137:     You can't turn curds to milk again,
7138:     Nor Now, by wishing, back to Then;
7139:     And having tasted stolen honey,
7140:     You can't buy innocence for money.
7141: 
7142: 
7143: Jermyn was not particularly pleased that some chance had apparently
7144: hindered Harold Transome from making other canvassing visits immediately
7145: after leaving Mr. Lyon, and so had sent him back to the office earlier
7146: than he had been expected to come. The inconvenient chance he guessed at
7147: once to be represented by Felix Holt, whom he knew very well by Trebian
7148: report to be a young man with so little of the ordinary Christian
7149: motives as to making an appearance and getting on in the world, that he
7150: presented no handle to any judicious and respectable person who might be
7151: willing to make use of him.
7152: 
7153: Harold Transome, on his side, was a great deal annoyed at being worried
7154: by Felix in an enquiry about electioneering details. The real dignity
7155: and honesty there was in him made him shrink from this necessity of
7156: satisfying a man with a troublesome tongue; it was as if he were to show
7157: indignation at the discovery of one barrel with a false bottom, when he
7158: had invested his money in a manufactory where a larger or smaller
7159: number of such barrels had always been made. A practical man must seek a
7160: good end by the only possible means; that is to say, if he is to get
7161: into Parliament he must not be too particular. It was not disgraceful to
7162: be neither a Quixote nor a theorist, aiming to correct the moral rules
7163: of the world: but whatever actually was, or might prove to be,
7164: disgraceful, Harold held in detestation. In this mood he pushed on
7165: unceremoniously to the inner office without waiting to ask questions;
7166: and when he perceived that Jermyn was not alone he said, with haughty
7167: quickness--
7168: 
7169: "A question about the electioneering at Sproxton. Can you give your
7170: attention to it at once? Here is Mr. Holt, who has come to me about the
7171: business."
7172: 
7173: "A--yes--a--certainly," said Jermyn, who, as usual, was the more cool
7174: and deliberate because he was vexed. He was standing, and, as he turned
7175: round, his broad figure concealed the person who was seated writing at
7176: the bureau. "Mr. Holt--a--will doubtless--a--make a point of saving a
7177: busy man's time. You can speak at once. This gentleman"--here Jermyn
7178: made a slight backward movement of the head--"is one of ourselves; he is
7179: a true-blue."
7180: 
7181: "I have simply to complain," said Felix, "that one of your agents has
7182: been sent on a bribing expedition to Sproxton--with what purpose you,
7183: sir, may know better than I do. Mr. Transome, it appears, was ignorant
7184: of the affair, and does not approve it."
7185: 
7186: Jermyn, looking gravely and steadily at Felix while he was speaking, at
7187: the same time drew forth a small sheaf of papers from his side pocket,
7188: and then, as he turned his eyes slowly on Harold, felt in his
7189: waistcoat-pocket for his pencil-case.
7190: 
7191: "I don't approve of it at all," said Harold, who hated Jermyn's
7192: calculated slowness and conceit in his own impenetrability. "Be good
7193: enough to put a stop to it, will you?"
7194: 
7195: "Mr. Holt, I know, is an excellent Liberal," said Jermyn, just inclining
7196: his head to Harold, and then alternately looking at Felix and docketing
7197: his bills; "but he is perhaps too inexperienced to be aware that no
7198: canvass--a--can be conducted without the action of able men, who
7199: must--a--be trusted, and not interfered with. And as to any possibility
7200: of promising to put a stop--a--to any procedure--a--that depends. If he
7201: had ever held the coachman's ribbons in his hands, as I have in my
7202: younger days--a--he would know that stopping is not always easy."
7203: 
7204: "I know very little about holding ribbons," said Felix; "but I saw
7205: clearly enough at once that more mischief had been done than could be
7206: well mended. Though I believe, if it were heartily tried, the treatment
7207: might be reduced and something might be done to hinder the men from
7208: turning out in a body to make a noise, which might end in worse."
7209: 
7210: "They might be hindered from making a noise on our side," said Jermyn,
7211: smiling. "That is perfectly true. But if they made a noise on the
7212: other--would your purpose be answered better, sir?"
7213: 
7214: Harold was moving about in an irritated manner while Felix and Jermyn
7215: were speaking. He preferred leaving the talk to the attorney, of whose
7216: talk he himself liked to keep as clear as possible.
7217: 
7218: "I can only say," answered Felix, "that if you make use of those heavy
7219: fellows when the drink is in them, I shouldn't like your responsibility.
7220: You might as well drive bulls to roar on our side as bribe a set of
7221: colliers and navvies to shout and groan."
7222: 
7223: "A lawyer may well envy your command of language, Mr. Holt," said
7224: Jermyn, pocketing his bills again, and shutting up his pencil; "but he
7225: would not be satisfied with the accuracy--a--of your terms. You must
7226: permit me to check your use of the word 'bribery.' The essence of
7227: bribery is, that it should be legally proved; there is not such a
7228: thing--a--_in rerum natura_--a--as unproved bribery. There has been no
7229: such thing as bribery at Sproxton, I'll answer for it. The presence of a
7230: body of stalwart fellows on--a--the Liberal side will tend to preserve
7231: order; for we know that the benefit clubs from the Pitchley district
7232: will show for Debarry. Indeed, the gentleman who has conducted the
7233: canvass at Sproxton is experienced in Parliamentary affairs, and would
7234: not exceed--a--the necessary measures that a rational judgment would
7235: dictate."
7236: 
7237: "What! you mean the man who calls himself Johnson?" said Felix, in a
7238: tone of disgust.
7239: 
7240: Before Jermyn chose to answer, Harold broke in, saying, quickly and
7241: peremptorily, "The long and short of it is this, Mr. Holt: I shall
7242: desire and insist that whatever can be done by way of remedy shall be
7243: done. Will that satisfy you? You see now some of the candidate's
7244: difficulties?" said Harold, breaking into his most agreeable smile. "I
7245: hope you will have some pity for me."
7246: 
7247: "I suppose I must be content," said Felix, not thoroughly propitiated.
7248: "I bid you good-morning, gentlemen."
7249: 
7250: When he was gone out, and had closed the door behind him, Harold,
7251: turning round and flashing, in spite of himself, an angry look at
7252: Jermyn, said--
7253: 
7254: "And who is Johnson? an _alias_, I suppose. It seems you are fond of the
7255: name."
7256: 
7257: Jermyn turned perceptibly paler, but disagreeables of this sort between
7258: himself and Harold had been too much in his anticipations of late for
7259: him to be taken by surprise. He turned quietly round and just touched
7260: the shoulder of the person seated at the bureau, who now rose.
7261: 
7262: "On the contrary," Jermyn answered, "the Johnson in question is this
7263: gentleman, whom I have the pleasure of introducing to you as one of my
7264: most active helpmates in electioneering business--Mr. Johnson, of
7265: Bedford Row, London. I am comparatively a novice--a--in these matters.
7266: But he was engaged with James Putty in two hardly-contested elections,
7267: and there could scarcely be a better initiation. Putty is one of the
7268: first men of the country as an agent--a--on the Liberal side--a--eh,
7269: Johnson? I think Makepiece is--a--not altogether a match for him, not
7270: quite of the same calibre--a--_haud consimili ingenio_--a--in
7271: tactics--a--and in experience?"
7272: 
7273: "Makepiece is a wonderful man, and so is Putty," said the glib Johnson,
7274: too vain not to be pleased with an opportunity of speaking, even when
7275: the situation was rather awkward. "Makepiece for scheming, but Putty for
7276: management. Putty knows men, sir," he went on, turning to Harold: "it's
7277: a thousand pities that you have not had his talents employed in your
7278: service. He's beyond any man for saving a candidate's money--does half
7279: the work with his tongue. He'll talk of anything, from the Areopagus,
7280: and that sort of thing, down to the joke about 'Where are you going,
7281: Paddy?'--you know what I mean, sir! 'Back again, says Paddy'--an
7282: excellent electioneering joke. Putty understands these things. He has
7283: said to me, 'Johnson, bear in mind there are two ways of speaking an
7284: audience will always like: one is to tell them what they don't
7285: understand; and the other is, to tell them what they're used to.' I
7286: shall never be the man to deny that I owe a great deal to Putty. I
7287: always say it was a most providential thing in the Mugham election last
7288: year that Putty was not on the Tory side. He managed the women; and, if
7289: you'll believe me, sir, one-fourth of the men would never have voted if
7290: their wives hadn't driven them to it for the good of their families. And
7291: as for speaking--it's currently reported in our London circles that
7292: Putty writes regularly for the _Times_. He has that kind of language;
7293: and I needn't tell you, Mr. Transome, that it's the apex, which, I take
7294: it, means the tiptop--and nobody can get higher than that, I think. I've
7295: belonged to a political debating society myself; I've heard a little
7296: language in my time; but when Mr. Jermyn first spoke to me about having
7297: the honor to assist in your canvass of North Loamshire"--here Johnson
7298: played with his watch-seals and balanced himself a moment on his
7299: toes--"the very first thing I said was, 'And there's Garstin has got
7300: Putty! No Whig could stand against a Whig,' I said, 'who had Putty on
7301: his side: I hope Mr. Transome goes in for something of a deeper color.'
7302: I don't say that, as a general rule, opinions go for much in a return,
7303: Mr. Transome; it depends on who are in the field before you, and on the
7304: skill of your agents. But as a Radical, and a moneyed Radical, you are
7305: in a fine position, sir; and with care and judgment--with care and
7306: judgment----"
7307: 
7308: It had been impossible to interrupt Johnson before, without the most
7309: impolitic rudeness. Jermyn was not sorry that he should talk, even if he
7310: made a fool of himself; for in that solid shape, exhibiting the average
7311: amount of human foibles, he seemed less of the _alias_ which Harold had
7312: insinuated him to be, and had all the additional plausibility of a lie
7313: with a circumstance.
7314: 
7315: Harold had thrown himself with contemptuous resignation into a chair,
7316: had drawn off one of his buff gloves, and was looking at his hand. But
7317: when Johnson gave his iteration with a slightly slackened pace, Harold
7318: looked up at him and broke in--
7319: 
7320: "Well then, Mr. Johnson, I shall be glad if you will use your care and
7321: judgment in putting an end, as well as you can, to this Sproxton affair;
7322: else it may turn out an ugly business."
7323: 
7324: "Excuse me, sir; I must beg you to look at the matter a little more
7325: closely. You will see that it is impossible to take a single step
7326: backward at Sproxton. It was a matter of necessity to get the Sproxton
7327: men; else I know to a certainty the other side would have laid hold of
7328: them first, and now I've undermined Garstin's people. They'll use their
7329: authority, and give a little shabby treating, but I've taken all the
7330: wind out of their sails. But if, by your orders, I or Mr. Jermyn here
7331: were to break promise with the honest fellows, and offend Chubb the
7332: publican, what would come of it? Chubb would leave no stone unturned
7333: against you, sir; he would egg on his customers against you; the
7334: colliers and navvies would be at the nomination and the election all the
7335: same, or rather not all the same, for they would be there against us;
7336: and instead of hustling people good-humoredly by way of a joke, and
7337: counterbalancing Debarry's cheers, they'd help to kick the cheering and
7338: voting out of our men, and instead of being, let us say, half-a-dozen
7339: ahead of Garstin, you'd be half-a-dozen behind him, that's all. I speak
7340: plain English to you, Mr. Transome, though I've the highest respect for
7341: you as a gentleman of first-rate talents and position. But, sir, to
7342: judge of these things a man must know the English voter and the English
7343: publican; and it would be a poor tale indeed"--here Mr. Johnson's mouth
7344: took an expression at once bitter and pathetic--"that a gentleman like
7345: you, to say nothing of the good of the country, should have gone to the
7346: expense and trouble of a canvass for nothing but to find himself out of
7347: Parliament at the end of it. I've seen it again and again; it looks bad
7348: in the cleverest man to have to sing small."
7349: 
7350: Mr. Johnson's argument was not the less stringent because his idioms
7351: were vulgar. It requires a conviction and resolution amounting to
7352: heroism not to wince at phrases that class our foreshadowed endurance
7353: among those common and ignominious troubles which the world is more
7354: likely to sneer at than to pity. Harold remained a few minutes in angry
7355: silence looking at the floor, with one hand on his knee and the other on
7356: his hat, as if he were preparing to start up.
7357: 
7358: "As to undoing anything that's been done down there," said Johnson,
7359: throwing in this observation as something into the bargain, "I must wash
7360: my hands of it, sir. I couldn't work knowingly against your interest.
7361: And that young man who is just gone out,--you don't believe that he need
7362: be listened to, I hope? Chubb, the publican, hates him. Chubb would
7363: guess he was at the bottom of your having the treating stopped, and he'd
7364: set half-a-dozen of the colliers to duck him in the canal, or break his
7365: head by mistake. I'm an experienced man, sir. I hope I've put it clear
7366: enough."
7367: 
7368: "Certainly, the exposition befits the subject," said Harold, scornfully,
7369: his dislike of the man Johnson's personality being stimulated by causes
7370: which Jermyn more than conjectured. "It's a damned, unpleasant, ravelled
7371: business that you and Mr. Jermyn have knit up between you. I've no more
7372: to say."
7373: 
7374: "Then, sir, if you've no more commands, I don't wish to intrude. I shall
7375: wish you good-morning, sir," said Johnson, passing out quickly.
7376: 
7377: Harold knew that he was indulging his temper, and he would probably have
7378: restrained it as a foolish move if he had thought there was great danger
7379: in it. But he was beginning to drop much of his caution and self-mastery
7380: where Jermyn was concerned, under the growing conviction that the
7381: attorney had very strong reasons for being afraid of him; reasons which
7382: would only be reinforced by any action hostile to the Transome interest.
7383: As for a sneak like this Johnson, a gentleman had to pay him, not to
7384: please him. Harold had smiles at command in the right place, but he was
7385: not going to smile when it was neither necessary nor agreeable. He was
7386: one of those good-humored, yet energetic men, who have the gift of
7387: anger, hatred, and scorn upon occasion, though they are too healthy and
7388: self-contented for such feelings to get generated in them without
7389: external occasion. And in relation to Jermyn the gift was coming into
7390: fine exercise.
7391: 
7392: "A--pardon me, Mr. Harold," said Jermyn, speaking as soon as Johnson
7393: went out, "but I am sorry--a--you should behave disobligingly to a man
7394: who has it in his power to do much service--who, in fact, holds many
7395: threads in his hands. I admit that--a--_nemo mortalium omnibus horis
7396: sapit_, as we say--a----"
7397: 
7398: "Speak for yourself," said Harold. "I don't talk in tags of Latin, which
7399: might be learned by a school-master's foot-boy. I find the King's
7400: English expresses my meaning better."
7401: 
7402: "In the King's English, then," said Jermyn, who could be idiomatic
7403: enough when he was stung, "a candidate should keep his kicks till he's a
7404: member."
7405: 
7406: "Oh, I suppose Johnson will bear a kick if you bid him. You're his
7407: principal, I believe."
7408: 
7409: "Certainly, thus far--a--he is my London agent. But he is a man of
7410: substance, and----"
7411: 
7412: "I shall know what he is if it's necessary, I dare say. But I must jump
7413: into the carriage again. I've no time to lose; I must go to Hawkins at
7414: the factory. Will you go?"
7415: 
7416: When Harold was gone, Jermyn's handsome face gathered blackness. He
7417: hardly ever wore his worst expression in the presence of others, and but
7418: seldom when he was alone, for he was not given to believe that any game
7419: would ultimately go against him. His luck had been good. New conditions
7420: might always turn up to give him new chances; and if affairs threatened
7421: to come to an extremity between Harold and himself, he trusted to
7422: finding some sure resource.
7423: 
7424: "He means to see to the bottom of everything if he can, that's quite
7425: plain," said Jermyn to himself. "I believe he has been getting another
7426: opinion; he has some new light about those annuities on the estate that
7427: are held in Johnson's name. He has inherited a deuced faculty for
7428: business--there's no denying that. But I shall beg leave to tell him
7429: that I've propped up the family. I don't know where they would have been
7430: without me; and if it comes to balancing, I know into which scale the
7431: gratitude ought to go. Not that he's likely to feel any--but he can feel
7432: something else; and if he makes signs of setting the dogs on me, I shall
7433: make him feel it. The people named Transome owe me a good deal more than
7434: I owe them."
7435: 
7436: In this way Mr. Jermyn inwardly appealed against an unjust construction
7437: which he foresaw that his old acquaintance the law might put on certain
7438: items in his history.
7439: 
7440: I have known persons who have been suspected of under-valuing gratitude,
7441: and excluding it from the list of virtues; but on closer observation it
7442: has been seen that, if they have never felt grateful, it has been for
7443: want of an opportunity; and that, far from despising gratitude, they
7444: regard it as the virtue most of all incumbent--on others toward them.
7445: 
7446: 
7447: 
7448: 
7449: CHAPTER XVIII.
7450: 
7451:     The little, nameless, unremembered acts
7452:     Of kindness and of love.
7453: 
7454:                                   --WORDSWORTH: _Tintern Abbey_.
7455: 
7456: 
7457: Jermyn did not forget to pay his visit to the minister in Malthouse Yard
7458: that evening. The mingled irritation, dread and defiance which he was
7459: feeling toward Harold Transome in the middle of the day depended on too
7460: many and far-stretching causes to be dissipated by eight o'clock; but
7461: when he left Mr. Lyon's house he was in a state of comparative triumph
7462: in the belief that he, and he alone, was now in possession of facts
7463: which, once grouped together, made a secret that gave him new power over
7464: Harold.
7465: 
7466: Mr. Lyon, in his need for help from one who had that wisdom of the
7467: serpent which, he argued, is not forbidden, but is only of hard
7468: acquirement to dovelike innocence, had been gradually led to pour out to
7469: the attorney all the reasons which made him desire to know the truth
7470: about the man who called himself Maurice Christian: he had shown all the
7471: precious relics, the locket, the letters, and the marriage certificate.
7472: And Jermyn had comforted him by confidently promising to ascertain,
7473: without scandal or premature betrayals, whether this man were really
7474: Annette's husband, or Maurice Christian Bycliffe.
7475: 
7476: Jermyn was not rash in making this promise, since he had excellent
7477: reasons for believing that he had already come to a true conclusion on
7478: the subject. But he wished both to know a little more of this man
7479: himself, and to keep Mr. Lyon in ignorance--not a difficult
7480: precaution--in an affair which it cost the minister so much pain to
7481: speak of. An easy opportunity of getting an interview with Christian was
7482: sure to offer itself before long--might even offer itself to-morrow.
7483: Jermyn had seen him more than once, though hitherto without any reason
7484: for observing him with interest; he had heard that Philip Debarry's
7485: courier was often busy in the town, and it seemed specially likely that
7486: he would be seen there when the market was to be agitated by politics,
7487: and the new candidate was to show his paces.
7488: 
7489: The world of which Treby Magna was the centre was, naturally, curious to
7490: see the young Transome, who had come from the East, was as rich as a
7491: Jew, and called himself a Radical--characteristics all equally vague in
7492: the minds of various excellent ratepayers, who drove to market in their
7493: taxed carts or in their hereditary gigs. Places at convenient windows
7494: had been secured beforehand for a few best bonnets; but, in general, a
7495: Radical candidate excited no ardent feminine partisanship, even among
7496: the Dissenters in Treby, if they were of the prosperous and
7497: long-resident class. Some chapel-going ladies were fond of remembering
7498: that "their family had been Church"; others objected to politics
7499: altogether as having spoiled old neighborliness, and sundered friends
7500: who had kindred views as to cowslip wine and Michaelmas cleaning;
7501: others, of the melancholy sort, said it would be well if people would
7502: think less of reforming Parliament and more of pleasing God.
7503: Irreproachable Dissenting matrons, like Mrs. Muscat, whose youth had
7504: been passed in a short-waisted bodice and tight skirt, had never been
7505: animated by the struggle for liberty, and had a timid suspicion that
7506: religion was desecrated by being applied to the things of this world.
7507: Since Mr. Lyon had been in Malthouse Yard there had been far too much
7508: mixing up of politics with religion; but, at any rate, these ladies had
7509: never yet been to hear speechifying in the market-place, and they were
7510: not going to begin that practice.
7511: 
7512: Esther, however, had heard some of her feminine acquaintances say that
7513: they intended to sit at the druggist's upper window, and she was
7514: inclined to ask her father if he could think of a suitable place where
7515: she also might see and hear. Two inconsistent motives urged her. She
7516: knew that Felix cared earnestly for public questions, and she supposed
7517: that he held it one of her deficiencies not to care about them: well,
7518: she would try to learn the secret of this ardor, which was so strong in
7519: him that it animated what she thought the dullest form of life. She was
7520: not too stupid to find it out. But this self-correcting motive was
7521: presently displaced by a motive of a different sort. It had been a
7522: pleasant variety in her monotonous days to see a man like Harold
7523: Transome, with a distinguished appearance and polished manners, and she
7524: would like to see him again: he suggested to her that brighter and more
7525: luxurious life on which her imagination dwelt without the painful effort
7526: it required to conceive the mental condition which would place her in
7527: complete sympathy with Felix Holt. It was this less unaccustomed
7528: prompting of which she was chiefly conscious when she awaited her
7529: father's coming down to breakfast. Why, indeed, should she trouble
7530: herself so much about Felix?
7531: 
7532: Mr. Lyon, more serene now that he had unbosomed his anxieties and
7533: obtained a promise of help, was already swimming so happily in the deep
7534: water of polemics in expectation of Philip Debarry's answer to his
7535: challenge, that, in the occupation of making a few notes lest certain
7536: felicitous inspirations should be wasted, he had forgotten to come down
7537: to breakfast. Esther, suspecting his abstraction, went up to his study,
7538: and found him at his desk looking up with wonder at her interruption.
7539: 
7540: "Come, father, you have forgotten your breakfast."
7541: 
7542: "It is true, child, I will come," he said, lingering to make some final
7543: strokes.
7544: 
7545: "Oh, you naughty father!" said Esther, as he got up from his chair,
7546: "your coat-collar is twisted, your waistcoat is buttoned all wrong, and
7547: you have not brushed your hair. Sit down and let me brush it again as I
7548: did yesterday."
7549: 
7550: He sat down obediently, while Esther took a towel, which she threw over
7551: his shoulders, and then brushed the thick, long fringe of soft auburn
7552: hair. This very trifling act, which she had brought herself to for the
7553: first time yesterday, meant a great deal in Esther's little history. It
7554: had been her habit to leave the mending of her father's clothes to
7555: Lyddy; she had not liked even to touch his cloth garments; still less
7556: had it seemed a thing she would willingly undertake to correct his
7557: toilette, and use a brush for him. But having once done this, under her
7558: new sense of faulty omission, the affectionateness that was in her
7559: flowed so pleasantly, as she saw how much her father was moved by what
7560: he thought a great act of tenderness, that she quite longed to repeat
7561: it. This morning, as he sat under her hands, his face had such a calm
7562: delight in it that she could not help kissing the top of his bald head;
7563: and afterward, when they were seated at breakfast, she said, merrily--
7564: 
7565: "Father, I shall make a _petit maître_ of you by-and-by; your hair looks
7566: so pretty and silken when it is well brushed."
7567: 
7568: "Nay, child, I trust that while I would willingly depart from my evil
7569: habit of a somewhat slovenly forgetfulness in my attire, I shall never
7570: arrive at the opposite extreme. For though there is that in apparel
7571: which pleases the eye, and I deny not that your neat gown and the color
7572: thereof--which is that of certain little flowers that spread themselves
7573: in the hedgerows, and make a blueness there as of the sky when it is
7574: deepened in the water--I deny not, I say, that these minor strivings
7575: after a perfection which is, as it were, an irrecoverable yet haunting
7576: memory, are a good in their proportion. Nevertheless, the brevity of our
7577: life, and the hurry and crush of the great battle with error and sin,
7578: often oblige us to an advised neglect of what is less momentous. This, I
7579: conceive, is the principle on which my friend Felix Holt acts; and I
7580: cannot but think the light comes from the true fount, though it shines
7581: through obstructions."
7582: 
7583: "You have not seen Mr. Holt since Sunday, have you, father?"
7584: 
7585: "Yes, he was here yesterday. He sought Mr. Transome, having a matter of
7586: some importance to speak upon with him. And I saw him afterward in the
7587: street, when he agreed that I should call for him this morning before I
7588: go into the market-place. He will have it," Mr. Lyon went on, smiling,
7589: "that I must not walk about in the crowd without him to act as my
7590: special constable."
7591: 
7592: Esther felt vexed with herself that her heart was suddenly beating with
7593: unusual quickness, and that her last resolution not to trouble herself
7594: about what Felix thought had transformed itself with magic swiftness
7595: into mortification that he evidently avoided coming to the house when
7596: she was there, though he used to come on the slightest occasion. He knew
7597: that she was always at home until the afternoon on market-days: that was
7598: the reason why he would not call for her father. Of course it was
7599: because he attributed such littleness to her that he supposed she would
7600: retain nothing else than a feeling of offence toward him for what he had
7601: said to her. Such distrust of any good in others, such arrogance of
7602: immeasurable superiority, was extremely ungenerous. But presently she
7603: said--
7604: 
7605: "I should have liked to hear Mr. Transome speak, but I suppose it is too
7606: late to get a place now."
7607: 
7608: "I am not sure, I would fain have you go if you desire it, my dear,"
7609: said Mr. Lyon, who could not bear to deny Esther any lawful wish. "Walk
7610: with me to Mrs. Holt's, and we will learn from Felix, who will doubtless
7611: already have been out, whether or not he could lead you in safety to
7612: Friend Lambert's."
7613: 
7614: Esther was glad of the proposal, because, if it answered no other
7615: purpose, it would be an easy way of obliging Felix to see her, and of
7616: showing him that it was not she who cherished offence. But when, later
7617: in the morning, she was walking toward Mrs. Holt's with her father, they
7618: met Mr. Jermyn, who stopped them to ask, in his most affable manner,
7619: whether Miss Lyon intended to hear the candidate, and whether she had
7620: secured a suitable place. And he ended by insisting that his daughters,
7621: who were presently coming in an open carriage, should call for her if
7622: she would permit them. It was impossible to refuse this civility, and
7623: Esther turned back to await the carriage, pleased with the certainty of
7624: hearing and seeing, yet sorry to miss Felix. There was another day for
7625: her to think of him with unsatisfied resentment, mixed with some
7626: longings for a better understanding: and in our spring-time every day
7627: has its hidden growths in the mind, as it has in the earth when the
7628: little folded blades are getting ready to pierce the ground.
7629: 
7630: 
7631: 
7632: 
7633: CHAPTER XIX.
7634: 
7635:     Consistency?--I never changed my mind,
7636:     Which is, and always was, to live at ease.
7637: 
7638: 
7639: It was only in the time of summer fairs that the market-place had ever
7640: looked more animated than it did under that autumn midday sun. There
7641: were plenty of blue cockades and streamers, faces at all the windows,
7642: and a crushing buzzing crowd, urging each other backward and forward
7643: round the small hustings in front of the Ram Inn, which showed its more
7644: plebeian sign at right angles with the venerable Marquis of Granby.
7645: Sometimes there were scornful shouts, sometimes a rolling cascade of
7646: cheers, sometimes the shriek of a penny whistle; but above all these
7647: fitful and feeble sounds, the fine old church-tower, which looked down
7648: from above the trees on the other side of the narrow stream, sent
7649: vibrating, at every quarter, the sonorous tones of its great bell, the
7650: Good Queen Bess.
7651: 
7652: Two carriages, with blue ribbons on the harness, were conspicuous near
7653: the hustings. One was Jermyn's, filled with the brilliantly-attired
7654: daughters, accompanied by Esther, whose quieter dress helped to mark her
7655: out for attention as the most striking of the group. The other was
7656: Harold Transome's; but in this there was no lady--only the olive-skinned
7657: Dominic, whose acute yet mild face was brightened by the occupation of
7658: amusing little Harry and rescuing from his tyrannies a King Charles
7659: puppy, with big eyes, much after the pattern of the boy's.
7660: 
7661: This Trebian crowd did not count for much in the political force of the
7662: nation, but it was not the less determined as to lending or not lending
7663: its ears. No man was permitted to speak from the platform except Harold
7664: and his uncle Lingon, though, in the interval of expectation, several
7665: Liberals had come forward. Among these ill-advised persons the one whose
7666: attempt met the most emphatic resistance was Rufus Lyon. This might have
7667: been taken for resentment at the unreasonableness of the cloth, that,
7668: not content with pulpits, from whence to tyrannize over the ears of men,
7669: wishes to have the larger share of the platforms; but it was not so, for
7670: Mr. Lingon was heard with much cheering, and would have been welcomed
7671: again.
7672: 
7673: The rector of Little Treby had been a favorite in the neighborhood since
7674: the beginning of the century. A clergyman thoroughly unclerical in his
7675: habits had a piquancy about him which made him a sort of practical joke.
7676: He had always been called Jack Lingon, or Parson Jack--sometimes, in
7677: older and less serious days, even "Cock-fighting Jack." He swore a
7678: little when the point of a joke seemed to demand it, and was fond of
7679: wearing a colored bandana tied loosely over his cravat, together with
7680: large brown leather leggings; he spoke in a pithy familiar way that
7681: people could understand, and had none of that frigid mincingness called
7682: dignity, which some have thought a peculiar clerical disease. In fact,
7683: he was "a charicter--" something cheerful to think of, not entirely out
7684: of connection with Sunday and sermons. And it seemed in keeping that he
7685: should have turned sharp round in politics, his opinions being only
7686: part of the excellent joke called Parson Jack. When his red eagle face
7687: and white hair were seen on the platform, the Dissenters hardly cheered
7688: this questionable Radical; but to make amends, all the Tory farmers gave
7689: him a friendly "hurray." "Let's hear what old Jack will say for
7690: himself," was the predominant feeling among them; "he'll have something
7691: funny to say, I'll bet a penny."
7692: 
7693: It was only Lawyer Labron's young clerks and their hangers-on who were
7694: sufficiently dead to Trebian traditions to assail the parson with
7695: various sharp-edged interjections, such as broken shells, and cries of
7696: "Cock-a-doodle-doo."
7697: 
7698: "Come now, my lads," he began, in his full, pompous, yet jovial tones,
7699: thrusting his hands into the stuffed-out pockets of his greatcoat, "I'll
7700: tell you what; I'm a parson you know; I ought to return good for evil.
7701: So here are some good nuts for you to crack in return for your shells."
7702: 
7703: There was a roar of laughter and cheering as he threw handfuls of nuts
7704: and filberts among the crowd.
7705: 
7706: "Come now, you'll say I used to be a Tory; and some of you, whose faces
7707: I know as well as I know the head of my own crab-stick, will say that's
7708: why I'm a good fellow. But now I'll tell you something else. It's for
7709: that very reason--that I used to be a Tory, and am a good fellow--that I
7710: go along with my nephew here, who is a thorough-going Liberal. For will
7711: anybody here come forward and say, 'A good fellow has no need to tack
7712: about and change his road?' No, there's not one of you such a Tom-noddy.
7713: What's good for one time is bad for another. If anybody contradicts
7714: that, ask him to eat pickled pork when he's thirsty, and to bathe in the
7715: Lapp there when the spikes of ice are shooting. And that's the reason
7716: why the men who are the best Liberals now are the very men who used to
7717: be the best Tories. There isn't a nastier horse than your horse that'll
7718: jib and back and turn round when there is but one road for him to go,
7719: and that's the road before him.
7720: 
7721: "And my nephew here--he comes of a Tory breed, you know--I'll answer for
7722: the Lingons. In the old Tory times there was never a pup belonged to a
7723: Lingon but would howl if a Whig came near him. The Lingon blood is good,
7724: rich old Tory blood--like good rich milk--and that's why, when the right
7725: time comes, it throws up a liberal cream. The best sort of Tory turns to
7726: the best sort of Radical. There's plenty of Radical scum--I say, beware
7727: of the scum, and look but for the cream. And here's my nephew--some of
7728: the cream, if there is any: none of your Whigs, none of your painted
7729: water that looks as if it ran, and it's standing still all the while;
7730: none of your spinning-jenny fellows. A gentleman; but up to all sorts of
7731: business. I'm no fool myself; I'm forced to wink a good deal, for fear
7732: of seeing too much, for a neighborly man must let himself be cheated a
7733: little. But though I've never been out of my own country, I know less
7734: about it than my nephew does. You may tell what he is, and only look at
7735: him. There's one sort of fellow sees nothing but the end of his own
7736: nose, and another sort that sees nothing but the hinder side of the
7737: moon; but my nephew Harold is of another sort; he sees everything that's
7738: at hitting distance, and he's not one to miss his mark. A good-looking
7739: man in his prime! Not a greenhorn; not a shrivelled old fellow, who'll
7740: come to speak to you and find he's left his teeth at home by mistake.
7741: Harold Transome will do you credit; if anybody says the Radicals are a
7742: set of sneaks, Brummagem half-pennies, scamps who want to play
7743: pitch-and-toss with the property of the country, you can say, 'Look at
7744: the member for North Loamshire!' And mind what you'll hear him say;
7745: he'll go in for making everything right--Poor-laws and Charities and
7746: Church--he wants to reform 'em all. Perhaps you'll say, 'There's that
7747: Parson Lingon talking about Church Reform--why, he belongs to the Church
7748: himself--he wants reforming too.' Well, well, wait a bit, and you'll
7749: hear by-and-by that old Parson Lingon is reformed--shoots no more,
7750: cracks his joke no more, has drunk his last bottle: the dogs, the old
7751: pointers, will be sorry; but you'll hear that the Parson at Little Treby
7752: is a new man. That's what Church Reform is sure to come to before long.
7753: So now here are some more nuts for you, lads, and I leave you to listen
7754: to your candidate. Here he is--give him a good hurray; wave your hats,
7755: and I'll begin. Hurray!"
7756: 
7757: Harold had not been quite confident beforehand as to the good effect of
7758: his uncle's introduction; but he was soon reassured. There was no acrid
7759: partisanship among the old-fashioned Tories who mustered strong about
7760: the Marquis of Granby, and Parson Jack had put them in a good humor.
7761: Harold's only interruption came from his own party. The oratorical clerk
7762: at the Factory, acting as the tribune of the Dissenting interest, and
7763: feeling bound to put questions, might have been troublesome; but his
7764: voice being unpleasantly sharp, while Harold's was full and
7765: penetrating, the questioning was cried down. Harold's speech "did": it
7766: was not of the glib-nonsensical sort, not ponderous, not
7767: hesitating--which is as much as to say, that it was remarkable among
7768: British speeches. Read in print the next day, perhaps it would be
7769: neither pregnant nor conclusive, which is saying no more than that its
7770: excellence was not of an abnormal kind, but such as is usually found in
7771: the best efforts of eloquent candidates. Accordingly, the applause
7772: drowned the opposition, and content predominated.
7773: 
7774: But, perhaps, the moment of most diffusive pleasure from public speaking
7775: is that in which the speech ceases and the audience can turn to
7776: commenting on it. The one speech, sometimes uttered under great
7777: responsibility as to missiles and other consequences, has given a text
7778: to twenty speakers who are under no responsibility. Even in the days of
7779: duelling a man was not challenged for being a bore, nor does this
7780: quality apparently hinder him from being much invited to dinner, which
7781: is the great index of social responsibility in a less barbarous age.
7782: 
7783: Certainly the crowd in the market-place seemed to experience this
7784: culminating enjoyment when the speaking on the platform in front of the
7785: Ram had ceased, and there were no less than three orators holding forth
7786: from the elevation of chance vehicles, not at all to the prejudice of
7787: the talking among those who were on a level with their neighbors. There
7788: was little ill-humor among the listeners, for Queen Bess was striking
7789: the last quarter before two, and a savory smell from the inn kitchens
7790: inspired them with an agreeable consciousness that the speakers were
7791: helping to trifle away the brief time before dinner.
7792: 
7793: Two or three of Harold's committee had lingered talking to each other on
7794: the platform, instead of re-entering; and Jermyn, after coming out to
7795: speak to one of them, had turned to the corner near which the carriages
7796: were standing, that he might tell the Transome's coachman to drive round
7797: to the side door and signal to his own coachman to follow. But a
7798: dialogue which was going on below induced him to pause, and instead of
7799: giving the order, to assume the air of a careless gazer. Christian, whom
7800: the attorney had already observed looking out of a window at the Marquis
7801: of Granby, was talking to Dominic. The meeting appeared to be one of new
7802: recognition, for Christian was saying:
7803: 
7804: "You've not got gray, as I have, Mr. Lenoni; you're not a day older for
7805: the sixteen years. But no wonder you didn't know me; I'm bleached like a
7806: dried bone."
7807: 
7808: "Not so. It is true I was confused a meenute--I could put your face
7809: nowhere; but, after that, Naples came behind it, and I said, Mr.
7810: Creesstian. And so you reside at the Manor, and I am at Transome Court."
7811: 
7812: "Ah! it's a thousand pities you're not on our side, else we might have
7813: dined together at the Marquis," said Christian. "Eh, could you manage
7814: it?" he added, languidly, knowing there was no chance of a yes.
7815: 
7816: "No--much obliged--couldn't leave the leetle boy. Ahi! Arry, Arry, pinch
7817: not poor Moro."
7818: 
7819: While Dominic was answering, Christian had stared about him, as his
7820: manner was when he was being spoken to, and had had his eyes arrested by
7821: Esther, who was leaning forward to look at Mr. Harold Transome's
7822: extraordinary little gypsy of a son. But, happening to meet Christian's
7823: stare, she felt annoyed, drew back, and turned away her head, coloring.
7824: 
7825: "Who are those ladies?" said Christian, in a low tone, to Dominic, as if
7826: he had been startled into a sudden wish for this information.
7827: 
7828: "They are Meester Jermyn's daughters," said Dominic, who knew nothing
7829: either of the lawyer's family or of Esther.
7830: 
7831: Christian looked puzzled a moment or two, and was silent.
7832: 
7833: "Oh, well--_au revoir_," he said, kissing the tips of his fingers as the
7834: coachman, having had Jermyn's order, began to urge on the horses.
7835: 
7836: "Does he see some likeness in the girl?" thought Jermyn, as he turned
7837: away. "I wish I hadn't invited her to come in the carriage, as it
7838: happens."
7839: 
7840: 
7841: 
7842: 
7843: CHAPTER XX.
7844: 
7845:     "Good earthenware pitchers, sir!--of an excellent quaint pattern
7846:     and sober color."
7847: 
7848: 
7849: The market dinner at "the Marquis" was in high repute in Treby and its
7850: neighborhood. The frequenters of this three-and-sixpenny ordinary liked
7851: to allude to it, as men allude to anything which implies that they move
7852: in good society, and habitually converse with those who are in the
7853: secret of the highest affairs. The guests were not only such rural
7854: residents as had driven to market, but some of the most substantial
7855: townsmen, who had always assured their wives that business required this
7856: weekly sacrifice of domestic pleasure. The poorer farmers, who put up at
7857: the Ram or the Seven Stars, where there was no fish, felt their
7858: disadvantage, bearing it modestly or bitterly, as the case might be;
7859: and although the Marquis was a Tory house, devoted to Debarry, it was
7860: too much to expect that such tenants of the Transomes as had always been
7861: used to dine there, should consent to eat a worse dinner, and sit with
7862: worse company, because they suddenly found themselves under a Radical
7863: landlord, opposed to the political party known as Sir Maxim's. Hence the
7864: recent political divisions had not reduced the handsome length of the
7865: table at the Marquis; and the many gradations of dignity--from Mr. Wace,
7866: the brewer, to the rich butcher from Leek Malton, who always modestly
7867: took the lowest seat, though without the reward of being asked to come
7868: up higher--had not been abbreviated by any secessions.
7869: 
7870: To-day there was an extra table spread for expected supernumeraries, and
7871: it was at this that Christian took his place with some of the younger
7872: farmers, who had almost a sense of dissipation in talking to a man of
7873: his questionable station and unknown experience. The provision was
7874: especially liberal, and on the whole the presence of a minority destined
7875: to vote for Transome was a ground for joking, which added to the good
7876: humor of the chief talkers. A respectable old acquaintance turned
7877: Radical rather against his will, was rallied with even greater gusto
7878: than if his wife had had twins twice over. The best Trebian Tories were
7879: far too sweet-blooded to turn against such old friends, and to make no
7880: distinction between them and the Radical, Dissenting, Papistical,
7881: Deistical set with whom they never dined, and probably never saw except
7882: in their imagination. But the talk was necessarily in abeyance until the
7883: more serious business of dinner was ended, and the wine, spirits, and
7884: tobacco raised mere satisfaction into beatitude.
7885: 
7886: Among the frequent though not regular guests, whom every one was glad to
7887: see, was Mr. Nolan, the retired London hosier, a wiry old gentleman past
7888: seventy, whose square, tight forehead, with its rigid hedge of gray
7889: hair, whose bushy eyebrows, sharp dark eyes, and remarkable hooked nose,
7890: gave a handsome distinction to his face in the midst of rural
7891: physiognomies. He had married a Miss Pendrell early in life, when he was
7892: a poor young Londoner, and the match had been thought as bad as ruin by
7893: her family; but fifteen years ago he had had the satisfaction of
7894: bringing his wife to settle amongst her own friends, and of being
7895: received with pride as a brother-in-law, retired from business,
7896: possessed of unknown thousands, and of a most agreeable talent for
7897: anecdote and conversation generally. No question had ever been raised
7898: as to Mr. Nolan's extraction on the strength of his hooked nose, or of
7899: his name being Baruch. Hebrew names "ran" in the best Saxon families;
7900: the Bible accounted for them; and no one among the uplands and hedgerows
7901: of that district was suspected of having an oriental origin unless he
7902: carried a peddler's jewel-box. Certainly, whatever genealogical research
7903: might have discovered, the worthy Baruch Nolan was so free from any
7904: distinctive marks of religious persuasion--he went to church with so
7905: ordinary an irregularity, and so often grumbled at the sermon--that
7906: there was no ground for classing him otherwise than with good Trebian
7907: Churchmen. He was generally regarded as a good-looking old gentleman,
7908: and a certain thin eagerness in his aspect was attributed to the life of
7909: the metropolis, where narrow space had the same sort of effect on men as
7910: on thickly-planted trees. Mr. Nolan always ordered his pint of port,
7911: which, after he had sipped it a little, was wont to animate his
7912: recollections of the Royal Family, and the various ministries which had
7913: been contemporary with the successive stages of his prosperity. He was
7914: always listened to with interest: a man who had been born in the year
7915: when good old King George came to the throne--who had been acquainted
7916: with the nude leg of the Prince Regent, and hinted at private reasons
7917: for believing that the Princess Charlotte ought not to have died--had
7918: conversational matter as special to his auditors as Marco Polo could
7919: have had on his return from his Asiatic travel.
7920: 
7921: "My good sir," he said to Mr. Wace, as he crossed his knees and spread
7922: his silk handkerchief over them, "Transome may be returned, or he may
7923: not be returned--that's a question for North Loamshire; but it makes
7924: little difference to the kingdom. I don't want to say things which may
7925: put younger men out of spirits, but I believe this country has seen it's
7926: best days--I do, indeed."
7927: 
7928: "I am sorry to hear it from one of your experience, Mr. Nolan," said the
7929: brewer, a large, happy-looking man. "I'd make a good fight myself before
7930: I'd leave a worse world for my boys than I've found for myself. There
7931: isn't a greater pleasure than doing a bit of planting and improving
7932: one's buildings, and investing one's money in some pretty acres of land,
7933: and when it turns up here and there--land you've known from a boy. It's
7934: a nasty thought that these Radicals are to turn things round so as one
7935: can calculate on nothing. One doesn't like it for one's self, and one
7936: doesn't like it for one's neighbors. But somehow, I believe it won't
7937: do: if we can't trust the Government just now, there's Providence and
7938: the good sense of the country; and there's a right in things--that's
7939: what I've always said--there's a right in things. The heavy end will get
7940: downmost. And if Church and King, and every man being sure of his own,
7941: are things good for this country, there's a God above will take care of
7942: 'em."
7943: 
7944: "It won't do, my dear sir," said Mr. Nolan--"It won't do. When Peel and
7945: the Duke turned round about the Catholics in '29, I saw it was all over
7946: with us. We could never trust ministers any more. It was to keep off a
7947: rebellion, they said; but I say it was to keep their places. They're
7948: monstrously fond of place, both of them--that I know." Here Mr. Nolan
7949: changed the crossing of his legs, and gave a deep cough, conscious of
7950: having made a point. Then he went on--"What we want is a king with a
7951: good will of his own. If we'd had that, we shouldn't have heard what
7952: we've heard to-day; Reform would never have come to this pass. When our
7953: good old King George III. heard his ministers talking about Catholic
7954: Emancipation, he boxed their ears all round. Ah, poor soul! he did
7955: indeed, gentlemen," ended Mr. Nolan, shaken by a deep laugh of
7956: admiration.
7957: 
7958: "Well, now, that's something like a king," said Mr. Crowder, who was an
7959: eager listener.
7960: 
7961: "It was uncivil, though. How did they take it?" said Mr. Timothy Rose, a
7962: "gentleman farmer" from Leek Malton, against whose independent position
7963: nature had provided the safeguard of a spontaneous servility. His large
7964: porcine cheeks, round twinkling eyes, and thumbs habitually twirling,
7965: expressed a concentrated effort not to get into trouble, and to speak
7966: everybody fair except when they were safely out of hearing.
7967: 
7968: "Take it! they'd be obliged to take it," said the impetuous young Joyce,
7969: a farmer of superior information. "Have you ever heard of the king's
7970: prerogative?"
7971: 
7972: "I don't say but what I have," said Rose, retreating. "I've nothing
7973: against it--nothing at all."
7974: 
7975: "No, but the Radicals have," said young Joyce, winking. "The prerogative
7976: is what they want to clip close. They want us to be governed by
7977: delegates from the trades-unions, who are to dictate to everybody, and
7978: make everything square to their mastery."
7979: 
7980: "They're a pretty set, now, these delegates," said Mr. Wace, with
7981: disgust. "I once heard two of 'em spouting away. They're a sort of
7982: fellow I'd never employ in my brewery, or anywhere else. I've seen it
7983: again and again. If a man takes to tongue-work it's all over with him.
7984: 'Everything's wrong,' says he. That's a big text. But does he want to
7985: make everything right? Not he. He'd lose his text. 'We want every man's
7986: good,' say they. Why, they never knew yet what a man's good is. How
7987: should they? It's working for his victual--not getting a slice of other
7988: people's."
7989: 
7990: "Ay, ay," said young Joyce, cordially. "I should just have liked all the
7991: delegates in the country mustered for our yeomanry to go into--that's
7992: all. They'd see where the strength of Old England lay then. You may tell
7993: what it is for a country to trust to trade when it breeds such spindling
7994: fellows as those."
7995: 
7996: "That isn't the fault of trade, my good sir," said Mr. Nolan, who was
7997: often a little pained by the defects of provincial culture. "Trade,
7998: properly conducted, is good for a man's constitution. I could have shown
7999: you, in my time, weavers past seventy, with all their faculties as sharp
8000: as a pen-knife, doing without spectacles. It's the new system of trade
8001: that's to blame: a country can't have too much trade if it's properly
8002: managed. Plenty of sound Tories have made their fortune by trade. You've
8003: heard of Calibut & Co.--everybody has heard of Calibut. Well, sir, I
8004: knew old Mr. Calibut as well as I know you. He was once a crony of mine
8005: in a city warehouse; and now, I'll answer for it, he has a larger rent
8006: roll than Lord Wyvern. Bless your soul! his subscriptions to charities
8007: would make a fine income for a nobleman. And he's as good a Tory as I
8008: am. And as for his town establishment--why, how much butter do you think
8009: is consumed there annually?"
8010: 
8011: Mr. Nolan paused, and then his face glowed with triumph as he answered
8012: his own question. "Why, gentlemen, not less than two thousand pounds of
8013: butter during the few months the family is in town! Trade makes
8014: property, my good sir, and property is conservative, as they say now.
8015: Calibut's son-in-law is Lord Fortinbras. He paid me a large debt on his
8016: marriage. It's all one web, sir. The prosperity of the country is one
8017: web."
8018: 
8019: "To be sure," said Christian, who, smoking his cigar with his chair
8020: turned away from the table, was willing to make himself agreeable in the
8021: conversation. "We can't do without nobility. Look at France. When they
8022: got rid of the old nobles they were obliged to make new."
8023: 
8024: "True, very true," said Mr. Nolan, who thought Christian a little too
8025: wise for his position, but could not resist the rare gift of an instance
8026: in point. "It's the French Revolution that has done us harm here. It was
8027: the same at the end of the last century, but the war kept it off--Mr.
8028: Pitt saved us. I knew Mr. Pitt. I had a particular interview with him
8029: once. He joked me about getting the length of his foot. 'Mr. Nolan,'
8030: said he, 'there are those on the other side of the water whose name
8031: begins with N. who would be glad to know what you know.' I was
8032: recommended to send an account of that to the newspapers after his
8033: death, poor man! but I'm not fond of that kind of show myself." Mr.
8034: Nolan swung his upper leg a little, and pinched his lip between his
8035: thumb and finger, naturally pleased with his own moderation.
8036: 
8037: "No, no--very right," said Mr. Wace, cordially. "But you never said a
8038: truer word than that about property. If a man's got a bit of property, a
8039: stake in the country, he'll want to keep things square. Where Jack isn't
8040: safe, Tom's in danger. But that's what makes it such an uncommonly nasty
8041: thing that a man like Transome should take up with these Radicals. It's
8042: my belief he does it only to get into Parliament; he'll turn round when
8043: he gets there. Come, Dibbs, there's something to put you in spirits,"
8044: added Mr. Wace, raising his voice a little and looking at a guest lower
8045: down. "You've got to vote for a Radical with one side of your mouth, and
8046: make a wry face with the other; but he'll turn round by-and-by. As
8047: Parson Jack says, he's got the right sort of blood in him."
8048: 
8049: "I don't care two straws who I vote for," said Dibbs, sturdily. "I'm not
8050: going to make a wry face. It stands to reason a man should vote for his
8051: landlord. My farm's in good condition, and I've got the best pasture on
8052: the estate. The rot's never come nigh me. Let them grumble as are on the
8053: wrong side of the hedge."
8054: 
8055: "I wonder if Jermyn'll bring him in, though," said Mr. Sircome, the
8056: great miller. "He's an uncommon fellow for carrying things through. I
8057: know he brought me through that suit about my weir; it cost a pretty
8058: penny, but he brought me through."
8059: 
8060: "It's a bit of a pill for him, too, having to turn Radical," said Mr.
8061: Wace. "They say he counted on making friends with Sir Maximus, by this
8062: young one coming home and joining with Mr. Philip."
8063: 
8064: "But I'll bet a penny he brings Transome in," said Mr. Sircome. "Folks
8065: say he hasn't got many votes hereabout; but toward Duffield, and all
8066: there, where the Radicals are, everybody's for him. Eh, Mr. Christian?
8067: Come--you're at the fountain-head--what do they say about it now at the
8068: Manor?"
8069: 
8070: When general attention was called to Christian young Joyce looked down
8071: at his own legs and touched the curves of his own hair, as if measuring
8072: his own approximation to that correct copy of a gentleman. Mr. Wace
8073: turned his head to listen for Christian's answer with that tolerance of
8074: inferiority which becomes men in places of public resort.
8075: 
8076: "They think it will be a hard run between Transome and Garstin," said
8077: Christian. "It depends on Transome's getting plumpers."
8078: 
8079: "Well, I know I shall not split for Garstin," said Mr. Wace. "It's
8080: nonsense for Debarry's voters to split for a Whig. A man's either a Tory
8081: or not a Tory."
8082: 
8083: "It seems reasonable there should be one of each side," said Mr. Timothy
8084: Rose. "I don't like showing favor either way. If one side can't lower
8085: the poor's rates and take off the tithe, let the other try."
8086: 
8087: "But there's this in it, Wace," said Mr. Sircome. "I'm not altogether
8088: against the Whigs. For they don't want to go so far as the Radicals do,
8089: and when they find they've slipped a bit too far they'll hold on all the
8090: tighter. And the Whigs have got the upper hand now, and it's no use
8091: fighting with the current. I run with the----"
8092: 
8093: Mr. Sircome checked himself, looked furtively at Christian, and, to
8094: divert criticisms, ended with--"eh, Mr. Nolan?"
8095: 
8096: "There have been eminent Whigs, sir. Mr. Fox was a Whig," said Mr.
8097: Nolan. "Mr. Fox was a great orator. He was very intimate with the Prince
8098: of Wales. I've seen him, and the Duke of York too, go home by daylight
8099: with their hats crushed. Mr. Fox was a great leader of Opposition:
8100: Government requires an Opposition. The Whigs should always be in
8101: opposition, and the Tories on the ministerial side. That's what the
8102: country used to like. 'The Whigs for salt and mustard, the Tories for
8103: meat,' Mr. Gottlib, the banker, used to say to me. Mr. Gottlib was a
8104: worthy man. When there was a great run on Mr. Gottlib's bank in '16, I
8105: saw a gentleman come in with bags of gold, and say, 'Tell Mr. Gottlib
8106: there's plenty more where that came from.' It stopped the run,
8107: gentlemen--it did indeed."
8108: 
8109: This anecodote was received with great admiration, but Mr. Sircome
8110: returned to the previous question.
8111: 
8112: "There now, you see, Wace--it's right there should be Whigs as well as
8113: Tories--Pitt and Fox--I've always heard them go together."
8114: 
8115: "Well, I don't like Garstin," said the brewer. "I didn't like his
8116: conduct about the Canal Company. Of the two, I like Transome best. If a
8117: nag is to throw me, I say, let him have some blood."
8118: 
8119: "As for blood, Wace," said Mr. Salt, the wool-factor, a bilious man, who
8120: only spoke when there was a good opportunity of contradicting, "ask my
8121: brother-in-law, Labron, a little about that. These Transomes are not the
8122: old blood."
8123: 
8124: "Well, they're the oldest that's forthcoming, I suppose," said Mr. Wace,
8125: laughing. "Unless you believe in mad old Tommy Trounsem. I wonder where
8126: that old poaching fellow is now."
8127: 
8128: "I saw him half-drunk the other day," said young Joyce. "He'd got a
8129: flag-basket with handbills in it over his shoulder."
8130: 
8131: "I thought the old fellow was dead," said Mr. Wace. "Hey! why, Jermyn,"
8132: he went on merrily, as he turned round and saw the attorney entering;
8133: "you Radical! how dare you show yourself in this Tory house? Come, this
8134: is going a bit too far. We don't mind Old Harry managing our law for
8135: us--that's his proper business from time immemorial; but----"
8136: 
8137: "But--a--" said Jermyn, smiling, always ready to carry on a joke, to
8138: which his slow manner gave the piquancy of surprise, "if he meddles with
8139: politics he must be a Tory."
8140: 
8141: Jermyn was not afraid to show himself anywhere in Treby. He knew many
8142: people were not exactly fond of him, but a man can do without that, if
8143: he is prosperous. A provincial lawyer in those old-fashioned days was as
8144: independent of personal esteem as if he had been a Lord Chancellor.
8145: 
8146: There was a good-humored laugh at this upper end of the room as Jermyn
8147: seated himself at about an equal angle between Mr. Wace and Christian.
8148: 
8149: "We were talking about old Tommy Trounsem; you remember him? They say
8150: he's turned up again," said Mr. Wace.
8151: 
8152: "Ah?" said Jermyn, indifferently. "But--a--Wace--I'm very busy
8153: to-day--but I wanted to see you about that bit of land of yours at the
8154: corner of Pod's End. I've had a handsome offer for you--I'm not at
8155: liberty to say from whom--but an offer that ought to tempt you."
8156: 
8157: "It won't tempt me," said Mr. Wace, peremptorily, "if I've got a bit of
8158: land, I'll keep it. It's hard enough to get hereabouts."
8159: 
8160: "Then I'm to understand that you refuse all negotiation?" said Jermyn,
8161: who had ordered a glass of sherry, and was looking around slowly as he
8162: sipped it, till his eyes seemed to rest for the first time on Christian,
8163: though he had seen him at once on entering the room.
8164: 
8165: "Unless one of the confounded railways should come. But then I'll stand
8166: out and make 'em bleed for it."
8167: 
8168: There was a murmur of approbation; the railways were a public wrong much
8169: denunciated in Treby.
8170: 
8171: "A--Mr. Philip Debarry at the Manor now?" said Jermyn, suddenly
8172: questioning Christian, in a haughty tone of superiority which he often
8173: chose to use.
8174: 
8175: "No," said Christian, "he is expected to-morrow morning."
8176: 
8177: "Ah!----" Jermyn paused a moment or two, and then said, "You are
8178: sufficiently in his confidence, I think, to carry a message to him with
8179: a small document?"
8180: 
8181: "Mr. Debarry has often trusted me so far," said Christian, with much
8182: coolness; "but if the business is yours, you can probably find some one
8183: you know better."
8184: 
8185: There was a little winking and grimacing among those of the company who
8186: heard this answer.
8187: 
8188: "A--true--a," said Jermyn, not showing any offence; "if you decline. But
8189: I think, if you will do me the favor to step round to my residence on
8190: your way back, and learn the business, you will prefer carrying it
8191: yourself. At my residence, if you please--not my office."
8192: 
8193: "Oh, very well," said Christian. "I shall be very happy." Christian
8194: never allowed himself to be treated as a servant by anyone but his
8195: master, and his master treated a servant more deferentially than an
8196: equal.
8197: 
8198: "Will it be five o'clock? what hour shall we say?" said Jermyn.
8199: 
8200: Christian looked at his watch and said, "About five I can be there."
8201: 
8202: "Very good," said Jermyn, finishing his sherry.
8203: 
8204: "Well--a--Wace--a--so you will hear nothing about Pod's End?"
8205: 
8206: "Not I."
8207: 
8208: "A mere pocket-handkerchief, not enough to swear by-a--" here Jermyn's
8209: face broke into a smile--"without a magnifying-glass."
8210: 
8211: "Never mind. It's mine into the bowels of the earth and up to the sky. I
8212: can build the Tower of Babel on it if I like--eh, Mr. Nolan?"
8213: 
8214: "A bad investment, my good sir," said Mr. Nolan, who enjoyed a certain
8215: flavor of infidelity in this smart reply, and laughed much at it in his
8216: inward way.
8217: 
8218: "See now, how blind you Tories are," said Jermyn, rising; "if I had been
8219: your lawyer, I'd have had you make another forty-shilling freeholder
8220: with that land, and all in time for this election. But--a--the _verbum
8221: sapientibus_ comes a little too late now."
8222: 
8223: Jermyn was moving away as he finished speaking, but Mr. Wace called out
8224: after him, "We're not so badly off for votes as you are--good sound
8225: votes, that'll stand the Revising Barrister. Debarry at the top of the
8226: poll!"
8227: 
8228: The lawyer was already out of the doorway.
8229: 
8230: 
8231: 
8232: 
8233: CHAPTER XXI.
8234: 
8235:     'Tis grievous that with all amplification of travel both by sea and
8236:     land, a man can never separate himself from his past history.
8237: 
8238: 
8239: Mr. Jermyn's handsome house stood a little way out of the town,
8240: surrounded by garden and lawn and plantations of hopeful trees. As
8241: Christian approached it he was in a perfectly easy state of mind: the
8242: business he was going on was none of his, otherwise than as he was well
8243: satisfied with any opportunity of making himself valuable to Mr. Philip
8244: Debarry. As he looked at Jermyn's length of wall and iron railing, he
8245: said to himself, "These lawyers are the fellows for getting on in the
8246: world with the least expense of civility. With this cursed conjuring
8247: secret of theirs called Law, they think everybody is frightened at them.
8248: My Lord Jermyn seems to have his insolence as ready as his soft sawder.
8249: He's as sleek as a rat, and has as vicious a tooth. I know the sort of
8250: vermin well enough. I've helped to fatten one or two."
8251: 
8252: In this mood of conscious, contemptuous penetration, Christian was shown
8253: by the footman into Jermyn's private room, where the attorney sat
8254: surrounded with massive oaken bookcases, and other furniture to
8255: correspond, from the thickest-legged library-table to the calendar frame
8256: and card-rack. It was the sort of a room a man prepares for himself when
8257: he feels sure of a long and respectable future. He was leaning back in
8258: his leather chair, against the broad window opening on the lawn, and had
8259: just taken off his spectacles and let the newspaper fall on his knees,
8260: in despair of reading by the fading light.
8261: 
8262: When the footman opened the door and said, "Mr. Christian," Jermyn said,
8263: "Good evening, Mr. Christian. Be seated," pointing to a chair opposite
8264: himself and the window. "Light the candles on the shelf, John, but leave
8265: the blinds alone."
8266: 
8267: He did not speak again till the man was gone out, but appeared to be
8268: referring to a document which lay on the bureau before him. When the
8269: door was closed he drew himself up again, began to rub his hands, and
8270: turned toward his visitor, who seemed perfectly indifferent to the fact
8271: that the attorney was in shadow, and that the light fell on himself.
8272: 
8273: "A--your name--a--is Henry Scaddon."
8274: 
8275: There was a start through Christian's frame which he was quick enough,
8276: almost simultaneously, to try and disguise as a change of position. He
8277: uncrossed his legs and unbuttoned his coat. But before he had time to
8278: say anything, Jermyn went on with slow emphasis.
8279: 
8280: "You were born on the sixteenth of December, 1782, at Blackheath. Your
8281: father was a cloth-merchant in London: he died when you were barely of
8282: age, leaving an extensive business: before you were five-and-twenty you
8283: had run through the greater part of the property, and had compromised
8284: your safety by an attempt to defraud your creditors. Subsequently you
8285: forged a check on your father's elder brother, who had intended to make
8286: you his heir."
8287: 
8288: Here Jermyn paused a moment and referred to the document. Christian was
8289: silent.
8290: 
8291: "In 1808 you found it expedient to leave this country in a military
8292: disguise, and were taken prisoner by the French. On the occasion of an
8293: exchange of prisoners you had the opportunity of returning to your own
8294: country, and to the bosom of your own family. You were generous enough
8295: to sacrifice that prospect in favor of a fellow-prisoner, of about your
8296: own age and figure, who had more pressing reasons than yourself for
8297: wishing to be on this side of the water. You exchanged dress, luggage,
8298: and names with him, and he passed to England instead of you as Henry
8299: Scaddon. Almost immediately afterward you escaped from your
8300: imprisonment, after feigning an illness which prevented your exchange of
8301: names from being discovered; and it was reported that you--that is, you
8302: under the name of your fellow-prisoner--were drowned in an open boat,
8303: trying to reach a Neapolitan vessel bound for Malta. Nevertheless I
8304: have to congratulate you on the falsehood of that report, and on the
8305: certainty that you are now, after the lapse of more than twenty years,
8306: seated here in perfect safety."
8307: 
8308: Jermyn paused so long that he was evidently awaiting some answer. At
8309: last Christian replied in a dogged tone--
8310: 
8311: "Well, sir, I've heard much longer stories than that told quite as
8312: solemnly, when there was not a word of truth in them. Suppose I deny the
8313: very peg you hang your statement on. Suppose I say I am not Henry
8314: Scaddon."
8315: 
8316: "A--in that case--a," said Jermyn, with wooden indifference, "you would
8317: lose the advantage which--a--may attach to your possession of Henry
8318: Scaddon's knowledge. And at the same time, if it were in the
8319: least--a--inconvenient to you that you should be recognized as Henry
8320: Scaddon, your denial would not prevent me from holding the knowledge and
8321: evidence which I possess on that point; it would only prevent us from
8322: pursuing the present conversation."
8323: 
8324: "Well, sir, suppose we admit, for the sake of the conversation, that
8325: your account of the matter is the true one: what advantage have you to
8326: offer the man named Henry Scaddon?"
8327: 
8328: "The advantage--a--is problematical; but it may be considerable. It
8329: might, in fact, release you from the necessity of acting as courier,
8330: or--a--valet, or whatever other office you may occupy which prevents you
8331: from being your own master. On the other hand, my acquaintance with your
8332: secret is not necessarily a disadvantage to you. To put the matter in a
8333: nutshell, I am not inclined--a--gratuitously--to do you any harm, and I
8334: may be able to do you a considerable service."
8335: 
8336: "Which you want me to earn somehow?" said Christian. "You offer me a
8337: turn in a lottery?"
8338: 
8339: "Precisely. The matter in question is of no earthly interest to you,
8340: except--a--as it may yield you a prize. We lawyers have to do with
8341: complicated questions, and--a--legal subtleties, which are
8342: never--a--fully known even to the parties immediately interested, still
8343: less to the witnesses. Shall we agree, then, that you continue to retain
8344: two-thirds of the name which you gained by exchange, and that you oblige
8345: me by answering certain questions as to the experience of Henry
8346: Scaddon?"
8347: 
8348: "Very good. Go on."
8349: 
8350: "What articles of property once belonging to your fellow-prisoner,
8351: Maurice Christian Bycliffe, do you still retain?"
8352: 
8353: "This ring," said Christian, twirling round the fine seal-ring on his
8354: finger, "his watch, and the little matters that hung with it, and a case
8355: of papers. I got rid of a gold snuff-box once when I was hard up. The
8356: clothes are all gone, of course. We exchanged everything; it was all
8357: done in a hurry. Bycliffe thought we should meet again in England before
8358: long, and he was mad to get there. But that was impossible--I mean that
8359: we should meet soon after. I don't know what's become of him, else I
8360: would give him up his papers and the watch, and so on--though, you know,
8361: it was I who did _him_ the service, and he felt that."
8362: 
8363: "You were at Vesoul together before being moved to Verdun?"
8364: 
8365: "Yes."
8366: 
8367: "What else do you know about Bycliffe?"
8368: 
8369: "Oh, nothing very particular," said Christian pausing, and rapping his
8370: boot with his cane. "He'd been in the Hanoverian army--a high-spirited
8371: fellow, took nothing easily; not over-strong in health. He made a fool
8372: of himself with marrying at Vesoul; and there was the devil to pay with
8373: the girl's relations; and then, when the prisoners were ordered off,
8374: they had to part. Whether they ever got together again I don't know."
8375: 
8376: "Was the marriage all right then?"
8377: 
8378: "Oh, all on the square--civil marriage, church--everything. Bycliffe was
8379: a fool--a good-natured, proud, headstrong fellow."
8380: 
8381: "How long did the marriage take place before you left Vesoul?"
8382: 
8383: "About three months. I was witness to the marriage."
8384: 
8385: "And you know no more about the wife?"
8386: 
8387: "Not afterward. I knew her very well before--pretty Annette--Annette
8388: Ledru was her name. She was of a good family, and they had made up a
8389: fine match for her. But she was one of your meek little diablesses, who
8390: have a will of their own once in their lives--the will to choose their
8391: own master."
8392: 
8393: "Bycliffe was not open to you about his other affairs?"
8394: 
8395: "Oh, no--a fellow you wouldn't dare to ask a question of. People told
8396: him everything, but he told nothing in return. If Madame Annette ever
8397: found him again, she found her lord and master with a vengeance; but she
8398: was a regular lapdog. However, her family shut her up--made a prisoner
8399: of her--to prevent her running away."
8400: 
8401: "Ah--good. Much of what you have been so obliging as to say is
8402: irrelevant to any possible purpose of mine, which, in fact, has only to
8403: do with a mouldy law-case that might be aired some day. You will
8404: doubtless, on your own account, maintain perfect silence on what has
8405: passed between us, and with that condition duly preserved--a--it is
8406: possible that--a--the lottery you have put into--as you observe--may
8407: turn up a prize."
8408: 
8409: "This, then, is all the business you have with me?" said Christian,
8410: rising.
8411: 
8412: "All. You will, of course, preserve carefully all the papers and other
8413: articles which have so many--a--recollections--a--attached to them?"
8414: 
8415: "Oh, yes. If there's any chance of Bycliffe turning up again, I shall be
8416: sorry to have parted with the snuff-box; but I was hard-up at Naples. In
8417: fact, as you see, I was obliged at last to turn courier."
8418: 
8419: "An exceedingly agreeable life for a man of some--a--accomplishments
8420: and--a--no income," said Jermyn, rising, and reaching a candle, which he
8421: placed against his desk.
8422: 
8423: Christian knew this was a sign that he was expected to go, but he
8424: lingered standing, with one hand on the back of his chair. At last, he
8425: said rather sulkily--
8426: 
8427: "I think you're too clever, Mr. Jermyn, not to perceive that I'm not a
8428: man to be made a fool of."
8429: 
8430: "Well--a--it may perhaps be a still better guarantee for you," said Jermyn,
8431: smiling, "that I see no use in attempting that--a--metamorphosis."
8432: 
8433: "The old gentleman, who ought never to have felt himself injured, is
8434: dead now, and I'm not afraid of creditors after more than twenty years."
8435: 
8436: "Certainly not;--a--there may indeed be claims which can't assert
8437: themselves--a--legally, which yet are molesting to a man of some
8438: reputation. But you may perhaps be happily free from such fears."
8439: 
8440: Jermyn drew round his chair toward the bureau, and Christian, too acute
8441: to persevere uselessly, said, "Good-day," and left the room.
8442: 
8443: After leaning back in his chair to reflect a few minutes, Jermyn wrote
8444: the following letter:--
8445: 
8446:     DEAR JOHNSON,--I learn from your letter, received this morning,
8447:     that you intend returning to town on Saturday.
8448: 
8449:     While you are there, be so good as to see Medwin, who used to be
8450:     with Batt & Cowley, and ascertain from him indirectly, and in the
8451:     course of conversation on other topics, whether in that old
8452:     business in 1810-11, Scaddon _alias_ Bycliffe, or Bycliffe _alias_
8453:     Scaddon, before his imprisonment, gave Batt & Cowley any reason to
8454:     believe that he was married and expected to have a child. The
8455:     question, as you know, is of no practical importance; but I wish to
8456:     draw up an abstract of the Bycliffe case, and the exact position in
8457:     which it stood before the suit was closed by the death of the
8458:     plaintiff, in order that, if Mr. Harold Transome desires it, he may
8459:     see how the failure of the last claim has secured the
8460:     Durfey-Transome title, and whether there is a hair's breadth of
8461:     chance that another claim should be set up.
8462: 
8463:     Of course there is not a shadow of such a chance. For even if Batt
8464:     & Cowley were to suppose that they had alighted on a surviving
8465:     representative of the Bycliffes, it would not enter their heads to
8466:     set up a new claim, since they brought evidence that the last life
8467:     which suspended the Bycliffe remainder was extinct before the case
8468:     was closed, a good twenty years ago.
8469: 
8470:     Still I want to show the present heir of the Durfey-Transomes the
8471:     exact condition of the family title to the estates. So get me an
8472:     answer from Medwin on the above mentioned point.
8473: 
8474:     I shall meet you at Duffield next week. We must get Transome
8475:     returned. Never mind his having been a little rough the other day,
8476:     but go on doing what you know is necessary for his interest. His
8477:     interest is mine, which I need not say is John Johnson's.
8478: 
8479:                 Yours faithfully,                MATTHEW JERMYN.
8480: 
8481: When the attorney had sealed this letter and leaned back in his chair
8482: again, he was inwardly saying--
8483: 
8484: "Now, Mr. Harold, I shall shut up this affair in a private drawer till
8485: you choose to take any extreme measures which will force me to bring it
8486: out. I have the matter entirely in my own power. No one but old Lyon
8487: knows about the girl's birth. No one but Scaddon can clench the evidence
8488: about Bycliffe, and I've got Scaddon under my thumb. No soul except
8489: myself and Johnson, who is a limb of myself, knows that there is one
8490: half-dead life which may presently leave the girl a new claim to the
8491: Bycliffe heirship. I shall learn through Methurst whether Batt & Cowley
8492: knew, through Bycliffe, of this woman having come to England. I shall
8493: hold all the threads between my thumb and finger. I can use the evidence
8494: or I can nullify it.
8495: 
8496: "And so, if Mr. Harold pushes me to extremity, and threatens me with
8497: chancery and ruin, I have an opposing threat, which will either save me
8498: or turn into a punishment for him."
8499: 
8500: He rose, put out his candles, and stood with his back to the fire,
8501: looking out on the dim lawn, with its black twilight fringe of shrubs,
8502: still meditating. Quick thought was gleaming over five-and-thirty years
8503: filled with devices more or less clever, more or less desirable to be
8504: avowed. Those which might be avowed with impunity were not always to be
8505: distinguished as innocent by comparison with those which it was
8506: advisable to conceal. In a profession where much that is noxious may be
8507: done without disgrace, is a conscience likely to be without balm when
8508: circumstances have urged a man to overstep the line where his good
8509: technical information makes him aware that (with discovery) disgrace is
8510: likely to begin?
8511: 
8512: With regard to the Transome affairs, the family had been in pressing
8513: need of money, and it had lain with him to get it for them: was it to be
8514: expected that he would not consider his own advantage where he had
8515: rendered services such as are never fully paid? If it came to a question
8516: of right and wrong instead of law, the least justifiable things he had
8517: ever done had been done on behalf of the Transomes. It had been a
8518: deucedly unpleasant thing for him to get Bycliffe arrested and thrown
8519: into prison as Henry Scaddon--perhaps hastening the man's death in that
8520: way. But if it had not been done by dint of his (Jermyn's) exertions and
8521: tact, he would like to know where the Durfey-Transomes might have been
8522: by this time. As for right or wrong, if the truth were known, the very
8523: possession of the estate by the Durfey-Transomes was owing to law-tricks
8524: that took place nearly a century ago, when the original old Durfey got
8525: his base fee.
8526: 
8527: But inward argument of this sort now, as always, was merged in anger, in
8528: exasperation, that Harold, precisely Harold Transome, should have turned
8529: out to be the probable instrument of a visitation which would be bad
8530: luck, not justice; for is there any justice where ninety-nine out of
8531: every hundred escape? He felt himself beginning to hate Harold as he had
8532: never--
8533: 
8534: Just then Jermyn's third daughter, a tall slim girl, wrapped in a white
8535: woollen shawl, which she had hung over her blanket-wise, skipped across
8536: the lawn toward the greenhouse to get a flower. Jermyn was startled, and
8537: did not identify the figure, or rather he identified it falsely with
8538: another tall white-wrapped figure which had sometimes set his heart
8539: beating quickly more than thirty years before. For a moment he was fully
8540: back in those distant years when he and another bright-eyed person had
8541: seen no reason why they should not indulge their passion and their
8542: vanity, and determine for themselves how their lives should be made
8543: delightful in spite of unalterable external conditions. The reasons had
8544: been unfolding themselves gradually ever since through all the years
8545: which had converted the handsome, soft-eyed, slim young Jermyn (with a
8546: touch of sentiment) into a portly lawyer of sixty, for whom life had
8547: resolved itself into the means of keeping up his head among his
8548: professional brethren and maintaining an establishment--into a
8549: gray-haired husband and father, whose third affectionate and expensive
8550: daughter now rapped at the window and called to him, "Papa, papa, get
8551: ready for dinner; don't you remember that the Lukyns are coming?"
8552: 
8553: 
8554: 
8555: 
8556: CHAPTER XXII.
8557: 
8558:     Her gentle looks shot arrows, piercing him
8559:     As gods are pierced, with poison of sweet pity.
8560: 
8561: 
8562: The evening of the market-day had passed, and Felix had not looked in at
8563: Malthouse Yard to talk over the public events with Mr. Lyon. When Esther
8564: was dressing the next morning, she had reached a point of irritated
8565: anxiety to see Felix, at which she found herself devising little schemes
8566: for attaining that end in some way that would be so elaborate as to seem
8567: perfectly natural. Her watch had a long-standing ailment of losing;
8568: possibly it wanted cleaning; Felix would tell her if it merely wanted
8569: regulating, whereas Mr. Prowd might detain it unnecessarily, and cause
8570: her useless inconvenience. Or could she not get a valuable hint from
8571: Mrs. Holt about the home-made bread, which was something as "sad" as
8572: Lyddy herself? Or, if she came home that way at twelve o'clock, Felix
8573: might be going out, she might meet him, and not be obliged to call.
8574: Or--but it would be very much beneath her to take any steps of this
8575: sort. Her watch had been losing for the last two months--why should it
8576: not go on losing a little longer? She could think of no devices that
8577: were not so transparent as to be undignified. All the more undignified
8578: because Felix chose to live in a way that would prevent any one from
8579: classing him according to his education and mental refinement--"which
8580: certainly are very high," said Esther, inwardly, coloring, as if in
8581: answer to some contrary allegation, "else I should not think his opinion
8582: of any consequence." But she came to the conclusion that she could not
8583: possibly call at Mrs. Holt's.
8584: 
8585: It followed that, up to a few minutes past twelve, when she reached the
8586: turning toward Mrs. Holt's, she believed that she should go home the
8587: other way; but at the last moment there is always a reason not existing
8588: before--namely, the impossibility of further vacillation. Esther turned
8589: the corner without any visible pause, and in another minute was knocking
8590: at Mrs. Holt's door, not without an inward flutter, which she was bent
8591: on disguising.
8592: 
8593: "It's never you, Miss Lyon! who'd have thought of seeing you at this
8594: time? Is the minister ill? I thought he looked creechy. If you want
8595: help, I'll put my bonnet on."
8596: 
8597: "Don't keep Miss Lyon at the door, mother; ask her to come in," said the
8598: ringing voice of Felix, surmounting various small shufflings and
8599: babbling voices within.
8600: 
8601: "It's my wish for her to come in, I'm sure," said Mrs. Holt, making way;
8602: "but what is there for her to come in to? a floor worse than any public.
8603: But step in, pray, if you're so inclined. When I've been forced to take
8604: my bit of carpet up, and have benches, I don't see why I need mind
8605: nothing no more."
8606: 
8607: "I only came to ask Mr. Holt if he would look at my watch for me," said
8608: Esther, entering, and blushing a general rose-color.
8609: 
8610: "He'll do that fast enough," said Mrs. Holt, with emphasis; "that's one
8611: of the things he _will_ do."
8612: 
8613: "Excuse my rising, Miss Lyon," said Felix; "I'm binding up Job's
8614: finger."
8615: 
8616: Job was a small fellow about five, with a germinal nose, large round
8617: blue eyes, and red hair that curled close to his head like the wool on
8618: the back of an infantine lamb. He had evidently been crying, and the
8619: corners of his mouth were still dolorous. Felix held him on his knee as
8620: he bound and tied up very cleverly a tiny forefinger. There was a table
8621: in front of Felix and against the window, covered with his watchmaking
8622: implements and some open books. Two benches stood at right angles on the
8623: sanded floor, and six or seven boys of various ages up to twelve were
8624: getting their caps and preparing to go home. They huddled themselves
8625: together and stood still when Esther entered. Felix could not look up
8626: till he had finished his surgery, but he went on speaking.
8627: 
8628: "This is a hero, Miss Lyon. This is Job Tudge, a bold Briton whose
8629: finger hurts him, but who doesn't mean to cry. Good-morning, boys. Don't
8630: lose your time. Get out into the air."
8631: 
8632: Esther seated herself on the end of the bench near Felix, much relieved
8633: that Job was the immediate object of attention; and the other boys
8634: rushed out behind her with a brief chant of "Good-morning!"
8635: 
8636: "Did you ever see," said Mrs. Holt, standing to look on, "how wonderful
8637: Felix is at that small work with his large fingers? And that's because
8638: he learned doctoring. It isn't for want of cleverness he looks like a
8639: poor man, Miss Lyon. I've left off speaking, else I should say it's a
8640: sin and a shame."
8641: 
8642: [Illustration: FELIX HOLT AND JOB TUDGE.]
8643: 
8644: "Mother," said Felix, who often amused himself and kept good-humored by
8645: giving his mother answers that were unintelligible to her, "you have an
8646: astonishing readiness in the Ciceronian antiphrasis, considering you
8647: have never studied oratory. There, Job--thou patient man--sit still if
8648: thou wilt; and now we can look at Miss Lyon."
8649: 
8650: Esther had taken off her watch and was holding it in her hand. But he
8651: looked at her face, or rather at her eyes, as he said, "You want me to
8652: doctor your watch?"
8653: 
8654: Esther's expression was appealing and timid, as it had never been before
8655: in Felix's presence; but when she saw the perfect calmness, which to her
8656: seemed coldness, of his clear gray eyes, as if he saw no reason for
8657: attaching any emphasis to this first meeting, a pang swift as an
8658: electric shock darted through her. She had been very foolish to think so
8659: much of it. It seemed to her as if her inferiority to Felix made a gulf
8660: between them. She could not at once rally her pride and self-command,
8661: but let her glance fall on her watch, and said, rather tremulously, "It
8662: loses. It is very troublesome. It has been losing a long while."
8663: 
8664: Felix took the watch from her hand; then, looking round and seeing that
8665: his mother was gone out of the room, he said, very gently--
8666: 
8667: "You look distressed, Miss Lyon. I hope there is no trouble at home"
8668: (Felix was thinking of the minister's agitation on the previous Sunday).
8669: "But I ought perhaps to beg your pardon for saying so much."
8670: 
8671: Poor Esther was quite helpless. The mortification which had come like a
8672: bruise to all the sensibilities that had been in keen activity, insisted
8673: on some relief. Her eyes filled instantly, and a great tear rolled down
8674: while she said in a loud sort of whisper, as involuntary as her tears--
8675: 
8676: "I wanted to tell you that I was not offended--that I am not
8677: ungenerous--I thought you might think--but you have not thought of it."
8678: 
8679: Was there ever more awkward speaking?--or any behavior less like that of
8680: the graceful, self-possessed Miss Lyon, whose phrases were usually so
8681: well turned, and whose repartees were so ready?
8682: 
8683: For a moment there was silence. Esther had her two little
8684: delicately-gloved hands clasped on the table. The next moment she felt
8685: one hand of Felix covering them both and pressing them firmly; but he
8686: did not speak. The tears were both on her cheeks now, and she could look
8687: up at him. His eyes had an expression of sadness in them, quite new to
8688: her. Suddenly little Job, who had his mental exercises on the occasion,
8689: called out, impatiently--
8690: 
8691: "She's tut her finger!"
8692: 
8693: Felix and Esther laughed, and drew their hands away; and as Esther took
8694: her handkerchief to wipe the tears from her cheeks she said--
8695: 
8696: "You see, Job, I am a naughty coward. I can't help crying when I've hurt
8697: myself."
8698: 
8699: "Zoo soodn't kuy," said Job energetically, being much impressed with a
8700: moral doctrine which had come to him after a sufficient transgression of
8701: it.
8702: 
8703: "Job is like me," said Felix, "fonder of preaching than of practice. But
8704: let us look at this same watch," he went on, opening and examining it.
8705: "These little Geneva toys are cleverly constructed to go always a little
8706: wrong. But if you wind them up and set them regularly every night, you
8707: may know at least that it's not noon when the hand points there."
8708: 
8709: Felix chatted, that Esther might recover herself; but now Mrs. Holt came
8710: back and apologized.
8711: 
8712: "You'll excuse my going away, I know, Miss Lyon. But there were the
8713: dumplings to see to, and what little I've got left on my hands now I
8714: like to do well. Not but what I've more cleaning to do than ever I had
8715: in my life before, as you may tell soon enough if you look at this
8716: floor. But when you've been used to doing things, and they've been taken
8717: away from you, it's as if your hands had been cut off, and you felt the
8718: fingers as are of no use to you."
8719: 
8720: "That's a great image, mother," said Felix, as he snapped the watch
8721: together and handed it to Esther; "I never heard you use such an image
8722: before."
8723: 
8724: "Yes, I know you've always some fault to find with what your mother
8725: says. But if ever there was a woman could talk with the open Bible
8726: before her, and not be afraid, it's me. I never did tell stories, and I
8727: never will--though I know it's done, Miss Lyon, and by church members
8728: too, when they have candles to sell, as I could bring you to the proof.
8729: But I never was one of 'em, let Felix say what he will about the
8730: printing on the tickets. His father believed it was gospel truth, and
8731: it's presumptuous to say it wasn't. For as for curing, how can anybody
8732: know? There's no physic'll cure without a blessing, and _with_ a
8733: blessing I know I've seen a mustard plaister work when there was no more
8734: smell nor strength in the mustard than so much flour. And reason
8735: good--for the mustard had lain in paper nobody knows how long--so I'll
8736: leave you to guess."
8737: 
8738: Mrs. Holt looked hard out of the window and gave a slight, inarticulate
8739: sound of scorn.
8740: 
8741: Felix had leaned back in his chair with a resigned smile, and was
8742: pinching Job's ears.
8743: 
8744: Esther said, "I think I had better go now," not knowing what else to
8745: say, yet not wishing to go immediately, lest she should seem to be
8746: running away from Mrs. Holt. She felt keenly how much endurance there
8747: must be for Felix. And she had often been discontented with her father,
8748: and called him tiresome!
8749: 
8750: "Where does Job Tudge live?" she said, still sitting and looking at the
8751: droll little figure, set off by a ragged jacket with a tail about two
8752: inches deep sticking out above the funniest of corduroys.
8753: 
8754: "Job has two mansions," said Felix. "He lives here chiefly; but he has
8755: another home, where his grandfather, Mr. Tudge, the stone-breaker,
8756: lives. My mother is very good to Job, Miss Lyon. She has made him a
8757: little bed in a cupboard, and she gives him sweetened porridge."
8758: 
8759: The exquisite goodness implied in these words of Felix impressed Esther
8760: the more, because in her hearing his talk had usually been pungent and
8761: denunciatory. Looking at Mrs. Holt, she saw that her eyes had lost their
8762: bleak north-easterly expression, and were shining with some mildness on
8763: little Job, who had turned round toward her, propping his head against
8764: Felix.
8765: 
8766: "Well, why shouldn't I be motherly to the child, Miss Lyon?" said Mrs.
8767: Holt, whose strong powers of argument required the file of an imagined
8768: contradiction, if there were no real one at hand. "I never was
8769: hard-hearted, and I never will be. It was Felix picked the child up and
8770: took to him, you may be sure, for there's nobody else master where he
8771: is; but I wasn't going to beat the orphan child and abuse him because of
8772: that, and him as straight as an arrow when he's stripped, and me so fond
8773: of children, and only had one of my own to live. I'd three babies, Miss
8774: Lyon, but the blessed Lord only spared Felix, and him the masterfulest
8775: and brownest of 'em all. But I did my duty by him, and I said, he'll
8776: have more schooling than his father, and he'll grow up a doctor, and
8777: marry a woman with money to furnish--as I was myself, spoons and
8778: everything--and I shall have the grandchildren to look up to me, and be
8779: drove out in the gig sometimes, like old Mrs. Lukyn. And you see what
8780: it's all come to, Miss Lyon: here's Felix made a common man of himself,
8781: and says he'll never be married--which is the most unreasonable thing,
8782: and him never easy but when he's got the child on his lap, or when----"
8783: 
8784: "Stop, stop, mother," Felix burst in; "pray don't use that limping
8785: argument again--that a man should marry because he's fond of children.
8786: That's a reason for not marrying. A bachelor's children are always
8787: young: they're immortal children--always lisping, waddling, helpless,
8788: and with a chance of turning out good."
8789: 
8790: "The Lord above may know what you mean! And haven't other folks's
8791: children a chance of turning out good?"
8792: 
8793: "Oh, they grow out of it very fast. Here's Job Tudge now," said Felix,
8794: turning the little one round on his knee, and holding his head by the
8795: back--"Job's limbs will get lanky; this little fist that looks like a
8796: puff-ball and can hide nothing bigger than a gooseberry, will get large
8797: and bony, and perhaps want to clutch more than its share; these wide
8798: blue eyes that tell me more truth than Job knows, will narrow and narrow
8799: and try to hide truth that Job would be better without knowing; this
8800: little negative nose will become long and self-asserting; and this
8801: little tongue--put out thy tongue, Job"--Job, awe-struck under this
8802: ceremony, put out a little red tongue very timidly--"this tongue, hardly
8803: bigger than a rose-leaf, will get large and thick, wag out of season, do
8804: mischief, brag and cant for gain or vanity, and cut as cruelly, for all
8805: its clumsiness, as if it were a sharp-edged blade. Big Job will perhaps
8806: be naughty--" As Felix, speaking with the loud emphatic distinctness
8807: habitual to him, brought out this terribly familiar word, Job's sense of
8808: mystification became too painful: he hung his lip and began to cry.
8809: 
8810: "See here," said Mrs. Holt, "you're frightening the innocent child with
8811: such talk--and it's enough to frighten them that think themselves the
8812: safest."
8813: 
8814: "Look here, Job, my man," said Felix, setting the boy down and turning
8815: him toward Esther; "go to Miss Lyon, ask her to smile at you, and that
8816: will dry up your tears like the sunshine."
8817: 
8818: Job put his two brown fists on Esther's lap, and she stooped to kiss
8819: him. Then holding his face between her hands she said, "Tell Mr. Holt we
8820: don't mean to be naughty, Job. He should believe in us more. But now I
8821: must really go home."
8822: 
8823: Esther rose and held out her hand to Mrs. Holt, who kept it while she
8824: said, a little to Esther's confusion--
8825: 
8826: "I'm very glad it's took your fancy to come here sometimes, Miss Lyon. I
8827: know you're thought to hold your head high, but I speak of people as I
8828: find 'em. And I'm sure anybody had need be humble that comes where
8829: there's a floor like this--for I've put by my best tea-trays, they're so
8830: out of all character--I must look Above for comfort now; but I don't say
8831: I'm not worthy to be called on for all that."
8832: 
8833: Felix had risen and moved toward the door that he might open it and
8834: shield Esther from more last words on his mother's part.
8835: 
8836: "Good-bye, Mr. Holt."
8837: 
8838: "Will Mr. Lyon like for me to sit with him an hour this evening, do you
8839: think?"
8840: 
8841: "Why not? He always likes to see you."
8842: 
8843: "Then I will come. Good-bye."
8844: 
8845: "She's a very straight figure," said Mrs. Holt. "How she carries
8846: herself! But I doubt there's some truth in what our people say. If she
8847: won't look at young Muscat, it's the better for _him_. He'd need have a
8848: big fortune that marries her."
8849: 
8850: "That's true, mother," said Felix, sitting down, snatching up little
8851: Job, and finding a vent for some unspeakable feeling in the pretence of
8852: worrying him.
8853: 
8854: Esther was rather melancholy as she went home, yet happier withal than
8855: she had been for many days before. She thought, "I need not mind having
8856: shown so much anxiety about his opinion. He is too clear-sighted to
8857: mistake our mutual position; he is quite above putting a false
8858: interpretation on what I have done. Besides, he had not thought of me at
8859: all--I saw that plainly enough. Yet he was very kind. There is something
8860: greater and better in him than I had imagined. His behavior to-day--to
8861: his mother and me too--I should call it the highest gentlemanliness,
8862: only it seems in him to be something deeper. But he has chosen an
8863: intolerable life; though I suppose, if I had a mind equal to his, and if
8864: he loved me very dearly, I should choose the same life."
8865: 
8866: Esther felt that she had prefixed an impossible "if" to that result. But
8867: now she had known Felix her conception of what a happy love must be had
8868: become like a dissolving view, in which the once-dear images were
8869: gradually melting into new forms and new colors. The favorite Byronic
8870: heroes were beginning to look like last night's decorations seen in the
8871: sober dawn. So fast does a little leaven spread within us--so
8872: incalculable is one personality on another. Behind all Esther's
8873: thoughts, like an unacknowledged yet constraining presence, there was
8874: the sense, that if Felix Holt were to love her, her life would be
8875: exalted into something quite new--into a sort of difficult blessedness,
8876: such as one may imagine in beings who are conscious of painfully growing
8877: into possession of higher powers.
8878: 
8879: It was quite true that Felix had not thought the more of Esther because
8880: of that Sunday afternoon's interview which had shaken her mind to the
8881: very roots. He had avoided intruding on Mr. Lyon without special reason,
8882: because he believed the minister to be preoccupied with some private
8883: care. He had thought a great deal of Esther with a mixture of strong
8884: disapproval and strong liking, which both together made a feeling the
8885: reverse of indifference; but he was not going to let her have any
8886: influence on his life. Even if his determination had not been fixed, he
8887: would have believed that she would utterly scorn him in any other light
8888: than that of an acquaintance, and the emotion she had shown to-day did
8889: not change that belief. But he was deeply touched by this manifestation
8890: of her better qualities, and felt that there was a new tie of friendship
8891: between them. That was the brief history Felix would have given of his
8892: relation to Esther. And he was accustomed to observe himself. But very
8893: close and diligent looking at living creatures, even through the best
8894: microscope, will leave room for new and contradictory discoveries.
8895: 
8896: Felix found Mr. Lyon particularly glad to talk to him. The minister had
8897: never yet disburdened himself about his letter to Mr. Philip Debarry
8898: concerning the public conference; and as by this time he had all the
8899: heads of his discussion thoroughly in his mind, it was agreeable to
8900: recite them, as well as to express his regret that time had been lost by
8901: Mr. Debarry's absence from the Manor, which had prevented the immediate
8902: fulfillment of his pledge.
8903: 
8904: "I don't see how he can fulfill it if the rector refuses," said Felix,
8905: thinking it well to moderate the little man's confidence.
8906: 
8907: "The rector is of a spirit that will not incur earthly impeachment, and
8908: he cannot refuse what is necessary to his nephew's honorable discharge
8909: of an obligation," said Mr. Lyon. "My young friend, it is a case wherein
8910: the prearranged conditions tend by such a beautiful fitness to the issue
8911: I have sought, that I should have forever held myself a traitor to my
8912: charge had I neglected the indication."
8913: 
8914: 
8915: 
8916: 
8917: CHAPTER XXIII.
8918: 
8919:     "I will not excuse you; you shall not be excused; excuses shall not
8920:     be admitted; there's no excuse shall serve; you shall not be
8921:     excused."--_Henry IV._
8922: 
8923: 
8924: When Philip Debarry had come home that morning and read the letters
8925: which had not been forwarded to him, he laughed so heartily at Mr.
8926: Lyon's that he congratulated himself on being in his private room.
8927: Otherwise his laughter would have awakened the curiosity of Sir Maximus,
8928: and Philip did not wish to tell any one the contents of the letter until
8929: he had shown them to his uncle. He determined to ride over to the
8930: rectory to lunch; for as Lady Mary was away, he and his uncle might be
8931: _tête-á-tête_.
8932: 
8933: The rectory was on the other side of the river, close to the church of
8934: which it was the fitting companion: a fine old brick-and-stone house,
8935: with a great bow-window opening from the library on to the deep-turfed
8936: lawn, one fat dog sleeping on the door-stone, another fat dog waddling
8937: on the gravel, the autumn leaves duly swept away, the lingering
8938: chrysanthemums cherished, tall trees stooping or soaring in the most
8939: picturesque variety, and a Virginian creeper turning a little rustic hut
8940: into a scarlet pavilion. It was one of those rectories which are among
8941: the bulwarks of our venerable institutions--which arrest disintegrating
8942: doubt, serve as a double embankment against Popery and Dissent, and
8943: rally feminine instinct and affection to reinforce the decisions of
8944: masculine thought.
8945: 
8946: "What makes you look so merry, Phil?" said the rector, as his nephew
8947: entered the pleasant library.
8948: 
8949: "Something that concerns you," said Philip, taking out the letter. "A
8950: clerical challenge. Here's an opportunity for you to emulate the divines
8951: of the sixteenth century and have a theological duel. Read this letter."
8952: 
8953: "What answer have you sent the crazy little fellow?" said the rector,
8954: keeping the letter in his hand and running over it again and again, with
8955: brow knit, but eyes gleaming without any malignity.
8956: 
8957: "Oh, I sent no answer. I awaited yours."
8958: 
8959: "Mine!" said the rector, throwing down the letter on the table. "You
8960: don't suppose I'm going to hold a public debate with a schismatic of
8961: that sort? I should have an infidel shoemaker next expecting me to
8962: answer blasphemies delivered in bad grammar."
8963: 
8964: "But you see how he puts it," said Philip. With all his gravity of
8965: nature he could not resist a slightly mischievous prompting, though he
8966: had a serious feeling that he should not like to be regarded as failing
8967: to fulfill his pledge. "I think if you refuse, I shall be obliged to
8968: offer myself."
8969: 
8970: "Nonsense! Tell him he is himself acting a dishonorable part in
8971: interpreting your words as a pledge to do any preposterous thing that
8972: suits his fancy. Suppose he had asked you to give him land to build a
8973: chapel on; doubtless that would have given him a 'lively satisfaction.'
8974: A man who puts a non-natural, strained sense on a promise is no better
8975: than a robber."
8976: 
8977: "But he has not asked for land. I dare say he thinks you won't object to
8978: his proposal. I confess there's a simplicity and quaintness about the
8979: letter that rather pleases me."
8980: 
8981: "Let me tell you, Phil, he's a crazy little firefly, that does a great
8982: deal of harm in my parish. He inflames the Dissenters' minds on
8983: politics. There's no end to the mischief done by these busy, prating
8984: men. They make the ignorant multitude the judges of the largest
8985: questions, both political and religious, till we shall soon have no
8986: institution left that is not on a level with the comprehension of a
8987: huckster or a drayman. There can be nothing more retrograde--losing all
8988: the results of civilization, all the lessons of Providence--letting the
8989: windlass run down after men have been turning at it painfully for
8990: generations. If the instructed are not to judge for the uninstructed,
8991: why, let us set Dick Stubbs to make our almanacs, and have a President
8992: of the Royal Society elected by universal suffrage."
8993: 
8994: The rector had risen, placed himself with his back to the fire, and
8995: thrust his hands in his pockets, ready to insist further on this wide
8996: argument. Philip sat nursing one leg, listening respectfully, as he
8997: always did, though often listening to the sonorous echo of his own
8998: statements, which suited his uncle's needs so exactly that he did not
8999: distinguish them from his own impressions.
9000: 
9001: "True," said Philip; "but in special cases we have to do with special
9002: conditions. You know I defend the casuists. And it may happen that, for
9003: the honor of the church in Treby, and a little also for my honor,
9004: circumstances may demand a concession even to some notions of a
9005: Dissenting preacher."
9006: 
9007: "Not at all. I should be making a figure which my brother clergy might
9008: well take as an affront to themselves. The character of the
9009: Establishment has suffered enough already through the Evangelicals, with
9010: their extempore incoherence and their pipe-smoking piety. Look at
9011: Wimple, the man who is vicar of Shuttleton--without his gown and bands
9012: anybody would take him for a grocer in mourning."
9013: 
9014: "Well, I shall cut a still worse figure, and so will you, in the
9015: Dissenting magazines and newspapers. It will go the round of the
9016: kingdom. There will be a paragraph headed, 'Tory Falsehood and Clerical
9017: Cowardice,' or else, 'The Meanness of the Aristocracy and the
9018: Incompetence of the Beneficed Clergy.'"
9019: 
9020: "There would be a worse paragraph if I were to consent to the debate. Of
9021: course it would be said that I was beaten hollow, and, that now the
9022: question had been cleared up at Treba Magna, the Church had not a sound
9023: leg to stand on. Besides," the rector went on, frowning and smiling,
9024: "it's all very well for you to talk, Phil; but this debating is not so
9025: easy when a man's close upon sixty. What one writes or says must be
9026: something good and scholarly; and, after all had been done, this little
9027: Lyon would buzz about one like a wasp, and cross-question and rejoin.
9028: Let me tell you, a plain truth may be so worried and mauled by fallacies
9029: as to get the worst of it. There's no such thing as tiring a
9030: talking-machine like Lyon."
9031: 
9032: "Then you absolutely refuse?"
9033: 
9034: "Yes, I do."
9035: 
9036: "You remember that when I wrote my letter of thanks to Lyon you approved
9037: my offer to serve him if possible."
9038: 
9039: "Certainly I remember it. But suppose he had asked you to vote for civil
9040: marriage, or to go and hear him preach every Sunday?"
9041: 
9042: "But he has not asked that."
9043: 
9044: "Something as unreasonable, though."
9045: 
9046: "Well," said Philip, taking up Mr. Lyon's letter and looking
9047: graver--looking even vexed, "it is rather an unpleasant business for me.
9048: I really felt obliged to him. I think there's a sort of worth in the man
9049: beyond his class. Whatever may be the reason of the case, I shall
9050: disappoint him instead of doing him the service I offered."
9051: 
9052: "Well, that's a misfortune; we can't help it."
9053: 
9054: "The worst of it is, I should be insulting him to say, 'I will do
9055: anything else, but not just this that you want.' He evidently feels
9056: himself in company with Luther and Zwingle and Calvin, and considers our
9057: letters part of the history of Protestantism."
9058: 
9059: "Yes, yes. I know it's rather an unpleasant thing, Phil. You are aware
9060: that I would have done anything in reason to prevent you from becoming
9061: unpopular here. I consider your character a possession to all of us."
9062: 
9063: "I think I must call on him forthwith and explain and apologize."
9064: 
9065: "No, sit still; I've thought of something," said the rector, with a
9066: sudden revival of spirits. "I've just seen Sherlock coming in. He is to
9067: lunch with me to-day. It would do no harm for him to hold the debate--a
9068: curate and a young man--he'll gain by it; and it would release you from
9069: any awkwardness, Phil. Sherlock is not going to stay here long, you
9070: know; he'll soon have his title. I'll put the thing to him. He won't
9071: object if I wish it. It's a capital idea. It will do Sherlock good. He's
9072: a clever fellow, but he wants confidence."
9073: 
9074: Philip had not time to object before Mr. Sherlock appeared--a young
9075: divine of good birth and figure, of sallow complexion and bashful
9076: address.
9077: 
9078: "Sherlock, you have come in most opportunely," said the rector. "A case
9079: has turned up in the parish in which you can be of eminent use. I know
9080: that is what you have desired ever since you have been with me. But I'm
9081: about so much myself that there really has not been sphere enough for
9082: you. You are a studious man, I know; I dare say you have all the
9083: necessary matter prepared--at your finger-ends, if not on paper."
9084: 
9085: Mr. Sherlock smiled with rather a trembling lip, willing to distinguish
9086: himself, but hoping that the rector only alluded to a dialogue on
9087: Baptism by Aspersion, or some other pamphlet suited to the purposes of
9088: the Christian Knowledge Society. But as the rector proceeded to unfold
9089: the circumstances under which his eminent service was to be rendered, he
9090: grew more and more nervous.
9091: 
9092: "You'll oblige me very much, Sherlock," the rector ended, "by going into
9093: this thing zealously. Can you guess what time you will require? because
9094: it will rest with us to fix the day."
9095: 
9096: "I should be rejoiced to oblige you, Mr. Debarry, but I really think I
9097: am not competent to----"
9098: 
9099: "That's your modesty, Sherlock. Don't let me hear any more of that. I
9100: know Filmore of Corpus said you might be a first-rate man if your
9101: diffidence didn't do you injustice. And you can refer anything to me,
9102: you know. Come, you will set about the thing at once. But, Phil, you
9103: must tell the preacher to send a scheme of the debate--all the different
9104: heads--and he must agree to keep rigidly within the scheme. There, sit
9105: down at my desk and write the letter now; Thomas shall carry it."
9106: 
9107: Philip sat down to write, and the rector, with his firm ringing voice,
9108: went on at his ease, giving "indications" to his agitated curate.
9109: 
9110: "But you can begin at once preparing a good, cogent, clear statement,
9111: and considering the probable points of assault. You can look into Jewel,
9112: Hall, Hooker, Whitgift, and the rest: you'll find them all here. My
9113: library wants nothing in English divinity. Sketch the lower ground taken
9114: by Usher and those men, but bring all your force to bear on marking out
9115: the true High-Church doctrine. Expose the wretched cavils of the
9116: Noncomformists, and the noisy futility that belongs to schismatics
9117: generally. I will give you a telling passage from Burke on the
9118: Dissenters, and some good quotations which I brought together in two
9119: sermons of my own on the Position of the English Church in Christendom.
9120: How long do you think it will take you to bring your thoughts together?
9121: You can throw them afterward into the form of an essay; we'll have the
9122: thing printed; it will do you good with the Bishop."
9123: 
9124: With all Mr. Sherlock's timidity, there was fascination for him in this
9125: distinction. He reflected that he could take coffee and sit up late, and
9126: perhaps produce something rather fine. It might be a first step toward
9127: that eminence which it was no more than his duty to aspire to. Even a
9128: polemical fame like that of a Philpotts must have had a beginning. Mr.
9129: Sherlock was not insensible to the pleasure of turning sentences
9130: successfully, and it was a pleasure not always unconnected with
9131: preferment. A diffident man likes the idea of doing something
9132: remarkable, which will create belief in him without any immediate
9133: display of brilliancy. Celebrity may blush and be silent, and win a
9134: grace the more. Thus Mr. Sherlock was constrained, trembling all the
9135: while, and much wishing that his essay were already in print.
9136: 
9137: "I think I could hardly be ready under a fortnight."
9138: 
9139: "Very good. Just write that, Phil, and tell him to fix the precise day
9140: and place. And then we'll go to lunch."
9141: 
9142: The rector was quite satisfied. He had talked himself into thinking that
9143: he should like to give Sherlock a few useful hints, look up his own
9144: earlier sermons, and benefit the curate by his criticism, when the
9145: argument had been got into shape. He was a healthy-natured man, but that
9146: was not at all a reason why he should not have those sensibilities to
9147: the odor of authorship which belong to almost everybody who is not
9148: expected to be a writer--and especially to that form of authorship
9149: which is called suggestion, and consists in telling another man that he
9150: might do a great deal with a given subject, by bringing a sufficient
9151: amount of knowledge, reasoning, and wit to bear upon it.
9152: 
9153: Philip would have had some twinges of conscience about the curate, if he
9154: had not guessed that the honor thrust upon him was not altogether
9155: disagreeable. The Church might perhaps have had a stronger supporter;
9156: but for himself, he had done what he was bound to do: he had done his
9157: best toward fulfilling Mr. Lyon's desire.
9158:

9162: CHAPTER XXIV.
9163: 
9164:     If he come not, the play is marred.--_Midsummer Night's Dream._
9165: 
9166: 
9167: Rufus Lyon was very happy on that mild November morning appointed for
9168: the great conference in the larger room at the Free School, between
9169: himself and the Reverend Theodore Sherlock, B.A. The disappointment of
9170: not contending with the rector in person, which had at first been
9171: bitter, had been gradually lost sight of in the positive enjoyment of an
9172: opportunity for debating on any terms. Mr. Lyon had two grand elements
9173: of pleasure on such occasions: confidence in the strength of his case,
9174: and confidence in his own power of advocacy. Not--to use his own
9175: phrase--not that "he glorified himself herein;" for speech and
9176: exposition were so easy to him, that if he argued forcibly, he believed
9177: it to be simply because the truth was forcible. He was not proud of
9178: moving easily in his native medium. A panting man thinks of himself as a
9179: clever swimmer; but a fish swims much better, and takes his performance
9180: as a matter of course.
9181: 
9182: Whether Mr. Sherlock were that panting, self-gratulating man, remained a
9183: secret. Philip Debarry, much occupied with his electioneering affairs,
9184: had only once had an opportunity of asking his uncle how Sherlock got
9185: on, and the rector had said, curtly, "I think he'll do. I've supplied
9186: him well with references. I advise him to read only, and decline
9187: everything else as out of order. Lyon will speak to a point, and then
9188: Sherlock will read: it will be all the more telling. It will give
9189: variety." But on this particular morning peremptory business connected
9190: with the magistracy called the rector away.
9191: 
9192: Due notice had been given, and the feminine world of Treby Magna was
9193: much more agitated by the prospect than by that of any candidate's
9194: speech. Mrs. Pendrell at the Bank, Mrs. Tiliot, and the Church ladies
9195: generally felt bound to hear the curate, who was known, apparently by an
9196: intuition concerning the nature of curates, to be a very clever young
9197: man; and he would show them what learning had to say on the right side.
9198: One or two Dissenting ladies were not without emotion at the thought
9199: that, seated on the front benches, they should be brought near to old
9200: Church friends, and have a longer greeting than had taken place since
9201: the Catholic Emancipation. Mrs. Muscat, who had been a beauty, and was
9202: as nice in her millinery as any Trebian lady belonging to the
9203: Establishment, reflected that she should put on her best embroidered
9204: collar, and that she should ask Mrs. Tiliot where it was in Duffield
9205: that she once got her bed-hanging dyed so beautifully. When Mrs. Tiliot
9206: was Mary Salt, the two ladies had been bosom friends; but Mr. Tiliot
9207: looked higher and higher since his gin had become so famous; and in the
9208: year '29 he had, in Mr. Muscat's hearing, spoken of Dissenters as
9209: sneaks--a personality which could not be overlooked.
9210: 
9211: The debate was to begin at eleven, for the rector would not allow the
9212: evening to be chosen, when low men and boys might want to be admitted
9213: out of mere mischief. This was one reason why the female part of the
9214: audience outnumbered the males. But some chief Trebians were there, even
9215: men whose means made them as independent of theory as Mr. Pendrell and
9216: Mr. Wace; encouraged by reflecting that they were not in a place of
9217: worship, and would not be obliged to stay longer than they chose. There
9218: was a muster of all Dissenters who could spare the morning time, and on
9219: the back benches were all the aged Churchwomen who shared the remnants
9220: of the sacrament wine, and who were humbly anxious to neglect nothing
9221: ecclesiastical or connected with "going to a better place."
9222: 
9223: At eleven the arrival of listeners seemed to have ceased. Mr. Lyon was
9224: seated on the school tribune or dais at his particular round table;
9225: another round table, with a chair, awaited the curate, with whose
9226: superior position it was quite in keeping that he should not be the
9227: first on the ground. A couple of extra chairs were placed farther back,
9228: and more than one important personage had been requested to act as
9229: chairman; but no Churchman would place himself in a position so
9230: equivocal as to dignity of aspect, and so unequivocal as to the
9231: obligation of sitting out the discussion; and the rector had beforehand
9232: put a veto on any Dissenting chairman.
9233: 
9234: Mr. Lyon sat patiently absorbed in his thoughts, with his notes in
9235: minute handwriting lying before him, seeming to look at the audience,
9236: but not seeing them. Every one else was contented that there should be
9237: an interval in which there could be a little neighborly talk.
9238: 
9239: Esther was particularly happy, seated on a side-bench near her father's
9240: side of the tribune, with Felix close behind her, so that she could turn
9241: her head and talk to him. He had been very kind ever since that morning
9242: when she had called at his home, more disposed to listen indulgently to
9243: what she had to say, and less blind to her looks and movements. If he
9244: had never railed at her or ignored her, she would have been less
9245: sensitive to the attention he gave her; but as it was, the prospect of
9246: seeing him seemed to light up her life, and to disperse the old
9247: dullness. She looked unusually charming to-day, from the very fact that
9248: she was not vividly conscious of anything but of having a mind near her
9249: that asked her to be something better than she actually was. The
9250: consciousness of her own superiority amongst the people around her was
9251: superseded, and even a few brief weeks had given a softened expression
9252: to her eyes, a more feminine beseechingness and self-doubt to her
9253: manners. Perhaps, however, a little new defiance was rising in place of
9254: the old contempt--defiance of the Trebian views about Felix Holt.
9255: 
9256: "What a very nice-looking young woman your minister's daughter is?" said
9257: Mrs. Tiliot in an undertone to Mrs. Muscat, who, as she had hoped, had
9258: found a seat next her quondam friend--"quite the lady."
9259: 
9260: "Rather too much so, considering," said Mrs. Muscat. "She's thought
9261: proud, and that is not pretty in a girl, even if there was anything to
9262: back it up. But now she seems to be encouraging that young Holt, who
9263: scoffs at everything, as you may judge by his appearance. She has
9264: despised his betters before now; but I leave you to judge whether a
9265: young man who has taken to low ways of getting a living can pay for fine
9266: cambric handkerchiefs and light kid gloves."
9267: 
9268: Mrs. Muscat lowered her blonde eyelashes and swayed her neat head just
9269: perceptibly from side to side, with a sincere desire to be moderate in
9270: her expressions, notwithstanding any shock that facts might have given
9271: her.
9272: 
9273: "Dear, dear," said Mrs. Tiliot. "What! that is young Holt leaning
9274: forward now without a cravat? I've never seen him before to notice him,
9275: but I've heard Tiliot talking about him. They say he's a dangerous
9276: character, and goes stirring up the workingmen at Sproxton. And--well,
9277: to be sure, such great eyes and such a great head of hair--it is enough
9278: to frighten one. What can she see in him? Quite below her."
9279: 
9280: "Yes, and brought up a governess," said Mrs. Muscat; "you'd have thought
9281: she'd knowed better how to choose. But the minister has let her get the
9282: upper hand sadly too much. It's a pity in a man of God. I don't deny
9283: he's _that_."
9284: 
9285: "Well, I am sorry," said Mrs. Tiliot, "for I meant her to give my girls
9286: lessons when they came from school."
9287: 
9288: Mr. Wace and Mr. Pendrell meanwhile were standing up and looking round
9289: at the audience, nodding to their fellow-townspeople with the affability
9290: due from men in their position.
9291: 
9292: "It's time he came now," said Mr. Wace, looking at his watch and
9293: comparing it with the schoolroom clock. "This debating is a new-fangled
9294: sort of thing; but the rector would never have given in to it if there
9295: hadn't been good reasons. Nolan said he wouldn't come. He says this
9296: debating is an atheistical sort of thing; the Atheists are very fond of
9297: it. Theirs is a bad book to take a leaf out of. However, we shall hear
9298: nothing but what's good from Mr. Sherlock. He preaches a capital
9299: sermon--for such a young man."
9300: 
9301: "Well, it was our duty to support him--not to leave him alone among the
9302: Dissenters," said Mr. Pendrell. "You see everybody hasn't felt that.
9303: Labron might have shown himself, if not Lukyn. I could have alleged
9304: business myself if I had thought proper."
9305: 
9306: "Here he comes, I think," said Mr. Wace, turning round on hearing a
9307: movement near the small door on a level with the platform. "By George!
9308: it's Mr. Debarry. Come now, this is handsome."
9309: 
9310: Mr. Wace and Mr. Pendrell clapped their hands, and the example was
9311: followed even by most of the Dissenters. Philip was aware that he was
9312: doing a popular thing, of a kind that Treby was not used to from the
9313: elder Debarrys; but his appearance had not been long premeditated. He
9314: was driving through the town toward an engagement at some distance, but
9315: on calling at Labron's office he had found that the affair which
9316: demanded his presence had been deferred, and so had driven round to the
9317: Free School. Christian came in behind him.
9318: 
9319: Mr. Lyon was now roused from his abstraction, and, stepping from his
9320: slight elevation, begged Mr. Debarry to act as moderator or president on
9321: the occasion.
9322: 
9323: "With all my heart," said Philip. "But Mr. Sherlock has not arrived,
9324: apparently?"
9325: 
9326: "He tarries somewhat unduly," said Mr. Lyon. "Nevertheless there may be
9327: a reason of which we know not. Shall I collect the thoughts of the
9328: assembly by a brief introductory address in the interval?"
9329: 
9330: "No, no, no," said Mr. Wace, who saw a limit to his powers of endurance.
9331: "Mr. Sherlock is sure to be here in a minute or two."
9332: 
9333: "Christian," said Philip Debarry, who felt a slight misgiving, "just be
9334: so good--but stay, I'll go myself. Excuse me, gentlemen: I'll drive
9335: round to Mr. Sherlock's lodgings. He may be under a little mistake as to
9336: the time. Studious men are sometimes rather absent-minded. You needn't
9337: come with me, Christian."
9338: 
9339: As Mr. Debarry went out, Rufus Lyon stepped on to the tribune again in
9340: rather an uneasy state of mind. A few ideas had occurred to him,
9341: eminently fitted to engage the audience profitably, and so to wrest some
9342: edification out of an unforeseen delay. But his native delicacy made him
9343: feel that in this assembly the Church people might fairly decline any
9344: "deliverance" on his part which exceeded the programme, and Mr. Wace's
9345: negative had been energetic. But the little man suffered from imprisoned
9346: ideas, and was as restless as a racer held in. He could not sit down
9347: again, but walked backward and forward, stroking his chin, emitting his
9348: low guttural interjections under the pressure of clauses and sentences
9349: which he longed to utter aloud, as he would have done in his own study.
9350: There was a low buzz in the room which helped to deepen the minister's
9351: sense that the thoughts within him were as divine messengers unheeded or
9352: rejected by a trivial generation. Many of the audience were standing;
9353: all, except the old Churchwomen on the back seats, and a few devout
9354: Dissenters who kept their eyes shut and gave their bodies a gentle
9355: oscillating motion, were interested in chat.
9356: 
9357: "Your father is uneasy," said Felix to Esther.
9358: 
9359: "Yes; and now, I think, he is feeling for his spectacles. I hope he has
9360: not left them at home: he will not be able to see anything two yards
9361: before him without them;--and it makes him so unconscious of what people
9362: expect or want."
9363: 
9364: "I'll go and ask him whether he has them," said Felix, striding over the
9365: form in front of him, and approaching Mr. Lyon, whose face showed a
9366: gleam of pleasure at this relief from his abstracted isolation.
9367: 
9368: "Miss Lyon is afraid that you are at a loss for your spectacles, sir,"
9369: said Felix.
9370: 
9371: "My dear young friend," said Mr. Lyon, laying his hand on Felix Holt's
9372: fore-arm, which was about on a level with the minister's shoulder, "it
9373: is a very glorious truth, albeit made somewhat painful to me by the
9374: circumstances of the present moment, that as a counterpoise to the
9375: brevity of our mortal life (wherein, as I apprehend, our powers are
9376: being trained not only for the transmission of an improved heritage, as
9377: I have heard you insist, but also for our own entrance into a higher
9378: initiation in the Divine scheme)--it is, I say, a very glorious truth,
9379: that even in what are called the waste minutes of our time, like those
9380: of expectation, the soul may soar and range, as in some of our dreams
9381: which are brief as a broken rainbow in duration, yet seem to comprise a
9382: long history of terror or joy. And again, each moment may be a beginning
9383: of a new spiritual energy; and our pulse would doubtless be a coarse and
9384: clumsy notation of the passage from that which was not to that which is,
9385: even in the finer processes of the material world--and how much
9386: more----"
9387: 
9388: Esther was watching her father and Felix, and though she was not within
9389: hearing of what was being said, she guessed the actual state of the
9390: case--that the enquiry about the spectacles had been unheeded, and that
9391: her father was losing himself and embarrassing Felix in the intricacies
9392: of a dissertation. There was not the stillness around her that would
9393: have made a movement on her part seem conspicuous, and she was impelled
9394: by her anxiety to step on the tribune and walk up to her father, who
9395: paused a little startled.
9396: 
9397: "Pray see whether you have forgotten your spectacles, father. If so, I
9398: will go home at once and look for them."
9399: 
9400: Mr. Lyon was automatically obedient to Esther, and he began immediately
9401: to feel in his pockets.
9402: 
9403: "How is it that Miss Jermyn is so friendly with the Dissenting parson?"
9404: said Christian to Quorlen, the Tory printer, who was an intimate of his.
9405: "Those grand Jermyns are not Dissenters surely?"
9406: 
9407: "_What_ Miss Jermyn?"
9408: 
9409: "Why--don't you see?--that fine girl who is talking to him."
9410: 
9411: "Miss Jermyn! Why, that's the little parson's daughter."
9412: 
9413: "His daughter!" Christian gave a low brief whistle, which seemed a
9414: natural expression of surprise that "the rusty old ranter" should have a
9415: daughter of such distinguished appearance.
9416: 
9417: Meanwhile the search for the spectacles had proved vain. "'Tis a
9418: grievous fault in me, my dear," said the little man, humbly; "I become
9419: thereby sadly burdensome to you."
9420: 
9421: "I will go at once," said Esther, refusing to let Felix go instead of
9422: her. But she had scarcely stepped off the tribune when Mr. Debarry
9423: re-entered, and there was a commotion which made her wait. After a
9424: low-toned conversation with Mr. Pendrell and Mr. Wace, Philip Debarry
9425: stepped on to the tribune with his hat in his hand and said, with an air
9426: of much concern and annoyance--
9427: 
9428: "I am sorry to have to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that--doubtless
9429: owing to some accidental cause which I trust will soon be explained as
9430: nothing serious--Mr. Sherlock is absent from his residence and is not to
9431: be found. He went out early, his landlady informs me, to refresh himself
9432: by a walk on this agreeable morning, as is his habit, she tells me, when
9433: he has been kept up late by study; and he has not returned. Do not let
9434: us be too anxious. I shall cause enquiry to be made in the direction of
9435: his walk. It is easy to imagine many accidents, not of a grave
9436: character, by which he might nevertheless be absolutely detained against
9437: his will. Under these circumstances, Mr. Lyon," continued Philip,
9438: turning to the minister, "I presume that the debate must be adjourned."
9439: 
9440: "The debate, doubtless," began Mr. Lyon; but his farther speech was
9441: drowned by a general rising of the Church people from their seats, many
9442: of them feeling that, even if the cause were lamentable, the adjournment
9443: was not altogether disagreeable.
9444: 
9445: "Good gracious me!" said Mrs. Tiliot, as she took her husband's arm, "I
9446: hope the poor young man hasn't fallen into the river or broken his leg."
9447: 
9448: But some of the more acrid Dissenters, whose temper was not controlled
9449: by the habits of retail business, had begun to hiss, implying that in
9450: their interpretation the curate's absence had not depended on any injury
9451: to life or limb.
9452: 
9453: "He's turned tail, sure enough," said Mr. Muscat to the neighbor behind
9454: him, lifting his eyebrows and shoulders, and laughing in a way that
9455: showed that, deacon as he was, he looked at the affair in an entirely
9456: secular light.
9457: 
9458: But Mrs. Muscat thought it would be nothing but right to have all the
9459: waters dragged, agreeing in this with the majority of the Church ladies.
9460: 
9461: "I regret sincerely, Mr. Lyon," said Philip Debarry, addressing the
9462: minister with politeness, "that I must say good-morning to you, with the
9463: sense that I have not been able at present to contribute to your
9464: satisfaction as I had wished."
9465: 
9466: "Speak not of it in the way of apology, sir," said Mr. Lyon, in a tone
9467: of depression. "I doubt not that you yourself have acted in good faith.
9468: Nor will I open any door of egress to constructions such as anger often
9469: deems ingenious, but which the disclosure of the simple truth may expose
9470: as erroneous and uncharitable fabrications. I wish you good-morning,
9471: sir."
9472: 
9473: When the room was cleared of the Church people, Mr. Lyon wished to
9474: soothe his own spirit and that of his flock by a few reflections
9475: introductory to a parting prayer. But there was a general resistance to
9476: this effort. The men mustered round the minister and declared their
9477: opinion that the whole thing was disgraceful to the Church. Some said
9478: that the curate's absence had been contrived from the first. Others more
9479: than hinted that it had been a folly in Mr. Lyon to set on foot any
9480: procedure in common with Tories and clergymen, who, if they ever aped
9481: civility to Dissenters, would never do anything but laugh at them in
9482: their sleeves. Brother Kemp urged in his heavy bass that Mr. Lyon should
9483: lose no time in sending an account of the affair to the _Patriot_; and
9484: brother Hawkins, in his high tenor, observed that it was an occasion on
9485: which some stinging things might be said with all the extra effect of an
9486: _apropos_.
9487: 
9488: The position of receiving a many-voiced lecture from the members of his
9489: church was familiar to Mr. Lyon; but now he felt weary, frustrated, and
9490: doubtful of his own temper. Felix, who stood by and saw that this man of
9491: sensitive fibre was suffering from talkers whose noisy superficiality
9492: cost them nothing, got exasperated. "It seems to me, sirs," he burst in,
9493: with his predominant voice, "that Mr. Lyon has hitherto had the hard
9494: part of the business, while you of his congregation have had the easy
9495: one. Punish the Church clergy, if you like--they can take care of
9496: themselves. But don't punish your own minister. It's no business of
9497: mine, perhaps, except so far as fair-play is everybody's business; but
9498: it seems to me the time to ask Mr. Lyon to take a little rest, instead
9499: of setting on him like so many wasps."
9500: 
9501: By this speech Felix raised a displeasure which fell on the minister as
9502: well as on himself; but he gained his immediate end. The talkers dropped
9503: off after a slight show of persistence, and Mr. Lyon quitted the field
9504: of no combat with a small group of his less imperious friends, to whom
9505: he confided his intention of committing his argument fully to paper,
9506: and forwarding it to a discriminating editor.
9507: 
9508: "But regarding personalities," he added, "I have not the same clear
9509: showing. For, say that this young man was pusillanimous--I were but
9510: ill-provided with arguments if I took my stand even for a moment on so
9511: poor an irrelevancy as that because one curate is ill furnished
9512: therefore Episcopacy is false. If I held up any one to just obloquy, it
9513: would be the well-designated Incumbent of this parish, who, calling
9514: himself one of the Church militant, sends a young and weak-kneed
9515: substitute to take his place in the fight."
9516: 
9517: Mr. Philip Debarry did not neglect to make industrious enquiry
9518: concerning the accidents which had detained the Reverend Theodore
9519: Sherlock on his morning walk. That well-intentioned young divine was
9520: seen no more in Treby Magna. But the river was not dragged, for by the
9521: evening coach the rector received an explanatory letter. The Reverend
9522: Theodore's agitation had increased so much during his walk, that the
9523: passing coach had been a means of deliverance not to be resisted; and,
9524: literally at the eleventh hour, he had hailed and mounted the cheerful
9525: Tally-ho! and carried away his portion of the debate in his pocket.
9526: 
9527: But the rector had subsequently the satisfaction of receiving Mr.
9528: Sherlock's painstaking production in print, with a dedication to the
9529: Reverend Augustus Debarry, a motto from St. Chrysostom, and other
9530: additions, the fruit of ripening leisure. He was "sorry for poor
9531: Sherlock, who wanted confidence"; but he was convinced that for his own
9532: part he had taken the course which under the circumstances was the least
9533: compromising to the Church. Sir Maximus, however, observed to his son
9534: and brother that he had been right and they had been wrong as to the
9535: danger of vague, enormous expressions of gratitude to a Dissenting
9536: preacher, and on any differences of opinion seldom failed to remind them
9537: of that precedent.

9542: CHAPTER XXV.
9543: 
9544:     Your fellow-man?--Divide the epithet:
9545:     Say rather, you're the fellow, he the man.
9546: 
9547: 
9548: When Christian quitted the Free School with the discovery that the young
9549: lady whose appearance had first startled him with an indefinable
9550: impression in the market-place was the daughter of the old Dissenting
9551: preacher who had shown so much agitated curiosity about his name, he
9552: felt very much like an uninitiated chess-player, who sees that the
9553: pieces are in a peculiar position on the board, and might open the way
9554: for him to give checkmate, if he only knew how. Ever since his interview
9555: with Jermyn, his mind had been occupied with the charade it offered to
9556: his ingenuity. What was the real meaning of the lawyer's interest in
9557: him, and in his relations with Maurice Christian Bycliffe? Here was a
9558: secret; and secrets were often a source of profit, of that agreeable
9559: kind which involved little labor. Jermyn had hinted at profit which
9560: might possibly come through him; but Christian said inwardly, with
9561: well-satisfied self-esteem, that he was not so pitiable a nincompoop as
9562: to trust Jermyn. On the contrary, the only problem before him was to
9563: find out by what combination of independent knowledge he could outwit
9564: Jermyn, elude any purchase the attorney had on him through his past
9565: history, and get a handsome bonus, by which a somewhat shattered man of
9566: pleasure might live well without a master. Christian, having early
9567: exhausted the more impulsive delights of life, had become a sober
9568: calculator; and he had made up his mind that, for a man who had long ago
9569: run through his own money, servitude in a great family was the best kind
9570: of retirement after that of a pensioner; but if a better chance offered,
9571: a person of talent must not let it slip through his fingers. He held
9572: various ends of threads, but there was danger of pulling at them too
9573: impatiently. He had not forgotten the surprise which had made him drop
9574: the punch-ladle, when Mr. Crowder, talking in the steward's room, had
9575: said that a scamp named Henry Scaddon had been concerned in a lawsuit
9576: about the Transome estate. Again, Jermyn was the family lawyer of the
9577: Transomes; he knew of the exchange of names between Scaddon and
9578: Bycliffe; he clearly wanted to know as much as he could about Bycliffe's
9579: history. The conclusion was not remote that Bycliffe had had some claim
9580: on the Transome property, and that a difficulty had arisen from his
9581: being confounded with Henry Scaddon. But hitherto the other incident
9582: which had been apparently connected with the interchange of names--Mr.
9583: Lyon's demand that he should write down the name Maurice Christian,
9584: accompanied with the question whether that were his whole name--had had
9585: no visible link with the inferences arrived at through Crowder and
9586: Jermyn.
9587: 
9588: The discovery made this morning at the Free School that Esther was the
9589: daughter of the Dissenting preacher at last suggested a possible link.
9590: Until then, Christian had not known why Esther's face had impressed him
9591: so peculiarly; but the minister's chief association for him was with
9592: Bycliffe, and that association served as a flash to show him that
9593: Esther's features and expression, and still more her bearing, now she
9594: stood and walked, revived Bycliffe's image. Daughter? There were various
9595: ways of being a daughter. Suppose this were a case of adoption; suppose
9596: Bycliffe were known to be dead, or thought to be dead. "Begad, if the
9597: old parson had fancied the original father was come to life again, it
9598: was enough to frighten him a little. Slow and steady," Christian said to
9599: himself; "I'll get some talk with the old man again. He's safe enough:
9600: one can handle him without cutting one's self. I'll tell him I knew
9601: Bycliffe, and was his fellow-prisoner. I'll worm out the truth about
9602: this daughter. Could pretty Annette have married again, and married this
9603: little scare-crow? There's no knowing what a woman will not do."
9604: 
9605: Christian could see no distinct result for himself from his industry;
9606: but if there were to be any such result, it must be reached by following
9607: out every clue; and to the non-legal mind there are dim possibilities in
9608: law and heirship which prevent any issue from seeming too miraculous.
9609: 
9610: The consequence of these meditations was, that Christian hung about
9611: Treby more than usual in his leisure time, and that on the first
9612: opportunity he accosted Mr. Lyon in the street with suitable civility,
9613: stating that since the occasion which had brought them together some
9614: weeks before he had often wished to renew their conversation, and, with
9615: Mr. Lyon's permission, would now ask to do so. After being assured, as
9616: he had been by Jermyn, that this courier, who had happened by some
9617: accident to possess the memorable locket and pocket-book, was certainly
9618: not Annette's husband, and was ignorant whether Maurice Christian
9619: Bycliffe were living or dead, the minister's mind had become easy again;
9620: his habitual lack of interest in personal details rendering him
9621: gradually oblivious of Jermyn's precautionary statement that he was
9622: pursuing enquiries, and that if anything of interest turned up, Mr. Lyon
9623: should be made acquainted with it. Hence, when Christian addressed him,
9624: the minister, taken by surprise and shaken by the recollections of
9625: former anxieties, said, helplessly--
9626: 
9627: "If it is business, sir, you would perhaps do better to address yourself
9628: to Mr. Jermyn."
9629: 
9630: He could not have said anything that was a more valuable hint to
9631: Christian. He inferred that the minister had made a confidant of Jermyn,
9632: and it was needful to be wary.
9633: 
9634: "On the contrary, sir," he answered, "it may be of the utmost importance
9635: to you that what passes between us should not be known to Mr. Jermyn."
9636: 
9637: Mr. Lyon was perplexed, and felt at once that he was no more in clear
9638: daylight concerning Jermyn than concerning Christian. He dared not
9639: neglect the possible duty of hearing what this man had to say, and he
9640: invited him to proceed to Malthouse Yard, where they could converse in
9641: private.
9642: 
9643: Once in Mr. Lyon's study, Christian opened the dialogue by saying that
9644: since he was in this room before it had occurred to him that the anxiety
9645: he had observed in Mr. Lyon might be owing to some acquaintance with
9646: Maurice Christian Bycliffe--a fellow-prisoner in France, whom he,
9647: Christian, had assisted in getting freed from his imprisonment, and who,
9648: in fact, had been the owner of the trifles which Mr. Lyon had recently
9649: had in his possession and had restored. Christian hastened to say that
9650: he knew nothing of Bycliffe's history since they had parted in France,
9651: but that he knew of his marriage with Annette Ledru, and had been
9652: acquainted with Annette herself. He would be very glad to know what
9653: became of Bycliffe, if he could, for he liked him uncommonly.
9654: 
9655: Here Christian paused; but Mr. Lyon only sat changing color and
9656: trembling. This man's bearing and tone of mind were made repulsive to
9657: him by being brought in contact with keenly-felt memories, and he could
9658: not readily summon the courage to give answers or ask questions.
9659: 
9660: "May I ask if you knew my friend Bycliffe?" said Christian, trying a
9661: more direct method.
9662: 
9663: "No, sir; I never saw him."
9664: 
9665: "Ah! well--you have seen a very striking likeness of him. It's
9666: wonderful--unaccountable; but when I saw Miss Lyon at the Free School
9667: the other day, I could have sworn she was Bycliffe's daughter."
9668: 
9669: "Sir!" said Mr. Lyon, in his deepest tone, half rising, and holding by
9670: the arms of his chair, "these subjects touch me with too sharp a point
9671: for you to be justified in thrusting them on me out of mere levity. Is
9672: there any good you seek or any injury you fear in relation to them?"
9673: 
9674: "Precisely, sir. We shall come to an understanding. Suppose I believed
9675: that the young lady who goes by the name of Miss Lyon was the daughter
9676: of Bycliffe?"
9677: 
9678: Mr. Lyon moved his lips silently.
9679: 
9680: "And suppose I had reason to suspect that there would be some great
9681: advantage for her if the law knew who was her father?"
9682: 
9683: "Sir!" said Mr. Lyon, shaken out of all reticence. "I would not conceal
9684: it. She believes herself to be my daughter. But I will bear all things
9685: rather than deprive her of a right. Nevertheless I appeal to the pity of
9686: any fellow-man, not to thrust himself between her and me, but to let me
9687: disclose the truth to her myself."
9688: 
9689: "All in good time," said Christian. "We must do nothing rash. Then Miss
9690: Lyon is Annette's child?"
9691: 
9692: The minister shivered as if the edge of a knife had been drawn across
9693: his hand. But the tone of this question, by the fact that it intensified
9694: his antipathy to Christian, enabled him to collect himself for what must
9695: be simply the endurance of a painful operation. After a moment or two he
9696: said more coolly, "It is true, sir. Her mother became my wife. Proceed
9697: with any statement which may concern my duty."
9698: 
9699: "I have no more to say than this: if there's a prize that the law might
9700: hand over to Bycliffe's daughter, I am much mistaken if there isn't a
9701: lawyer who'll take precious good care to keep the law hoodwinked. And
9702: that lawyer is Mat Jermyn. Why, my good sir, if you've been taking
9703: Jermyn into your confidence, you've been setting the fox to keep off the
9704: weasel. It strikes me that when you were made a little anxious about
9705: those articles of poor Bycliffe's, you put Jermyn on making enquiries of
9706: me. Eh? I think I am right?"
9707: 
9708: "I do not deny it."
9709: 
9710: "Ah!--it was very well you did, for by that means I've found that he's
9711: got hold of some secrets about Bycliffe which he means to stifle. Now,
9712: sir, if you desire any justice for your daughter--step-daughter, I
9713: should say--don't so much as wink to yourself before Jermyn; and if
9714: you've got any papers or things of that sort that may come in evidence,
9715: as these confounded rascals the lawyers call it, clutch them tight, for
9716: if they get into Jermyn's hands they may soon fly up the chimney. Have I
9717: said enough?"
9718: 
9719: "I had not purposed any further communication with Mr. Jermyn, sir;
9720: indeed, I have nothing further to communicate. Except that one fact
9721: concerning my daughter's birth, which I have erred in concealing from
9722: her, I neither seek disclosures nor do I tremble before them."
9723: 
9724: "Then I have your word that you will be silent about this conversation
9725: between us? It is for your daughter's interest, mind."
9726: 
9727: "Sir, I shall be silent," said Mr. Lyon, with cold gravity. "Unless,"
9728: he added, with an acumen as to possibilities rather disturbing to
9729: Christian's confident contempt for the old man--"unless I were called
9730: upon by some tribunal to declare the whole truth in this relation; in
9731: which case I should submit myself to that authority of investigation
9732: which is a requisite of social order."
9733: 
9734: Christian departed, feeling satisfied that he had got the utmost to be
9735: obtained at present out of the Dissenting preacher, whom he had not
9736: dared to question more closely. He must look out for chance lights, and
9737: perhaps, too, he might catch a stray hint by stirring the sediment of
9738: Mr. Crowder's memory. But he must not venture on enquiries that might be
9739: noticed.
9740: 
9741: When Mr. Lyon was alone he paced up and down among his books, and
9742: thought aloud, in order to relieve himself after the constraint of this
9743: interview. "I will not wait for the urgency of necessity," he said more
9744: than once. "I will tell the child without compulsion. And then I shall
9745: fear nothing. And an unwonted spirit of tenderness has filled her of
9746: late. She will forgive me."

9759: 
9760: 
9761: The next morning, after much prayer for the needful strength and wisdom,
9762: Mr. Lyon came down stairs with the resolution that another day should
9763: not pass without the fulfillment of the task he had laid on himself: but
9764: what hour he should choose for this solemn disclosure to Esther must
9765: depend on their mutual occupations. Perhaps he must defer it till they
9766: sat up alone together, after Lyddy was gone to bed. But at breakfast
9767: Esther said--
9768: 
9769: "To-day is a holiday, father. My pupils are all going to Duffield to see
9770: the wild beasts. What have you got to do to-day? Come, you are eating no
9771: breakfast. Oh, Lyddy, Lyddy, the eggs are hard again. I wish you would
9772: not read Alleyne's 'Alarm' before breakfast; it makes you cry and forget
9773: the eggs."
9774: 
9775: "They _are_ hard, and that's the truth; but there's hearts as are
9776: harder, Miss Esther," said Lyddy.
9777: 
9778: "I think not," said Esther. "This is leathery enough for the heart of
9779: the most obdurate Jew. Pray give it little Zachary for a football."
9780: 
9781: "Dear, dear, don't you be so light, miss. We may all be dead before
9782: night."
9783: 
9784: "You speak out of season, my good Lyddy," said Mr. Lyon, wearily;
9785: "depart into the kitchen."
9786: 
9787: "What have you got to do to-day, father?" persisted Esther. "I have a
9788: holiday."
9789: 
9790: Mr. Lyon felt as if this were a fresh summons not to delay. "I have
9791: something of great moment to do, my dear; and since you are not
9792: otherwise demanded, I will ask you to come and sit with me up-stairs."
9793: 
9794: Esther wondered what there could be on her father's mind more pressing
9795: than his morning studies.
9796: 
9797: Soon she knew. Motionless, but mentally stirred as she had never been
9798: before, Esther listened to her mother's story, and to the outpouring of
9799: her step-father's long-pent-up experience. The rays of the morning sun
9800: which fell athwart the books, the sense of the beginning day had
9801: deepened the solemnity more than night would have done. All knowledge
9802: which alters our lives penetrates us more when it comes in the early
9803: morning: the day that has to be travelled with something new and perhaps
9804: forever sad in its light, is an image of the life that spreads beyond.
9805: But at night the time of rest is near.
9806: 
9807: Mr. Lyon regarded his narrative as a confession--as a revelation to this
9808: beloved child of his own miserable weakness and error. But to her it
9809: seemed a revelation of another sort: her mind seemed suddenly enlarged
9810: by a vision of passion and struggle, of delight and renunciation, in the
9811: lot of beings who had hitherto been a dull enigma to her. And in the act
9812: of unfolding to her that he was not her real father, but had only
9813: striven to cherish her as a father, had only longed to be loved as a
9814: father, the odd, way-worn, unworldly man became the object of a new
9815: sympathy in which Esther exulted. Perhaps this knowledge would have been
9816: less powerful within her, but for the mental preparation that had come
9817: during the last two months from her acquaintance with Felix Holt, which
9818: had taught her to doubt the infallibility of her own standard, and
9819: raised a presentiment of moral depths that were hidden from her.
9820: 
9821: Esther had taken her place opposite to her father, and had not moved
9822: even her clasped hands while he was speaking. But after the long
9823: outpouring in which he seemed to lose the sense of everything but the
9824: memories he was giving utterance to, he paused a little while, and then
9825: said timidly--
9826: 
9827: "This is a late retrieval of a long error, Esther. I make not excuses
9828: for myself, for we ought to strive that our affections be rooted in the
9829: truth. Nevertheless you----"
9830: 
9831: Esther had risen, and had glided on to the wooden stool on a level with
9832: her father's chair, where he was accustomed to lay books. She wanted to
9833: speak, but the flood-gates could not be opened for words alone. She
9834: threw her arms round the old man's neck and sobbed out with a passionate
9835: cry, "Father, father! forgive me if I have not loved you enough. I
9836: will--I will!"
9837: 
9838: The old man's little delicate frame was shaken by a surprise and joy
9839: that was almost painful in their intensity. He had been going to ask
9840: forgiveness of her who asked it for herself. In that moment of supreme
9841: complex emotion one ray of the minister's joy was the thought, "Surely
9842: the work of grace is begun in her--surely here is a heart that the Lord
9843: hath touched."
9844: 
9845: They sat so, enclasped in silence, while Esther relieved her full heart.
9846: When she raised her head, she sat quite still for a minute or two
9847: looking fixedly before her, and keeping one little hand in the
9848: minister's. Presently she looked at him and said--
9849: 
9850: "Then you lived like a workingman, father; you were very, very poor. Yet
9851: my mother had been used to luxury, She was well born--she was a lady?"
9852: 
9853: "It is true, my dear; it was a poor life that I could give her."
9854: 
9855: Mr. Lyon answered in utter dimness as to the course Esther's mind was
9856: taking. He had anticipated before his disclosure, from his long-standing
9857: discernment of tendencies in her which were often the cause of silent
9858: grief to him, that the discovery likely to have the keenest interest for
9859: her would be that her parents had a higher rank than that of the poor
9860: Dissenting preacher; but she had shown that other and better
9861: sensibilities were predominant. He rebuked himself now for a hasty and
9862: shallow judgment concerning the child's inner life, and waited for new
9863: clearness.
9864: 
9865: "But that must be the best life, father," said Esther, suddenly rising,
9866: with a flush across her paleness, and standing with her head thrown a
9867: little backward, as if some illumination had given her a new decision.
9868: "That must be the best life."
9869: 
9870: "What life, my dear child?"
9871: 
9872: "Why, that where one bears and does everything because of some great and
9873: strong feeling--so that this and that in one's circumstances don't
9874: signify."
9875: 
9876: "Yea, verily; but the feeling that should be thus supreme is devotedness
9877: to the Divine Will."
9878: 
9879: Esther did not speak; her father's words did not fit on to the
9880: impressions wrought in her by what he had told her. She sat down again,
9881: and said, more quietly--
9882: 
9883: "Mamma did not speak much of my--first father?"
9884: 
9885: "Not much, dear. She said he was beautiful to the eye, and good and
9886: generous; and that his family was of those who had been long privileged
9887: among their fellows. But now I will deliver to you the letters, which,
9888: together with the ring and locket, are the only visible memorials she
9889: retained of him."
9890: 
9891: Mr. Lyon reached and delivered to Esther the box containing the relics.
9892: "Take them, and examine them in privacy, my dear. And that I may no more
9893: err by concealment, I will tell you some late occurrences that bear on
9894: these memorials, though to my present apprehension doubtfully and
9895: confusedly."
9896: 
9897: He then narrated to Esther all that had passed between himself and
9898: Christian. The possibility--to which Mr. Lyon's alarms had pointed--that
9899: her real father might still be living, was a new shock. She could not
9900: speak about it to her present father, but it was registered in silence
9901: as a painful addition to the uncertainties which she suddenly saw
9902: hanging over her life.
9903: 
9904: "I have little confidence in this man's allegations," Mr. Lyon ended. "I
9905: confess his presence and speech are to me as the jarring of metal. He
9906: bears the stamp of one who has never conceived aught of more sanctity
9907: than the lust of the eye and the pride of life. He hints at some
9908: possible inheritance for you, and denounces mysteriously the devices of
9909: Mr. Jermyn. All this may or may not have a true foundation. But it is
9910: not my part to move in this matter save on a clear showing."
9911: 
9912: "Certainly not, father," said Esther, eagerly. A little while ago, these
9913: problematic prospects might have set her dreaming pleasantly; but now,
9914: for some reasons that she could not have put distinctly into words, they
9915: affected her with dread.
9916: 
9917:

9925: 
9926:                         Custom calls me to't;
9927:     What custom wills, in all things should we do't.
9928:     The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
9929:     And mountainous error be too highly heaped
9930:     For truth to over-peer.--_Coriolanus._
9931: 
9932: 
9933: In the afternoon Mr. Lyon went out to see the sick amongst his flock,
9934: and Esther, who had been passing the morning in dwelling on the memories
9935: and the few remaining relics of her parents, was left alone in the
9936: parlor amidst the lingering odors of the early dinner, not easily got
9937: rid of in that small house. Rich people, who know nothing of these
9938: vulgar details, can hardly imagine their significance in the history of
9939: multitudes of human lives in which the sensibilities are never adjusted
9940: to the external conditions. Esther always felt so much discomfort from
9941: those odors that she usually seized any possibility of escaping from
9942: them, and to-day they oppressed her the more because she was weary with
9943: long-continued agitation. Why did she not put on her bonnet as usual and
9944: get out into the open air? It was one of those pleasant November
9945: afternoons--pleasant in the wide country--when the sunshine is on the
9946: clinging brown leaves of the young oaks, and the last yellow leaves of
9947: the elms flutter down in the fresh but not eager breeze. But Esther sat
9948: still on the sofa--pale and with reddened eyelids, her curls all pushed
9949: back carelessly, and her elbow resting on the ridgy black horsehair,
9950: which usually almost set her teeth on edge if she pressed it even
9951: through her sleeve--while her eyes rested blankly on the dull street.
9952: Lyddy had said, "Miss, you look sadly; if you can't take a walk, go and
9953: lie down." She had never seen the curls in such disorder, and she
9954: reflected that there had been a death from typhus recently. But the
9955: obstinate Miss only shook her head.
9956: 
9957: Esther was waiting for the sake of--not a probability, but--a mere
9958: possibility, which made the brothy odors endurable. Apparently, in less
9959: than half an hour, the possibility came to pass, for she changed her
9960: attitude, almost started from her seat, sat down again, and listened
9961: eagerly. If Lyddy should send him away, could she herself rush out and
9962: call him back? Why not? Such things were permissible where it was
9963: understood, from the necessity of the case, that there was only
9964: friendship. But Lyddy opened the door and said, "Here's Mr. Holt, Miss,
9965: wants to know if you'll give him leave to come in. I told him you was
9966: sadly."
9967: 
9968: "Oh, yes, Lyddy, beg him to come in."
9969: 
9970: "I should not have persevered," said Felix, as they shook hands, "only I
9971: know Lyddy's dismal way. But you do look ill," he went on, as he seated
9972: himself at the other end of the sofa. "Or rather--for that's a false way
9973: of putting it--you look as if you had been very much distressed. Do you
9974: mind about my taking notice of it?"
9975: 
9976: He spoke very kindly, and looked at her more persistently than he had
9977: ever done before, when her hair was perfect.
9978: 
9979: "You are quite right. I am not at all ill. But I have been very much
9980: agitated this morning. My father has been telling me things I never
9981: heard before about my mother, and giving me things that belonged to her.
9982: She died when I was a very little creature."
9983: 
9984: "Then it is no new pain or trouble for you and Mr. Lyon? I could not
9985: help being anxious to know that."
9986: 
9987: Esther passed her hand over her brow before she answered. "I hardly know
9988: whether it is pain, or something better than pleasure. It has made me
9989: see things I was blind to before--depths in my father's nature."
9990: 
9991: As she said this, she looked at Felix, and their eyes met very gravely.
9992: 
9993: "It is such a beautiful day," he said, "it would do you good to go into
9994: the air. Let me take you along the river toward Little Treby, will you?"
9995: 
9996: "I will put my bonnet on," said Esther, unhesitatingly, though they had
9997: never walked out together before.
9998: 
9999: It is true that to get into the fields they had to pass through the
10000: street; and when Esther saw some acquaintances, she reflected that her
10001: walking alone with Felix might be a subject of remark--all the more
10002: because of his cap, patched boots, no cravat, and thick stick. Esther
10003: was a little amazed herself at what she had come to. So our lives glide
10004: on: the river ends we don't know where, and the sea begins, and there is
10005: no more jumping ashore.
10006: 
10007: When they were in the streets Esther hardly spoke. Felix talked with his
10008: usual readiness, as easily as if he were not doing it solely to divert
10009: her thoughts, first about Job Tudge's delicate chest, and the
10010: probability that the little white-faced monkey would not live long; and
10011: then about a miserable beginning of a night-school, which was all he
10012: could get together at Sproxton, and the dismalness of that hamlet, which
10013: was a sort of lip to the coalpit on one side and the "public" on the
10014: other--and yet a paradise compared with the wynds of Glasgow, where
10015: there was little more than a chink of daylight to show the hatred in
10016: women's faces.
10017: 
10018: But soon they got into the fields, where there was a right of way toward
10019: Little Treby, now following the course of the river, now crossing toward
10020: a lane, and now turning into a cart-track through a plantation.
10021: 
10022: "Here we are!" said Felix, when they had crossed the wooden bridge, and
10023: were treading on the slanting shadows made by the elm-trunks. "I think
10024: this is delicious. I never feel less unhappy than in these late autumn
10025: afternoons when they are sunny."
10026: 
10027: "Less unhappy! There now!" said Esther, smiling at him with some of her
10028: habitual sauciness, "I have caught you in self-contradiction. I have
10029: heard you quite furious against puling, melancholy people. If I had said
10030: what you have just said, you would have given me a long lecture, and
10031: told me to go home and interest myself in the reason of the
10032: rule-of-three."
10033: 
10034: "Very likely," said Felix, beating the weeds, according to the foible of
10035: our common humanity when it has a stick in its hand. "But I don't think
10036: myself a fine fellow because I'm melancholy. I don't measure my force by
10037: the negations in me, and think my soul must be a mighty one because it
10038: is more given to idle suffering than to beneficent activity. That's what
10039: your favorite gentlemen do, of the Byronic-bilious style."
10040: 
10041: "I don't admit that those are my favorite gentlemen."
10042: 
10043: "I've heard you defend them--gentlemen like your Rénés, who have no
10044: particular talent for the finite, but a general sense that the infinite
10045: is the right thing for them. They might as well boast of nausea as a
10046: proof of a strong inside."
10047: 
10048: "Stop, stop! You run on in that way to get out of my reach. I convicted
10049: you of confessing that you are melancholy."
10050: 
10051: "Yes," said Felix, thrusting his left hand into his pocket, with a
10052: shrug; "as I could confess to a great many other things I'm not proud
10053: of. The fact is, there are not many easy lots to be drawn in the world
10054: at present; and such as they are I am not envious of them. I don't say
10055: life is not worth having to a man who has some sparks of sense and
10056: feeling and bravery in him. And the finest fellow of all would be the
10057: one who could be glad to have lived because the world was chiefly
10058: miserable, and his life had come to help some one who needed it. He
10059: would be the man who had the most powers and the fewest selfish wants.
10060: But I'm not up to the level of what I see to be best. I'm often a hungry
10061: discontented fellow."
10062: 
10063: "Why have you made your life so hard then?" said Esther, rather
10064: frightened as she asked the question. "It seems to me you have tried to
10065: find just the most difficult task."
10066: 
10067: "Not at all," said Felix, with curt decision. "My course was a very
10068: simple one. It was pointed out to me by conditions that I saw as clearly
10069: as I see the bars of this stile. It's a difficult stile too," added
10070: Felix, striding over. "Shall I help you, or will you be left to
10071: yourself?"
10072: 
10073: "I can do without help, thank you."
10074: 
10075: "It was simple enough," continued Felix, as they walked on. "If I meant
10076: to put a stop to the sale of those drugs, I must keep my mother, and of
10077: course at her age she would not leave the place she had been used to.
10078: And I had made up my mind against what they call genteel business."
10079: 
10080: "But suppose every one did as you do? Please to forgive me for saying
10081: so; but I cannot see why you could not have lived as honorably with some
10082: employment that presupposes education and refinement."
10083: 
10084: "Because you can't see my history or my nature," said Felix, bluntly. "I
10085: have to determine for myself, and not for other men. I don't blame them,
10086: or think I am better than they; their circumstances are different. I
10087: would never choose to withdraw myself from the labor and common burden
10088: of the world; but I do choose to withdraw myself from the push and the
10089: scramble for money and position. Any man is at liberty to call me a
10090: fool, and say that mankind are benefited by the push and the scramble in
10091: the long-run. But I care for the people who live now and will not be
10092: living when the long-run comes. As it is, I prefer going shares with the
10093: unlucky."
10094: 
10095: Esther did not speak, and there was silence between them for a minute or
10096: two, till they passed through a gate into a plantation where there was
10097: no large timber, but only thin-stemmed trees and underwood, so that the
10098: sunlight fell on the mossy spaces which lay open here and there.
10099: 
10100: "See how beautiful those stooping birch-stems are with the light on
10101: them!" said Felix. "Here is an old felled trunk they have not thought
10102: worth carrying away. Shall we sit down a little while?"
10103: 
10104: "Yes; the mossy ground with the dry leaves sprinkled over it is
10105: delightful to one's feet." Esther sat down and took off her bonnet, that
10106: the light breeze might fall on her head. Felix, too, threw down his cap
10107: and stick, lying on the ground with his back against the felled trunk.
10108: 
10109: "I wish I felt more as you do," she said, looking at the point of her
10110: foot, which was playing with a tuft of moss. "I can't help caring very
10111: much what happens to me. And you seem to care so little about yourself."
10112: 
10113: "You are thoroughly mistaken," said Felix. "It is just because I'm a
10114: very ambitious fellow, with very hungry passions, wanting a great deal
10115: to satisfy me, that I have chosen to give up what people call worldly
10116: good. At least that has been one determining reason. It all depends on
10117: what a man gets into his consciousness--what life thrusts into his mind,
10118: so that it becomes present to him as remorse is present to the guilty,
10119: or a mechanical problem to an inventive genius. There are two things
10120: I've got present in that way: one of them is the picture of what I
10121: should hate to be. I'm determined never to go about making my face
10122: simpering or solemn, and telling professional lies for profit; or to get
10123: tangled in affairs where I must wink at dishonesty and pocket the
10124: proceeds, and justify that knavery as part of a system that I can't
10125: alter. If I once went into that sort of struggle for success I should
10126: want to win--I should defend the wrong that I had once identified myself
10127: with. I should become everything that I see now beforehand to be
10128: detestable. And what's more, I should do this, as men are doing it every
10129: day, for a ridiculously small prize--perhaps for none at all--perhaps
10130: for the sake of two parlors, a rank eligible for the churchwardenship, a
10131: discontented wife, and several unhopeful children."
10132: 
10133: Esther felt a terrible pressure on her heart--the certainty of her
10134: remoteness from Felix--the sense that she was utterly trivial to him.
10135: 
10136: "The other thing that's got into my mind like a splinter," said Felix,
10137: after a pause, "is the life of the miserable--the spawning life of vice
10138: and hunger. I'll never be one of the sleek dogs. The old Catholics are
10139: right, with their higher rule and their lower. Some are called to
10140: subject themselves to a harder discipline, and renounce things
10141: voluntarily which are lawful for others. It is the old word--'necessity'
10142: is laid upon me.
10143: 
10144: "It seems to me you are stricter than my father is."
10145: 
10146: "No; I quarrel with no delight that is not base or cruel, but one must
10147: sometimes accommodate one's self to a small share. That is the lot of
10148: the majority. I would wish the minority joy, only they don't want my
10149: wishes."
10150: 
10151: Again there was silence. Esther's cheeks were hot in spite of the breeze
10152: that sent her hair floating backward. She felt an inward strain, a
10153: demand on her to see things in a light that was not easy or soothing.
10154: When Felix had asked her to walk he seemed so kind, so alive to what
10155: might be her feelings, that she had thought herself nearer to him than
10156: she had ever been before; but since they had come out he had appeared to
10157: forget all that. And yet she was conscious that this impatience of hers
10158: was very petty. Battling in this way with her own little impulses, and
10159: looking at the birch-stems opposite till her gaze was too wide for her
10160: to see anything distinctly, she was unaware how long they had remained
10161: without speaking. She did not know that Felix had changed his attitude a
10162: little, and was resting his elbow on the tree-trunk, while he supported
10163: his head, which was turned toward her. Suddenly he said, in a lower tone
10164: than was habitual to him:
10165: 
10166: "You are very beautiful."
10167: 
10168: She started and looked round at him, to see whether his face would give
10169: some help to the interpretation of this novel speech. He was looking up
10170: at her quite calmly, very much as a reverential Protestant might look at
10171: a picture of the Virgin, with a devoutness suggested by the type rather
10172: than by the image. Esther's vanity was not in the least gratified: she
10173: felt that, somehow or other, Felix was going to reproach her.
10174: 
10175: "I wonder," he went on, still looking at her, "whether the subtle
10176: measuring of forces will ever come to measuring the force there would be
10177: in one beautiful woman whose mind was as noble as her face was
10178: beautiful--who made a man's passion for her rush in one current with all
10179: the great aims of his life."
10180: 
10181: Esther's eyes got hot and smarting. It was no use trying to be
10182: dignified. She had turned away her head, and now said, rather bitterly,
10183: "It is difficult for a woman ever to try to be anything good when she is
10184: not believed in--when it is always supposed that she must be
10185: contemptible."
10186: 
10187: "No, dear Esther"--it was the first time Felix had been prompted to call
10188: her by her Christian name, and as he did so he laid his large hand on
10189: her two little hands, which were clasped on her knees. "You don't
10190: believe that I think you contemptible. When I first saw you----"
10191: 
10192: "I know, I know," said Esther, interrupting him impetuously, but still
10193: looking away. "You mean you did think me contemptible then. But it was
10194: very narrow of you to judge me in that way, when my life had been so
10195: different from yours. I have great faults. I know I am selfish, and
10196: think too much of my own small tastes and too little of what affects
10197: others. But I am not stupid. I am not unfeeling. I can see what is
10198: better."
10199: 
10200: "But I have not done you injustice since I knew more of you," said
10201: Felix, gently.
10202: 
10203: "Yes, you have," said Esther, turning and smiling at him through her
10204: tears. "You talk to me like an angry pedagogue. Were _you_ always wise?
10205: Remember the time when you were foolish or naughty."
10206: 
10207: "That is not far off," said Felix, curtly, taking away his hand, and
10208: clasping it with the other at the back of his head. The talk, which
10209: seemed to be introducing a mutual understanding, such as had not existed
10210: before, seemed to have undergone some check.
10211: 
10212: "Shall we get up and walk back now?" said Esther, after a few moments.
10213: 
10214: "No," said Felix, entreatingly. "Don't move yet. I dare say we shall
10215: never walk together or sit here again."
10216: 
10217: "Why not?"
10218: 
10219: "Because I am a man who am warned by visions. Those old stories of
10220: visions and dreams guiding men have their truth; we are saved by making
10221: the future present to ourselves."
10222: 
10223: "I wish I could get visions, then," said Esther, smiling at him, with an
10224: effort of playfulness, in resistance to something vaguely mournful
10225: within her.
10226: 
10227: "That is what I want," said Felix, looking at her very earnestly. "Don't
10228: turn your head. Do look at me, and then I shall know if I may go on
10229: speaking. I do believe in you; but I want you to have such a vision of
10230: the future that you may never lose your best self. Some charm or other
10231: may be flung about you--some of your attar-of-rose fascinations--and
10232: nothing but a good strong terrible vision will save you. And if it did
10233: save you, you might be that woman I was thinking of a little while ago
10234: when I looked at your face: the woman whose beauty makes a great task
10235: easier to men instead of turning them away from it. I am not likely to
10236: see such fine issues; but they may come where a woman's spirit is finely
10237: touched. I should like to be sure they would come to you."
10238: 
10239: "Why are you not likely to know what becomes of me?" said Esther,
10240: turning away her eyes in spite of his command. "Why should you not
10241: always be my father's friend and mine?"
10242: 
10243: "Oh, I shall go away as soon as I can to some large town," said Felix,
10244: in his more usual tone--"some ugly, wicked, miserable place. I want to
10245: be a demagogue of a new sort; an honest one, if possible, who will tell
10246: the people they are blind and foolish, and neither flatter them nor
10247: fatten on them. I have my heritage--an order I belong to. I have the
10248: blood of a line of handicraftsmen in my veins, and I want to stand up
10249: for the lot of the handicraftsman as a good lot, in which a man may be
10250: better trained to all the best functions of his nature than if he
10251: belonged to the grimacing set who have visiting-cards, and are proud to
10252: be thought richer than their neighbors."
10253: 
10254: "Would nothing ever make it seem right to you to change your mind?" said
10255: Esther (she had rapidly woven some possibilities out of the new
10256: uncertainties in her own lot, though she would not for the world have
10257: had Felix know of her weaving). "Suppose, by some means or other, a
10258: fortune might come to you honorably--by marriage, or in any other
10259: unexpected way--would you see no change in your course?"
10260: 
10261: "No," said Felix, peremptorily; "I will never be rich. I don't count
10262: that as any peculiar virtue. Some men do well to accept riches, but that
10263: is not my inward vocation: I have no fellow-feeling with the rich as a
10264: class; the habits of their lives are odious to me. Thousands of men have
10265: wedded poverty because they expect to go to heaven for it; I don't
10266: expect to go to heaven for it, but I wed it because it enables me to do
10267: what I most want to do on earth. Whatever the hopes for the world may
10268: be--whether great or small--I am a man of this generation; I will try to
10269: make life less bitter for a few within my reach. It is held reasonable
10270: enough to toil for the fortunes of a family, though it may turn to
10271: imbecility in the third generation. I choose a family with more chances
10272: in it."
10273: 
10274: Esther looked before her dreamily till she said, "That seems a hard lot;
10275: yet it is a great one." She rose to walk back.
10276: 
10277: "Then you don't think I'm a fool," said Felix, loudly, starting to his
10278: feet, and then stooping to gather up his cap and stick.
10279: 
10280: "Of course you suspected me of that stupidity."
10281: 
10282: "Well--women, unless they are Saint Theresas or Elizabeth Frys,
10283: generally think this sort of thing madness, unless when they read of it
10284: in the Bible."
10285: 
10286: "A woman can hardly ever choose in that way; she is dependent on what
10287: happens to her. She must take meaner things, because only meaner things
10288: are within her reach."
10289: 
10290: "Why, can you imagine yourself choosing hardship as the better lot?"
10291: said Felix, looking at her with a sudden question in his eyes.
10292: 
10293: "Yes, I can," she said, flushing over neck and brow.
10294: 
10295: Their words were charged with a meaning dependent entirely on the secret
10296: consciousness of each. Nothing had been said which was necessarily
10297: personal. They walked a few yards along the road by which they had come,
10298: without further speech, till Felix said gently, "Take my arm." She took
10299: it, and they walked home so, entirely without conversation. Felix was
10300: struggling as a firm man struggles with a temptation, seeing beyond it
10301: and disbelieving its lying promise. Esther was struggling as a woman
10302: struggles with the yearning for some expression of love, and with
10303: vexation under that subjection to a yearning which is not likely to be
10304: satisfied. Each was conscious of a silence which each was unable to
10305: break, till they entered Malthouse Lane, and were within a few yards of
10306: the minister's door.
10307: 
10308: "It is getting dusk," Felix then said; "will Mr. Lyon be anxious about
10309: you?"
10310: 
10311: "No, I think not. Lyddy would tell him that I went out with you, and
10312: that you carried a large stick," said Esther, with a light laugh.
10313: 
10314: Felix went in with Esther to take tea, but the conversation was entirely
10315: between him and Mr. Lyon about the tricks of canvassing, the foolish
10316: personality of the placards, and the probabilities of Transome's return,
10317: as to which Felix declared himself to have become indifferent. This
10318: scepticism made the minister uneasy: he had great belief in the old
10319: political watchwords, had preached that universal suffrage and no ballot
10320: were agreeable to the will of God, and liked to believe that a visible
10321: "instrument" was forthcoming in the Radical candidate who had pronounced
10322: emphatically against Whig finality. Felix, being in a perverse mood,
10323: contended that universal suffrage would be equally agreeable to the
10324: devil; that he would change his politics a little, have a larger
10325: traffic, and see himself more fully represented in Parliament.
10326: 
10327: "Nay, my friend," said the minister, "you are again sporting with
10328: paradox; for you will not deny that you glory in the name of Radical, or
10329: Root-and-branch man, as they said in the great times when Nonconformity
10330: was in its giant youth."
10331: 
10332: "A Radical--yes; but I want to go to some roots a good deal lower down
10333: than the franchise."
10334: 
10335: "Truly there is a work within which cannot be dispensed with; but it is
10336: our preliminary work to free men from the stifled life of political
10337: nullity, and bring them into what Milton calls 'the liberal air,'
10338: wherein alone can be wrought the final triumphs of the Spirit."
10339: 
10340: "With all my heart. But while Caliban is Caliban, though you multiply
10341: him by a million, he'll worship every Trinculo that carries a bottle. I
10342: forget, though--you don't read Shakespeare, Mr. Lyon."
10343: 
10344: "I am bound to confess that I have so far looked into a volume of
10345: Esther's as to conceive your meaning; but the fantasies therein were so
10346: little to be reconciled with a steady contemplation of that divine
10347: economy which is hidden from sense and revealed to faith, that I forbore
10348: the reading, as likely to perturb my ministrations."
10349: 
10350: Esther sat by in unusual silence. The conviction that Felix willed her
10351: exclusion from his life was making it plain that something more than
10352: friendship between them was not so thoroughly out of the question as she
10353: had always inwardly asserted. In her pain that his choice lay aloof from
10354: her, she was compelled frankly to admit to herself the longing that it
10355: had been otherwise, and that he had entreated her to share his difficult
10356: life. He was like no one else to her: he had seemed to bring at once a
10357: law, and the love that gave strength to obey the law. Yet the next
10358: moment, stung by his independence of her, she denied that she loved him;
10359: she had only longed for a moral support under the negations of her life.
10360: If she were not to have that support, all effort seemed useless.
10361: 
10362: Esther had been so long used to hear the formulas of her father's belief
10363: without feeling or understanding them, that they had lost all power to
10364: touch her. The first religious experience of her life--the first
10365: self-questioning, the first voluntary subjection, the first longing to
10366: acquire the strength of greater motives and obey the more strenuous
10367: rule--had come to her through Felix Holt. No wonder that she felt as if
10368: the loss of him were inevitable backsliding.
10369: 
10370: But was it certain that she should lose him? She did not believe that he
10371: was really indifferent to her.
10372: 
10373: 
10374: 
10375: 
10376: CHAPTER XXVIII.
10377: 
10378:     _Titus._  But what says Jupiter, I ask thee?
10379: 
10380:     _Clown._  Alas, sir, I know not Jupiter:
10381:               I never drank with him in all my life.
10382: 
10383:                                                 --_Titus Andronicus_
10384: 
10385: 
10386: The multiplication of uncomplimentary placards noticed by Mr. Lyon and
10387: Felix Holt was one of several signs that the days of nomination and
10388: election were approaching. The presence of the Revising Barrister in
10389: Treby was not only an opportunity for all persons not otherwise busy to
10390: show their zeal for the purification of the voting-lists, but also to
10391: reconcile private ease and public duty by standing about the streets and
10392: lounging at doors.
10393: 
10394: It was no light business for Trebians to form an opinion; the mere fact
10395: of a public functionary with an unfamiliar title was enough to give
10396: them pause, as a premise that was not to be quickly started from. To Mr.
10397: Pink, the saddler, for example, until some distinct injury or benefit
10398: had accrued to him, the existence of the Revising Barrister was like the
10399: existence of the young giraffe which Wombwell had lately brought into
10400: those parts--it was to be contemplated, and not criticised. Mr. Pink
10401: professed a deep-dyed Toryism; but he regarded all fault-finding as
10402: Radical and somewhat impious, as disturbing to trade, and likely to
10403: offend the gentry, or the servants through whom their harness was
10404: ordered: there was a Nemesis in things which made objection unsafe, and
10405: even the Reform Bill was a sort of electric eel which a thriving
10406: tradesman had better leave alone. It was only the "Papists" who lived
10407: far enough off to be spoken of uncivilly.
10408: 
10409: But Mr. Pink was fond of news, which he collected and retailed with
10410: perfect impartiality, noting facts and rejecting comments. Hence he was
10411: well pleased to have his shop so constant a place of resort for
10412: loungers, that to many Trebians there was a strong association between
10413: the pleasures of gossip and the smell of leather. He had the
10414: satisfaction of chalking and cutting, and of keeping his journeymen
10415: close at work, at the very time that he learned from his visitors who
10416: were those whose votes had been called in question before His Honor, how
10417: Lawyer Jermyn had been too much for Lawyer Labron about Todd's cottages,
10418: and how, in the opinion of some townsmen, this looking into the value of
10419: people's property, and swearing it down below a certain sum, was a nasty
10420: inquisitorial kind of thing; while others observed that being nice to a
10421: few pounds was all nonsense--they should put the figure high enough, and
10422: then never mind if a voter's qualification was thereabouts. But, said
10423: Mr. Sims, the auctioneer, everything was done for the sake of the
10424: lawyers. Mr. Pink suggested impartially that lawyers must live; but Mr.
10425: Sims, having a ready auctioneering wit, did not see that so many of them
10426: need live, or that babies were born lawyers. Mr. Pink felt that this
10427: speculation was complicated by the ordering of side-saddles for lawyers'
10428: daughters, and, returning to the firm ground of fact, stated that it was
10429: getting dusk.
10430: 
10431: The dusk seemed deepened the next moment by a tall figure obstructing
10432: the doorway, at sight of whom Mr. Pink rubbed his hands and smiled and
10433: bowed more than once, with evident solicitude to show honor where honor
10434: was due, while he said:
10435: 
10436: "Mr. Christian, sir, how do you do, sir?"
10437: 
10438: Christian answered with the condescending familiarity of a superior.
10439: "Very badly, I can tell you, with these confounded braces that you were
10440: to make such a fine job of. See, old fellow, they've burst out again."
10441: 
10442: "Very sorry, sir. Can you leave them with me?"
10443: 
10444: "Oh, yes, I'll leave them. What's the news, eh?" said Christian, half
10445: seating himself on a high stool, and beating his boot with a hand-whip.
10446: 
10447: "Well, sir, we look to you to tell us that," said Mr. Pink, with a
10448: knowing smile. "You're at headquarters--eh, sir? That was what I said to
10449: Mr. Scales the other day. He came up for some straps, Mr. Scales did,
10450: and he asked that question in pretty near the same terms that you've
10451: done, sir, and I answered him, as I may say, ditto. Not meaning any
10452: disrespect to you, sir, but a way of speaking."
10453: 
10454: "Come, that's gammon, Pink," said Christian. "You know everything. You
10455: can tell me if you will, who is the fellow employed to paste up
10456: Transome's handbills?"
10457: 
10458: "What do _you_ say, Mr. Sims?" said Pink, looking at the auctioneer.
10459: 
10460: "Why, you know and I know well enough. It's Tommy Trounsem--an old,
10461: crippling, half-mad fellow. Most people know Tommy. I've employed him
10462: myself for charity."
10463: 
10464: "Where shall I find him?" said Christian.
10465: 
10466: "At the Cross-Keys, in Pollard's End, most likely," said Mr. Sims. "I
10467: don't know where he puts himself when he isn't at the public."
10468: 
10469: "He was a stoutish fellow fifteen year ago, when he carried pots," said
10470: Mr. Pink.
10471: 
10472: "Ay, and has snared many a hare in his time," said Mr. Sims. "But he was
10473: always a little cracked. Lord bless you! he used to swear he had a right
10474: to the Transome estate."
10475: 
10476: "Why, what put that notion into his head?" said Christian, who had
10477: learned more than he expected.
10478: 
10479: "The lawing, sir--nothing but the lawing about the estate. There was a
10480: deal of it twenty year ago," said Mr. Pink. "Tommy happened to turn up
10481: hereabout at that time; a big, lungeous fellow, who would speak
10482: disrespectfully of hanybody."
10483: 
10484: "Oh, he meant no harm," said Mr. Sims. "He was fond of a drop to drink,
10485: and not quite right in the upper story, and he could hear no difference
10486: between Trounsem and Transome. It's an odd way of speaking they have in
10487: that part where he was born--a little north'ard. You'll hear it in his
10488: tongue now, if you talk to him."
10489: 
10490: "At the Cross-Keys I shall find him, eh?" said Christian, getting off
10491: his stool. "Good-day, Pink--good-day."
10492: 
10493: Christian went straight from the saddler's to Quorlen's, the Tory
10494: printer's, with whom he had contrived a political spree. Quorlen was a
10495: new man in Treby, who had so reduced the trade of Dow, the old
10496: hereditary printer, that Dow had lapsed to Whiggery and Radicalism and
10497: opinions in general, so far as they were contented to express themselves
10498: in a small stock of types. Quorlen had brought his Duffield wit with
10499: him, and insisted that religion and joking were the handmaids of
10500: politics; on which principle he and Christian undertook the joking, and
10501: left the religion to the rector. The joke at present in question was a
10502: practical one. Christian, turning into the shop, merely said, "I've
10503: found him out--give me the placards"; and, tucking a thickish flat
10504: bundle, wrapped in a black glazed cotton bag, under his arm, walked out
10505: into the dusk again.
10506: 
10507: "Suppose now," he said to himself, as he strode along--"suppose there
10508: should be some secret to be got out of this old scamp, or some notion
10509: that's as good as a secret to those who know how to use it? That would
10510: be virtue rewarded. But I'm afraid the old tosspot is not likely to be
10511: good for much. There's truth in wine, and there may be some in gin and
10512: muddy beer; but whether it's truth worth my knowing, is another
10513: question. I've got plenty of truth, but never any that was worth a
10514: sixpence to me."
10515: 
10516: The Cross-Keys was a very old-fashioned "public"; its bar was a big
10517: rambling kitchen, with an undulating brick floor; the small-paned
10518: windows threw an interesting obscurity over the far-off dresser,
10519: garnished with pewter and tin, and with large dishes that seemed to
10520: speak of better times; the two settles were half pushed under the
10521: wide-mouthed chimney; and the grate with its brick hobs, massive iron
10522: crane, and various pothooks, suggested a generous plenty possibly
10523: existent in all moods and tenses except the indicative present. One way
10524: of getting an idea of our fellow-countrymen's miseries is to go and look
10525: at their pleasures. The Cross-Keys had a fungous-featured landlord and a
10526: yellow sickly landlady, with a large white kerchief bound round her cap,
10527: as if her head had recently required surgery; it had doctored ale, an
10528: odor of bad tobacco, and remarkably strong cheese. It was not what
10529: Astræa, when come back, might be expected to approve as the scene of
10530: ecstatic enjoyment for the beings whose special prerogative it is to
10531: lift their sublime faces toward heaven. Still, there was ample space on
10532: the hearth--accommodation for narrative bagmen or boxmen--room for a man
10533: to stretch his legs; his brain was not pressed upon by a white wall
10534: within a yard of him, and the light did not stare in mercilessly on bare
10535: ugliness, turning the fire to ashes. Compared with some beerhouses of
10536: this more advanced period, the Cross-Keys of that day presented a high
10537: standard of pleasure.
10538: 
10539: But though this venerable "public" had not failed to share in the recent
10540: political excitement of drinking, the pleasures it offered were not at
10541: this hour of the evening sought by a numerous company. There were only
10542: three or four pipes being smoked by the firelight, but it was enough for
10543: Christian when he found that one of these was being smoked by the
10544: bill-sticker, whose large flat basket, stuffed with placards, leaned
10545: near him against the settle. So splendid an apparition as Christian was
10546: not a little startling at the Cross-Keys, and was gazed at in expectant
10547: silence; but he was a stranger in Pollard's End, and was taken for the
10548: highest style of traveller when he declared that he was deucedly
10549: thirsty, ordered sixpenny worth of gin and a large jug of water, and,
10550: putting a few drops of the spirit into his own glass, invited Tommy
10551: Trounsem, who sat next him, to help himself. Tommy was not slower than a
10552: shaking hand obliged him to be in accepting this invitation. He was a
10553: tall, broad-shouldered old fellow, who had once been good-looking; but
10554: his cheeks and chest were both hollow now, and his limbs were shrunken.
10555: 
10556: "You've got some bills there, master, eh?" said Christian, pointing to
10557: the basket. "Is there an auction coming on?"
10558: 
10559: "Auction? no," said Tommy, with a gruff hoarseness, which was the
10560: remnant of a jovial bass, and with an accent which differed from the
10561: Trebian fitfully, as an early habit is wont to reassert itself. "I've
10562: nought to do wi' auctions; I'm a pol'tical charicter. It's me am getting
10563: Trounsem into Parl'ment."
10564: 
10565: "Trounsem, said he," the landlord observed, taking out his pipe with a
10566: low laugh. "It's Transome, sir. Maybe you don't belong to this part.
10567: It's the candidate 'ull do most for the workingmen, and's proved it too,
10568: in the way o' being open-handed and wishing 'em to enjoy themselves. If
10569: I'd twenty votes, I'd give one for Transome, and I don't care who hears
10570: me."
10571: 
10572: The landlord peered out from his fungous cluster of features with a
10573: beery confidence that the high figure of twenty had somehow raised the
10574: hypothetic value of his vote.
10575: 
10576: "Spilkins, now," said Tommy, waving his hand to the landlord, "you let
10577: one gentelman speak to another, will you? This genelman wants to know
10578: about my bills. Does he, or doesn't he?"
10579: 
10580: "What then? I spoke according," said the landlord, mildly holding his
10581: own.
10582: 
10583: "You're all very well, Spilkins," returned Tommy, "but y'aren't me. I
10584: know what the bills are. It's public business. I'm none o' your common
10585: bill-stickers, master; I've left off sticking up ten guineas reward for
10586: a sheep-stealer, or low stuff like that. These are Trounsem's bills; and
10587: I'm the rightful family, and so I give him a lift. A Trounsem I am, and
10588: a Trounsem I'll be buried; and if Old Nick tries to lay hold on me for
10589: poaching, I'll say, 'You be hanged for a lawyer, Old Nick; every hare
10590: and pheasant on the Trounsem's land is mine'; and what rises the family,
10591: rises old Tommy; and we're going to get into Parl'ment--that's the long
10592: and the short on't, master. And I'm the head o' the family, and I stick
10593: the bills. There's Johnsons, and Thomsons, and Jacksons, and Billsons;
10594: but I'm a Trounsem, I am. What do you say to that, master?"
10595: 
10596: This appeal, accompanied by a blow on the table, while the landlord
10597: winked at the company, was addressed to Christian, who answered, with
10598: severe gravity--
10599: 
10600: "I say there isn't any work more honorable than bill-sticking."
10601: 
10602: "No, no," said Tommy, wagging his head from side to side. "I thought
10603: you'd come in to that. I thought you'd know better than say contrairy.
10604: But I'll shake hands wi' you; I don't want to knock any man's head off.
10605: I'm a good chap--a sound crock--an old family kep' out o' my rights. I
10606: shall go to heaven, for all Old Nick."
10607: 
10608: As these celestial prospects might imply that a little extra gin was
10609: beginning to tell on the bill-sticker, Christian wanted to lose no time
10610: in arresting his attention. He laid his hand on Tommy's and spoke
10611: emphatically.
10612: 
10613: "But I'll tell you what you bill-stickers are not up to. You should be
10614: on the look-out when Debarry's side have stuck up fresh bills, and go
10615: and paste yours over them. I know where there's a lot of Debarry's bills
10616: now. Come along with me and I'll show you. We'll paste them over, and
10617: then we'll come back and treat the company."
10618: 
10619: "Hooray!" said Tommy. "Let's be off then."
10620: 
10621: He was one of the thoroughly inured, originally hale drunkards, and did
10622: not easily lose his head or legs or the ordinary amount of method in his
10623: talk. Strangers often supposed that Tommy was tipsy when he had only
10624: taken what he called "one blessed pint," chiefly from that glorious
10625: contentment with himself and his adverse fortunes which is not usually
10626: characteristic of the sober Briton. He knocked the ashes out of his
10627: pipe, seized his paste-vessel and his basket, and prepared to start with
10628: a satisfactory promise that he could know what he was about.
10629: 
10630: The landlord and some others had confidently concluded that they
10631: understood all about Christian now. He was a Transome's man, come to see
10632: after the bill-sticking in Transome's interest. The landlord, telling
10633: his yellow wife snappishly to open the door for the gentleman, hoped
10634: soon to see him again.
10635: 
10636: "This is a Transome's house, sir," he observed, "in respect of
10637: entertaining customers of that color. I do my duty as a publican, which,
10638: if I know it, is to turn back no genelman's money. I say, give every
10639: genelman a chance, and the more the merrier, in Parl'ment and out of it.
10640: And if anybody says they want but two Parl'ment men, I say it 'ud be
10641: better for trade if there was six of 'em, and voters according."
10642: 
10643: "Ay, ay," said Christian; "you're a sensible man, landlord. You don't
10644: mean to vote for Debarry, then, eh?"
10645: 
10646: "Not nohow," said the landlord, thinking that where negatives were good
10647: the more you had of them the better.
10648: 
10649: As soon as the door had closed behind Christian and his new companion
10650: Tommy said--
10651: 
10652: "Now, master, if you're to be my lantern, don't you be a Jacky Lantern,
10653: which I take to mean one as leads you the wrong way. For I'll tell you
10654: what--if you've had the luck to fall in wi' Tommy Trounsem, don't you
10655: let him drop."
10656: 
10657: "No, no--to be sure not," said Christian. "Come along here. We'll go to
10658: the Back Brewery wall first."
10659: 
10660: "No, no; don't you let me drop. Give me a shilling any day you like, and
10661: I'll tell you more nor you'll hear from Spilkins in a week. There isna
10662: many men like me. I carried pots for fifteen year off and on--what do
10663: you think o' that now, for a man as might ha' lived up there at Trounsem
10664: Park, and snared his own game? Which I'd ha' done," said Tommy, wagging
10665: his head at Christian in the dimness undisturbed by gas. "None o' your
10666: shooting for me--it's two to one you'll miss. Snaring's more
10667: fishing-like. You bait your hook, and if it isna the fishes' good-will
10668: to come, that's nothing again' the sporting genelman. And that's what I
10669: say by snaring."
10670: 
10671: "But if you'd a right to the Transome estate, how was it you were kept
10672: out of it, old boy? It was some foul shame or other, eh?"
10673: 
10674: "It's the law--that's what it is. You're a good sort of chap; I don't
10675: mind telling you. There's folks born to property, and there's folks
10676: catch hold on it; and the law's made for them to catch hold. I'm pretty
10677: deep; I see a good deal further than Spilkins. There was Ned Patch, the
10678: peddler, used to say to me, 'You canna read, Tommy,' says he. 'No; thank
10679: you,' says I; 'I'm not going to crack my headpiece to make myself as big
10680: a fool as you.' I was fond o' Ned. Many's the pot we've had together."
10681: 
10682: "I see well enough you're deep, Tommy. How came you to know you were
10683: born to property?"
10684: 
10685: "It was the regester--the parish regester," said Tommy, with his knowing
10686: wag of the head, "that shows as you was born. I allays felt it inside me
10687: as I was somebody, and I could see other chaps thought it on me too; and
10688: so one day at Littleshaw, where I kep' ferrets and a little bit of a
10689: public, there come a fine man looking after me, and walking me up and
10690: down wi' questions. And I made out from the clerk as he'd been at the
10691: regester; and I gave the clerk a pot or two, and he got it off our
10692: parson as the name o' Trounsem was a great name hereabout. And I waits a
10693: bit for my fine man to come again. Thinks I, if there's property wants a
10694: right owner, I shall be called for; for I didn't know the law then. And
10695: I waited and waited, till I see'd no fun i' waiting. So I parted with my
10696: public and my ferrets--for she was dead a' ready, my wife was, and I
10697: hadn't no cumbrance. And off I started a pretty long walk to this
10698: country-side, for I could walk for a wager in them days."
10699: 
10700: "Ah! well, here we are at the Back Brewery wall. Put down your paste and
10701: your basket now, old boy, and I'll help you. You paste, and I'll give
10702: you the bills, and then you can go on talking."
10703: 
10704: Tommy obeyed automatically, for he was now carried away by the rare
10705: opportunity of talking to a new listener, and was only eager to go on
10706: with his story. As soon as his back was turned, and he was stooping over
10707: his paste-pot, Christian, with quick adroitness, exchanged the placards
10708: in his own bag for those in Tommy's basket. Christian's placards had not
10709: been printed at Treby, but were a new lot which had been sent from
10710: Duffield that very day--"highly spiced," Quorlen had said, "coming from
10711: a pen that was up to that sort of thing." Christian had read the first
10712: of the sheaf, and supposed they were all alike. He proceeded to hand one
10713: to Tommy and said--
10714: 
10715: "Here, old boy, paste this over the other. And so, when you got into
10716: this country-side, what did you do?"
10717: 
10718: "Why, I put up at a good public and ordered the best, for I'd a bit o'
10719: money in my pocket; and I axed about, and they said to me, if it's
10720: Trounsem business you're after, you go to Lawyer Jermyn. And I went; and
10721: says I, going along, he's maybe the fine man as walked me up and down.
10722: But no such thing. I'll tell you what Lawyer Jermyn was. He stands you
10723: there, and holds you away from him wi' a pole three yard long. He stares
10724: at you, and says nothing, till you feel like a Tomfool; and then he
10725: threats you to set the justice on you; and then he's sorry for you, and
10726: hands you money, and preaches you a sarmint, and tells you you're a poor
10727: man, and he'll give you a bit of advice--and you'd better not be
10728: meddling wi' things belonging to the law, else you be catched up in a
10729: big wheel and fly to bits. And I went of a cold sweat, and I wished I
10730: might never come i' sight o' Lawyer Jermyn again. But he says, if you
10731: keep i' this neighborhood, behave yourself well, and I'll pertect you. I
10732: were deep enough, but it's no use being deep, 'cause you can never know
10733: the law. And there's times when the deepest fellow's most frightened."
10734: 
10735: "Yes, yes. There! Now for another placard. And so that was all?"
10736: 
10737: "All?" said Tommy, turning round and holding the paste-brush in suspense.
10738: "Don't you be running too quick. Thinks I, 'I'll meddle no more. I've
10739: got a bit o' money--I'll buy a basket, and be a pot-man. It's a pleasant
10740: life. I shall live at publics and see the world, and pick 'quaintance,
10741: and get a chance penny.' But when I'd turned into the Red Lion, and got
10742: myself warm again wi' a drop o' hot, something jumps into my head.
10743: Thinks I, Tommy, you've done finely for yourself: you're a rat as has
10744: broke up your house to take a journey, and show yourself to a ferret.
10745: And then it jumps into my head: I'd once two ferrets as turned on one
10746: another, and the little un killed the big un. Says I to the landlady,
10747: 'Missus, could you tell me of a lawyer,' says I, 'not very big or fine,
10748: but a second-size--a big-potato, like?' 'That I can,' says she; 'there's
10749: one now in the bar parlor.' 'Be so kind as bring us together,' says I.
10750: And she cries out--I think I hear her now--'Mr. Johnson!' And what do
10751: you think?"
10752: 
10753: At this crisis in Tommy's story the gray clouds, which had been
10754: gradually thinning, opened sufficiently to let down the sudden
10755: moonlight, and show his poor battered old figure and face in the
10756: attitude and with the expression of a narrator sure of the coming effect
10757: on his auditor; his body and neck stretched a little on one side, and
10758: his paste-brush held out with an alarming intention of tapping
10759: Christian's coat-sleeve at the right moment. Christian started to a safe
10760: distance, and said--
10761: 
10762: "It's wonderful. I can't tell what to think."
10763: 
10764: "Then never do you deny Old Nick," said Tommy, with solemnity. "I've
10765: believed in him more ever since. Who was Johnson? Why, Johnson was the
10766: fine man as had walked me up and down with questions. And I out with it
10767: to him then and there. And he speaks me civil, and says, 'Come away wi'
10768: me, my good fellow.' And he told me a deal o' law. And he says, 'Whether
10769: you're a Tommy Trounsem or no, it's no good to you, but only to them as
10770: have got hold o' the property. If you was a Tommy Trounsem twenty times
10771: over, it 'ud be no good, for the law's bought you out; and your life's
10772: no good, only to them as have catched hold o' the property. The more you
10773: live, the more they'll stick in. Not as they want you now,' says
10774: he--'you're no good to anybody, and you might howl like a dog foriver,
10775: and the law 'ud take no notice on you.' Says Johnson, 'I'm doing a kind
10776: thing by you to tell you. For that's the law.' And if you want to know
10777: the law, master, you ask Johnson. I heard 'em say after, as he was an
10778: understrapper at Jermyn's. I've never forgot it from that day to this.
10779: But I saw clear enough, as if the law hadn't been again' me, the
10780: Trounsem estate 'ud ha' been mine. But folks are fools hereabouts, and
10781: I've left off talking. The more you tell 'em the truth, the more they'll
10782: niver believe you. And I went and bought my basket and the pots,
10783: and----"
10784: 
10785: "Come then, fire away," said Christian. "Here's another placard."
10786: 
10787: "I'm getting a bit dry, master."
10788: 
10789: "Well, then, make haste, and you'll have something to drink all the
10790: sooner."
10791: 
10792: Tommy turned to his work again, and Christian, continuing his help,
10793: said, "And how long has Mr. Jermyn been employing you?"
10794: 
10795: "Oh, no particular time--off and on; but a week or two ago he sees me
10796: upo' the road, and speaks to me uncommon civil, and tells me to go up to
10797: his office and he'll give me employ. And I was noways unwilling to stick
10798: the bills to get the family into Parl'ment. For there's no man can help
10799: the law. And the family's the family, whether you carry pots or no.
10800: Master, I'm uncommon dry; my head's a-turning round; it's talking so
10801: long on end."
10802: 
10803: The unwonted excitement of poor Tommy's memory was producing a reaction.
10804: 
10805: "Well, Tommy," said Christian, who had just made a discovery among the
10806: placards which altered the bent of his thoughts, "you may go back to the
10807: Cross-Keys now, if you like; here's a half-crown for you to spend
10808: handsomely. I can't go back there myself just yet; but you may give my
10809: respects to Spilkins, and mind you paste the rest of the bills early
10810: to-morrow morning."
10811: 
10812: "Ay, ay. But don't you believe too much i' Spilkins," said Tommy,
10813: pocketing the half-crown, and showing his gratitude by giving this
10814: advice--"he's no harm much--but weak. He thinks he's at the bottom o'
10815: things because he scores you up. But I bear him no ill-will. Tommy
10816: Trounsem's a good chap; and any day you like to give me half-a-crown,
10817: I'll tell you the same story over again. Not now; I'm dry. Come, help me
10818: up wi' these things; you're a younger chap than me. Well, I'll tell
10819: Spilkins you'll come again another day."
10820: 
10821: The moonlight, which had lit up poor Tommy's oratorical attitude, had
10822: served to light up for Christian the print of the placards. He had
10823: expected the copies to be various, and had turned them half over at
10824: different depths of the sheaf before drawing out those he offered to the
10825: bill-sticker. Suddenly the clearer light had shown him on one of them a
10826: name which was just then especially interesting to him, and all the more
10827: when occurring in a placard intended to dissuade the electors of North
10828: Loamshire from voting for the heir of the Transomes. He hastily turned
10829: over the bills that preceded and succeeded, that he might draw out and
10830: carry away all of this pattern; for it might turn out to be wiser for
10831: him not to contribute to the publicity of handbills which contained
10832: allusions to Bycliffe _versus_ Transome. There were about a dozen of
10833: them; he pressed them together and thrust them into his pocket,
10834: returning all the rest to Tommy's basket. To take away this dozen might
10835: not be to prevent similar bills from being posted up elsewhere, but he
10836: had reason to believe that these were all of the same kind which had
10837: been sent to Treby from Duffield.
10838: 
10839: Christian's interest in his practical joke had died out like a morning
10840: rushlight. Apart from this discovery in the placards, old Tommy's story
10841: had some indications in it that were worth pondering over. Where was
10842: that well-informed Johnson now? Was he still an understrapper of
10843: Jermyn's?
10844: 
10845: With this matter in his thoughts, Christian only turned in hastily at
10846: Quorlen's, threw down the black bag which contained the captured Radical
10847: handbills, said he had done the job, and hurried back to the Manor that
10848: he might study his problem.
10849:

10853: CHAPTER XXIX.
10854: 
10855:     I doe believe that, as the gall has severall receptacles in several
10856:     creatures, soe there's scarce any creature but hath that emunctorye
10857:     somewhere.--SIR THOMAS BROWNE.
10858: 
10859: 
10860: Fancy what a game at chess would be if all the chessmen had passions and
10861: intellects, more or less small and cunning: if you were not only
10862: uncertain about your adversary's men, but a little uncertain about your
10863: own; if your knight could shuffle himself on to a new square by the sly;
10864: if your bishop, in disgust at your castling, could wheedle your pawns
10865: out of their places; and if your pawns, hating you because they are
10866: pawns, could make away from their appointed posts that you might get
10867: checkmate on a sudden. You might be the longest-headed of deductive
10868: reasoners, and yet you might be beaten by your own pawns. You would be
10869: especially likely to be beat, if you depended arrogantly on your
10870: mathematical imagination, and regarded your passionate pieces with
10871: contempt.
10872: 
10873: Yet this imaginary chess is easy compared with the game a man has to
10874: play against his fellow-men with other fellow-men for his instruments.
10875: He thinks himself sagacious, perhaps, because he trusts no bond except
10876: that of self-interest: but the only self-interest he can safely rely on
10877: is what seems to be such to the mind he would use or govern. Can he ever
10878: be sure of knowing this?
10879: 
10880: Matthew Jermyn was under no misgivings as to the fealty of Johnson. He
10881: had "been the making of Johnson"; and this seems to many men as a reason
10882: for expecting devotion, in spite of the fact that they themselves,
10883: though very fond of their own persons and lives, are not at all devoted
10884: to the Maker they believe in. Johnson was a most serviceable
10885: subordinate. Being a man who aimed at respectability, a family man, who
10886: had a good church-pew, subscribed for engravings of banquet pictures
10887: where there were portraits of political celebrities, and wished his
10888: children to be more unquestionably genteel than their father, he
10889: presented all the more numerous handles of worldly motive by which a
10890: judicious superior might get a hold on him. But this useful regard to
10891: respectability had its inconvenience in relation to such a superior: it
10892: was a mark of some vanity and some pride, which, if they were not
10893: touched just in the right handling-place, were liable to become raw and
10894: sensitive. Jermyn was aware of Johnson's weaknesses, and thought he had
10895: flattered them sufficiently. But on the point of knowing when we are
10896: disagreeable, our human nature is fallible. Our lavender-water, our
10897: smiles, our compliments, and other polite falsities, are constantly
10898: offensive, when in the very nature of them they can only be meant to
10899: attract admiration and regard. Jermyn had often been unconsciously
10900: disagreeable to Johnson, over and above the constant offence of being an
10901: ostentatious patron. He would never let Johnson dine with his wife and
10902: daughters; he would not himself dine at Johnson's house when he was in
10903: town. He often did what was equivalent to poohpoohing his conversation
10904: by not even appearing to listen, and by suddenly cutting it short with a
10905: query on a new subject. Jermyn was able and politic enough to have
10906: commanded a great deal of success in his life, but he could not help
10907: being handsome, arrogant, fond of being heard, indisposed to any kind of
10908: comradeship, amorous and bland toward women, cold and self-contained
10909: toward men. You will hear very strong denials that an attorney's being
10910: handsome could enter into the dislike he excited; but conversation
10911: consists a good deal in the denial of what is true. From the British
10912: point of view masculine beauty is regarded very much as it is in the
10913: drapery business:--as good solely for the fancy department--for young
10914: noblemen, artists, poets, and the clergy. Some one who, like Mr. Lingon,
10915: was disposed to revile Jermyn (perhaps it was Sir Maximus), had called
10916: him "a cursed, sleek, handsome, long-winded, overbearing sycophant";
10917: epithets which expressed, rather confusedly, the mingled character of
10918: the dislike he excited. And serviceable John Johnson, himself sleek, and
10919: mindful about his broadcloth and his cambric fronts, had what he
10920: considered "spirit" enough within him to feel that dislike of Jermyn
10921: gradually gathering force through years of obligation and subjection,
10922: till it had become an actuating motive disposed to use an opportunity;
10923: if it did not watch for one.
10924: 
10925: It was not this motive, however, but rather the ordinary course of
10926: business, which accounted for Johnson's playing a double part as an
10927: electioneering agent. What men do in elections is not to be classed
10928: either among sins or marks of grace; it would be profane to include
10929: business in religion, and conscience refers to failure, not to success.
10930: Still, the sense of being galled by Jermyn's harness was an additional
10931: reason for cultivating all relations that were independent of him; and
10932: pique at Harold Transome's behavior to him in Jermyn's office perhaps
10933: gave all the more zest to Johnson's use of his pen and ink when he wrote
10934: a handbill in the service of Garstin, and Garstin's incomparable agent,
10935: Putty, full of innuendoes against Harold Transome, as a descendant of
10936: the Durfey-Transomes. It is a natural subject of self-congratulation to
10937: a man, when special knowledge, gained long ago without any forecast,
10938: turns out to afford a special inspiration in the present; and Johnson
10939: felt a new pleasure in the consciousness that he of all people in the
10940: world next to Jermyn had the most intimate knowledge of the Transome
10941: affairs. Still better--some of these affairs were secrets of Jermyn's.
10942: If in an uncomplimentary spirit he might have been called Jermyn's "man
10943: of straw," it was a satisfaction to know that the unreality of the man
10944: John Johnson was confined to his appearance in annuity deeds, and that
10945: elsewhere he was solid, locomotive, and capable of remembering anything
10946: for his own pleasure and benefit. To act with doubleness towards a man
10947: whose conduct was double, was so near an approach to virtue that it
10948: deserved to be called by no meaner name than diplomacy.
10949: 
10950: By such causes it came to pass that Christian held in his hands a bill
10951: in which Jermyn was playfully alluded to as Mr. German Cozen, who won
10952: games by clever shuffling and odd tricks without any honor, and backed
10953: Durfey's crib against Bycliffe--in which it was adroitly implied that
10954: the so-called head of the Transomes was only the tail of the
10955: Durfeys--and that some said the Durfeys would have died out and left
10956: their nest empty if it had not been for their German Cozen.
10957: 
10958: Johnson had not dared to use any recollections except such as might
10959: credibly exist in other minds besides his own. In the truth of the case,
10960: no one but himself had the prompting to recall these out-worn scandals;
10961: but it was likely enough that such foul-winged things should be revived
10962: by election heats for Johnson to escape all suspicion.
10963: 
10964: Christian could gather only dim and uncertain inferences from this flat
10965: irony and heavy joking; but one chief thing was clear to him. He had
10966: been right in his conjecture that Jermyn's interest about Bycliffe had
10967: its source in some claim of Bycliffe's on the Transome property. And
10968: then, there was that story of the old bill-sticker's, which, closely
10969: considered, indicated that the right of the present Transomes depended,
10970: or, at least, had depended on the continuance of some other lives.
10971: Christian in his time had gathered enough legal notions to be aware that
10972: possession by one man sometimes depended on the life of another; that a
10973: man might sell his own interest in property, and the interest of his
10974: descendants, while a claim on that property would still remain to some
10975: one else than the purchaser, supposing the descendants became extinct,
10976: and the interests they had sold were at an end. But under what
10977: conditions the claim might be valid or void in any particular case, was
10978: all darkness to him. Suppose Bycliffe had any such claim on the Transome
10979: estates: how was Christian to know whether at the present moment it was
10980: worth anything more than a bit of rotten parchment? Old Tommy Trounsem
10981: had said that Johnson knew all about it. But even if Johnson were still
10982: above-ground--and all Johnsons are mortal--he might still be an
10983: understrapper of Jermyn's, in which case his knowledge would be on the
10984: wrong side of the hedge for the purposes of Henry Scaddon. His immediate
10985: care must be to find out all he could about Johnson. He blamed himself
10986: for not having questioned Tommy further while he had him at command; but
10987: on this head the bill-sticker could hardly know more than the less
10988: dilapidated denizens of Treby.
10989: 
10990: Now it had happened that during the weeks in which Christian had been at
10991: work trying to solve the enigma of Jermyn's interest about Bycliffe,
10992: Johnson's mind also had been somewhat occupied with suspicion and
10993: conjecture as to new information on the subject of the old Bycliffe
10994: claims which Jermyn intended to conceal from him. The letter which,
10995: after his interview with Christian, Jermyn had written with a sense of
10996: perfect safety to his faithful ally Johnson, was, as we know, written to
10997: a Johnson who had found his self-love incompatible with that
10998: faithfulness of which it was supposed to be the foundation. Anything
10999: that the patron felt it inconvenient for his obliged friend and servant
11000: to know, became by that very fact an object of peculiar curiosity. The
11001: obliged friend and servant secretly doted on his patron's inconvenience,
11002: provided that he himself did not share it; and conjecture naturally
11003: became active.
11004: 
11005: Johnson's legal imagination, being very differently furnished from
11006: Christian's, was at no loss to conceive conditions under which there
11007: might arise a new claim on the Transome estates. He had before him the
11008: whole history of the settlement of those estates made a hundred years
11009: ago by John Justus Transome, entailing them, whilst in his possession,
11010: on his son Thomas and his heirs-male, with remainder to the Bycliffes in
11011: fee. He knew that Thomas, son of John Justus, proving a prodigal, had,
11012: without the knowledge of his father, the tenant in possession, sold his
11013: own and his descendants' rights to a lawyer-cousin named Durfey; that,
11014: therefore, the title of the Durfey-Transomes, in spite of that old
11015: Durfey's tricks to show the contrary, depended solely on the purchase of
11016: the "base fee" thus created by Thomas Transome; and that the Bycliffes
11017: were the "remainder men" who might fairly oust the Durfey-Transomes if
11018: ever the issue of the prodigal Thomas went clean out of existence, and
11019: ceased to represent a right which he had bargained away from them.
11020: 
11021: Johnson, as Jermyn's subordinate, had been closely cognizant of the
11022: details concerning the suit instituted by successive Bycliffes, of whom
11023: Maurice Christian Bycliffe was the last, on the plea that the extinction
11024: of Thomas Transome's line had actually come to pass--a weary suit, which
11025: had eaten into the fortunes of two families, and had only made the
11026: cankerworms fat. The suit had closed with the death of Maurice Christian
11027: Bycliffe in prison; but before his death, Jermyn's exertions to get
11028: evidence that there was still issue of Thomas Transome's line surviving,
11029: as a security of the Durfey title, had issued in the discovery of a
11030: Thomas Transome at Littleshaw, in Stonyshire, who was the representative
11031: of the pawned inheritance. The death of Maurice had made this discovery
11032: useless--had made it seem the wiser part to say nothing about it; and
11033: the fact had remained a secret known only to Jermyn and Johnson. No
11034: other Bycliffe was known or believed to exist, and the Durfey-Transomes
11035: might be considered safe, unless--yes, there was an "unless" which
11036: Johnson could conceive: an heir or heiress of the Bycliffes--if such a
11037: personage turned out to be in existence--might sometime raise a new and
11038: valid claim when once informed that wretched old Tommy Trounsem the
11039: bill-sticker, tottering drunkenly on the edge of the grave, was the last
11040: issue remaining above-ground from that dissolute Thomas who played his
11041: Esau part a century before. While the poor old bill-sticker breathed,
11042: the Durfey-Transomes could legally keep their possession in spite of a
11043: possible Bycliffe proved real; but not when the parish had buried the
11044: bill-sticker.
11045: 
11046: Still, it is one thing to conceive conditions, and another to see any
11047: chance of proving their existence. Johnson at present had no glimpse of
11048: such a chance; and even if he ever gained the glimpse, he was not sure
11049: that he should ever make any use of it. His enquiries of Medwin, in
11050: obedience to Jermyn's letter, had extracted only a negative as to any
11051: information possessed by the lawyers of Bycliffe concerning a marriage,
11052: or expectation of offspring on his part. But Johnson felt not the less
11053: stung by curiosity to know what Jermyn had found out: that he had found
11054: something in relation to a possible Bycliffe, Johnson felt pretty sure.
11055: And he thought with satisfaction that Jermyn could not hinder him from
11056: knowing what he already knew about Thomas Transome's issue. Many things
11057: might occur to alter his policy and give a new value to facts. Was it
11058: certain that Jermyn would always be fortunate?
11059: 
11060: When greed and unscrupulousness exhibit themselves on a grand historical
11061: scale, and there is a question of peace or war or amicable partition, it
11062: often occurs that gentlemen of high diplomatic talents have their minds
11063: bent on the same object from different points of view. Each, perhaps, is
11064: thinking of a certain duchy or province, with a view to arranging the
11065: ownership in such a way as shall best serve the purposes of the
11066: gentleman with high diplomatic talents in whom each is more especially
11067: interested. But these select minds in high office can never miss their
11068: aims from ignorance of each other's existence or whereabouts. Their high
11069: titles may be learned even by common people from every pocket almanac.
11070: 
11071: But with meaner diplomats, who might be mutually useful, such ignorance
11072: is often obstructive. Mr. John Johnson and Mr. Christian, otherwise Mr.
11073: Scaddon, might have had a concentration of purpose and an ingenuity of
11074: device fitting them to make a figure in the parcelling of Europe, and
11075: yet they might never have met, simply because Johnson knew nothing of
11076: Christian, and because Christian did not know where to find Johnson.

11081: CHAPTER XXX.
11082: 
11083:     His nature is too noble for the world:
11084:     He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
11085:     Or Jove for his power to thunder. His heart's his mouth;
11086:     What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;
11087:     And, being angry, doth forget that ever
11088:     He heard the name of death.--_Coriolanus._
11089: 
11090: 
11091: Christian and Johnson did meet, however, by means that were quite
11092: incalculable. The incident which brought them into communication was due
11093: to Felix Holt, who of all men in the world had the least affinity either
11094: for the industrious or the idle parasite.
11095: 
11096: Mr. Lyon had urged Felix to go to Duffield on the fifteenth of December
11097: to witness the nomination of the candidates for North Loamshire. The
11098: minister wished to hear what took place; and the pleasure of gratifying
11099: him helped to outweigh some opposing reasons.
11100: 
11101: "I shall get into a rage at something or other," Felix had said. "I've
11102: told you one of my weak points. Where I have any particular business, I
11103: must incur the risks my nature brings. But I've no particular business
11104: at Duffield. However, I'll make a holiday and go. By dint of seeing
11105: folly, I shall get lessons in patience."
11106: 
11107: The weak point to which Felix referred was his liability to be carried
11108: completely out of his own mastery by indignant anger. His strong health,
11109: his renunciation of selfish claims, his habitual preoccupation with
11110: large thoughts and with purposes independent of everyday casualties,
11111: secured him a fine and even temper, free from moodiness or irritability.
11112: He was full of long-suffering toward his unwise mother, who "pressed him
11113: daily with her words and urged him, so that his soul was vexed;" he had
11114: chosen to fill his days in a way that required the utmost exertion of
11115: patience, that required those little rill-like outflowings of goodness
11116: which in minds of great energy must be fed from deep sources of thought
11117: and passionate devotedness. In this way his energies served to make him
11118: gentle; and now, in this twenty-sixth year of his life, they had ceased
11119: to make him angry, except in the presence of something that roused his
11120: deep indignation. When once exasperated, the passionateness of his
11121: nature threw off the yoke of a long-trained consciousness in which
11122: thought and emotion had been more and more completely mingled, and
11123: concentrated itself in a rage as ungovernable as that of boyhood. He was
11124: thoroughly aware of the liability, and knew that in such circumstances
11125: he could not answer for himself. Sensitive people with feeble frames
11126: have often the same sort of fury within them; but they are themselves
11127: shattered, and shatter nothing. Felix had a terrible arm: he knew that
11128: he was dangerous; and he avoided the conditions that might cause him
11129: exasperation as he would have avoided intoxicating drinks if he had been
11130: in danger of intemperance.
11131: 
11132: The nomination-day was a great epoch of successful trickery, or, to
11133: speak in a more parliamentary manner, of war-stratagem, on the part of
11134: skilful agents. And Mr. Johnson had his share of inward chuckling and
11135: self-approval, as one who might justly expect increasing renown, and be
11136: some day in as general request as the great Putty himself. To have the
11137: pleasure and the praise of electioneering ingenuity, and also to get
11138: paid for it, without too much anxiety whether the ingenuity will achieve
11139: its ultimate end, perhaps gives to some select persons a sort of
11140: satisfaction in their superiority to their more agitated fellow-men that
11141: is worthy to be classed with those generous enjoyments of having the
11142: truth chiefly to yourself, and of seeing others in danger of drowning
11143: while you are high and dry, which seem to have been regarded as unmixed
11144: privileges by Lucretius and Lord Bacon.
11145: 
11146: One of Mr. Johnson's great successes was this. Spratt, the hated manager
11147: of the Sproxton Colliery, in careless confidence that the colliers and
11148: other laborers under him would follow his orders, had provided carts to
11149: carry some loads of voteless enthusiasm to Duffield on behalf of
11150: Garstin; enthusiasm which, being already paid for by the recognized
11151: benefit of Garstin's existence as a capitalist with a share in the
11152: Sproxton mines, was not to cost much in the form of treating. A
11153: capitalist was held worthy of pious honor as the cause why workingmen
11154: existed. But Mr. Spratt did not sufficiently consider that a cause which
11155: was to be proved by argument or testimony is not an object of passionate
11156: devotion to colliers: a visible cause of beer acts on them much more
11157: strongly. And even if there had been any love of the far-off Garstin,
11158: hatred of the too immediate Spratt would have been the stronger motive.
11159: Hence Johnson's calculations, made long ago with Chubb, the remarkable
11160: publican, had been well founded, and there had been diligent care to
11161: supply treating at Duffield in the name of Transome. After the election
11162: was over it was not improbable that there would be much friendly joking
11163: between Putty and Johnson as to the success of this trick against
11164: Putty's employer, and Johnson would be conscious of rising in the
11165: opinion of his celebrated senior.
11166: 
11167: For the show of hands and the cheering, the hustling and the pelting,
11168: the roaring and the hissing, the hard hits with small missiles and the
11169: soft hits with small jokes, were strong enough on the side of Transome
11170: to balance the similar "demonstrations" for Garstin, even with the
11171: Debarry interest in his favor. And the inconvenient presence of Spratt
11172: was easily got rid of by a dexterously-managed accident, which sent him
11173: bruised and limping from the scene of action. Mr. Chubb had never before
11174: felt so thoroughly that the occasion was up to a level with his talents,
11175: while the clear daylight in which his virtue would appear when at the
11176: election he voted, as his duty to himself bound him, for Garstin only,
11177: gave him thorough repose of conscience.
11178: 
11179: Felix Holt was the only person looking on at the senseless exhibitions
11180: of this nomination-day, who knew from the beginning the history of the
11181: trick with the Sproxton men. He had been aware all along that the
11182: treating at Chubb's had been continued, and that so far Harold
11183: Transome's promise had produced no good fruits; and what he was
11184: observing to-day, as he watched the uproarious crowd, convinced him that
11185: the whole scheme would be carried out just as if he had never spoken
11186: about it. He could be fair enough to Transome to allow that he might
11187: have wished, and yet have been unable, with his notions of success, to
11188: keep his promise; and his bitterness toward the candidate only took the
11189: form of contemptuous pity; for Felix was not sparing in his contempt for
11190: men who put their inward honor in pawn by seeking the prizes of the
11191: world. His scorn fell too readily on the fortunate. But when he saw
11192: Johnson passing to and fro, and speaking to Jermyn on the hustings, he
11193: felt himself getting angry, and jumped off the wheel of the stationary
11194: cart on which he was mounted, that he might no longer be in sight of
11195: this man, whose vitiating cant had made his blood hot and his fingers
11196: tingle on the first day of encountering him at Sproxton. It was a little
11197: too exasperating to look at this pink-faced rotund specimen of
11198: prosperity, to witness the power for evil that lay in his vulgar cant,
11199: backed by another man's money, and to know that such stupid iniquity
11200: flourished the flags of Reform, and Liberalism, and justice to the
11201: needy. While the roaring and the scuffling were still going on, Felix,
11202: with his thick stick in his hand, made his way through the crowd, and
11203: walked on through the Duffield streets, till he came out on a grassy
11204: suburb, where the houses surrounded a small common. Here he walked
11205: about in the breezy air, and ate his bread and apples, telling himself
11206: that this angry haste of his about evils that could only be remedied
11207: slowly, could be nothing else than obstructive, and might some day--he
11208: saw it so clearly that the thought seemed like a presentiment--be
11209: obstructive of his own work.
11210: 
11211: "Not to waste energy, to apply force where it would tell, to do small
11212: work close at hand, not waiting for speculative chances of heroism, but
11213: preparing for them"--these were the rules he had been constantly urging
11214: on himself. But what could be a greater waste than to beat a scoundrel
11215: who had law and opodeldoc at command? After this meditation, Felix felt
11216: cool and wise enough to return into the town, not, however, intending to
11217: deny himself the satisfaction of a few pungent words wherever there was
11218: place for them. Blows are sarcasms turned stupid: wit is a form of force
11219: that leaves the limbs at rest.
11220: 
11221: Anything that could be called a crowd was no longer to be seen. The show
11222: of hands having been pronounced to be in favor of Debarry and Transome,
11223: and a poll having been demanded for Garstin, the business of the day
11224: might be considered at an end. But in the street where the hustings were
11225: erected, and where the great hotels stood, there were many groups, as
11226: well as strollers and steady walkers to and fro. Men in superior
11227: greatcoats and well-brushed hats were awaiting with more or less
11228: impatience an important dinner, either at the Crown, which was Debarry's
11229: house, or at the Three Cranes, which was Garstin's, or at the Fox and
11230: Hounds, which was Transome's. Knots of sober retailers, who had already
11231: dined, were to be seen at some shop-doors; men in very shabby coats and
11232: miscellaneous head-coverings, inhabitants of Duffield and not county
11233: voters, were lounging about in dull silence, or listening, some to a
11234: grimy man in a flannel shirt, hatless and with turbid red hair, who was
11235: insisting on political points with much more ease than had seemed to
11236: belong to the gentlemen speakers on the hustings, and others to a Scotch
11237: vendor of articles useful to sell, whose unfamiliar accent seemed to
11238: have a guarantee of truth in it wanting as an association with everyday
11239: English. Some rough-looking pipe-smokers, or distinguished
11240: cigar-smokers, chose to walk up and down in isolation and silence. But
11241: the majority of those who had shown a burning interest in the nomination
11242: had disappeared, and cockades no longer studded a close-pressed crowd,
11243: like, and also very unlike, meadow-flowers among the grass. The street
11244: pavement was strangely painted with fragments of perishable missiles
11245: ground flat under heavy feet: but the workers were resting from their
11246: toil, and the buzz and tread and the fitfully discernible voices seemed
11247: like stillness to Felix after the roar with which the wide space had
11248: been filled when he left it.
11249: 
11250: The group round the speaker in the flannel shirt stood at the corner of
11251: a side-street, and the speaker himself was elevated by the head and
11252: shoulders above his hearers, not because he was tall, but because he
11253: stood on a projecting stone. At the opposite corner of the turning was
11254: the great inn of the Fox and Hounds, and this was the ultra-Liberal
11255: quarter of the High street. Felix was at once attracted by this group;
11256: he liked the look of the speaker, whose bare arms were powerfully
11257: muscular, though he had the pallid complexion of a man who lives chiefly
11258: amidst the heat of furnaces. He was leaning against the dark stone
11259: building behind him with folded arms, the grimy paleness of his shirt
11260: and skin standing out in high relief against the dark stone building
11261: behind him. He lifted up one forefinger, and marked his emphasis with it
11262: as he spoke. His voice was high and not strong, but Felix recognized the
11263: fluency and the method of an habitual preacher or lecturer.
11264: 
11265: "It's the fallacy of all monopolists," he was saying. "We know what
11266: monopolists are: men who want to keep a trade all to themselves, under
11267: the pretence that they'll furnish the public with a better article. We
11268: know what that comes to: in some countries a poor man can't afford to
11269: buy a spoonful of salt, and yet there's salt enough in the world to
11270: pickle every living thing in it. That's the sort of benefit monopolists
11271: do to mankind. And these are the men who tell us we're to let politics
11272: alone; they'll govern us better without our knowing anything about it.
11273: We must mind our business; we are ignorant; we've no time to study great
11274: questions. But I tell them this: the greatest question in the world is,
11275: how to give every man a man's share in what goes on in life----"
11276: 
11277: "Hear, hear!" said Felix in his sonorous voice, which seemed to give a
11278: new impressiveness to what the speaker had said. Every one looked at
11279: him: the well-washed face and its educated expression along with a dress
11280: more careless than that of most well-to-do workmen on a holiday, made
11281: his appearance strangely arresting.
11282: 
11283: "Not a pig's share," the speaker went on, "not a horse's, not the share
11284: of a machine fed with oil only to make it work and nothing else. It
11285: isn't a man's share just to mind your pin-making, or your glass-blowing,
11286: and higgle about your own wages, and bring up your family to be ignorant
11287: sons of ignorant fathers, and no better prospect; that's a slave's
11288: share; we want a freeman's share, and that is to think and speak and act
11289: about what concerns us all, and see whether these fine gentlemen who
11290: undertake to govern us are doing the best they can for us. They've got
11291: the knowledge, say they. Very well, we've got the wants. There's many a
11292: one would be idle if hunger didn't pinch him; but the stomach sets us to
11293: work. There's a fable told where the nobles are the belly and the people
11294: the members. But I make another sort of fable. I say, we are the belly
11295: that feels the pinches, and we'll set these aristocrats, these great
11296: people who call themselves our brains, to work at some way of satisfying
11297: us a bit better. The aristocrats are pretty sure to try and govern for
11298: their own benefit; but how are we to be sure they'll try and govern for
11299: ours? They must be looked after, I think, like other workmen. We must
11300: have what we call inspectors, to see whether the work's well done for
11301: us. We want to send our inspectors to Parliament. Well, they say--you've
11302: got the Reform Bill; what more can you want? Send your inspectors. But I
11303: say, the Reform Bill is a trick--it's nothing but swearing-in special
11304: constables to keep the aristocrats safe in their monopoly; it's bribing
11305: some of the people with votes to make them hold their tongues about
11306: giving votes to the rest. I say, if a man doesn't beg or steal, but
11307: works for his bread, the poorer and the more miserable he is, the more
11308: he'd need have a vote to send an inspector to Parliament--else the man
11309: who is worst off is likely to be forgotten; and I say, he's the man who
11310: ought to be first remembered. Else what does their religion mean? Why do
11311: they build churches and endow them that their sons may get paid well for
11312: preaching a Saviour, and making themselves as little like Him as can be?
11313: If I want to believe in Jesus Christ, I must shut my eyes for fear I
11314: should see a parson. And what's a bishop? A bishop's a person dressed
11315: up, who sits in the House of Lords to help and throw out Reform Bills.
11316: And because it's hard to get anything in the shape of a man to dress
11317: himself up like that, and do such work, they have to give him a palace
11318: for it, and plenty of thousands a-year. And then they cry out--'The
11319: Church is in danger,'--'the poor man's Church.' And why is it the poor
11320: man's Church? Because he can have a seat for nothing. I think it _is_
11321: for nothing; for it would be hard to tell what he gets by it. If the
11322: poor man had a vote in the matter, I think he'd choose a different sort
11323: of Church to what that is. But do you think the aristocrats will ever
11324: alter it, if the belly doesn't pinch them? Not they. It's part of their
11325: monopoly. They'll supply us with our religion like everything else, and
11326: get a profit on it. They'll give us plenty of heaven. We may have land
11327: _there_. That's the sort of religion they like--a religion that gives us
11328: workingmen heaven, and nothing else. But we'll offer to change with
11329: them. We'll give them back some of their heaven, and take it out in
11330: something for us and our children in this world. They don't seem to care
11331: so much about heaven themselves till they feel the gout very bad; but
11332: you won't get them to give up anything else, if you don't pinch 'em for
11333: it. And to pinch them enough, we must get the suffrage, we must get
11334: votes, that we may send the men to Parliament who will do our work for
11335: us; and we must have Parliament dissolved every year, that we may change
11336: our man if he doesn't do what we want him to do; and we must have the
11337: country divided so that the little kings of the counties can't do as
11338: they like, but must be shaken up in one bag with us. I say, if we
11339: workingmen are ever to get a man's share, we must have universal
11340: suffrage, and annual Parliaments, and the vote by ballot, and electoral
11341: districts."
11342: 
11343: "No!--something else before all that," said Felix, again startling the
11344: audience into looking at him. But the speaker glanced coldly at him and
11345: went on.
11346: 
11347: "That's what Sir Francis Burdett went in for fifteen years ago; and it's
11348: the right thing for us, if it was Tomfool who went in for it. You must
11349: lay hold of such handles as you can. I don't believe much in Liberal
11350: aristocrats; but if there's any fine carved gold-headed stick of an
11351: aristocrat will make a broomstick of himself, I'll lose no time but I'll
11352: sweep with him. And that's what I think about Transome. And if any of
11353: you have acquaintance among county voters, give 'em a hint that you wish
11354: 'em to vote for Transome."
11355: 
11356: At the last word, the speaker stepped down from his slight eminence, and
11357: walked away rapidly, like a man whose leisure was exhausted, and who
11358: must go about his business. But he had left an appetite in his audience
11359: for further oratory, and one of them seemed to express a general
11360: sentiment as he hurried immediately to Felix, and said, "Come, sir, what
11361: do you say?"
11362: 
11363: Felix did at once what he would very likely have done without being
11364: asked--he stepped on the stone, and took off his cap by an instinctive
11365: prompting that always led him to speak uncovered. The effect of his
11366: figure in relief against the stone background was unlike that of the
11367: previous speaker. He was considerably taller, his head and neck were
11368: more massive, and the expression of his mouth and eyes was something
11369: very different from the mere acuteness and rather hard-lipped antagonism
11370: of the trades-union man. Felix Holt's face had the look of habitual
11371: meditative abstraction from objects of mere personal vanity or desire,
11372: which is the peculiar stamp of culture, and makes a very roughly-cut
11373: face worthy to be called "the human face divine." Even lions and dogs
11374: know a distinction between men's glances; and doubtless those Duffield
11375: men, in the expectation with which they looked up at Felix, were
11376: unconsciously influenced by the grandeur of his full yet firm mouth, and
11377: the calm clearness of his gray eyes, which were somehow unlike what they
11378: were accustomed to see along with an old brown velveteen coat, and an
11379: absence of chin-propping. When he began to speak, the contrast of voice
11380: was still stronger than that of appearance. The man in the flannel shirt
11381: had not been heard--had probably not cared to be heard--beyond the
11382: immediate group of listeners. But Felix at once drew the attention of
11383: persons comparatively at a distance.
11384: 
11385: "In my opinion," he said, almost the moment after he was addressed,
11386: "that was a true word spoken by your friend when he said the great
11387: question was how to give every man a man's share in life. But I think he
11388: expects voting to do more toward it than I do. I want the workingmen to
11389: have power. I'm a workingman myself, and I don't want to be anything
11390: else. But there are two sorts of power. There's a power to do
11391: mischief--to undo what has been done with great expense and labor, to
11392: waste and destroy, to be cruel to the weak, to lie and quarrel, and to
11393: talk poisonous nonsense. That's the sort of power that ignorant numbers
11394: have. It never made a joint stool or planted a potato. Do you think it's
11395: likely to do much toward governing a great country, and making wise
11396: laws, and giving shelter, food, and clothes to millions of men? Ignorant
11397: power comes in the end to the same thing as wicked power; it makes
11398: misery. It's another sort of power that I want us workingmen to have,
11399: and I can see plainly enough that our all having votes will do little
11400: toward it at present. I hope we, or the children that come after us,
11401: will get plenty of political power some time. I tell everybody plainly,
11402: I hope there will be great changes, and that some time, whether we live
11403: to see it or not, men will have come to be ashamed of things they're
11404: proud of now. But I should like to convince you that votes would never
11405: give you political power worth having while things are as they are now,
11406: and that if you go the right way to work you may get power sooner
11407: without votes. Perhaps all you who hear me are sober men, who try to
11408: learn as much of the nature of things as you can, and to be as little
11409: like fools as possible. A fool or idiot is one who expects things to
11410: happen that never can happen; he pours milk into a can without a bottom,
11411: and expects the milk to stay there. The more of such vain expectations a
11412: man has, the more he is a fool or idiot. And if any working man expects
11413: a vote to do for him what it never can do, he's foolish to that amount,
11414: if no more. I think that's clear enough, eh?"
11415: 
11416: "Hear, hear," said several voices, but they were not those of the
11417: original group; they belonged to some strollers who had been attracted
11418: by Felix Holt's vibrating voice, and were Tories from the Crown. Among
11419: them was Christian, who was smoking a cigar with a pleasure he always
11420: felt in being among people who did not know him, and doubtless took him
11421: to be something higher than he really was. Hearers from the Fox and
11422: Hounds also were slowly adding themselves to the nucleus. Felix,
11423: accessible to the pleasure of being listened to, went on with more and
11424: more animation: "The way to get rid of folly is to get rid of vain
11425: expectations, and of thoughts that don't agree with the nature of
11426: things. The men who have had true thoughts about water, and what it will
11427: do when it is turned into steam and under all sorts of circumstances,
11428: have made themselves a great power in the world: they are turning the
11429: wheels of engines that will help to change most things. But no engines
11430: would have done, if there had been false notions about the way water
11431: would act. Now, all the schemes about voting, and districts, and annual
11432: Parliaments, and the rest, are engines, and the water or steam--the
11433: force that is to work them--must come out of human nature--out of men's
11434: passions, feelings, desires. Whether the engines will do good work or
11435: bad depends on these feelings; and if we have false expectations about
11436: men's characters, we are very much like the idiot who thinks he'll carry
11437: milk in a can without a bottom. In my opinion, the notions about what
11438: mere voting will do are very much of that sort."
11439: 
11440: "That's very fine," said a man in dirty fustian, with a scornful laugh.
11441: "But how are we to get the power without votes?"
11442: 
11443: "I'll tell you what's the greatest power under heaven," said Felix, "and
11444: that is public opinion--the ruling belief in society about what is right
11445: and what is wrong, what is honorable and what is shameful. That's the
11446: steam that is to work the engines. How can political freedom make us
11447: better, any more than a religion we don't believe in, if people laugh
11448: and wink when they see men abuse and defile it? And while public opinion
11449: is what it is--while men have no better beliefs about public duty--while
11450: corruption is not felt to be a damning disgrace--while men are not
11451: ashamed in Parliament and out of it to make public questions which
11452: concern the welfare of millions a mere screen for their own petty
11453: private ends,--I say, no fresh scheme of voting will much mend our
11454: condition. For, take us workingmen of all sorts. Suppose out of every
11455: hundred who had a vote there were thirty who had some soberness, some
11456: sense to choose with, some good feeling to make them wish the right
11457: thing for all. And suppose there were seventy out of the hundred who
11458: were, half of them, not sober, who had no sense to choose one thing in
11459: politics more than another, and who had so little good feeling in them
11460: that they wasted on their own drinking the money that should have helped
11461: to feed and clothe their wives and children; and another half of them
11462: who, if they didn't drink, were too ignorant or stupid to see any good
11463: for themselves better than pocketing a five-shilling piece when it was
11464: offered them. Where would be the political power of the thirty sober
11465: men? The power would lie with the seventy drunken and stupid votes; and
11466: I'll tell you what sort of men would get the power--what sort of men
11467: would end by returning whom they pleased to Parliament."
11468: 
11469: Felix had seen every face around him, and had particularly noticed a
11470: recent addition to his audience; but now he looked about him, without
11471: appearing to fix his glance on any one. In spite of his cooling
11472: meditations an hour ago, his pulse was getting quickened by indignation,
11473: and the desire to crush what he hated was likely to vent itself in
11474: articulation. His tone became more biting.
11475: 
11476: "They would be men who would undertake to do the business for a
11477: candidate, and return him: men who have no real opinions, but who pilfer
11478: the words of every opinion, and turn them into a cant which will serve
11479: their purpose at the moment; men who look out for dirty work to make
11480: their fortunes by, because dirty work wants little talent and no
11481: conscience; men who know all the ins and outs of bribery, because there
11482: is not a cranny in their own souls where a bribe can't enter. Such men
11483: as these will be the masters wherever there's a majority of voters who
11484: care more for money, for drink, more for some mean little end which is
11485: their own and nobody else's, than for anything that has ever been called
11486: Right in the world. For suppose there's a poor voter named Jack, who has
11487: seven children, and twelve or fifteen shillings a-week wages, perhaps
11488: less. Jack can't read--I don't say whose fault that is--he never had the
11489: chance to learn; he knows so little that he perhaps thinks God made the
11490: poor-laws, and if anybody said the pattern of the work-house was laid
11491: down in the Testament, he wouldn't be able to contradict them. What is
11492: poor Jack likely to do when he sees a smart stranger coming to him, who
11493: happens to be just one of these men that I say will be the masters till
11494: public opinion gets too hot for them? He's a middle-sized man, we'll
11495: say; stout, with coat upon coat of fine broadcloth, open enough to show
11496: a fine gold chain: none of your dark, scowling men, but one with an
11497: innocent pink-and-white skin and very smooth light hair--a most
11498: respectable man, who calls himself a good, sound, well-known English
11499: name--as Green, or Baker, or Wilson, or let us say, Johnson----"
11500: 
11501: Felix was interrupted by an explosion of laughter from a majority of the
11502: bystanders. Some eyes had been turned on Johnson, who stood on the right
11503: hand of Felix, at the very beginning of the description, and these were
11504: gradually followed by others, till at last every hearer's attention was
11505: fixed on him, and the first burst of laughter from the two or three who
11506: knew the attorney's name, let every one sufficiently into the secret to
11507: make the amusement common. Johnson, who had kept his ground till his
11508: name was mentioned, now turned away, looking unusually white after being
11509: unusually red, and feeling by an attorney's instinct for his
11510: pocket-book, as if he felt it was a case for taking down the names of
11511: witnesses.
11512: 
11513: All the well-dressed hearers turned away too, thinking they had had the
11514: cream of the speech in the joke against Johnson, which, as a thing worth
11515: telling, helped to recall them to the scene of dinner.
11516: 
11517: "Who is this Johnson?" said Christian to a young man who had been
11518: standing near him, and had been one of the first to laugh. Christian's
11519: curiosity had naturally been awakened by what might prove a golden
11520: opportunity.
11521: 
11522: "Oh--a London attorney. He acts for Transome. That tremendous fellow at
11523: the corner there is some red-hot Radical demagogue, and Johnson has
11524: offended him, I suppose; else he wouldn't have turned in that way on a
11525: man of their own party."
11526: 
11527: "I had heard there was a Johnson who was an understrapper of Jermyn's,"
11528: said Christian.
11529: 
11530: "Well, so this man may have been for what I know. But he's a London man
11531: now--a very busy fellow--on his own legs in Bedford Row. Ha, ha! it's
11532: capital, though, when these Liberals get a slap in the face from the
11533: workingmen they're so very fond of."
11534: 
11535: Another turn along the street enabled Christian to come to a resolution.
11536: Having seen Jermyn drive away an hour before, he was in no fear: he
11537: walked at once to the Fox and Hounds and asked to speak to Mr. Johnson.
11538: A brief interview, in which Christian ascertained that he had before him
11539: the Johnson mentioned by the bill-sticker, issued in the appointment of
11540: a longer one at a later hour; and before they left Duffield they had
11541: come not exactly to a mutual understanding, but to an exchange of
11542: information mutually welcome.
11543: 
11544: Christian had been very cautious in the commencement, only intimating
11545: that he knew something important which some chance hints had induced him
11546: to think might be interesting to Mr. Johnson, but that this entirely
11547: depended on how far he had a common interest with Mr. Jermyn. Johnson
11548: replied that he had much business in which that gentleman was not
11549: concerned, but that to a certain extent they had a common interest.
11550: Probably then, Christian observed, the affairs of the Transome estate
11551: were part of the business in which Mr. Jermyn and Mr. Johnson might be
11552: understood to represent each other, in which case he need not detain Mr.
11553: Johnson? At this hint Johnson could not conceal that he was becoming
11554: eager. He had no idea what Christian's information was, but there were
11555: many grounds on which Johnson desired to know as much as he could about
11556: the Transome affairs independently of Jermyn. By little and little an
11557: understanding was arrived at. Christian told of his interview with Tommy
11558: Trounsem, and stated that if Johnson could show him whether the
11559: knowledge could have any legal value, he could bring evidence that a
11560: legitimate child of Bycliffe's existed: he felt certain of his fact, and
11561: of his proof. Johnson explained, that in this case the death of the old
11562: bill-sticker would give the child the first valid claim to the Bycliffe
11563: heirship; that for his own part he should be glad to further a true
11564: claim, but that caution would have to be observed. How did Christian
11565: know that Jermyn, was informed on this subject? Christian, more and more
11566: convinced that Johnson would be glad to counteract Jermyn at length
11567: became explicit about Esther, but still withheld his own real name, and
11568: the nature of his relations with Bycliffe. He said he would bring the
11569: rest of his information when Mr. Johnson took the case up seriously, and
11570: place it in the hands of Bycliffe's old lawyers--of course he would do
11571: that? Johnson replied that he would certainly do that; but that there
11572: were legal niceties which Mr. Christian was probably not acquainted
11573: with; that Esther's claim had not yet accrued, and that hurry was
11574: useless.
11575: 
11576: The two men parted, each in distrust of the other, but each well pleased
11577: to have learned something. Johnson was not at all sure how he should
11578: act, but thought it likely that events would soon guide him. Christian
11579: was beginning to meditate a way of securing his own ends without
11580: depending in the least on Johnson's procedure. It was enough for him
11581: that he was now assured of Esther's legal claim on the Transome estates.

11586: CHAPTER XXXI.
11587: 
11588:     "In the copia of the factious language the word Tory was
11589:     entertained, and being a vocal clever-sounding word, readily
11590:     pronounced, it kept its hold, and took possession of the foul
11591:     mouths of the faction.----The Loyalists began to cheer up and to
11592:     take heart of grace, and in the working of this crisis, according
11593:     to the common law of scolding, they considered which way to make
11594:     payment for so much of Tory as they had been treated with to clear
11595:     scores.----Immediately the train took, and ran like wildfire and
11596:     became general. And so the account of Tory was balanced, and soon
11597:     began to run up a sharp score on the other side."--NORTH'S
11598:     _Examen_, p. 321.
11599: 
11600: 
11601: At last the great epoch of the election for North Loamshire had arrived.
11602: The roads approaching Treby were early traversed by a larger number of
11603: vehicles, horsemen, and also foot-passengers than were ever seen at the
11604: annual fair. Treby was the polling-place for many voters whose faces
11605: were quite strange in the town; and if there were some strangers who did
11606: not come to poll, though they had business not unconnected with the
11607: election, they were not liable to be regarded with suspicion or especial
11608: curiosity. It was understood that no division of a county had ever been
11609: more thoroughly canvassed, and that there would be a hard run between
11610: Garstin and Transome. Mr. Johnson's headquarters were at Duffield; but
11611: it was a maxim which he repeated after the great Putty, that a capable
11612: agent makes himself omnipresent; and quite apart from the express
11613: between him and Jermyn, Mr. John Johnson's presence in the universe had
11614: potent effects on this December day at Treby Magna.
11615: 
11616: A slight drizzling rain which was observed by some Tories who looked out
11617: of their bedroom windows before six o'clock, made them hope that, after
11618: all, the day might pass off better than alarmists had expected. The rain
11619: was felt to be somehow on the side of quiet and Conservatism; but soon
11620: the breaking of the clouds and the mild gleams of a December sun brought
11621: back previous apprehensions. As there were already precedents for riot
11622: at a Reformed election, and as the Trebian district had had its
11623: confidence in the natural course of things somewhat shaken by a landed
11624: proprietor with an old name offering himself as a Radical candidate, the
11625: election had been looked forward to by many with a vague sense that it
11626: would be an occasion something like a fighting match, when bad
11627: characters would probably assemble, and there might be struggles and
11628: alarms for respectable men, which would make it expedient for them to
11629: take a little neat brandy as a precaution beforehand and a restorative
11630: afterward. The tenants on the Transome estate were comparatively
11631: fearless: poor Mr. Goffe, of Rabbit's End, considered that "one thing
11632: was as mauling as the other," and that an election was no worse than the
11633: sheep-rot; while Mr. Dibbs, taking the more cheerful view of a
11634: prosperous man, reflected that if the Radicals were dangerous, it was
11635: safer to be on their side. It was the voters for Debarry and Garstin who
11636: considered that they alone had the right to regard themselves as targets
11637: for evil-minded men; and Mr. Crowder, if he could have got his ideas
11638: countenanced, would have recommended a muster of farm-servants with
11639: defensive pitchforks on the side of Church and king. But the bolder men
11640: were rather gratified by the prospect of being groaned at, so that they
11641: might face about and groan in return.
11642: 
11643: Mr. Crow, the high constable of Treby, inwardly rehearsed a brief
11644: address to a riotous crowd in case it should be wanted, having been
11645: warned by the rector that it was a primary duty on these occasions to
11646: keep a watch against provocation as well as violence. The rector, with a
11647: brother magistrate who was on the spot, had thought it desirable to
11648: swear in some special constables, but the presence of loyal men not
11649: absolutely required for the polling was not looked at in the light of a
11650: provocation. The Benefit Clubs from various quarters made a show, some
11651: with the orange-colored ribbons and streamers of the true Tory
11652: candidate, some with the mazarine of the Whig. The orange-colored bands
11653: played "Auld Lang Syne," and a louder mazarine band came across them
11654: with "Oh, whistle and I will come to thee, my lad"--probably as the tune
11655: the most symbolical of Liberalism which their repertory would furnish.
11656: There was not a single club bearing the Radical blue: the Sproxton Club
11657: members wore the mazarine, and Mr. Chubb wore so much of it that he
11658: looked (at a sufficient distance) like a very large gentianella. It was
11659: generally understood that "these brave fellows," representing the fine
11660: institution of Benefit Clubs, holding aloft the motto, "Let brotherly
11661: love continue," were a civil force calculated to encourage voters of
11662: sound opinions and keep up their spirits. But a considerable number of
11663: unadorned heavy navvies, colliers, and stone-pit men, who used their
11664: freedom as British subjects to be present in Treby on this great
11665: occasion, looked like a possible uncivil force whose politics were
11666: dubious until it was clearly seen for whom they cheered and for whom
11667: they groaned.
11668: 
11669: Thus the way up to the polling-booths was variously lined, and those who
11670: walked it, to whatever side they belonged, had the advantage of hearing
11671: from the opposite side what were the most marked defects or excesses in
11672: their personal appearance; for the Trebians of that day held, without
11673: being aware that they had Cicero's authority for it, that the bodily
11674: blemishes of an opponent were a legitimate ground for ridicule; but if
11675: the voter frustrated wit by being handsome, he was groaned at and
11676: satirized according to a formula, in which the adjective was Tory, Whig,
11677: or Radical, as the case might be, and the substantive a blank to be
11678: filled up after the taste of the speaker.
11679: 
11680: Some of the more timid had chosen to go through this ordeal as early as
11681: possible in the morning. One of the earliest was Mr. Timothy Rose, the
11682: gentleman-farmer from Leek Malton. He had left home with some
11683: foreboding, having swathed his more vital parts in layers of flannel,
11684: and put on two greatcoats as a soft kind of armor. But reflecting with
11685: some trepidation that there were no resources for protecting his head,
11686: he once more wavered in his intention to vote; he once more observed to
11687: Mrs. Rose that these were hard times when a man of independent property
11688: was expected to vote "willy-nilly;" but finally coerced by the sense
11689: that he should be looked ill on "in these times" if he did not stand by
11690: the gentlemen round about, he set out in his gig, taking with him a
11691: powerful wagoner, whom he ordered to keep him in sight as he went to
11692: the polling-booth. It was hardly more than nine o'clock when Mr. Rose,
11693: having thus come up to the level of his times, cheered himself with a
11694: little cherry-brandy at the Marquis, drove away in a much more
11695: courageous spirit, and got down at Mr. Nolan's, just outside the town.
11696: The retired Londoner, he considered, was a man of experience, who would
11697: estimate properly the judicious course he had taken, and could make it
11698: known to others. Mr. Nolan was superintending the removal of some shrubs
11699: in his garden.
11700: 
11701: "Well, Mr. Nolan," said Rose, twinkling a self-complacent look over the
11702: red prominence of his cheeks, "have you been to give your vote yet?"
11703: 
11704: "No; all in good time. I shall go presently."
11705: 
11706: "Well, I wouldn't lose an hour, I wouldn't. I said to myself, if I've
11707: got to do gentlemen a favor, I'll do it at once. You see, I've got no
11708: landlord, Nolan--I'm in that position o' life that I can be
11709: independent."
11710: 
11711: "Just so, my dear sir," said the wiry-faced Nolan, pinching his
11712: under-lip between his thumb and finger, and giving one of those
11713: wonderful universal shrugs, by which he seemed to be recalling all his
11714: garments from a tendency to disperse themselves. "Come in and see Mrs.
11715: Nolan?"
11716: 
11717: "No, no, thankye. Mrs. Rose expects me back. But, as I was saying, I'm a
11718: independent man, and I consider it's not my part to show favor to one
11719: more than another, but to make things as even as I can. If I'd been a
11720: tenant to anybody, well, in course I must have voted for my
11721: landlord--that stands to sense. But I wish everybody well; and if one's
11722: returned to Parliament more than another, nobody can say it's my doing;
11723: for when you can vote for two, you can make things even. So I gave one
11724: to Debarry and one to Transome; and I wish Garstin no ill, but I can't
11725: help the odd number, and he hangs on to Debarry, they say."
11726: 
11727: "God bless me, sir," said Mr. Nolan, coughing down a laugh, "don't you
11728: perceive that you might as well have stayed at home and not voted at
11729: all, unless you would rather send a Radical to Parliament than a sober
11730: Whig?"
11731: 
11732: "Well, I'm sorry you should have anything to say against what I've done,
11733: Nolan," said Mr. Rose, rather crestfallen, though sustained by inward
11734: warmth. "I thought you'd agree with me, as you're a sensible man. But
11735: the most a independent man can do is to try and please all; and if he
11736: hasn't the luck--here's wishing I may do it another time," added Mr.
11737: Rose, apparently confounding a toast with a salutation, for he put out
11738: his hand for a passing shake, and then stepped into his gig again.
11739: 
11740: At the time that Mr. Timothy Rose left the town, the crowd in King
11741: Street and in the market-place, where the polling-booths stood, was
11742: fluctuating. Voters as yet were scanty, and brave fellows who had come
11743: from any distance this morning, or who had sat up late drinking the
11744: night before, required some reinforcement of their strength and spirits.
11745: Every public house in Treby, not excepting the venerable and sombre
11746: Cross-Keys, was lively with changing and numerous company. Not, of
11747: course, that there was any treating: treating necessarily had stopped,
11748: from moral scruples, when once "the writs were out;" but there was
11749: drinking, which did equally well under any name.
11750: 
11751: Poor Tommy Trounsem, breakfasting here on Falstaff's proportion of
11752: bread, and something which, for gentility's sake, I will call sack, was
11753: more than usually victorious over the ills of life, and felt himself one
11754: of the heroes of the day. He had an immense light-blue cockade in his
11755: hat, and an amount of silver in a dirty little canvas bag which
11756: astonished himself. For some reason, at first inscrutable to him, he had
11757: been paid for his bill-sticking with great liberality at Mr. Jermyn's
11758: office, in spite of his having been the victim of a trick by which he
11759: had once lost his own bills and pasted up Debarry's; but he soon saw
11760: that this was simply a recognition of his merit as "an old family kept
11761: out of its rights," and also of his peculiar share in an occasion when
11762: the family was to get into Parliament. Under these circumstances, it was
11763: due from him that he should show himself prominently where business was
11764: going forward, and give additional value by his presence to every vote
11765: for Transome. With this view he got a half-pint bottle filled with his
11766: peculiar kind of "sack," and hastened back to the market-place, feeling
11767: good-natured and patronizing toward all political parties, and only so
11768: far partial as his family bound him to be.
11769: 
11770: But a disposition to concentrate at that extremity of King Street which
11771: issued in the market-place, was not universal among the increasing
11772: crowd. Some of them seemed attracted toward another nucleus at the other
11773: extremity of King Street, near the Seven Stars. This was Garstin's chief
11774: house, where his committee sat, and it was also a point which must
11775: necessarily be passed by many voters entering the town on the eastern
11776: side. It seemed natural that the mazarine colors should be visible
11777: here, and that Pack, the tall "shepherd" of the Sproxton men, should be
11778: seen moving to and fro where there would be a frequent opportunity of
11779: cheering the voters for a gentleman who had the chief share in the
11780: Sproxton mines. But the side lanes and entries out of King Street were
11781: numerous enough to relieve any pressure if there was need to make way.
11782: The lanes had a distinguished reputation. Two of them had odors of
11783: brewing; one had a side entrance to Mr. Tiliot's wine and spirit vaults;
11784: up another Mr. Muscat's cheeses were frequently being unloaded; and even
11785: some of the entries had those cheerful suggestions of plentiful
11786: provision which were among the characteristics of Treby.
11787: 
11788: Between ten and eleven the voters came in more rapid succession, and the
11789: whole scene became spirited. Cheers, sarcasms, and oaths, which seemed
11790: to have a flavor of wit for many hearers, were beginning to be
11791: reinforced by more practical demonstrations, dubiously jocose. There was
11792: a disposition in the crowd to close and hem in the way for voters,
11793: either going or coming, until they had paid some kind of toll. It was
11794: difficult to see who set the example in the transition from words to
11795: deeds. Some thought it was due to Jacob Cuff, a Tory charity-man, who
11796: was a well-known ornament of the pothouse, and gave his mind much
11797: leisure for amusing devices; but questions of origination in stirring
11798: periods are notoriously hard to settle. It is by no means necessary in
11799: human things that there should be only one beginner. This, however, is
11800: certain--that Mr. Chubb, who wished it to be noticed that he voted for
11801: Garstin solely, was one of the first to get rather more notice than he
11802: wished, and that he had his hat knocked off and crushed in the interest
11803: of Debarry by Tories opposed to coalition. On the other hand, some said
11804: it was at the same time that Mr. Pink, the saddler, being stopped on his
11805: way and made to declare that he was going to vote for Debarry, got
11806: himself well chalked as to his coat, and pushed up an entry, where he
11807: remained the prisoner of terror combined with the want of any back
11808: outlet, and never gave his vote that day.
11809: 
11810: The second Tory joke was performed with much gusto. The majority of the
11811: Transome tenants came in a body from the Ram Inn, with Mr. Banks, the
11812: bailiff, leading them. Poor Goffe was the last of them, and his worn
11813: melancholy look and forward-leaning gait gave the jocose Cuff the notion
11814: that the farmer was not what he called "compus." Mr. Goffe was cut off
11815: from his companions and hemmed in: asked, by voices with hot breath
11816: close to his ear, how many horses he had, how many cows, how many fat
11817: pigs; then jostled from one to another, who made trumpets with their
11818: hands, and deafened him by telling him to vote for Debarry. In this way
11819: the melancholy Goffe was hustled on till he was at the polling-booth,
11820: filled with confused alarms, the immediate alarm being that of having to
11821: go back in still worse fashion than he had come. Arriving in this way
11822: after the other tenants had left, he astonished all hearers who knew him
11823: for a tenant of the Transomes by saying "Debarry," and was jostled back
11824: trembling amid shouts of laughter.
11825: 
11826: By stages of this kind the fun grew faster, and was in danger of getting
11827: rather serious. The Tories began to feel that their jokes were returned
11828: by others of a heavier sort, and that the main strength of the crowd was
11829: not on the side of sound opinion, but might come to be on the side of
11830: sound cudgelling and kicking. The navvies and pitmen in dishabille
11831: seemed to be multiplying, and to be clearly not belonging to the party
11832: of Order. The shops were freely resorted to for various forms of playful
11833: missiles and weapons; and news came to the magistrates, watching from
11834: the large window of the Marquis, that a gentleman coming in on horseback
11835: at the other end of the street to vote for Garstin had had his horse
11836: turned round and frightened into a headlong gallop out of it again.
11837: 
11838: Mr. Crow and his subordinates, and all the special constables, felt that
11839: it was necessary to make some energetic effort, or else every voter
11840: would be intimidated and the poll must be adjourned. The rector
11841: determined to get on horseback and go amidst the crowd with the
11842: constables; and he sent a message to Mr. Lingon, who was at the Ram,
11843: calling on him to do the same. "Sporting Jack" was sure the good fellows
11844: meant no harm, but he was courageous enough to face any bodily dangers,
11845: and rode out in his brown leggings and colored bandana, speaking
11846: persuasively.
11847: 
11848: It was nearly twelve o'clock when this sally was made: the constables
11849: and magistrates tried the most pacific measures, and they seemed to
11850: succeed. There was a rapid thinning of the crowd: the most boisterous
11851: disappeared, or seemed to do so by becoming quiet; missiles ceased to
11852: fly, and a sufficient way was cleared for voters along King Street. The
11853: magistrates returned to their quarters, and the constables took
11854: convenient posts of observation. Mr. Wace, who was one of Debarry's
11855: committee, had suggested to the rector that it might be wise to send
11856: for the military from Duffield, with orders that they should station
11857: themselves at Hathercote, three miles off: there was so much property in
11858: the town that it would be better to make it secure against risks. But
11859: the rector felt that this was not the part of a moderate and wise
11860: magistrate, unless the signs of riot recurred. He was a brave man, and
11861: fond of thinking that his own authority sufficed for the maintenance of
11862: the general good in Treby.

11867: CHAPTER XXXII.
11868: 
11869:     Go from me. Yet I feel that I shall stand
11870:     Henceforward in thy shadow. Nevermore
11871:     Alone upon the threshold of my door
11872:     Of individual life, I shall command
11873:     The uses of my soul, nor lift my hand
11874:     Serenely in the sunshine as before
11875:     Without the sense of that which I forbore--
11876:     Thy touch upon the palm. The widest land
11877:     Doom takes to part us, leaves thy heart in mine
11878:     With pulses that beat double. What I do
11879:     And what I dream include thee, as the wine
11880:     Must taste of its own grapes. And when I sue
11881:     God for myself, He hears that name of thine,
11882:     And sees within my eyes the tears of two.
11883: 
11884:                                             --MRS. BROWNING.
11885: 
11886: 
11887: Felix Holt, seated at his work without his pupils, who had asked for a
11888: holiday with a notion that the wooden booths promised some sort of show,
11889: noticed about eleven o'clock that the noises which reached him from the
11890: main street were getting more and more tumultuous. He had long seen bad
11891: auguries for this election, but, like all people who dread the prophetic
11892: wisdom that ends in desiring the fulfillment of its own evil
11893: forebodings, he had checked himself with remembering that, though many
11894: conditions were possible which might bring on violence, there were just
11895: as many which might avert it. There would, perhaps, be no other mischief
11896: than what he was already certain of. With these thoughts he sat down
11897: quietly to his work, meaning not to vex his soul by going to look on at
11898: things he would fain have made different if he could. But he was of a
11899: fiber that vibrated too strongly to the life around him to shut himself
11900: away in quiet, even from suffering and irremediable wrong. As the noises
11901: grew louder, and wrought more and more strongly on his imagination, he
11902: was obliged to lay down his delicate wheel-work. His mother came from
11903: her turnip-paring, in the kitchen, where little Job was her companion,
11904: to observe that they must be killing everybody in the High Street, and
11905: that the election, which had never been before at Treby, must have come
11906: for a judgment; that there were mercies where you didn't look for them,
11907: and that she thanked God in His wisdom for making her live up a back
11908: street.
11909: 
11910: Felix snatched his cap and rushed out. But when he got to the turning
11911: into the market-place the magistrates were already on horseback there,
11912: the constables were moving about, and Felix observed that there was no
11913: strong spirit of resistance to them. He stayed long enough to see the
11914: partial dispersion of the crowd and the restoration of tolerable quiet,
11915: and then went back to Mrs. Holt to tell her that there was nothing to
11916: fear now; he was going out again, and she must not be in any anxiety at
11917: his absence. She might set by his dinner for him.
11918: 
11919: Felix had been thinking of Esther and her probable alarm at the noises
11920: that must have reached her more distinctly than they had reached him,
11921: for Malthouse Yard was removed but a little way from the main street.
11922: Mr. Lyon was away from home, having been called to preach charity
11923: sermons and attend meetings in a distant town; and Esther, with the
11924: plaintive Lyddy for her sole companion, was not cheerfully
11925: circumstanced. Felix had not been to see her yet since her father's
11926: departure, but to-day he gave way to new reasons.
11927: 
11928: "Miss Esther was in the garret," Lyddy said, trying to see what was
11929: going on. But before she was fetched she came running down the stairs,
11930: drawn by the knock at the door, which had shaken the small dwelling.
11931: 
11932: "I am so thankful to see you," she said, eagerly. "Pray come in."
11933: 
11934: When she had shut the parlor door behind them, Felix said, "I suspected
11935: that you might have been made anxious by the noises. I came to tell you
11936: that things are quiet now. Though, indeed, you can hear that they are."
11937: 
11938: "I _was_ frightened," said Esther. "The shouting and roaring of rude men
11939: is so hideous. It is a relief to me that my father is not at home--that
11940: he is out of the reach of any danger he might have fallen into if he had
11941: been here. But I gave you credit for being in the midst of the danger,"
11942: she added, smiling, with a determination not to show much feeling. "Sit
11943: down and tell me what has happened."
11944: 
11945: They sat down at the extremities of the old black sofa, and Felix said--
11946: 
11947: "To tell you the truth, I had shut myself up, and tried to be as
11948: indifferent to the election as if I'd been one of the fishes in the
11949: Lapp, till the noises got too strong for me. But I only saw the tail end
11950: of the disturbance. The poor noisy simpletons seemed to give way before
11951: the magistrates and the constables. I hope nobody has been much hurt.
11952: The fear is that they may turn out again by-and-by; their giving way so
11953: soon may not be altogether a good sign. There's a great number of heavy
11954: fellows in the town. If they go and drink more, the last end may be
11955: worse than the first. However----"
11956: 
11957: Felix broke off, as if this talk was futile, clasped his hands behind
11958: his head, and, leaning backward, looked at Esther, who was looking at
11959: him.
11960: 
11961: "May I stay here a little while?" he said, after a moment, which seemed
11962: long.
11963: 
11964: "Pray do," said Esther, coloring. To relieve herself she took some work
11965: and bowed her head over her stitching. It was in reality a little heaven
11966: to her that Felix was there, but she saw beyond it--saw that by-and-by
11967: he would be gone, and that they should be farther on their way, not
11968: toward meeting, but parting. His will was impregnable. He was a rock,
11969: and she was no more to him than the white clinging mist-cloud.
11970: 
11971: "I wish I could be sure that you see things just as I do," he said
11972: abruptly, after a minute's silence.
11973: 
11974: "I am sure you see them much more wisely than I do!" said Esther, almost
11975: bitterly, without looking up.
11976: 
11977: "There are some people one must wish to judge truly. Not to wish it
11978: would be mere hardness. I know you think I am a man without feeling--at
11979: least, without strong affections. You think I love nothing but my own
11980: resolutions."
11981: 
11982: "Suppose I reply in the same sort of strain?" said Esther, with a little
11983: toss of the head.
11984: 
11985: "How?"
11986: 
11987: "Why, that you think me a shallow woman, incapable of believing what is
11988: best in you, setting down everything that is too high for me as a
11989: deficiency."
11990: 
11991: "Don't parry what I say. Answer me." There was an expression of painful
11992: beseeching in the tone with which Felix said this. Esther let her work
11993: fall on her lap and looked at him, but she was unable to speak.
11994: 
11995: "I want you to tell me--once--that you know it would be easier to me to
11996: give myself up to loving and being loved, as other men do, when they
11997: can, than to----"
11998: 
11999: This breaking-off in speech was something quite new in Felix. For the
12000: first time he had lost his self-possession, and turned his eyes away. He
12001: was at variance with himself. He had begun what he felt he ought not to
12002: finish.
12003: 
12004: Esther, like a woman as she was--a woman waiting for love, never able
12005: to ask for it--had her joy in these signs of her power; but they made
12006: her generous, not chary, as they might have done if she had had a
12007: pettier disposition. She said, with deep yet timid earnestness--
12008: 
12009: "What you have chosen to do has only convinced me that your love would
12010: be the better worth having."
12011: 
12012: All the finest part of Esther's nature trembled in those words. To be
12013: right in great memorable moments is perhaps the thing we need most
12014: desire for ourselves.
12015: 
12016: Felix as quick as lightning turned his look upon her again, and, leaning
12017: forward, took her sweet hand and held it to his lips some moments before
12018: he let it fall again and raised his head.
12019: 
12020: "We shall always be the better for thinking of each other," he said,
12021: leaning his elbow on the back of the sofa, and supporting his head as he
12022: looked at her with calm sadness. "This thing can never come to me twice
12023: over. It is my knighthood. That was always a business of great cost."
12024: 
12025: He smiled at her, but she sat biting her inner lip and pressing her
12026: hands together. She desired to be worthy of what she reverenced in
12027: Felix, but the inevitable renunciation was too difficult. She saw
12028: herself wandering through the future weak and forsaken. The charming
12029: sauciness was all gone from her face, but the memory of it made this
12030: childlike dependent sorrow all the more touching.
12031: 
12032: "Tell me what you would----" Felix burst out, leaning nearer to her; but
12033: the next instant he started up, went to the table, took his cap in his
12034: hand and came in front of her.
12035: 
12036: "Good-bye," he said, very gently, not daring to put out his hand. But
12037: Esther put up hers instead of speaking. He just pressed it and then went
12038: away.
12039: 
12040: She heard the doors close behind him, and felt free to be miserable. She
12041: cried bitterly. If she might have married Felix Holt, she could have
12042: been a good woman. She felt no trust that she could ever be good without
12043: him.
12044: 
12045: Felix reproached himself. He would have done better not to speak in that
12046: way. But the prompting to which he had chiefly listened had been the
12047: desire to prove to Esther that he set a high value on her feelings. He
12048: could not help seeing that he was very important to her; and he was too
12049: simple and sincere a man to ape a sort of humility which would not have
12050: made him any the better if he had possessed it. Such pretences turn our
12051: lives into sorry dramas. And Felix wished Esther to know that her love
12052: was dear to him as the beloved dead are dear. He felt that they must
12053: not marry--that they would ruin each other's lives. But he had longed
12054: for her to know fully that his will to be always apart from her was
12055: renunciation, not an easy preference. In this he was thoroughly
12056: generous; and yet, now some subtle, mysterious conjuncture of
12057: impressions and circumstances had made him speak, he questioned the
12058: wisdom of what he had done. Express confessions give definiteness to
12059: memories that might more easily melt away without; and Felix felt for
12060: Esther's pain as the strong soldier, who can march on hungering without
12061: fear that he shall faint, feels for the young brother--the
12062: maiden-cheeked conscript whose load is too heavy for him.
12063: 
12064: 
12065: 
12066: 
12067: CHAPTER XXXIII.
12068: 
12069:     Mischief, thou art afoot.--_Julius Cæsar._
12070: 
12071: 
12072: Felix could not go home again immediately after quitting Esther. He got
12073: out of the town, skirted it a little while, looking across the December
12074: stillness of the fields, and then re-entered it by the main road into
12075: the market-place, thinking that, after all, it would be better for him
12076: to look at the busy doings of men than to listen in solitude to the
12077: voices within him; and he wished to know how things were going on.
12078: 
12079: It was now nearly half-past one, and Felix perceived that the street was
12080: filling with more than the previous crowd. By the time he got in front
12081: of the booths, he was himself so surrounded by men who were being thrust
12082: hither and thither that retreat would have been impossible; and he went
12083: where he was obliged to go, although his height and strength were above
12084: the average even in a crowd where there were so many heavy-armed workmen
12085: used to the pickaxe. Almost all shabby-coated Trebians must have been
12086: there, but the entries and back streets of the town did not supply the
12087: mass of the crowd; and besides the rural incomers, both of the more
12088: decent and the rougher sort, Felix, as he was pushed along, thought he
12089: discerned here and there men of that keener aspect which is only common
12090: in manufacturing towns.
12091: 
12092: But at present there was no evidence of any distinctly mischievous
12093: design. There was only evidence that the majority of the crowd were
12094: excited with drink, and that their action could hardly be calculated on
12095: more than those of the oxen and pigs congregated amidst hootings and
12096: pushings. The confused deafening shouts, the incidental fighting, the
12097: knocking over, pulling and scuffling, seemed to increase every moment.
12098: Such of the constables as were mixed with the crowd were quite helpless;
12099: and if an official staff was seen above the heads, it moved about
12100: fitfully, showing as little sign of a guiding hand as the summit of a
12101: buoy on the waves. Doubtless many hurts and bruises had been received,
12102: but no one could know the amount of injuries that were widely scattered.
12103: 
12104: It was clear that no more voting could be done, and the poll had been
12105: adjourned. The probabilities of serious mischief had grown strong enough
12106: to prevail over the rector's objection to getting military aid within
12107: reach; and when Felix re-entered the town, a galloping messenger had
12108: already been dispatched to Duffield. The rector wished to ride out
12109: again, and read the Riot Act from a point where he could be better heard
12110: than from the window of the Marquis; but Mr. Crow, the high
12111: constable, who had returned from closer observation, insisted that the
12112: risk would be too great. New special constables had been sworn in, but
12113: Mr. Crow said prophetically that if once mischief began, the mob was
12114: past caring for constables.
12115: 
12116: But the rector's voice was ringing and penetrating, and when he appeared
12117: on the narrow balcony and read the formula, commanding all men to go to
12118: their homes or about their lawful business, there was a strong transient
12119: effect. Every one within hearing listened, and for a few moments after
12120: the final words, "God save the King!" the comparative silence continued.
12121: Then the people began to move, the buzz rose again, and grew, and grew,
12122: till it turned to shouts and roaring as before. The movement was that of
12123: a flood hemmed in; it carried nobody away. Whether the crowd would obey
12124: the order to disperse themselves within an hour, was a doubt that
12125: approached nearer to a negative certainty.
12126: 
12127: Presently Mr. Crow, who called himself a tactician, took a
12128: well-intentioned step, which went far to fulfill his own prophecy. He
12129: had arrived with the magistrates by a back way at the Seven Stars, and
12130: here again the Riot Act was read from a window, with much the same
12131: result as before. The rector had returned by the same way to the
12132: Marquis, as the headquarters most suited for administration, but Mr.
12133: Crow remained at the other extremity of King Street, where some
12134: awe-striking presence was certainly needed. Seeing that the time was
12135: passing, and all effect from the voice of law had disappeared, he showed
12136: himself at an upper window, and addressed the crowd, telling them that
12137: the soldiers had been sent for, and that if they did not disperse they
12138: would have cavalry upon them instead of constables.
12139: 
12140: Mr. Crow, like some other high constables more celebrated in history,
12141: "enjoyed a bad reputation"; that is to say, he enjoyed many things which
12142: caused his reputation to be bad, and he was anything but popular in
12143: Treby. It is probable that a pleasant message would have lost something
12144: from his lips, and what he actually said was so unpleasant that, instead
12145: of persuading the crowd, it appeared to enrage them. Some one, snatching
12146: a raw potato from a sack in the green-grocer's shop behind him, threw it
12147: at the constable, and hit him on the mouth. Straightway raw potatoes and
12148: turnips were flying by twenties at the windows of the Seven Stars, and
12149: the panes were smashed. Felix, who was half-way up the street, heard the
12150: voices turning to a savage roar, and saw a rush toward the hardware
12151: shop, which furnished more effective weapons and missiles than turnips
12152: and potatoes. Then a cry ran along that the Tories had sent for the
12153: soldiers, and if those among the mob who called themselves Tories as
12154: willingly as anything else were disposed to take whatever called itself
12155: the Tory side, they only helped the main result of reckless disorder.
12156: 
12157: But there were proofs that the predominant will of the crowd was against
12158: "Debarry's men," and in favor of Transome. Several shops were invaded,
12159: and they were all of them "Tory shops." The tradesmen who could do so
12160: now locked their doors and barricaded their windows within. There was a
12161: panic among the householders of this hitherto peaceful town, and a
12162: general anxiety for the military to arrive. The rector was in painful
12163: anxiety on this head; he had sent out two messengers as secretly as he
12164: could toward Hathercote, to order the soldiers to ride straight to the
12165: town; but he feared that these messengers had been somehow intercepted.
12166: 
12167: It was three o'clock; more than an hour had elapsed since the reading of
12168: the Riot Act. The rector of Treby Magna wrote an indignant message and
12169: sent it to the Ram, to Mr. Lingon, the rector of Little Treby, saying
12170: that there was evidently a Radical animus in the mob, and that Mr.
12171: Transome's party should hold themselves peculiarly responsible. Where
12172: was Mr. Jermyn?
12173: 
12174: Mr. Lingon replied that he was going himself out toward Duffield to see
12175: after the soldiers. As for Jermyn, he was not that attorney's sponsor;
12176: he believed that Jermyn was gone away somewhere on business--to fetch
12177: voters.
12178: 
12179: A serious effort was now being made by all the civil force at command.
12180: The December day would soon be passing into evening, and all disorder
12181: would be aggravated by obscurity. The horrors of fire were as likely to
12182: happen as any minor evil. The constables, as many of them as could do
12183: so, armed themselves with carbines and sabres; all the respectable
12184: inhabitants who had any courage, prepared themselves to struggle for
12185: order; and many felt with Mr. Wace and Mr. Tiliot that the nearest duty
12186: was to defend the breweries and the spirit and wine vaults, where the
12187: property was of a sort at once most likely to be threatened and most
12188: dangerous in its effects. The rector, with fine determination, got on
12189: horseback again, as the best mode of leading the constables, who could
12190: only act efficiently in a close body. By his direction the column of
12191: armed men avoided the main street, and made their way along a back road,
12192: that they might occupy the two chief lanes leading into the wine-vaults
12193: of the brewery, and bear down on the crowd from these openings, which it
12194: was especially desirable to guard.
12195: 
12196: Meanwhile Felix Holt had been hotly occupied in King Street. After the
12197: first window-smashing at the Seven Stars, there was a sufficient reason
12198: for damaging that inn to the utmost. The destructive spirit tends toward
12199: completeness; and any object once maimed or otherwise injured, is as
12200: readily doomed by unreasoning men as by unreasoning boys. Also the Seven
12201: Stars sheltered Spratt; and to some Sproxton men in front of that inn it
12202: was exasperating that Spratt should be safe and sound on a day when
12203: blows were going, and justice might be rendered. And again, there was
12204: the general desirableness of being inside a public house.
12205: 
12206: Felix had at last been willingly urged on to this spot. Hitherto swayed
12207: by the crowd, he had been able to do nothing but defend himself and keep
12208: on his legs; but he foresaw that the people would burst into the inn; he
12209: heard cries of "Spratt!" "Fetch him out!" "We'll pitch him out!" "Pummel
12210: him!" It was not unlikely that lives might be sacrificed; and it was
12211: intolerable to Felix to be witnessing the blind outrages of this mad
12212: crowd, and yet be doing nothing to counteract them. Even some vain
12213: effort would satisfy him better than mere gazing. Within the walls of
12214: the inn he might save some one. He went in with a miscellaneous set, who
12215: dispersed themselves with different objects--some to the tap-room, and
12216: to search for the cellar: some up-stairs to search in all the rooms for
12217: Spratt, or any one else, perhaps, as a temporary scapegoat for Spratt.
12218: Guided by the screams of women, Felix at last got to a high up-stairs
12219: passage, where the landlady and some of her servants were running away
12220: in helpless terror from two or three half-tipsy men, who had been
12221: emptying a spirit decanter in the bar. Assuming the tone of a mob-leader
12222: he cried out, "Here, boys, here's better fun this way--come with me!"
12223: and drew the men back with him along the passage. They reached the lower
12224: staircase in time to see the unhappy Spratt being dragged, coatless and
12225: screaming, down the steps. No one at present was striking or kicking
12226: him; it seemed as if he were being reserved for punishment on some wider
12227: area, where the satisfaction might be more generally shared. Felix
12228: followed close, determined, if he could, to rescue both assailers and
12229: assaulted from the worst consequences. His mind was busy with possible
12230: devices.
12231: 
12232: Down the stairs, out along the stones through the gateway, Spratt was
12233: dragged as a mere heap of linen and cloth rags. When he was got outside
12234: the gateway, there was an immense hooting and roaring, though many there
12235: had no grudge against him, and only guessed that others had the grudge.
12236: But this was the narrower part of the street; it widened as it went
12237: onward, and Spratt was dragged on, his enemies crying, "We'll make a
12238: ring--we'll see how frightened he looks!"
12239: 
12240: "Kick him, and have done with him," Felix heard another say. "Let's go
12241: to Tiliot's vaults--there's more gin there!"
12242: 
12243: Here were two hideous threats. In dragging Spratt onward the people were
12244: getting very near to the lane leading up to Tiliot's. Felix kept as
12245: close as he could to the threatened victim. He had thrown away his own
12246: stick, and carried a bludgeon which had escaped from the hands of an
12247: invader at the Seven Stars; his head was bare; he looked, to
12248: undiscerning eyes, like a leading spirit of the mob. In this condition
12249: he was observed by several persons looking anxiously from their upper
12250: windows, and finally observed to push himself, by violent efforts, close
12251: behind the dragged man.
12252: 
12253: Meanwhile, the foremost among the constables, who, coming by the back
12254: way, had now reached the opening of Tiliot's lane, discerned that the
12255: crowd had a victim amongst them. One spirited fellow, named Tucker, who
12256: was a regular constable, feeling that no time was to be lost in
12257: meditation, called on his neighbor to follow him, and with a sabre that
12258: happened to be his weapon, got away for himself where he was not
12259: expected, by dint of quick resolution. At this moment Spratt had been
12260: let go--had been dropped, in fact, almost lifeless with terror, on the
12261: street stones, and the men round him had retreated for a little space,
12262: as if to amuse themselves with looking at him. Felix had taken his
12263: opportunity; and seeing the first step toward a plan he was bent on, he
12264: sprang forward close to the cowering Spratt. As he did this, Tucker had
12265: cut his way to the spot, and imagining Felix to be the destined
12266: executioner of Spratt--for any discrimination of Tucker's lay in his
12267: muscles rather than his eyes--he rushed up to Felix, meaning to collar
12268: him and throw him down. But Felix had rapid senses and quick thoughts;
12269: he discerned the situation; he chose between two evils. Quick as
12270: lightning he frustrated the constable, fell upon him, and tried to
12271: master his weapon. In the struggle, which was watched without
12272: interference, the constable fell undermost, and Felix got his weapon. He
12273: started up with the bare sabre in his hand. The crowd round him cried
12274: "Hurray!" with a sense that he was on their side against the constable.
12275: Tucker did not rise immediately; but Felix did not imagine that he was
12276: much hurt.
12277: 
12278: "Don't touch him!" said Felix. "Let him go. Here, bring Spratt, and
12279: follow me."
12280: 
12281: Felix was perfectly conscious that he was in the midst of a tangled
12282: business. But he had chiefly before his imagination the horrors that
12283: might come if the mass of wild chaotic desires and impulses around him
12284: were not diverted from any further attacks on places where they would
12285: get in the midst of intoxicating and inflammable materials. It was not a
12286: moment in which a spirit like his could calculate the effect of
12287: misunderstanding as to himself: nature never makes men who are at once
12288: energetically sympathetic and minutely calculating. He believed he had
12289: the power and was resolved to try, to carry the dangerous mass out of
12290: mischief till the military came to awe them--which he supposed, from Mr.
12291: Crow's announcement a long time ago, must be a near event.
12292: 
12293: He was followed the more willingly, because Tiliot's lane was seen by
12294: the hindmost to be now defended by constables, some of whom had
12295: firearms; and where there is no strong counter-movement, any proposition
12296: to do something that is unspecified stimulates stupid curiosity. To many
12297: of the Sproxton men who were within sight of him, Felix was known
12298: personally, and vaguely believed to be a man who meant many queer
12299: things, not at all of an everyday kind. Pressing along like a leader,
12300: with the sabre in his hand, and inviting them to bring on Spratt, there
12301: seemed a better reason for following him than for doing anything else. A
12302: man with a definite will and an energetic personality acts as a sort of
12303: flag to draw and bind together the foolish units of a mob. It was on
12304: this sort of influence over men whose mental state was a mere medley of
12305: appetites and confused impressions, that Felix had dared to count. He
12306: hurried them along with words of invitation, telling them to hold up
12307: Spratt and not drag him; and those behind followed him, with a growing
12308: belief that he had some design worth knowing, while those in front were
12309: urged along partly by the same notion, partly by the sense that there
12310: was a motive in those behind them, not knowing what the motive was. It
12311: was that mixture of pushing forward and being pushed forward, which is a
12312: brief history of most human things.
12313: 
12314: What Felix really intended to do, was to get the crowd by the nearest
12315: way out of the town, and induce them to skirt it on the north side with
12316: him, keeping up in them the idea that he was leading them to execute
12317: some stratagem, by which they would surprise something worth attacking,
12318: and circumvent the constables who were defending the lanes. In the
12319: meantime he trusted that the soldiers would have arrived, and with this
12320: sort of mob which was animated by no real political passion or fury
12321: against social distinctions, it was in the highest degree unlikely that
12322: there would be any resistance to a military force. The presence of fifty
12323: soldiers would probably be enough to scatter the rioting hundreds. How
12324: numerous the mob was, no one ever knew: many inhabitants afterward were
12325: ready to swear that there must have been at least two thousand rioters.
12326: Felix knew he was incurring great risks; but "his blood was up"; we
12327: hardly allow enough in common life for the results of that enkindled
12328: passionate enthusiasm which, under other conditions, makes world-famous
12329: deeds.
12330: 
12331: He was making for a point where the street branched off on one side
12332: toward a speedy opening between hedgerows, on the other toward the
12333: shabby wideness of Pollard's End. At this forking of the street there
12334: was a large space, in the centre of which there was a small stone
12335: platform, mounting by three steps, with an old green finger-post upon
12336: it. Felix went straight to this platform and stepped upon it, crying
12337: "Halt!" in a loud voice to the men behind and before him, and calling to
12338: those who held Spratt to bring him there. All came to a stand with faces
12339: toward the finger-post, and perhaps for the first time the extremities
12340: of the crowd got a definite idea that a man with a sabre in his hand was
12341: taking the command.
12342: 
12343: "Now!" said Felix, when Spratt had been brought to the stone platform,
12344: faint and trembling, "has anybody got cord? if not, handkerchiefs
12345: knotted fast; give them to me."
12346: 
12347: He drew out his own handkerchief, and two or three others were mustered
12348: and handed to him. He ordered them to be knotted together, while curious
12349: eyes were fixed on him. Was he going to have Spratt hanged? Felix kept
12350: fast hold of his weapon, and ordered others to act.
12351: 
12352: "Now, put it round his waist, wind his arms in, draw them a little
12353: backward--so! and tie it fast on the other side of the post."
12354: 
12355: When that was done, Felix said, imperatively:
12356: 
12357: "Leave him there--we shall come back to him; let us make haste; march
12358: along, lads! Up Park Street and down Hobb's Lane."
12359: 
12360: It was the best chance he could think of for saving Spratt's life. And
12361: he succeeded. The pleasure of seeing the helpless man tied up sufficed
12362: for the moment, if there were any who had ferocity enough to count much
12363: on coming back to him. Nobody's imagination represented the certainty
12364: that some one out of the houses at hand would soon come and untie him
12365: when he was left alone.
12366: 
12367: And the rioters pushed up Park Street, a noisy stream, with Felix still
12368: in the midst of them, though he was laboring hard to get his way to the
12369: front. He wished to determine the course of the crowd along a by-road
12370: called Hobb's Lane, which would have taken them to the other--the
12371: Duffield end of the town. He urged several of the men round him, one of
12372: whom was no less a person than the big Dredge, our old Sproxton
12373: acquaintance, to get forward, and be sure that all the fellows would go
12374: down the lane, else they would spoil sport. Hitherto Felix had been
12375: successful, and he had gone along with an unbroken impulse. But soon
12376: something occurred which brought with a terrible shock the sense that
12377: his plan might turn out to be as mad as all bold projects are seen to be
12378: when they have failed.
12379: 
12380: Mingled with the more headlong and half-drunken crowd there were some
12381: sharp-visaged men who loved the irrationality of riots for something
12382: else than its own sake, and who at present were not so much the richer
12383: as they desired to be, for the pains they had taken in coming to the
12384: Treby election, induced by certain prognostics gathered at Duffield on
12385: the nomination-day that there might be the conditions favorable to that
12386: confusion which was always a harvest-time. It was known to some of these
12387: sharp men that Park Street led out toward the grand house of Treby
12388: Manor, which was as good--nay, better, for their purpose than the bank.
12389: While Felix was entertaining his ardent purpose, these other sons of
12390: Adam were entertaining another ardent purpose of their peculiar sort,
12391: and the moment had come when they were to have their triumph.
12392: 
12393: From the front ranks backward toward Felix there ran a new summons--a
12394: new invitation.
12395: 
12396: "Let us go to Treby Manor!"
12397: 
12398: From that moment Felix was powerless; a new definite suggestion overrode
12399: his vaguer influence. There was a determined rush past Hobb's Lane, and
12400: not down it. Felix was carried along too. He did not know whether to
12401: wish the contrary. Once on the road, out of town, with openings into
12402: fields and with the wide park at hand, it would have been easy to
12403: liberate himself from the crowd. At first it seemed to him the better
12404: part to do this, and to get back to the town as fast as he could, in the
12405: hope of finding the military and getting a detachment to come and save
12406: the Manor. But he reflected that the course of the mob had been
12407: sufficiently seen, and that there were plenty of people in Park Street
12408: to carry the information faster than he could. It seemed more necessary
12409: that he should secure the presence of some help for the family at the
12410: Manor by going there himself. The Debarrys were not of the class of
12411: people he was wont to be anxious about; but Felix Holt's conscience was
12412: alive to the accusation that any danger they might be in now was brought
12413: on by a deed of his. In these moments of bitter vexation and
12414: disappointment, it did occur to him that very unpleasant consequences
12415: might be hanging over him of a kind quite different from inward
12416: dissatisfaction; but it was useless now to think of averting such
12417: consequences. As he was pressed along with the multitude into Treby
12418: Park, his very movement seemed to him only an image of the day's
12419: fatalities, in which the multitudinous small wickednesses of small
12420: selfish ends, really undirected toward any larger result, had issued in
12421: widely-shared mischief that might yet be hideous.
12422: 
12423: [Illustration: FELIX WOUNDED IN THE RIOT.]
12424: 
12425: The light was declining: already the candles shone through many windows
12426: of the Manor. Already the foremost part of the crowd had burst into the
12427: offices, and adroit men were busy in the right places to find plate,
12428: after setting others to force the butler into unlocking the cellars; and
12429: Felix had only just been able to force his way on to the front terrace,
12430: with the hope of getting to the rooms where he would find the ladies of
12431: the household and comfort them with the assurance that rescue must
12432: soon come, when the sound of horses' feet convinced him that the rescue
12433: was nearer than he had expected. Just as he heard the horses, he had
12434: approached the large window of a room where a brilliant light suspended
12435: from the ceiling showed him a group of women clinging together in
12436: terror. Others of the crowd were pushing their way up the terrace-steps
12437: and gravel-slopes at various points. Hearing the horses, he kept his
12438: post in front of the window, and, motioning with his sabre, cried out to
12439: the oncomers, "Keep back! I hear the soldiers coming." Some scrambled
12440: back, some paused automatically.
12441: 
12442: The louder and louder sound of the hoofs changed its pace and
12443: distribution. "Halt! Fire!" Bang! bang! bang!--came deafening the ears
12444: of the men on the terrace.
12445: 
12446: Before they had time or nerve to move, there was a rushing sound closer
12447: to them--again "Fire!" a bullet whizzed, and passed through Felix Holt's
12448: shoulder--the shoulder of the arm that held the naked weapon which shone
12449: in the light from the window.
12450: 
12451: Felix fell. The rioters ran confusedly, like terrified sheep. Some of
12452: the soldiers, turning, drove them along with the flat of their swords.
12453: The greater difficulty was to clear the invaded offices.
12454: 
12455: The rector, who with another magistrate and several other gentlemen on
12456: horseback had accompanied the soldiers, now jumped on to the terrace,
12457: and hurried to the ladies of the family.
12458: 
12459: Presently there was a group round Felix, who had fainted, and, reviving,
12460: had fainted again. He had had little food during the day, and had been
12461: overwrought. Two of the group were civilians, but only one of them knew
12462: Felix, the other being a magistrate not resident in Treby. The one who
12463: knew Felix was Mr. John Johnson, whose zeal for the public peace had
12464: brought him from Duffield when he heard that the soldiers were summoned.
12465: 
12466: "I know this man very well," said Mr. Johnson. "He is a dangerous
12467: character--quite revolutionary."
12468: 
12469: It was a weary night; and the next day, Felix, whose wound was declared
12470: trivial, was lodged in Loamford Jail. There were three charges against
12471: him: that he had assaulted a constable, that he had committed
12472: manslaughter (Tucker was dead from spinal concussion), and that he had
12473: led a riotous onslaught on a dwelling-house.
12474: 
12475: Four other men were committed: one of them for possessing himself of a
12476: gold cup with the Debarry arms on it; the three others, one of whom was
12477: the collier Dredge, for riot and assault.
12478: 
12479: That morning Treby town was no longer in terror; but it was in much
12480: sadness. Other men, more innocent than the hated Spratt, were groaning
12481: under severe bodily injuries. And poor Tucker's corpse was not the only
12482: one that had been lifted from the pavement. It is true that none grieved
12483: much for the other dead man, unless it be grief to say, "Poor old
12484: fellow!" He had been trampled upon, doubtless, where he fell drunkenly,
12485: near the entrance of the Seven Stars. This second corpse was old Tommy
12486: Trounsem, the bill-sticker--otherwise Thomas Transome, the last of a
12487: very old family-line.
12488: 
12489: 
12490: 
12491: 
12492: CHAPTER XXXIV.
12493: 
12494:     The fields are hoary with December's frost,
12495:     I too am hoary with the chills of age.
12496:     But through the fields and through the untrodden woods
12497:     Is rest and stillness--only in my heart
12498:     The pall of winter shrouds a throbbing life.
12499: 
12500: 
12501: A week after that Treby riot, Harold Transome was at Transome Court. He
12502: had returned from a hasty visit to town to keep his Christmas at this
12503: delightful country home, not in the best Christmas spirits. He had lost
12504: the election; but if that had been his only annoyance, he had good humor
12505: and good sense enough to have borne it as well as most men, and to have
12506: paid the eight or nine thousand, which had been the price of
12507: ascertaining that he was not to sit in the next Parliament, without
12508: useless grumbling. But the disappointments of life can never, any more
12509: than its pleasures, be estimated singly; and the healthiest and most
12510: agreeable of men is exposed to that coincidence of various vexations,
12511: each heightening the effect of the other, which may produce in him
12512: something corresponding to the spontaneous and externally unaccountable
12513: moodiness of the morbid and disagreeable.
12514: 
12515: Harold might not have grieved much at a small riot in Treby, even if it
12516: had caused some expenses to fall on the county; but the turn which the
12517: riot had actually taken was a bitter morsel for rumination, on more
12518: grounds than one. However the disturbances had arisen and been
12519: aggravated--and probably no one knew the whole truth on these
12520: points--the conspicuous, gravest incidents had all tended to throw the
12521: blame on the Radical party, that is to say, on Transome and on
12522: Transome's agents; and so far the candidateship and its results had done
12523: Harold dishonor in the county: precisely the opposite effect to that
12524: which was a dear object of his ambition. More than this, Harold's
12525: conscience was active enough to be very unpleasantly affected by what
12526: had befallen Felix Holt. His memory, always good, was particularly vivid
12527: in its retention of Felix Holt's complaint to him about the treating of
12528: the Sproxton men, and of the subsequent irritating scene in Jermyn's
12529: office, when the personage with the inauspicious name of Johnson had
12530: expounded to him the impossibility of revising an electioneering scheme
12531: once begun, and of turning your vehicle back when it had already begun
12532: to roll downhill. Remembering Felix Holt's words of indignant warning
12533: about hiring men with drink in them to make a noise, Harold could not
12534: resist the urgent impression that the offences for which Felix was
12535: committed were fatalities, not brought about by any willing co-operation
12536: of his with the noisy rioters, but arising probably from some rather
12537: ill-judged efforts to counteract their violence. And this urgent
12538: impression, which insisted on growing into a conviction, became in one
12539: of its phases an uneasy sense that he held evidence which would at once
12540: tend to exonerate Felix and to place himself and his agents in anything
12541: but a desirable light. It was likely that some one else could give
12542: equivalent evidence in favor of Felix--the little talkative Dissenting
12543: preacher, for example: but, anyhow, the affair with the Sproxton men
12544: would be ripped open and made the worst of by the opposite parties. The
12545: man who has failed in the use of some indirectness, is helped very
12546: little by the fact that his rivals are men to whom that indirectness is
12547: a something human, very far from being alien. There remains this grand
12548: distinction, that he has failed, and that the jet of light is thrown
12549: entirely on his misdoings.
12550: 
12551: In this matter Harold felt himself a victim. Could he hinder the tricks
12552: of his agents? In this particular case he had tried to hinder them, and
12553: had tried in vain. He had not loved the two agents in question, to begin
12554: with; and now at this later stage of events he was more innocent than
12555: ever of bearing them anything but the most sincere ill-will. He was more
12556: utterly exasperated with them than he would probably have been if his
12557: one great passion had been for public virtue. Jermyn, with his John
12558: Johnson, had added this ugly, dirty business of the Treby election to
12559: all the long-accumulating list of offences, which Harold was resolved to
12560: visit on him to the utmost. He had seen some handbills carrying the
12561: insinuation that there was a discreditable indebtedness to Jermyn on
12562: the part of the Transomes. If any such notions existed apart from
12563: electioneering slander, there was all the more reason for letting the
12564: world see Jermyn severely punished for abusing his power over the family
12565: affairs, and tampering with the family property. And the world certainly
12566: should see this with as little delay as possible. The cool, confident,
12567: assuming fellow should be bled to the last drop in compensation, and all
12568: connection with him be finally got rid of. Now that the election was
12569: done with, Harold meant to devote himself to private affairs, till
12570: everything lay in complete order under his supervision.
12571: 
12572: This morning he was seated as usual in his private room, which had now
12573: been handsomely fitted up for him. It was but the third morning after
12574: the first Christmas he had spent in his English home for fifteen years,
12575: and the home looked like an eminently desirable one. The white frost was
12576: now lying on the broad lawn, on the many-formed leaves of the evergreens
12577: and on the giant trees at a distance. Logs of dry oak blazed on the
12578: hearth; the carpet was like warm moss under his feet; he had breakfasted
12579: just according to his taste, and he had the interesting occupations of a
12580: large proprietor to fill the morning. All through the house now steps
12581: were noiseless on carpets or on fine matting; there was warmth in hall
12582: and corridors; there were servants enough to do everything, and to do it
12583: at the right time. Skilful Dominic was always at hand to meet his
12584: master's demands, and his bland presence diffused itself like a smile
12585: over the household, infecting the gloomy English mind with the belief
12586: that life was easy, and making his real predominance seem as soft and
12587: light as a down quilt. Old Mr. Transome had gathered new courage and
12588: strength since little Harry and Dominic had come, and since Harold had
12589: insisted on his taking drives. Mrs. Transome herself was seen on a fresh
12590: background with a gown of rich new stuff. And if, in spite of this, she
12591: did not seem happy, Harold either did not observe it, or kindly ignored
12592: it as the necessary frailty of elderly women whose lives have had too
12593: much of dullness and privation. Our minds get tricks and attitudes as
12594: our bodies do, thought Harold, and age stiffens them into
12595: unalterableness. "Poor mother! I confess I should not like to be an
12596: elderly woman myself. One requires a good deal of the purring cat for
12597: that, or else of the loving grandame. I wish she would take more to
12598: little Harry. I suppose she has her suspicions about the lad's mother,
12599: and is as rigid in those matters as in her Toryism. However, I do what
12600: I can; it would be difficult to say what there is wanting to her in the
12601: way of indulgence and luxury to make up for the old niggardly life."
12602: 
12603: And certainly Transome Court was now such a home as many women would
12604: covet. Yet even Harold's own satisfaction in the midst of its elegant
12605: comfort needed at present to be sustained by the expectation of
12606: gratified resentment. He was obviously less bright and enjoying than
12607: usual, and his mother, who watched him closely without daring to ask
12608: questions, had gathered hints and drawn inferences enough to make her
12609: feel sure that there was some storm gathering between him and Jermyn.
12610: She did not dare to ask questions, and yet she had not resisted the
12611: temptation to say something bitter about Harold's failure to get
12612: returned as a Radical, helping, with feminine self-defeat, to exclude
12613: herself more completely from any consultation by him. In this way poor
12614: women, whose power lies solely in their influence, make themselves like
12615: music out of tune, and only move men to run away.
12616: 
12617: This morning Harold had ordered his letters to be brought to him at the
12618: breakfast-table, which was not his usual practice. His mother could see
12619: that there were London business letters about which he was eager, and
12620: she had found out that the letter brought by a clerk the day before was
12621: to make an appointment with Harold for Jermyn to come to Transome Court
12622: at eleven this morning. She observed Harold swallow his coffee and push
12623: away his plate with an early abstraction from the business of breakfast
12624: which was not at all after his usual manner. She herself ate nothing:
12625: her sips of tea seemed to excite her; her cheeks flushed, and her hands
12626: were cold. She was still young and ardent in her terrors; the passions
12627: of the past were living in her dread.
12628: 
12629: When Harold left the table she went into the long drawing-room, where
12630: she might relieve her restlessness by walking up and down, and catch the
12631: sound of Jermyn's entrance into Harold's room, which was close by. Here
12632: she moved to and fro amongst the rose-colored satin of chairs and
12633: curtains--the great story of this world reduced for her to the little
12634: tale of her own existence--dull obscurity everywhere, except where the
12635: keen light fell on the narrow track of her own lot, wide only for a
12636: woman's anguish. At last she heard the expected ring and footstep, and
12637: the opening and closing door. Unable to walk about any longer, she sank
12638: into a large cushioned chair, helpless and prayerless. She was not
12639: thinking of God's anger or mercy, but of her son's. She was thinking of
12640: what might be brought, not by death, but by life.
12641: 
12642: 
12643: 
12644: 
12645: CHAPTER XXXV.
12646: 
12647:     _M._  Check to your queen!
12648: 
12649:     _N._                      Nay, your own king is bare,
12650:           And moving so, you give yourself checkmate.
12651: 
12652: 
12653: When Jermyn entered the room, Harold, who was seated at his library
12654: table examining papers, with his back toward the light and his face
12655: toward the door, moved his head coldly. Jermyn said an ungracious
12656: "Good-morning,"--as little as possible like a salutation to one who
12657: might regard himself as a patron. On the attorney's handsome face there
12658: was a black cloud of defiant determination slightly startling to Harold,
12659: who had expected to feel that the overpowering weight of temper in the
12660: interview was on his own side. Nobody was ever prepared beforehand for
12661: this expression of Jermyn's face, which seemed as strongly contrasted
12662: with the cold impenetrableness which he preserved under the ordinary
12663: annoyance of business as with the bland radiance of his lighter moments.
12664: 
12665: Harold himself did not look amiable just then, but his anger was of the
12666: sort that seeks a vent without waiting to give a fatal blow; it was that
12667: of a nature more subtly mixed than Jermyn's--less animally forcible,
12668: less unwavering in selfishness, and with more of high-bred pride. He
12669: looked at Jermyn with increased disgust and secret wonder.
12670: 
12671: "Sit down," he said curtly.
12672: 
12673: Jermyn seated himself in silence, opened his greatcoat, and took some
12674: papers from a side pocket.
12675: 
12676: "I have written to Makepeace," said Harold, "to tell him to take the
12677: entire management of the election expenses. So you will transmit your
12678: accounts to him."
12679: 
12680: "Very well. I am come this morning on other business."
12681: 
12682: "If it's about the riot and the prisoners, I have only to say that I
12683: shall enter into no plans. If I am called on, I shall say what I know
12684: about that young fellow Felix Holt. People may prove what they can about
12685: Johnson's damnable tricks, or yours either."
12686: 
12687: "I am not come to speak about the riot. I agree with you in thinking
12688: that quite a subordinate subject." (When Jermyn had the black cloud over
12689: his face, he never hesitated or drawled, and made no Latin quotations.)
12690: 
12691: "Be so good, then, as to open your business at once," said Harold, in a
12692: tone of imperious indifference.
12693: 
12694: "That is precisely what I wish to do. I have here information from a
12695: London correspondent that you are about to file a bill against me in
12696: Chancery." Jermyn, as he spoke, laid his hand on the papers before him,
12697: and looked straight at Harold.
12698: 
12699: "In that case, the question for you is, how far your conduct as the
12700: family solicitor will bear investigation. But it is a question which you
12701: will consider quite apart from me."
12702: 
12703: "Doubtless. But prior to that there is a question which we must consider
12704: together."
12705: 
12706: The tone in which Jermyn said this gave an unpleasant shock to Harold's
12707: sense of mastery. Was it possible that he should have the weapon
12708: wrenched out of his hand?
12709: 
12710: "I shall know what to think of that," he replied, as haughtily as ever,
12711: "when you have stated what the question is."
12712: 
12713: "Simply, whether you will choose to retain the family estates, or lay
12714: yourself open to be forthwith legally deprived of them."
12715: 
12716: "I presume you refer to some underhand scheme of your own, on a par with
12717: the annuities you have drained us by in the name of Johnson," said
12718: Harold, feeling a new movement of anger. "If so, you had better state
12719: your scheme to my lawyers, Dymock and Halliwell."
12720: 
12721: "No. I think you will approve of my stating in your own ear first of
12722: all, that it depends on my will whether you remain an important landed
12723: proprietor in North Loamshire, or whether you retire from the country
12724: with the remainder of the fortune you have acquired in trade."
12725: 
12726: Jermyn paused, as if to leave time for this morsel to be tasted.
12727: 
12728: "What do you mean?" said Harold, sharply.
12729: 
12730: "Not any scheme of mine; but a state of the facts resulting from the
12731: settlement of the estate made in 1729: state of the facts which renders
12732: your father's title and your own title to the family estates utterly
12733: worthless as soon as the claimant is made aware of his right."
12734: 
12735: "And you intend to inform him?"
12736: 
12737: "That depends. I am the only person who has the requisite knowledge. It
12738: rests with you to decide whether I shall use that knowledge against you;
12739: or whether I shall use it in your favor by putting an end to the
12740: evidence that would serve to oust you in spite of your 'robust title of
12741: occupancy.'"
12742: 
12743: Jermyn paused again. He had been speaking slowly, but without the least
12744: hesitation, and with a bitter definiteness of enunciation. There was a
12745: moment or two before Harold answered, and then he said abruptly--
12746: 
12747: "I don't believe you."
12748: 
12749: "I thought you were more shrewd," said Jermyn, with a touch of scorn. "I
12750: thought you understood that I had had too much experience to waste my
12751: time in telling fables to persuade a man who has put himself into the
12752: attitude of my deadly enemy."
12753: 
12754: "Well, then, say at once what your proofs are," said Harold, shaking in
12755: spite of himself, and getting nervous.
12756: 
12757: "I have no inclination to be lengthy. It is not more than a few weeks
12758: since I ascertained that there is in existence an heir of the Bycliffes,
12759: the old adversaries of your family. More curiously, it is only a few
12760: days ago--in fact, only since the day of the riot--that the Bycliffe
12761: claim has become valid, and that the right of remainder accrues to the
12762: heir in question."
12763: 
12764: "And how, pray?" said Harold, rising from his chair, and making a turn
12765: in the room, with his hands thrust in his pockets. Jermyn rose too, and
12766: stood near the hearth, facing Harold, as he moved to and fro.
12767: 
12768: "By the death of an old fellow who got drunk and was trampled to death
12769: in the riot. He was the last of that Thomas Transome's line, by the
12770: purchase of whose interest your family got its title to the estate. Your
12771: title died with him. It was supposed that the line had become extinct
12772: before--and on that supposition the old Bycliffes founded their claim.
12773: But I hunted up this man just about the time the last suit was closed.
12774: His death would have been of no consequence to you if there had not been
12775: a Bycliffe in existence; but I happen to know that there is, and that
12776: the fact can be legally proved."
12777: 
12778: For a minute or two Harold did not speak, but continued to pace the
12779: room, while Jermyn kept his position, holding his hands behind him. At
12780: last Harold said, from the other end of the room, speaking in a scornful
12781: tone--
12782: 
12783: "That sounds alarming. But it is not to be proved simply by your
12784: statement."
12785: 
12786: "Clearly. I have here a document, with a copy which will back my
12787: statement. It is the opinion given on the case more than twenty years
12788: ago, and it bears the signature of the Attorney-General and the first
12789: conveyancer of the day."
12790: 
12791: Jermyn took up the papers he had laid on the table, opening them slowly
12792: and coolly as he went on speaking, and as Harold advanced toward him.
12793: 
12794: "You may suppose that we spared no pains to ascertain the state of the
12795: title in the last suit against Maurice Christian Bycliffe, which
12796: threatened to be a hard run. This document is the result of a
12797: consultation; it gives an opinion which must be taken as a final
12798: authority. You may cast your eyes over that, if you please; I will wait
12799: your time. Or you may read the summing-up here," Jermyn ended, holding
12800: out one of the papers to Harold, and pointing to a final passage.
12801: 
12802: Harold took the paper with a slight gesture of impatience. He did not
12803: choose to obey Jermyn's indication, and confine himself to the
12804: summing-up. He ran through the document. But in truth he was too much
12805: excited really to follow the details, and was rather acting than
12806: reading, till at once he threw himself into his chair and consented to
12807: bend his attention on the passage to which Jermyn had pointed. The
12808: attorney watched him as he read and twice re-read:--
12809: 
12810:     To sum up----we are of opinion that the title of the present
12811:     possessors of the Transome estate can be strictly proved to rest
12812:     solely upon a base fee created under the original settlement of
12813:     1729, and to be good so long only as issue exists of the tenant in
12814:     tail by whom that base fee was created. We feel satisfied by the
12815:     evidence that such issue exists in the person of Thomas Transome,
12816:     otherwise Trounsem, of Littleshaw. But upon his decease without
12817:     issue we are of opinion that the right in remainder of the Bycliffe
12818:     family will arise, which right would not be barred by any statute
12819:     of limitation.
12820: 
12821: When Harold's eyes were on the signatures to this document for the third
12822: time, Jermyn said--
12823: 
12824: "As it turned out, the case being closed by the death of the claimant,
12825: we had no occasion for producing Thomas Transome, who was the old fellow
12826: I told you of. The enquiries about him set him agog, and after they were
12827: dropped he came into this neighborhood, thinking there was something
12828: fine in store for him. Here, if you like to take it, is a memorandum
12829: about him. I repeat that he died in the riot. The proof is ready. And I
12830: repeat, that, to my knowledge, and mine only, there is a Bycliffe in
12831: existence; and that I know how the proof can be made out."
12832: 
12833: Harold rose from his chair again, and again paced the room. He was not
12834: prepared with any defiance.
12835: 
12836: "And where is he--this Bycliffe?" he said at last, stopping in his walk,
12837: and facing round toward Jermyn.
12838: 
12839: "I decline to say more till you promise to suspend proceedings against
12840: me."
12841: 
12842: Harold turned again, and looked out of the window, without speaking, for
12843: a moment or two. It was impossible that there should not be a conflict
12844: within him, and at present it was a very confused one. At last he said--
12845: 
12846: "This person is in ignorance of his claim?"
12847: 
12848: "Yes."
12849: 
12850: "Has been brought up in an inferior station?"
12851: 
12852: "Yes," said Jermyn, keen enough to guess part of what was going on in
12853: Harold's mind. "There is no harm in leaving him in ignorance. The
12854: question is a purely legal one. And, as I said before, the complete
12855: knowledge of the case, as one of evidence, lies exclusively with me. I
12856: can nullify the evidence, or I can make it tell with certainty against
12857: you. The choice lies with you."
12858: 
12859: "I must have time to think of this," said Harold, conscious of a
12860: terrible pressure.
12861: 
12862: "I can give you no time unless you promise me to suspend proceedings."
12863: 
12864: "And then, when I ask you, you will lay the details before me?"
12865: 
12866: "Not without a thorough understanding beforehand. If I engage not to use
12867: my knowledge against you, you must engage in writing that on being
12868: satisfied by the details, you will cancel all hostile proceedings
12869: against me, and will not institute fresh ones on the strength of any
12870: occurrences now past."
12871: 
12872: "Well, I must have time," said Harold, more than ever inclined to thrash
12873: the attorney, but feeling bound hand and foot with knots that he was not
12874: sure he could ever unfasten.
12875: 
12876: "That is to say," said Jermyn, with his black-browed persistence, "you
12877: will write to suspend proceedings."
12878: 
12879: Again Harold paused. He was more than ever exasperated, but he was
12880: threatened, mortified, and confounded by the necessity for an immediate
12881: decision between alternatives almost equally hateful to him. It was with
12882: difficulty that he could prevail on himself to speak any conclusive
12883: words. He walked as far as he could from Jermyn--to the other end of the
12884: room--then walked back to his chair and threw himself into it. At last
12885: he said, without looking at Jermyn, "I agree--I must have time."
12886: 
12887: "Very well. It is a bargain."
12888: 
12889: "No further than this," said Harold, hastily, flashing a look at
12890: Jermyn--"no further than this, that I require time, and therefore I give
12891: it to you."
12892: 
12893: "Of course. You require time to consider whether the pleasure of trying
12894: to ruin me--me to whom you are really indebted--is worth the loss of the
12895: Transome estates. I shall wish you good-morning."
12896: 
12897: Harold did not speak to him or look at him again, and Jermyn walked out
12898: of the room. As he appeared outside the door and closed it behind him,
12899: Mrs. Transome showed her white face at another door which opened on a
12900: level with Harold's in such a way that it was just possible for Jermyn
12901: not to see her. He availed himself of that possibility, and walked
12902: straight across the hall, where there was no servant in attendance to
12903: let him out, as if he believed that no one was looking at him who could
12904: expect recognition. He did not want to speak to Mrs. Transome at
12905: present; he had nothing to ask from her, and one disagreeable interview
12906: had been enough for him this morning.
12907: 
12908: She was convinced that he had avoided her, and she was too proud to
12909: arrest him. She was as insignificant now in his eyes as in her son's.
12910: "Men have no memories in their hearts," she said to herself, bitterly.
12911: And then turning into her sitting-room she heard the voices of Mr.
12912: Transome and little Harry at play together. She would have given a great
12913: deal at this moment if her feeble husband had not always lived in dread
12914: of her temper and her tyranny, so that he might have been fond of her
12915: now. She felt herself loveless; if she was important to any one, it was
12916: only to her old waiting-woman Denner.

12921: CHAPTER XXXVI.
12922: 
12923:     Are these things then necessities?
12924:     Then let us meet them like necessities.
12925: 
12926:                                         --SHAKESPEARE: _Henry IV_.
12927: 
12928:     See now the virtue living in a word!
12929:     Hobson will think of swearing it was noon
12930:     When he saw Dobson at the May-day fair,
12931:     To prove poor Dobson did not rob the mail.
12932:     'Tis neighborly to save a neighbor's neck:
12933:     What harm in lying when you mean no harm?
12934:     But say 'tis perjury, then Hobson quakes--
12935:     He'll none of perjury.
12936:                           Thus words embalm
12937:     The conscience of mankind: and Roman laws
12938:     Bring still a conscience to poor Hobson's aid.
12939: 
12940: 
12941: Few men would have felt otherwise than Harold Transome felt, if, having
12942: a reversion tantamount to possession of a fine estate, carrying an
12943: association with an old name and considerable social importance, they
12944: were suddenly informed that there was a person who had a legal right to
12945: deprive them of these advantages; that person's right having never been
12946: contemplated by any one as more than a chance, and being quite unknown
12947: to himself. In ordinary cases a shorter possession than Harold's family
12948: had enjoyed was allowed by the law to constitute an indefeasible right;
12949: and if in rare and peculiar instances the law left the possessor of a
12950: long inheritance exposed to deprivation as the consequence of old
12951: obscure transactions, the moral reasons for giving legal validity to the
12952: title of long occupancy were not the less strong. Nobody would have said
12953: that Harold was bound to hunt out this alleged remainder-man and urge
12954: his rights upon him; on the contrary, all the world would have laughed
12955: at such conduct, and he would have been thought an interesting patient
12956: for a mad-doctor. The unconscious remainder-man was probably much better
12957: off, left in his original station: Harold would not have been called
12958: upon to consider his existence, if it had not been presented to him in
12959: the shape of a threat from one who had power to execute the threat.
12960: 
12961: In fact, what he would have done had the circumstances been different,
12962: was much clearer than what he should choose to do or feel himself
12963: compelled to do in the actual crisis. He would not have been disgraced
12964: if, on a valid claim being urged, he had got his lawyers to fight it out
12965: for him on the chance of eluding the claim by some adroit technical
12966: management. Nobody off the stage could be sentimental about these
12967: things, or pretend to shed tears of joy because an estate was handed
12968: over from a gentleman to a mendicant sailor with a wooden leg. And this
12969: chance remainder-man was perhaps some such specimen of inheritance as
12970: the drunken fellow killed in the riot. All the world would think the
12971: actual Transomes in the right to contest any adverse claim to the
12972: utmost. But then--it was not certain that they would win in the contest;
12973: and not winning, they would incur other losses besides that of the
12974: estate. There had been a little too much of such loss already.
12975: 
12976: But why, if it were not wrong to contest the claim, should he feel the
12977: most uncomfortable scruples about robbing the claim of its sting by
12978: getting rid of its evidence? It was a mortal disappointment--it was a
12979: sacrifice of indemnification--to abstain from punishing Jermyn. But even
12980: if he brought his mind to contemplate that as the wiser course, he still
12981: shrank from what looked like complicity with Jermyn; he still shrank
12982: from the secret nullification of a just legal claim. If he had only
12983: known the details, if he had known who this alleged heir was, he might
12984: have seen his way to some course that would not have grated on his sense
12985: of honor and dignity. But Jermyn had been too acute to let Harold know
12986: this: he had even carefully kept to the masculine pronoun. And he
12987: believed that there was no one besides himself who would or could make
12988: Harold any wiser. He went home persuaded that between this interview and
12989: the next which they would have together, Harold would be left to an
12990: inward debate, founded entirely on the information he himself had given.
12991: And he had not much doubt that the result would be what he desired.
12992: Harold was no fool: there were many good things he liked better in life
12993: than an irrational vindictiveness.
12994: 
12995: And it did happen that, after writing to London in fulfillment of his
12996: pledge, Harold spent many hours over that inward debate, which was not
12997: very different from what Jermyn imagined. He took it everywhere with him
12998: on foot and on horseback, and it was his companion through a great deal
12999: of the night. His nature was not of a kind given to internal conflict,
13000: and he had never before been long undecided and puzzled. This
13001: unaccustomed state of mind was so painfully irksome to him--he rebelled
13002: so impatiently against the oppression of circumstances in which his
13003: quick temperament and habitual decision could not help him--that it
13004: added tenfold to his hatred of Jermyn, who was the cause of it. And
13005: thus, as the temptation to avoid all risk of losing the estate grew and
13006: grew till scruples looked minute by the side of it, the difficulty of
13007: bringing himself to make a compact with Jermyn seemed more and more
13008: insurmountable.
13009: 
13010: But we have seen that the attorney was much too confident in his
13011: calculations. And while Harold was being gulled by his subjection to
13012: Jermyn's knowledge, independent information was on its way to him. The
13013: messenger was Christian, who, after as complete a survey of
13014: probabilities as he was capable of, had come to the conclusion that the
13015: most profitable investment he could make of his peculiar experience and
13016: testimony in relation to Bycliffe and Bycliffe's daughter, was to place
13017: them at the disposal of Harold Transome. He was afraid of Jermyn; he
13018: utterly distrusted Johnson; but he thought he was secure in relying on
13019: Harold Transome's care for his own interest; and he preferred above all
13020: issues the prospect of forthwith leaving the country with a sum that at
13021: least for a good while would put him at his ease.
13022: 
13023: When, only three mornings after the interview with Jermyn, Dominic
13024: opened the door of Harold's sitting-room, and said that "Meester
13025: Chreestian," Mr. Philip Debarry's courier and an acquaintance of his own
13026: at Naples, requested to be admitted on business of importance, Harold's
13027: immediate thought was that the business referred to the so-called
13028: political affairs which were just now his chief association with the
13029: name of Debarry, though it seemed an oddness requiring explanation, that
13030: a servant should be personally an intermediary. He assented, expecting
13031: something rather disagreeable than otherwise.
13032: 
13033: Christian wore this morning those perfect manners of a subordinate who
13034: is not servile, which he always adopted toward his unquestionable
13035: superiors. Mr. Debarry, who preferred having some one about him with as
13036: little resemblance as possible to a regular servant, had a singular
13037: liking for the adroit, quiet-mannered Christian, and would have been
13038: amazed to see the insolent assumption he was capable of in the presence
13039: of people like Mr. Lyon, who were of no account in society. Christian
13040: had that sort of cleverness which is said to "know the world"--that is
13041: to say, he knew the price-current of most things.
13042: 
13043: Aware that he was looked at as a messenger while he remained standing
13044: near the door with his hat in his hand, he said, with respectful ease--
13045: 
13046: "You will probably be surprised, sir, at my coming to speak to you on my
13047: own account; and, in fact, I could not have thought of doing so if my
13048: business did not happen to be something of more importance to you than
13049: to any one else."
13050: 
13051: "You don't come from Mr. Debarry, then?" said Harold, with some
13052: surprise.
13053: 
13054: "No, sir. My business is a secret; and, if you please, must remain so."
13055: 
13056: "Is it a pledge you are demanding from me?" said Harold, rather
13057: suspiciously, having no ground for confidence in a man of Christian's
13058: position.
13059: 
13060: "Yes, sir; I am obliged to ask no less than that you will pledge
13061: yourself not to take Mr. Jermyn into confidence concerning what passes
13062: between us."
13063: 
13064: "With all my heart," said Harold, something like a gleam passing over
13065: his face. His circulation had become more rapid. "But what have you had
13066: to do with Jermyn?"
13067: 
13068: "He has not mentioned me to you then--has he, sir?"
13069: 
13070: "No; certainly not--never."
13071: 
13072: Christian thought, "Aha, Mr. Jermyn! you are keeping the secret well,
13073: are you?" He said, aloud--
13074: 
13075: "Then Mr. Jermyn has never mentioned to you, sir, what I believe he is
13076: aware of--that there is danger of a new suit being raised against you on
13077: the part of a Bycliffe, to get the estate?"
13078: 
13079: "Ah!" said Harold, starting up, and placing himself with his back
13080: against the mantelpiece. He was electrified by surprise at the quarter
13081: from which this information was coming. Any fresh alarm was counteracted
13082: by the flashing thought that he might be enabled to act independently of
13083: Jermyn; and in the rush of feelings he could utter no more than an
13084: interjection. Christian concluded that Harold had no previous hint.
13085: 
13086: "It is this fact, that I came to tell you of."
13087: 
13088: "From some other motive than kindness to me, I presume," said Harold,
13089: with a slight approach to a smile.
13090: 
13091: "Certainly," said Christian, as quietly as if he had been stating
13092: yesterday's weather. "I should not have the folly to use any affectation
13093: with you, Mr. Transome. I lost considerable property early in life, and
13094: am now in the receipt of a salary simply. In the affair I have just
13095: mentioned to you I can give evidence which will turn the scale against
13096: you. I have no wish to do so, if you will make it worth my while to
13097: leave the country."
13098: 
13099: Harold listened as if he had been a legendary hero, selected for
13100: peculiar solicitation by the Evil One. Here was temptation in a more
13101: alluring form than before, because it was sweetened by the prospect of
13102: eluding Jermyn. But the desire to gain time served all the purposes of
13103: caution and resistance, and his indifference to the speaker in this case
13104: helped him to preserve perfect self-command.
13105: 
13106: "You are aware," he said, coolly, "that silence is not a commodity worth
13107: purchasing unless it is loaded. There are many persons, I dare say, who
13108: would like me to pay their travelling expenses for them. But they might
13109: hardly be able to show me that it was worth my while."
13110: 
13111: "You wish me to state what I know?"
13112: 
13113: "Well, that is a necessary preliminary to any further conversation."
13114: 
13115: "I think you will see, Mr. Transome, that, as a matter of justice, the
13116: knowledge I can give is worth something, quite apart from my future
13117: appearance or non-appearance as a witness. I must take care of my own
13118: interest, and if anything should hinder you from choosing to satisfy me
13119: for taking an essential witness out of the way, I must at least be paid
13120: for bringing you the information."
13121: 
13122: "Can you tell me who and where this Bycliffe is?"
13123: 
13124: "I can."
13125: 
13126: "-----And give me a notion of the whole affair?"
13127: 
13128: "Yes; I have talked to a lawyer--not Jermyn--who is at the bottom of the
13129: law in the affair."
13130: 
13131: "You must not count on any wish of mine to suppress evidence or remove a
13132: witness. But name your price for the information."
13133: 
13134: "In that case I must be paid the higher for my information. Say, two
13135: thousand pounds."
13136: 
13137: "Two thousand devils!" burst out Harold, throwing himself into his chair
13138: again, and turning his shoulder toward Christian. New thoughts crowded
13139: upon him. "This fellow may want to decamp for some reason or other," he
13140: said to himself. "More people besides Jermyn know about his evidence, it
13141: seems. The whole thing may look black for me if it comes out. I shall be
13142: believed to have bribed him to run away, whether or not." Thus the
13143: outside conscience came in aid of the inner.
13144: 
13145: "I will not give you one sixpence for your information," he said,
13146: resolutely, "until time has made it clear that you do not intend to
13147: decamp, but will be forthcoming when you are called for. On those terms
13148: I have no objection to give you a note, specifying that after the
13149: fulfilment of that condition--that is, after the occurrence of a suit,
13150: or the understanding that no suit is to occur--I will pay you a certain
13151: sum in consideration of the information you now give me!"
13152: 
13153: Christian felt himself caught in a vise. In the first instance he had
13154: counted confidently on Harold's ready seizure of his offer to disappear,
13155: and after some words had seemed to cast a doubt on this presupposition
13156: he had inwardly determined to go away, whether Harold wished it or not,
13157: if he could get a sufficient sum. He did not reply immediately, and
13158: Harold waited in silence, inwardly anxious to know what Christian could
13159: tell, but with a vision at present so far cleared that he was determined
13160: not to risk incurring the imputation of having anything to do with
13161: scoundrelism. We are very much indebted to such a linking of events as
13162: makes a doubtful action look wrong.
13163: 
13164: Christian was reflecting that if he stayed and faced some possible
13165: inconveniences of being known publicly as Henry Scaddon for the sake of
13166: what he might get from Esther, it would at least be wise to be certain
13167: of some money from Harold Transome, since he turned out to be of so
13168: peculiar a disposition as to insist on a punctilious honesty to his own
13169: disadvantage. Did he think of making a bargain with the other side? If
13170: so, he might be content to wait for the knowledge till it came in some
13171: other way. Christian was beginning to be afraid lest he should get
13172: nothing by this clever move of coming to Transome Court. At last he
13173: said--
13174: 
13175: "I think, sir, two thousand would not be an unreasonable sum, on those
13176: conditions."
13177: 
13178: "I will not give two thousand."
13179: 
13180: "Allow me to say, sir, you must consider that there is no one whose
13181: interest it is to tell you as much as I shall, even if they could; since
13182: Mr. Jermyn, who knows it, has not thought fit to tell you. There may be
13183: use you don't think of in getting the information at once."
13184: 
13185: "Well?"
13186: 
13187: "I think a gentleman should act liberally under such circumstances."
13188: 
13189: "So I will."
13190: 
13191: "I could not take less than a thousand pounds. It really would not be
13192: worth my while. If Mr. Jermyn knew I gave you the information, he would
13193: endeavor to injure me."
13194: 
13195: "I will give you a thousand," said Harold, immediately, for Christian
13196: had unconsciously touched a sure spring. "At least, I'll give you a note
13197: to the effect I spoke of."
13198: 
13199: He wrote as he had promised, and gave the paper to Christian.
13200: 
13201: "Now, don't be circuitous," said Harold. "You seem to have a
13202: business-like gift of speech. Who and where is this Bycliffe?"
13203: 
13204: "You will be surprised to hear, sir, that she is supposed to be the
13205: daughter of the old preacher, Lyon, in Malthouse Yard."
13206: 
13207: "Good God! How can that be?" said Harold. At once, the first occasion on
13208: which he had seen Esther rose in his memory--the little dark parlor--the
13209: graceful girl in blue, with the surprisingly distinguished manners and
13210: appearance.
13211: 
13212: "In this way. Old Lyon, by some strange means or other, married
13213: Bycliffe's widow when this girl was a baby. And the preacher didn't want
13214: the girl to know that he was not her real father: he told me that
13215: himself. But she is the image of Bycliffe, whom I knew well--an
13216: uncommonly fine woman--steps like a queen."
13217: 
13218: "I have seen her," said Harold, more than ever glad to have purchased
13219: this knowledge. "But now, go on."
13220: 
13221: Christian proceeded to tell all he knew, including his conversation with
13222: Jermyn, except so far as it had an unpleasant relation to himself.
13223: 
13224: "Then," said Harold, as the details seemed to have come to a close, "you
13225: believe that Miss Lyon and her supposed father are at present unaware of
13226: the claims that might be urged for her on the strength of her birth?"
13227: 
13228: "I believe so. But I need not tell you that where the lawyers are on
13229: the scent you can never be sure of anything long together. I must remind
13230: you, sir, that you have promised to protect me from Mr. Jermyn by
13231: keeping my confidence."
13232: 
13233: "Never fear. Depend upon it, I shall betray nothing to Mr. Jermyn."
13234: 
13235: Christian was dismissed with a "good-morning"; and while he cultivated
13236: some friendly reminiscences with Dominic, Harold sat chewing the cud of
13237: his new knowledge, and finding it not altogether so bitter as he had
13238: expected.
13239: 
13240: From the first, after his interview with Jermyn, the recoil of Harold's
13241: mind from the idea of strangling a legal right threw him on the
13242: alternative of attempting a compromise. Some middle course might be
13243: possible, which would be a less evil than a costly lawsuit, or than the
13244: total renunciation of the estates. And now he had learned that the new
13245: claimant was a woman--a young woman, brought up under circumstances that
13246: would make the fourth of the Transome property seem to her an immense
13247: fortune. Both the sex and the social condition were of the sort that
13248: lies open to many softening influences. And having seen Esther, it was
13249: inevitable that, amongst the various issues, agreeable and disagreeable,
13250: depicted by Harold's imagination, there should present itself a
13251: possibility that would unite the two claims--his own, which he felt to
13252: be the rational, and Esther's, which apparently was the legal claim.
13253: 
13254: Harold, as he had constantly said to his mother, was "not a marrying
13255: man"; he did not contemplate bringing a wife to Transome Court for many
13256: years to come, if at all. Having little Harry as an heir, he preferred
13257: freedom. Western women were not to his taste; they showed a transition
13258: from the feebly animal to the thinking being, which was simply
13259: troublesome. Harold preferred a slow-witted large-eyed woman, silent and
13260: affectionate, with a load of black hair weighing much more heavily than
13261: her brains. He had seen no such woman in England, except one which he
13262: had brought with him from the East.
13263: 
13264: Therefore Harold did not care to be married until or unless some
13265: surprising chance presented itself; and now that such a chance had
13266: occurred to suggest marriage to him, he would not admit to himself that
13267: he contemplated marrying Esther as a plan; he was only obliged to see
13268: that such an issue was not inconceivable. He was not going to take any
13269: step expressly directed toward that end: what he had made up his mind
13270: to, as the course most satisfactory to his nature under present
13271: urgencies, was to behave to Esther with a frank gentle manliness, which
13272: must win her good will, and incline her to save his family interest as
13273: much as possible. He was helped to this determination by the pleasure of
13274: frustrating Jermyn's contrivance to shield himself from punishment, and
13275: his most distinct and cheering prospect was that within a very short
13276: space of time he should not only have effected a satisfactory compromise
13277: with Esther, but should have made Jermyn aware by a very disagreeable
13278: form of announcement, that Harold Transome was no longer afraid of him.
13279: Jermyn should bite the dust.
13280: 
13281: At the end of these meditations he felt satisfied with himself and
13282: light-hearted. He had rejected two dishonest propositions, and he was
13283: going to do something that seemed eminently graceful. But he needed his
13284: mother's assistance, and it was necessary that he should both confide in
13285: her and persuade her.
13286: 
13287: Within two hours after Christian left him, Harold begged his mother to
13288: come into his private room, and there he told her the strange and
13289: startling story, omitting, however, any particulars which would involve
13290: the identification of Christian as his informant. Harold felt that his
13291: engagement demanded his reticence; and he told his mother that he was
13292: bound to conceal the source of that knowledge which he had got
13293: independently of Jermyn.
13294: 
13295: Mrs. Transome said little in the course of the story: she made no
13296: exclamations, but she listened with close attention, and asked a few
13297: questions so much to the point as to surprise Harold. When he showed her
13298: the copy of the legal opinion which Jermyn had left with him, she said
13299: she knew it very well; she had a copy herself. The particulars of that
13300: last lawsuit were too well engraven on her mind: it happened at a time
13301: when there was no one to supersede her, and she was the virtual head of
13302: the family affairs. She was prepared to understand how the estate might
13303: be in danger; but nothing had prepared her for the strange details--for
13304: the way in which the new claimant had been reared and brought within the
13305: range of converging motives that had led to this revelation, least of
13306: all for the part Jermyn had come to play in the revelation. Mrs.
13307: Transome saw these things through the medium of certain dominant
13308: emotions that made them seem like a long-ripening retribution. Harold
13309: perceived that she was painfully agitated, that she trembled, and that
13310: her white lips would not readily lend themselves to speech. And this
13311: was hardly more than he expected. He had not liked the revelation
13312: himself when it had first come to him.
13313: 
13314: But he did not guess what it was in his narrative which had most pierced
13315: his mother. It was something that made the threat about the estate only
13316: a secondary alarm. Now, for the first time, she heard of the intended
13317: proceedings against Jermyn. Harold had not chosen to speak of them
13318: before; but having at last called his mother into consultation, there
13319: was nothing in his mind to hinder him from speaking without reserve of
13320: his determination to visit on the attorney his shameful
13321: maladministration of the family affairs.
13322: 
13323: Harold went through the whole narrative--of what he called Jermyn's
13324: scheme to catch him in a vise, and his power of triumphantly frustrating
13325: that scheme--in his usual rapid way, speaking with a final decisiveness
13326: of tone; and his mother felt that if she urged any counter-consideration
13327: at all, she could only do so when he had no more to say.
13328: 
13329: "Now, what I want you to do, mother, if you can see this matter as I see
13330: it," Harold said in conclusion, "is to go with me to call on this girl
13331: in Malthouse Yard. I will open the affair to her; it appears she is not
13332: likely to have been informed yet; and you will invite her to visit you
13333: here at once, that all scandal, all hatching of law-mischief, may be
13334: avoided, and the thing may be brought to an amicable conclusion."
13335: 
13336: "It seems almost incredible--extraordinary--a girl in her position,"
13337: said Mrs. Transome, with difficulty. It would have seemed the bitterest,
13338: humiliating penance if another sort of suffering had left any room in
13339: her heart.
13340: 
13341: "I assure you she is a lady; I saw her when I was canvassing, and was
13342: amazed at the time. You will be quite struck with her. It is no
13343: indignity for you to invite her."
13344: 
13345: "Oh," said Mrs. Transome, with low-toned bitterness, "I must put up with
13346: all things as they are determined for me. When shall we go?"
13347: 
13348: "Well," said Harold, looking at his watch, "it is hardly two yet. We
13349: could really go to-day, when you have lunched. It is better to lose no
13350: time. I'll order the carriage."
13351: 
13352: "Stay," said Mrs. Transome, with a desperate effort. "There is plenty of
13353: time. I shall not lunch. I have a word to say."
13354: 
13355: Harold withdrew his hand from the bell, and leaned against the
13356: mantelpiece to listen.
13357: 
13358: "You see I comply with your wish at once, Harold?"
13359: 
13360: "Yes, mother, I'm much obliged to you for making no difficulties."
13361: 
13362: "You ought to listen to me in return."
13363: 
13364: "Pray go on," said Harold, expecting to be annoyed.
13365: 
13366: "What is the good of having these Chancery proceedings against Jermyn?"
13367: 
13368: "Good? This good: that fellow has burdened the estate with annuities and
13369: mortgages to the extent of three thousand a year; and the bulk of them,
13370: I am certain, he holds himself under the name of another man. And the
13371: advances this yearly interest represents, have not been much more than
13372: twenty thousand. Of course, he has hoodwinked you, and my father never
13373: gave attention to these things. He has been up to all sorts of devil's
13374: work with the deeds; he didn't count on my coming back from Smyrna to
13375: fill poor Durfey's place. He shall feel the difference. And the good
13376: will be, that I shall save almost all the annuities for the rest of my
13377: father's life, which may be ten years or more, and I shall get back some
13378: of the money, and I shall punish a scoundrel. That is the good."
13379: 
13380: "He will be ruined."
13381: 
13382: "That's what I intend," said Harold, sharply.
13383: 
13384: "He exerted himself a great deal for us in the old suits: everyone said
13385: he had wonderful zeal and ability," said Mrs. Transome, getting courage
13386: and warmth, as she went on. Her temper was rising.
13387: 
13388: "What he did, he did for his own sake, you may depend on that," said
13389: Harold, with a scornful laugh.
13390: 
13391: "There were very painful things in that last suit. You seem anxious
13392: about this young woman, to avoid all further scandal and contests in the
13393: family. Why don't you wish to do it in this case? Jermyn might be
13394: willing to arrange things amicably--to make restitution as far as he
13395: can--if he has done anything wrong."
13396: 
13397: "I will arrange nothing amicably with him," said Harold, decisively. "If
13398: he has ever done anything scandalous as our agent, let him bear the
13399: infamy. And the right way to throw the infamy on him is to show the
13400: world that he has robbed us, and that I mean to punish him. Why do you
13401: wish to shield such a fellow, mother? It has been chiefly through him
13402: that you have had to lead such a thrifty, miserable life--you who used
13403: to make as brilliant a figure as a woman need wish."
13404: 
13405: Mrs. Transome's rising temper was turned into a horrible sensation, as
13406: painful as a sudden concussion from something hard and immovable when we
13407: have struck out with our fist, intending to hit something warm, soft,
13408: and breathing like ourselves. Poor Mrs. Transome's strokes were sent
13409: jarring back on her by a hard unalterable past. She did not speak in
13410: answer to Harold, but rose from the chair as if she gave up the debate.
13411: 
13412: "Women are frightened at everything I know," said Harold, kindly,
13413: feeling that he had been a little harsh after his mother's compliance.
13414: "And you have been used for so many years to think Jermyn a law of
13415: nature. Come, mother," he went on, looking at her gently, and resting
13416: his hands on her shoulders, "look cheerful. We shall get through all
13417: these difficulties. And this girl--I dare say she will be quite an
13418: interesting visitor for you. You have not had any young girl about you
13419: for a long while. Who knows? she may fall deeply in love with me, and I
13420: may be obliged to marry her."
13421: 
13422: He spoke laughingly, only thinking how he could make his mother smile.
13423: But she looked at him seriously and said, "Do you mean that, Harold?"
13424: 
13425: "Am I not capable of making a conquest? Not too fat yet--a handsome,
13426: well-rounded youth of thirty-four?"
13427: 
13428: She was forced to look straight at the beaming face, with its rich dark
13429: color, just bent a little over her. Why could she not be happy in this
13430: son whose future she had once dreamed of, and who had been as fortunate
13431: as she had ever hoped? The tears came, not plenteously, but making her
13432: dark eyes as large and bright as youth had once made them without tears.
13433: 
13434: "There, there!" said Harold, coaxingly. "Don't be afraid. You shall not
13435: have a daughter-in-law unless she is a pearl. Now we will get ready to
13436: go."
13437: 
13438: In half an hour from that time Mrs. Transome came down, looking majestic
13439: in sables and velvet, ready to call on "the girl in Malthouse Yard." She
13440: had composed herself to go through this task. She saw there was nothing
13441: better to be done. After the resolutions Harold had taken, some sort of
13442: compromise with this oddly-placed heiress was the result most to be
13443: hoped for; if the compromise turned out to be a marriage--well, she had
13444: no reason to care much: she was already powerless. It remained to be
13445: seen what this girl was.
13446: 
13447: The carriage was to be driven round the back way, to avoid too much
13448: observation. But the late election affairs might account for Mr. Lyon's
13449: receiving a visit from the unsuccessful Radical candidate.
13450:

13453: 
13454: CHAPTER XXXVII.
13455: 
13456:     I also could speak as ye do; if your soul were in my soul's stead,
13457:     I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at
13458:     you.--_Book of Job._
13459: 
13460: 
13461: In the interval since Esther parted with Felix Holt on the day of the
13462: riot, she had gone through so much emotion, and had already had so
13463: strong a shock of surprise, that she was prepared to receive any new
13464: incident of an unwonted kind with comparative equanimity.
13465: 
13466: When Mr. Lyon had got home again from his preaching excursion, Felix was
13467: already on his way to Loamford Jail. The little minister was terribly
13468: shaken by the news. He saw no clear explanation of Felix Holt's conduct;
13469: for the statements Esther had heard were so conflicting that she had not
13470: been able to gather distinctly what had come out in the examination by
13471: the magistrates. But Mr. Lyon felt confident that Felix was innocent of
13472: any wish to abet a riot or the infliction of injuries; what he chiefly
13473: feared was that in the fatal encounter with Tucker he had been moved by
13474: a rash temper, not sufficiently guarded against by a prayerful and
13475: humble spirit.
13476: 
13477: "My poor young friend is being taught with mysterious severity the evil
13478: of a too confident self-reliance," he said to Esther, as they sat
13479: opposite to each other, listening and speaking sadly.
13480: 
13481: "You will go and see him, father?"
13482: 
13483: "Verily will I. But I must straightway go and see that poor afflicted
13484: woman, whose soul is doubtless whirled about in this trouble like a
13485: shapeless and unstable thing driven by divided winds." Mr. Lyon rose and
13486: took his hat hastily, ready to walk out, with his greatcoat flying open
13487: and exposing his small person to the keen air.
13488: 
13489: "Stay, father, pray, till you have had some food," said Esther, putting
13490: her hand on his arm. "You look quite weary and shattered."
13491: 
13492: "Child, I cannot stay. I can neither eat bread nor drink water till I
13493: have learned more about this young man's deeds, what can be proved and
13494: what cannot be proved against him. I fear he has none to stand by him in
13495: this town, for even by the friends of our church I have been ofttimes
13496: rebuked because he seemed dear to me. But, Esther, my beloved child----"
13497: 
13498: Here Mr. Lyon grasped her arm, and seemed in the need of speech to
13499: forget his previous haste. "I bear in mind this: the Lord knoweth them
13500: that are His; but we--we are left to judge by uncertain signs, that so
13501: we may learn to exercise hope and faith toward one another; and in this
13502: uncertainty I cling with awful hope to those whom the world loves not
13503: because their conscience, albeit mistakenly, is at war with the habits
13504: of the world. Our great faith, my Esther, is the faith of martyrs: I
13505: will not lightly turn away from any man who endures harshness because he
13506: will not lie; nay, though I would not wantonly grasp at ease of mind
13507: through an arbitrary choice of doctrine, I cannot but believe that the
13508: merits of the Divine Sacrifice are wider than our utmost charity. I once
13509: believed otherwise--but not now, not now."
13510: 
13511: The minister paused, and seemed to be abstractedly gazing at some
13512: memory: he was always liable to be snatched away by thoughts from the
13513: pursuit of a purpose which had seemed pressing. Esther seized the
13514: opportunity and prevailed on him to fortify himself with some of Lyddy's
13515: porridge before he went out on his tiring task of seeking definite
13516: trustworthy knowledge from the lips of various witnesses, beginning with
13517: that feminine darkener of counsel, poor Mrs. Holt.
13518: 
13519: She, regarding all her trouble about Felix in the light of a fulfilment
13520: of her own prophecies, treated the sad history with a preference for
13521: edification above accuracy, and for mystery above relevance, worthy of a
13522: commentator on the Apocalypse. She insisted chiefly, not on the
13523: important facts that Felix had sat at his work till after eleven, like a
13524: deaf man, had rushed out in surprise and alarm, had come back to report
13525: with satisfaction that things were quiet, and had asked her to set by
13526: his dinner for him--facts which would tell as evidence that Felix was
13527: disconnected with any project of disturbances, and was averse to them.
13528: These things came out incidentally in her long plaint to the minister;
13529: but what Mrs. Holt felt it essential to state was, that long before
13530: Michaelmas was turned, sitting in her chair, she had said to Felix that
13531: there would be a judgment on him for being so certain sure about the
13532: Pills and the Elixir.
13533: 
13534: "And now, Mr. Lyon," said the poor woman, who had dressed herself in a
13535: gown previously cast off, a front all out of curl, and a cap with no
13536: starch in it, while she held little coughing Job on her knee,--"and now
13537: you see--my words have come true sooner than I thought they would. Felix
13538: may contradict me if he will; but there he is in prison, and here am I,
13539: with nothing in the world to bless myself with but half-a-crown a-week
13540: as I've saved by my own scraping, and this house I've got to pay rent
13541: for. It's not me has done wrong, Mr. Lyon; there's nobody can say it of
13542: me--not the orphan child on my knee is more innicent o' riot and murder
13543: and anything else as is bad. But when you've got a son so masterful and
13544: stopping medicines as Providence has sent, and his betters have been
13545: taking up and down the country since before he was a baby, it's o' no
13546: use being good here below. But he _was_ a baby, Mr. Lyon, and I gave him
13547: the breast,"--here poor Mrs. Holt's motherly love over-came her
13548: expository eagerness, and she fell more and more to crying as she
13549: spoke--"And to think there's folks saying now as he'll be transported,
13550: and his hair shaved off, and the treadmill, and everything. Oh, dear!"
13551: 
13552: As Mrs. Holt broke off into sobbing, little Job also, who had got a
13553: confused yet profound sense of sorrow, and of Felix being hurt and gone
13554: away, set up a little wail of wondering misery.
13555: 
13556: "Nay, Mistress Holt," said the minister, soothingly, "enlarge not your
13557: grief by more than warrantable grounds. I have good hope that my young
13558: friend, your son, will be delivered from any severe consequences beyond
13559: the death of the man Tucker, which I fear will ever be a sore burden on
13560: his memory. I feel confident that a jury of his country-men will
13561: discern between misfortune, or it may be misjudgment, and an evil will,
13562: and that he will be acquitted of any grave offence."
13563: 
13564: "He never stole anything in his life, Mr. Lyon," said Mrs. Holt,
13565: reviving. "Nobody can throw it in my face as my son ran away with money
13566: like the young man at the bank--though he looked most respectable, and
13567: far different on a Sunday to what Felix ever did. And I know it's very
13568: hard fighting with constables; but they say Tucker's wife'll be a deal
13569: better off than she was before, for the great folks'll pension her, and
13570: she'll be put on all the charities, and her children at the Free School,
13571: and everything. Your trouble's easy borne when everybody gives it a lift
13572: for you; and if judge and jury wants to do right by Felix, they'll think
13573: of his poor mother, with the bread took out of her mouth, all but
13574: half-a-crown a-week and furniture--which, to be sure, is most excellent,
13575: and of my own buying--and got to keep this orphin child as Felix himself
13576: brought on me. And I might send him back to his old grandfather on
13577: parish pay, but I'm not that woman, Mr. Lyon; I've a tender heart. And
13578: here's his little feet and toes, like marbil; do but look"--here Mrs.
13579: Holt drew off Job's sock and shoe, and showed a well-washed little
13580: foot--"and you'll perhaps say I might take a lodger; but it's easy
13581: talking; it isn't everybody at a loose-end wants a parlor and a bedroom;
13582: and if anything bad happens to Felix, I may as well go and sit in the
13583: parish pound, and nobody to buy me out; for it's beyond everything how
13584: the church members find fault with my son. But I think they might leave
13585: his mother to find fault; for queer and masterful he might be, and
13586: flying in the face of the very Scripture about the physic, but he was
13587: most clever beyond anything--that I _will_ say--and was his own father's
13588: lawful child, and me his mother, that was Mary Wall thirty years before
13589: ever I married his father." Here Mrs. Holt's feelings again became too
13590: much for her, but she struggled on to say, sobbingly, "And if they're to
13591: transport him, I should like to go to the prison and take the orphin
13592: child; for he was most fond of having him on his lap, and said he'd
13593: never marry; and there was One above overheard him, for he's been took
13594: at his word."
13595: 
13596: Mr. Lyon listened with low groans, and then tried to comfort her by
13597: saying that he would himself go to Loamford as soon as possible, and
13598: would give his soul no rest till he had done all he could do for Felix.
13599: 
13600: On one point Mrs. Holt's plaint tallied with his own forebodings, and he
13601: found them verified: the state of feeling in Treby among the Liberal
13602: Dissenting flock was unfavorable to Felix. None who had observed his
13603: conduct from the windows saw anything tending to excuse him, and his own
13604: account of his motives, given on his examination, was spoken of with
13605: head-shaking; if it had not been for his habit of always thinking
13606: himself wiser than other people, he would never have entertained such a
13607: wild scheme. He had set himself up for something extraordinary, and had
13608: spoken ill of respectable trades-people. He had put a stop to the making
13609: of saleable drugs, contrary to the nature of buying and selling, and to
13610: a due reliance on what Providence might effect in the human inside
13611: through the instrumentality of remedies unsuitable to the stomach,
13612: looked at in a merely secular light; and the result was what might have
13613: been expected. He had brought his mother to poverty, and himself into
13614: trouble. And what for? He had done no good to "the cause"; if he had
13615: fought about Church-rates, or had been worsted in some struggle in which
13616: he was distinctly the champion of Dissent and Liberalism, his case would
13617: have been one for gold, silver, and copper subscriptions, in order to
13618: procure the best defence; sermons might have been preached on him, and
13619: his name might have floated on flags from Newcastle to Dorchester. But
13620: there seemed to be no edification in what had befallen Felix. The riot
13621: at Treby, "turn it which way you would," as Mr. Muscat observed, was no
13622: great credit to Liberalism; and what Mr. Lyon had to testify as to Felix
13623: Holt's conduct in the matter of the Sproxton men, only made it clear
13624: that the defence of Felix was the accusation of his party. The whole
13625: affair, Mr. Nuttwood said, was dark and inscrutable, and seemed not to
13626: be one in which the interference of God's servants would tend to give
13627: the glory where the glory was due. That a candidate for whom the richer
13628: church members had all voted should have his name associated with the
13629: encouragement of drunkenness, riot, and plunder, was an occasion for the
13630: enemy to blaspheme; and it was not clear how the enemy's mouth would be
13631: stopped by exertions in favor of a rash young man, whose interference
13632: had made things worse instead of better. Mr. Lyon was warned lest his
13633: human partialities should blind him to the interests of truth: it was
13634: God's cause that was endangered in this matter.
13635: 
13636: The little minister's soul was bruised; he himself was keenly alive to
13637: the complication of public and private regards in this affair, and
13638: suffered a good deal at the thought of Tory triumph in the demonstration
13639: that, excepting the attack on the Seven Stars, which called itself a
13640: Whig house, all damage to property had been borne by Tories. He cared
13641: intensely for his opinions, and would have liked events to speak for
13642: them in a sort of picture-writing that everybody could understand. The
13643: enthusiasms of the world are not to be stimulated by a commentary in
13644: small and subtle characters which alone can tell the whole truth; and
13645: the picture writing in Felix Holt's troubles was of an entirely puzzling
13646: kind: if he were a martyr, neither side wanted to claim him. Yet the
13647: minister, as we have seen, found in his Christian faith a reason for
13648: clinging the more to one who had not a large party to back him. That
13649: little man's heart was heroic; he was not one of those Liberals who make
13650: their anxiety for "the cause" of Liberalism a plea for cowardly
13651: desertion.
13652: 
13653: Besides himself, he believed there was no one who could bear testimony
13654: to the remonstrances of Felix concerning the treating of the Sproxton
13655: men, except Jermyn, Johnson, and Harold Transome. Though he had the
13656: vaguest idea of what could be done in the case, he fixed his mind on the
13657: probability that Mr. Transome would be moved to the utmost exertion, if
13658: only as an atonement; but he dared not take any step until he had
13659: consulted Felix, who he foresaw was likely to have a very strong
13660: determination as to the help he would accept or not accept.
13661: 
13662: This last expectation was fulfilled. Mr. Lyon returned to Esther, after
13663: his day's journey to Loamford and back, with less of trouble and
13664: perplexity in his mind: he had at least got a definite course marked
13665: out, to which he must resign himself. Felix had declared that he would
13666: receive no aid from Harold Transome, except the aid he might give as an
13667: honest witness. There was nothing to be done for him but what was
13668: perfectly simple and direct. Even if the pleading of counsel had been
13669: permitted (and at that time it was not) on behalf of a prisoner on trial
13670: for felony, Felix would have declined it: he would in any case have
13671: spoken in his own defence. He had a perfectly simple account to give,
13672: and needed not to avail himself of any legal adroitness. He consented to
13673: accept the services of a respectable solicitor in Loamford, who offered
13674: to conduct his case without any fees. The work was plain and easy, Felix
13675: said. The only witnesses who had to be hunted up at all were some who
13676: could testify that he had tried to take the crowd down Hobb's Lane, and
13677: that they had gone to the Manor in spite of him.
13678: 
13679: "Then he is not so much cast down as you feared, father?" said Esther.
13680: 
13681: "No, child; albeit he is pale and much shaken for one so stalwart. He
13682: hath no grief, he says, save for the poor man Tucker, and for his
13683: mother; otherwise his heart is without a burden. We discoursed greatly
13684: on the sad effect of all this for his mother, and on the perplexed
13685: condition of human things, whereby even right action seems to bring evil
13686: consequences, if we have respect only to our own brief lives, and not to
13687: that larger rule whereby we are stewards of the eternal dealings, and
13688: not contrivers of our own success."
13689: 
13690: "Did he say nothing about me, father?" said Esther, trembling a little,
13691: but unable to repress her egoism.
13692: 
13693: "Yes; he asked if you were well, and sent his affectionate regards. Nay,
13694: he bade me say something which appears to refer to your discourse
13695: together when I was not present. 'Tell her,' he said, 'whatever they
13696: sentence me to, she knows they can't rob me of my vocation. With poverty
13697: for my bride, and preaching and pedagoguy for my business, I am sure of
13698: a handsome establishment.' He laughed--doubtless bearing in mind some
13699: playfulness of thine."
13700: 
13701: Mr. Lyon seemed to be looking at Esther as he smiled, but she was not
13702: near enough for him to discern the expression of her face. Just then it
13703: seemed made for melancholy rather than for playfulness. Hers was not a
13704: childish beauty; and when the sparkle of mischief, wit and vanity was
13705: out of her eyes, and the large look of abstracted sorrow was there, you
13706: would have been surprised by a certain grandeur which the smiles had
13707: hidden. That changing face was the perfect symbol of her mixed
13708: susceptible nature, in which battle was inevitable, and the side of
13709: victory uncertain.
13710: 
13711: She began to look on all that had passed between herself and Felix as
13712: something not buried, but embalmed and kept as a relic in a private
13713: sanctuary. The very entireness of her preoccupation about him, the
13714: perpetual repetition in her memory of all that had passed between them,
13715: tended to produce this effect. She lived with him in the past; in the
13716: future she seemed shut out from him. He was an influence above her life,
13717: rather than a part of it; some time or other, perhaps, he would be to
13718: her as if he belonged to the solemn admonishing skies, checking her
13719: self-satisfied pettiness with the suggestion of a wider life.
13720: 
13721: But not yet--not while her trouble was so fresh. For it was still _her_
13722: trouble, and not Felix Holt's. Perhaps it was a subtraction from his
13723: power over her, that she could never think of him with pity, because he
13724: always seemed to her too great and strong to be pitied; he wanted
13725: nothing. He evaded calamity by choosing privation. The best part of a
13726: woman's love is worship; but it is hard to her to be sent away with her
13727: precious spikenard rejected, and her long tresses too, that were let
13728: fall ready to soothe the wearied feet.
13729: 
13730: While Esther was carrying these things in her heart, the January days
13731: were beginning to pass by with their wonted wintry monotony, except that
13732: there was rather more of good cheer than usual remaining from the feast
13733: of Twelfth Night among the triumphant Tories, and rather more scandal
13734: than usual excited among the mortified Dissenters by the wilfulness of
13735: their minister. He had actually mentioned Felix Holt by name in his
13736: evening sermon, and offered up a petition for him in the evening prayer,
13737: also by name--not as "a young Ishmaelite, whom he would fain see brought
13738: back from the lawless life of the desert, and seated in the same fold
13739: even with the sons of Judah and of Benjamin," a suitable periphrasis
13740: which Brother Kemp threw off without any effort, and with all the
13741: felicity of a suggestive critic. Poor Mrs. Holt, indeed, even in the
13742: midst of her grief, experienced a proud satisfaction; that though she
13743: was not a church member she was now an object of congregational remark
13744: and ministerial allusion. Feeling herself a spotless character standing
13745: out in relief on a dark background of affliction, and a practical
13746: contradiction to that extreme doctrine of human depravity which she had
13747: never "given in to," she was naturally gratified and soothed by a notice
13748: which must be a recognition. But more influential hearers were of
13749: opinion, that in a man who had so many long sentences at command as Mr.
13750: Lyon, so many parentheses and modifying clauses, this naked use of a
13751: non-scriptural Treby name in an address to the Almighty was all the more
13752: offensive. In a low unlettered local preacher of the Wesleyan persuasion
13753: such things might pass; but a certain style in prayer was demanded from
13754: Independents, the most educated body in the ranks of orthodox Dissent.
13755: To Mr. Lyon such notions seemed painfully perverse, and the next morning
13756: he was declaring to Esther his resolution stoutly to withstand them, and
13757: to count nothing common or unclean on which a blessing could be asked,
13758: when the tenor of his thoughts was completely changed by a great shock
13759: of surprise which made both himself and Esther sit looking at each other
13760: in speechless amazement.
13761: 
13762: The cause was a letter brought by a special messenger from Duffield; a
13763: heavy letter addressed to Esther in a business-like manner, quite
13764: unexampled in her correspondence. And the contents of the letter were
13765: more startling than its exterior. It began:
13766: 
13767:     MADAM,--Herewith we send you a brief abstract of evidence which has
13768:     come within our knowledge, that the right of remainder whereby the
13769:     lineal issue of Edward Bycliffe can claim possession of the estates
13770:     of which the entail was settled by John Justus Transome in 1729,
13771:     now first accrues to you as the sole and lawful issue of Maurice
13772:     Christian Bycliffe. We are confident of success in the prosecution
13773:     of this claim, which will result to you in the possession of
13774:     estates to the value, at the lowest, of from five to six thousand
13775:     per annum----
13776: 
13777: It was at this point that Esther, who was reading aloud, let her hand
13778: fall with the letter on her lap, and with a palpitating heart looked at
13779: her father, who looked again in silence that lasted for two or three
13780: minutes. A certain terror was upon them both, though the thoughts that
13781: laid that weight on the tongue of each were different.
13782: 
13783: It was Mr. Lyon who spoke first.
13784: 
13785: "This, then, is what the man named Christian referred to. I distrusted
13786: him, yet it seems he spoke truly."
13787: 
13788: "But," said Esther, whose imagination ran necessarily to those
13789: conditions of wealth which she could best appreciate, "Do they mean that
13790: the Transomes would be turned out of Transome Court, and that I should
13791: go and live there? It seems quite an impossible thing."
13792: 
13793: "Nay, child, I know not. I am ignorant in these things, and the thought
13794: of worldly grandeur for you hath more of terror than of gladness for me.
13795: Nevertheless we must duly weigh all things, not considering aught that
13796: befalls us as a bare event, but rather as an occasion for faithful
13797: stewardship. Let us go to my study and consider this writing further."
13798: 
13799: How this announcement, which to Esther seemed as unprepared as if it had
13800: fallen from the skies, came to be made to her by solicitors other than
13801: Batt & Cowley, the old lawyers of the Bycliffes, was by a sequence as
13802: natural, that is to say, as legally natural, as any in the world. The
13803: secret worker of the apparent wonder was Mr. Johnson, who, on the very
13804: day when he wrote to give his patron, Mr. Jermyn, the serious warning
13805: that a bill was likely to be filed in Chancery against him, had carried
13806: forward with added zeal the business already commenced, of arranging
13807: with another firm his share in the profits likely to result from the
13808: prosecution of Esther Bycliffe's claim.
13809: 
13810: Jermyn's star was certainly going down, and Johnson did not feel an
13811: unmitigated grief. Beyond some troublesome declarations as to his actual
13812: share in transactions in which his name had been used, Johnson saw
13813: nothing formidable in prospect for himself. He was not going to be
13814: ruined, though Jermyn probably was: he was not a high-flyer, but a mere
13815: climbing-bird, who could hold on and get his livelihood just as well if
13816: his wings were clipped a little. And, in the meantime, here was
13817: something to be gained in this Bycliffe business, which, it was not
13818: unpleasant to think, was a nut that Jermyn had intended to keep for his
13819: own particular cracking, and which would be rather a severe astonishment
13820: to Mr. Harold Transome, whose manners towards respectable agents were
13821: such as leave a smart in a man of spirit.
13822: 
13823: Under the stimulus of small many-mixed motives like these, a great deal
13824: of business has been done in the world by well-clad and, in 1833,
13825: clean-shaven men, whose names are on charity lists, and who do not know
13826: that they are base. Mr. Johnson's character was not much more
13827: exceptional than his double chin.
13828: 
13829: No system, religious or political, I believe, has laid it down as a
13830: principle that all men are alike virtuous, or even that all the people
13831: rated for £80 houses are an honor to their species.
13832: 
13833: 
13834: 
13835: 
13836: CHAPTER XXXVIII.
13837: 
13838:     The down we rest on in our aëry dreams
13839:     Has not been plucked from birds that live and smart;
13840:     'Tis but warm snow, that melts not.
13841: 
13842: 
13843: The story and the prospect revealed to Esther by the lawyer's letter,
13844: which she and her father studied together, had made an impression on her
13845: very different from what she had been used to figure to herself in her
13846: many day-dreams as to the effect of a sudden elevation in rank and
13847: fortune. In her day-dreams she had not traced out the means by which
13848: such a change could be brought about; in fact, the change had seemed
13849: impossible to her, except in her little private Utopia, which, like
13850: other Utopias, was filled with delightful results, independent of
13851: processes. But her mind had fixed itself habitually on the signs and
13852: luxuries of ladyhood, for which she had the keenest perception. She had
13853: seen the very mat in her carriage, had scented the dried rose-leaves in
13854: her corridors, had felt the soft carpet under her pretty feet, and seen
13855: herself, as she rose from her sofa cushions, in the crystal panel that
13856: reflected a long drawing-room, where the conservatory flowers and the
13857: pictures of fair women left her still with the supremacy of charm. She
13858: had trodden the marble-firm gravel of her garden-walks and the soft deep
13859: turf of her lawn; she had had her servants about her filled with adoring
13860: respect, because of her kindness as well as her grace and beauty; but
13861: she had had several accomplished cavaliers all at once sueing for her
13862: hand--one of whom, uniting very high birth with long dark eyelashes and
13863: the most distinguished talents, she secretly preferred, though his pride
13864: and hers hindered an avowal, and supplied the inestimable interest of
13865: retardation. The glimpses she had had in her brief life as a family
13866: governess, supplied her ready faculty with details enough of delightful
13867: still life to furnish her day-dreams; and no one who has not, like
13868: Esther, a strong natural prompting and susceptibility toward such
13869: things, and has at the same time suffered from the presence of opposite
13870: conditions, can understand how powerfully those minor accidents of rank
13871: which please the fastidious sense can preoccupy the imagination.
13872: 
13873: It seemed that almost everything in her day-dreams--cavaliers
13874: apart--must be found at Transome Court. But now that fancy was becoming
13875: real, and the impossible appeared possible, Esther found the balance of
13876: her attention reversed: now that her ladyhood was not simply in Utopia,
13877: she found herself arrested and painfully grasped by the means through
13878: which the ladyhood was to be obtained. To her inexperience this strange
13879: story of an alienated inheritance, of such a last representative of
13880: pure-blooded lineage as old Thomas Transome the bill-sticker, above all
13881: of the dispossession hanging over those who actually held, and had
13882: expected always to hold, the wealth and position which were suddenly
13883: announced to be rightly hers--all these things made a picture, not for
13884: her own tastes and fancies to float in with Elysian indulgence, but in
13885: which she was compelled to gaze on the degrading hard experience of
13886: other human beings, and on a humiliating loss which was the obverse of
13887: her own proud gain. Even in her times of most untroubled egoism, Esther
13888: shrank from anything ungenerous; and the fact that she had a very lively
13889: image of Harold Transome and his gypsy-eyed boy in her mind, gave
13890: additional distinctness to the thought that if she entered they must
13891: depart. Of the elder Transomes she had a dimmer vision, and they were
13892: necessarily in the background to her sympathy.
13893: 
13894: She and her father sat with their hands locked, as they might have done
13895: if they had been listening to a solemn oracle in the days of old
13896: revealing unknown kinship and rightful heirdom. It was not that Esther
13897: had any thought of renouncing her fortune; she was incapable, in these
13898: moments, of condensing her vague ideas and feelings into any distinct
13899: plan of action, nor indeed did it seem that she was called upon to act
13900: with any promptitude. It was only that she was conscious of being
13901: strangely awed by something that was called good fortune; and the awe
13902: shut out any scheme of rejection as much as any triumphant joy in
13903: acceptance. Her father, she learned, had died disappointed and in
13904: wrongful imprisonment, and an undefined sense of Nemesis seemed half to
13905: sanctify her inheritance, and counteract its apparent arbitrariness.
13906: 
13907: Felix Holt was present in her mind throughout; what he would say was an
13908: imaginary commentary that she was constantly framing, and the words that
13909: she most frequently gave him--for she dramatized under the inspiration
13910: of a sadness slightly bitter--were of this kind: "That is clearly your
13911: destiny--to be aristocratic, to be rich. I always saw that our lots lay
13912: widely apart. You are not fit for poverty, or any work of difficulty.
13913: But remember what I once said to you about a vision of consequences;
13914: take care where your fortune leads you."
13915: 
13916: Her father had not spoken since they had ended their study and
13917: discussion of the story and the evidence as it was presented to them.
13918: Into this he had entered with his usual penetrating activity; but he was
13919: so accustomed to the impersonal study of narrative, that even in these
13920: exceptional moments the habit of half a century asserted itself, and he
13921: seemed sometimes not to distinguish the case of Esther's inheritance
13922: from a story in ancient history, until some detail recalled him to the
13923: profound feeling that a great, great change might be coming over the
13924: life of this child who was so close to him. At last he relapsed into
13925: total silence, and for some time Esther was not moved to interrupt it.
13926: He had sunk back in his chair with his hand locked in hers, and was
13927: pursuing a sort of prayerful meditation: he lifted up no formal
13928: petition, but it was as if his soul travelled again over the facts he
13929: had been considering in the company of a guide ready to inspire and
13930: correct him. He was striving to purify his feeling in this matter from
13931: selfish or worldly dross--a striving which is that prayer without
13932: ceasing, sure to wrest an answer by its sublime importunity.
13933: 
13934: There is no knowing how long they might have sat in this way, if it had
13935: not been for the inevitable Lyddy reminding them dismally of dinner.
13936: 
13937: "Yes, Lyddy, we come," said Esther: and then, before moving--
13938: 
13939: "Is there any advice you have in your mind for me, father?" The sense of
13940: awe was growing in Esther. Her intensest life was no longer in her
13941: dreams, where she made things to her own mind: she was moving in a world
13942: charged with forces.
13943: 
13944: "Not yet, my dear--save this; that you will seek special illumination in
13945: this juncture, and, above all, be watchful that your soul be not lifted
13946: up within you by what, rightly considered, is rather an increase of
13947: charge, and a call upon you to walk along a path which is indeed easy to
13948: the flesh, but dangerous to the spirit."
13949: 
13950: "You would always live with me, father?" Esther said, under a strong
13951: impulse--partly affection, partly the need to grasp at some moral help.
13952: But she had no sooner uttered the words than they raised a vision,
13953: showing, as by a flash of lightning, the incongruity of that past which
13954: had created the sanctities and affections of her life with that future
13955: which was coming to her----The little rusty old minister, with the one
13956: luxury of his Sunday evening pipe, smoked up the kitchen chimney, coming
13957: to live in the midst of grandeur----but no! her father, with the
13958: grandeur of his past sorrow and his long struggling labors, forsaking
13959: his vocation, and vulgarly accepting an existence unsuited to
13960: him.----Esther's face flushed with the excitement of this vision and its
13961: reversed interpretation, which five months ago she would have been
13962: incapable of seeing. Her question to her father seemed like a mockery;
13963: she was ashamed. He answered slowly--
13964: 
13965: "Touch not that chord yet, my child. I must learn to think of thy lot
13966: according to the demands of Providence. We will rest a while from the
13967: subject; and I will seek calmness in my ordinary duties."
13968: 
13969: The next morning nothing more was said. Mr. Lyon was absorbed in his
13970: sermon-making, for it was near the end of the week, and Esther was
13971: obliged to attend to her pupils. Mrs. Holt came by invitation with
13972: little Job to share their dinner of roast-meat; and, after much of what
13973: the minister called unprofitable discourse, she was quitting the house
13974: when she hastened back with an astonished face, to tell Mr. Lyon and
13975: Esther, who were already in wonder at crashing, thundering sounds on the
13976: pavement, that there was a carriage stopping and stamping at the entry
13977: into Malthouse Yard, with "all sorts of fine liveries," and a lady and
13978: gentleman inside. Mr. Lyon and Esther looked at each other, both having
13979: the same name in their minds.
13980: 
13981: "If it's Mr. Transome or somebody else as is great, Mr. Lyon," urged
13982: Mrs. Holt, "you'll remember my son, and say he's got a mother with a
13983: character they may enquire into as much as they like. And never mind
13984: what Felix says, for he's so masterful he'd stay in prison and be
13985: transported whether or no, only to have his own way. For it's not to be
13986: thought but what the great people could get him off if they would; and
13987: it's very hard with a King in the country and all the texts in Proverbs
13988: about the King's countenance, and Solomon and the live baby----"
13989: 
13990: Mr. Lyon lifted up his hand deprecatingly, and Mrs. Holt retreated from
13991: the parlor-door to a corner of the kitchen, the outer doorway being
13992: occupied by Dominic, who was enquiring if Mr. and Miss Lyon were at
13993: home, and could receive Mrs. Transome and Mr. Harold Transome. While
13994: Dominic went back to the carriage Mrs. Holt escaped with her tiny
13995: companion to Zachary's, the new pew-opener, observing to Lyddy that she
13996: knew herself, and was not that woman to stay where she might not be
13997: wanted; whereupon Lyddy, differing fundamentally, admonished her parting
13998: ear that it was well if she knew herself to be dust and ashes--silently
13999: extending the application of this remark to Mrs. Transome, as she saw
14000: the tall lady sweep in arrayed in her rich black and fur, with that fine
14001: gentleman behind her whose thick top-knot of wavy hair, sparkling ring,
14002: dark complexion, and general air of worldly exaltation unconnected with
14003: chapel, were painfully suggestive to Lyddy of Herod, Pontius Pilate, or
14004: the much-quoted Gallio.
14005: 
14006: Harold Transome, greeting Esther gracefully, presented his mother, whose
14007: eagle-like glance, fixed on her from the first moment of entering,
14008: seemed to Esther to pierce her through. Mrs. Transome hardly noticed Mr.
14009: Lyon, not from studied haughtiness, but from sheer mental inability to
14010: consider him--as a person ignorant of natural history is unable to
14011: consider a fresh-water polyp otherwise than as a sort of animated weed,
14012: certainly not fit for table. But Harold saw that his mother was
14013: agreeably struck by Esther, who indeed showed to much advantage. She was
14014: not at all taken by surprise, and maintained a dignified quietude; but
14015: her previous knowledge and reflection about the possible dispossession
14016: of these Transomes gave her a softened feeling toward them which tinged
14017: her manners very agreeably.
14018: 
14019: Harold was carefully polite to the minister, throwing out a word to make
14020: him understand that he had an important part in the important business
14021: which had brought this unannounced visit; and the four made a group
14022: seated not far off each other near the window, Mrs. Transome and Esther
14023: being on the sofa.
14024: 
14025: "You must be astonished at a visit from me, Miss Lyon," Mrs. Transome
14026: began; "I seldom come to Treby Magna. Now I see you, the visit is an
14027: unexpected pleasure; but the cause of my coming is business of a serious
14028: nature, which my son will communicate to you."
14029: 
14030: "I ought to begin by saying that what I have to announce to you is the
14031: reverse of disagreeable, Miss Lyon," said Harold, with lively ease. "I
14032: don't suppose the world would consider it very good news for me; but a
14033: rejected candidate, Mr. Lyon," Harold went on, turning graciously to the
14034: minister, "begins to be inured to loss and misfortune."
14035: 
14036: "Truly, sir," said Mr. Lyon, with a rather sad solemnity, "your allusion
14037: hath a grievous bearing for me, but I will not retard your present
14038: purpose by further remark."
14039: 
14040: "You will never guess what I have to disclose," said Harold, again
14041: looking at Esther, "unless, indeed, you have already had some previous
14042: intimation of it."
14043: 
14044: "Does it refer to law and inheritance?" said Esther, with a smile. She
14045: was already brightened by Harold's manner. The news seemed to be losing
14046: its chillness, and to be something really belonging to warm,
14047: comfortable, interesting life.
14048: 
14049: "Then you have already heard of it?" said Harold, inwardly vexed, but
14050: sufficiently prepared not to seem so.
14051: 
14052: "Only yesterday," said Esther, quite simply, "I received a letter from
14053: some lawyers with a statement of many surprising things, showing that I
14054: was an heiress"--here she turned very prettily to address Mrs.
14055: Transome--"which, as you may imagine, is one of the last things I could
14056: have supposed myself to be."
14057: 
14058: "My dear," said Mrs. Transome with elderly grace, just laying her hand
14059: for an instant on Esther's, "it is a lot that would become you
14060: admirably."
14061: 
14062: Esther blushed, and said playfully:
14063: 
14064: "Oh, I know what to buy with fifty pounds a-year, but I know the price
14065: of nothing beyond that."
14066: 
14067: Her father sat looking at her through his spectacles, stroking his chin.
14068: It was amazing to herself that she was taking so lightly now what had
14069: caused her such deep emotion yesterday.
14070: 
14071: "I daresay, then," said Harold, "you are more fully possessed of
14072: particulars than I am. So that my mother and I need only tell you what
14073: no one else can tell you--that is, what are her and my feelings and
14074: wishes under these new and unexpected circumstances."
14075: 
14076: "I am most anxious," said Esther, with a grave beautiful look of respect
14077: to Mrs. Transome--"most anxious on that point. Indeed, being of course
14078: in uncertainty about it, I have not yet known whether I could rejoice."
14079: Mrs. Transome's glance had softened. She liked Esther to look at her.
14080: 
14081: "Our chief anxiety," she said, knowing what Harold wished her to say,
14082: "is, that there may be no contest, no useless expenditure of money. Of
14083: course we will surrender what can be rightfully claimed."
14084: 
14085: "My mother expresses our feeling precisely, Miss Lyon," said Harold.
14086: "And I'm sure, Mr. Lyon, you will understand our desire."
14087: 
14088: "Assuredly, sir. My daughter would in any case have had my advice to
14089: seek a conclusion which would involve no strife. We endeavor, sir, in
14090: our body, to hold to the apostolic rule that one Christian brother
14091: should not go to law with another; and I, for my part, would extend this
14092: rule to all my fellow-men, apprehending that the practice of our courts
14093: is little consistent with the simplicity that is in Christ."
14094: 
14095: "If it is to depend on my will," said Esther, "there is nothing that
14096: would be more repugnant to me than any struggle on such a subject. But
14097: can't the lawyers go on doing what they will in spite of me? It seems
14098: that this is what they mean."
14099: 
14100: "Not exactly," said Harold, smiling. "Of course they live by such
14101: struggles as you dislike. But we can thwart them by determining not to
14102: quarrel. It is desirable that we should consider the affair together,
14103: and put it into the hands of honorable solicitors. I assure you we
14104: Transomes will not contend for what is not our own."
14105: 
14106: "And this is what I have come to beg of you," said Mrs. Transome. "It is
14107: that you will come to Transome Court--and let us take full time to
14108: arrange matters. Do oblige me: you shall not be teased more than you
14109: like by an old woman: you shall do just as you please, and become
14110: acquainted with your future home, since it is to be yours. I can tell
14111: you a world of things that you will want to know; and the business can
14112: proceed properly."
14113: 
14114: "Do consent," said Harold, with winning brevity.
14115: 
14116: Esther was flushed and her eyes were bright. It was impossible for her
14117: not to feel that the proposal was a more tempting step toward her change
14118: of condition than she could have thought of beforehand. She had
14119: forgotten that she was in any trouble. But she looked toward her father,
14120: who was again stroking his chin, as was his habit when he was doubting
14121: or deliberating.
14122: 
14123: "I hope you do not disapprove of Miss Lyon's granting us this favor?"
14124: said Harold to the minister.
14125: 
14126: "I have nothing to oppose to it, sir, if my daughter's own mind is clear
14127: as to her course."
14128: 
14129: "You will come--now--with us," said Mrs. Transome, persuasively. "You
14130: will go back with us now in the carriage."
14131: 
14132: Harold was highly gratified with the perfection of his mother's manner
14133: on this occasion, which he had looked forward to as difficult. Since he
14134: had come home again he had never seen her so much at her ease, or with
14135: so much benignancy in her face. The secret lay in the charm of Esther's
14136: sweet young deference, a sort of charm that had not before entered into
14137: Mrs. Transome's elderly life. Esther's pretty behavior, it must be
14138: confessed, was not fed entirely from lofty moral sources: over and above
14139: her really generous feeling, she enjoyed Mrs. Transome's accent, the
14140: high-bred quietness of her speech, the delicate odor of her drapery. She
14141: had always thought that life must be particularly easy if one could pass
14142: it among refined people; and so it seemed at this moment. She wished,
14143: unmixedly, to go to Transome Court.
14144: 
14145: "Since my father has no objection," she said, "and you urge me so
14146: kindly. But I must beg for time to pack up a few clothes."
14147: 
14148: "By all means," said Mrs. Transome. "We are not at all pressed."
14149: 
14150: When Esther had left the room, Harold said, "Apart from our immediate
14151: reason for coming, Mr. Lyon, I could have wished to see you about these
14152: unhappy consequences of the election contest. But you will understand
14153: that I have been much preoccupied with private affairs."
14154: 
14155: "You have well said that the consequences are unhappy, sir. And but for
14156: a reliance on something more than human calculation, I know not which I
14157: should most bewail--the scandal which wrong-dealing has brought on right
14158: principles or the snares which it laid for the feet of a young man who
14159: is dear to me. 'One soweth, and another reapeth,' is a verity that
14160: applies to evil as well as good."
14161: 
14162: "You are referring to Felix Holt. I have not neglected steps to secure
14163: the best legal help for the prisoners: but I am given to understand that
14164: Holt refuses any aid from me. I hope he will not go rashly to work in
14165: speaking in his own defence without any legal instruction. It is an
14166: opprobrium of our law that no counsel is allowed to plead for the
14167: prisoner in cases of felony. A ready tongue may do a man as much harm as
14168: good in a court of justice. He piques himself on making a display, and
14169: displays a little too much."
14170: 
14171: "Sir, you know him not," said the little minister, in his deeper tone.
14172: "He would not accept, even if it were accorded, a defense wherein the
14173: truth was screened or avoided,--not from a vainglorious spirit of
14174: self-exhibition, for he hath a singular directness and simplicity of
14175: speech; but from an averseness to a profession wherein a man may without
14176: shame seek to justify the wicked for reward, and take away the
14177: righteousness of the righteous from him."
14178: 
14179: "It's a pity a fine young fellow should do himself harm by fanatical
14180: notions of that sort. I could at least have procured the advantage of
14181: first-rate consultation. He didn't look to me like a dreamy personage."
14182: 
14183: "Nor is he dreamy; rather, his excess lies in being too practical."
14184: 
14185: "Well, I hope you will not encourage him in such irrationality; the
14186: question is not one of misrepresentation, but of adjusting fact, so as
14187: to raise it to the power of evidence. Don't you see that?"
14188: 
14189: "I do, I do. But I distrust not Felix Holt's discernment in regard to
14190: his own case. He builds not on doubtful things and hath no illusory
14191: hopes; on the contrary, he is of a too-scornful incredulity where I
14192: would fain see a more childlike faith. But he will hold no belief
14193: without action corresponding thereto; and the occasion of his return to
14194: this, his native place, at a time which has proved fatal, was no other
14195: than his resolve to hinder the sale of some drugs, which had chiefly
14196: supported his mother, but which his better knowledge showed him to be
14197: pernicious to the human frame. He undertook to support her by his own
14198: labor; but, sir, I pray you to mark--and old as I am, I will not deny
14199: that this young man instructs me herein--I pray you to mark the
14200: poisonous confusion of good and evil which is the wide-spreading effect
14201: of vicious practices. Through the use of undue electioneering
14202: means--concerning which, however, I do not accuse you farther than of
14203: having acted the part of him who washes his hands when he delivers up to
14204: others the exercise of an iniquitous power--Felix Holt is, I will not
14205: scruple to say, the innocent victim of a riot; and that deed of strict
14206: honesty, whereby he took on himself the charge of his aged mother, seems
14207: now to have deprived her of sufficient bread, and is even an occasion of
14208: reproach to him from the weaker brethren."
14209: 
14210: "I shall be proud to supply her as amply as you think desirable," said
14211: Harold, not enjoying this lecture.
14212: 
14213: "I will pray you to speak of this question with my daughter, who, it
14214: appears, may herself have large means at command, and would desire to
14215: minister to Mrs. Holt's needs with all friendship and delicacy. For the
14216: present I can take care that she lacks nothing essential."
14217: 
14218: As Mr. Lyon was speaking, Esther re-entered, equipped for her drive. She
14219: laid her hand on her father's arm and said, "You will let my pupils know
14220: at once, will you, father?"
14221: 
14222: "Doubtless, my dear," said the old man, trembling a little under the
14223: feeling that this departure of Esther's was a crisis. Nothing again
14224: would be as it had been in their mutual life. But he feared that he was
14225: being mastered by a too tender self-regard, and struggled to keep
14226: himself calm.
14227: 
14228: Mrs. Transome and Harold had both risen.
14229: 
14230: "If you are quite ready, Miss Lyon," said Harold, divining that the
14231: father and daughter would like to have an unobserved moment, "I will
14232: take my mother to the carriage and come back for you."
14233: 
14234: When they were alone, Esther put her hands on her father's shoulders and
14235: kissed him.
14236: 
14237: "This will not be a grief to you, I hope, father? You think it is better
14238: that I should go?"
14239: 
14240: "Nay, child, I am weak. But I would fain be capable of a joy quite apart
14241: from the accidents of my aged earthly existence, which, indeed, is a
14242: petty and almost dried-up fountain--whereas to the receptive soul the
14243: river of life pauses not, nor is diminished."
14244: 
14245: "Perhaps you will see Felix Holt again and tell him all?"
14246: 
14247: "Shall I say aught to him for you?"
14248: 
14249: "Oh, no; only that Job Tudge has a little flannel shirt and a box of
14250: lozenges," said Esther, smiling. "Ah, I hear Mr. Transome coming back. I
14251: must say good-bye to Lyddy, else she will cry over my hard heart."
14252: 
14253: In spite of all the grave thoughts that had been, Esther felt it a very
14254: pleasant as well as new experience to be led to the carriage by Harold
14255: Transome, to be seated on soft cushions, and bowled along, looked at
14256: admiringly and deferentially by a person opposite, whom it was agreeable
14257: to look at in return, and talked to with suavity and liveliness. Toward
14258: what prospect was that easy carriage really leading her? She could not
14259: be always asking herself Mentor-like questions. Her young, bright nature
14260: was rather weary of the sadness that had grown heavier in these last
14261: weeks, like a chill white mist hopelessly veiling the day. Her fortune
14262: was beginning to appear worthy of being called good fortune. She had
14263: come to a new stage in her journey; a new day had arisen on new scenes,
14264: and her young untired spirit was full of curiosity.
14265: 
14266: 
14267: 
14268: 
14269: CHAPTER XXXIX.
14270: 
14271:     No man believes that many-textured knowledge and skill--as a just
14272:     idea of the solar system, or the power of painting flesh, or of
14273:     reading written harmonies--can come late and of a sudden; yet many
14274:     will not stick at believing that happiness can come at any day and
14275:     hour solely by a new disposition of events; though there is naught
14276:     less capable of a magical production than a mortal's happiness,
14277:     which is mainly a complex of habitual relations and dispositions
14278:     not to be wrought by news from foreign parts, or any whirling of
14279:     fortune's wheel for one on whose brow Time has written legibly.
14280: 
14281: 
14282: Some days after Esther's arrival at Transome Court, Denner, coming to
14283: dress Mrs. Transome before dinner--a labor of love for which she had
14284: ample leisure now--found her mistress seated with more than ever of a
14285: marble aspect of self-absorbed suffering, which to the waiting-woman's
14286: keen observation had been gradually intensifying itself during the past
14287: week. She had tapped at the door without having been summoned, and she
14288: had ventured to enter though she had heard no voice saying, "Come in."
14289: 
14290: Mrs. Transome had on a dark warm dressing-gown, hanging in thick folds
14291: about her, and she was seated before a mirror which filled a panel from
14292: the floor to the ceiling. The room was bright with the light of the fire
14293: and of wax candles. For some reason, contrary to her usual practice,
14294: Mrs. Transome had herself unfastened her abundant gray hair, which
14295: rolled backward in a pale sunless stream over her dark dress. She was
14296: seated before the mirror apparently looking at herself, her brow knit in
14297: one deep furrow, and her jewelled hands laid one above the other on her
14298: knee. Probably she had ceased to see the reflection in the mirror, for
14299: her eyes had the fixed wide-open look that belongs not to examination,
14300: but to reverie. Motionless in that way, her clear-cut features keeping
14301: distinct record of past beauty, she looked like an image faded, dried,
14302: and bleached by uncounted suns, rather than a breathing woman who had
14303: numbered the years as they passed, and had a consciousness within her
14304: which was the slow deposit of those ceaseless rolling years.
14305: 
14306: Denner, with all her ingrained and systematic reserve, could not help
14307: showing signs that she was startled, when, peering from between her
14308: half-closed eyelids, she saw the motionless image in the mirror opposite
14309: to her as she entered. Her gentle opening of the door had not roused her
14310: mistress, to whom the sensations produced by Denner's presence were as
14311: little disturbing as those of a favorite cat. But the slight cry, and
14312: the start reflected in the glass, were unusual enough to break the
14313: reverie, Mrs. Transome moved, leaned back in her chair, and said--
14314: 
14315: "So you're come at last, Denner?"
14316: 
14317: "Yes, madam; it is not late. I'm sorry you should have undone your hair
14318: yourself."
14319: 
14320: "I undid it to see what an old hag I am. These fine clothes you put on
14321: me, Denner, are only a smart shroud."
14322: 
14323: "Pray don't talk so, madam. If there's anybody doesn't think it pleasant
14324: to look at you, so much the worse for them. For my part, I've seen no
14325: young ones fit to hold up your train. Look at your likeness down below;
14326: and though you're older now, what signifies? I wouldn't be Letty in the
14327: scullery because she's got red cheeks. She mayn't know she's a poor
14328: creature, but I know it, and that's enough for me; I know what sort of a
14329: dowdy draggletail she'll be in ten years' time. I would change with
14330: nobody, madam. And if troubles were put up to market, I'd sooner buy old
14331: than new. It's something to have seen the worst."
14332: 
14333: "A woman never has seen the worst till she is old, Denner," said Mrs.
14334: Transome, bitterly.
14335: 
14336: The keen little waiting-woman was not clear as to the cause of her
14337: mistress's added bitterness; but she rarely brought herself to ask
14338: questions, when Mrs. Transome did not authorize them by beginning to
14339: give her information. Banks the bailiff and the head-servant had nodded
14340: and winked a good deal over the certainty that Mr. Harold was "none so
14341: fond" of Jermyn, but this was a subject on which Mrs. Transome had never
14342: made up her mind to speak, and Denner knew nothing definite. Again, she
14343: felt quite sure that there was some important secret connected with
14344: Esther's presence in the house; she suspected that the close Dominic
14345: knew the secret, and was more trusted than she was, in spite of her
14346: forty years' service; but any resentment on this ground would have been
14347: an entertained reproach against her mistress, inconsistent with Denner's
14348: creed and character. She inclined to the belief that Esther was the
14349: immediate cause of the new discontent.
14350: 
14351: "If there's anything worse coming to you, I should like to know what it
14352: is, madam," she said, after a moment's silence, speaking always in the
14353: same low quick way, and keeping up her quiet labors. "When I awake at
14354: cock-crow, I'd sooner have one real grief on my mind than twenty false.
14355: It's better to know one's robbed than to think one's going to be
14356: murdered."
14357: 
14358: "I believe you are the creature in the world that loves me best, Denner;
14359: yet you will never understand what I suffer. It's of no use telling you.
14360: There's no folly in you, and no heartache. You are made of iron. You
14361: have never had any trouble."
14362: 
14363: "I've had some of your trouble, madam."
14364: 
14365: "Yes, you good thing. But as a sick-nurse, that never caught the fever.
14366: You never even had a child."
14367: 
14368: "I can feel for things I never went through. I used to be sorry for the
14369: poor French Queen when I was young; I'd have lain cold for her to lie
14370: warm. I know people have feelings according to their birth and station.
14371: And you always took things to heart, madam, beyond anybody else. But I
14372: hope there's nothing new, to make you talk of the worst."
14373: 
14374: "Yes, Denner, there is--there is," said Mrs. Transome, speaking in a low
14375: tone of misery, while she bent for her head-dress to be pinned on.
14376: 
14377: "Is it this young lady?"
14378: 
14379: "Why, what do you think about her, Denner?" said Mrs. Transome, in a
14380: tone of more spirit, rather curious to hear what the old woman would
14381: say.
14382: 
14383: "I don't deny she's graceful, and she has a pretty smile and very good
14384: manners: it's quite unaccountable by what Banks says about her father. I
14385: know nothing of those Treby townsfolk myself, but for my part I'm
14386: puzzled. I'm fond of Mr. Harold. I always shall be, madam. I was at his
14387: bringing into the world, and nothing but his doing wrong by you would
14388: turn me against him. But the servants all say he's in love with Miss
14389: Lyon."
14390: 
14391: "I wish it were true, Denner," said Mrs. Transome, energetically. "I
14392: wish he were in love with her, so that she could master him, and make
14393: him do what she pleased."
14394: 
14395: "Then it is not true--what they say?"
14396: 
14397: "Not true that she will ever master him. No woman ever will. He will
14398: make her fond of him, and afraid of him. That's one of the things you
14399: have never gone through, Denner. A woman's love is always freezing into
14400: fear. She wants everything, she is secure of nothing. This girl has a
14401: fine spirit--plenty of fire and pride and wit. Men like such captives,
14402: as they like horses that champ the bit and paw the ground: they feel
14403: more triumph in their mastery. What is the use of a woman's will?--if
14404: she tries, she doesn't get it, and she ceases to be loved. God was cruel
14405: when He made women."
14406: 
14407: Denner was used to such outbursts as this. Her mistress's rhetoric and
14408: temper belonged to her superior rank, her grand person, and her piercing
14409: black eyes. Mrs. Transome had a sense of impiety in her words which made
14410: them all the more tempting to her impotent anger. The waiting-woman had
14411: none of that awe which could be turned into defiance: the Sacred Grove
14412: was a common thicket to her.
14413: 
14414: "It mayn't be good luck to be a woman," she said. "But one begins with
14415: it from a baby: one gets used to it. And I shouldn't like to be a
14416: man--to cough so loud, and stand straddling about on a wet day, and be
14417: so wasteful with meat and drink. They're a coarse lot, I think. Then I
14418: needn't make a trouble of this young lady, madam," she added, after a
14419: moment's pause.
14420: 
14421: "No, Denner, I like her. If that were all--I should like Harold to marry
14422: her. It would be the best thing. If the truth were known--and it will be
14423: known soon--the estate is hers by law--such law as it is. It's a strange
14424: story: she's a Bycliffe really."
14425: 
14426: Denner did not look amazed, but went on fastening her mistress's dress,
14427: as she said--
14428: 
14429: "Well, madam, I was sure there was something wonderful at the bottom of
14430: it. And turning the old lawsuits and everything else over in my mind, I
14431: thought the law might have something to do with it. Then she is a born
14432: lady?"
14433: 
14434: "Yes; she has good blood in her veins."
14435: 
14436: "We talked that over in the housekeeper's room--what a hand and an
14437: instep she has, and how her head is set on her shoulders--almost like
14438: your own, madam. But her lightish complexion spoils her, to my thinking.
14439: And Dominic said Mr. Harold never admired that sort of woman before.
14440: There's nothing that smooth fellow couldn't tell you if he would: he
14441: knows the answer to riddles before they're made. However, he knows how
14442: to hold his tongue; I'll say that for him. And so do I, madam."
14443: 
14444: "Yes, yes; you will not talk of it till other people are talking of it."
14445: 
14446: "And so, if Mr. Harold married her, it would save all fuss and
14447: mischief?"
14448: 
14449: "Yes--about the estate."
14450: 
14451: "And he seems inclined; and she'll not refuse him, I'll answer for it.
14452: And you like her, madam. There's everything to set your mind at rest."
14453: 
14454: Denner was putting the finishing-touch to Mrs. Transome's dress by
14455: throwing an Indian scarf over her shoulders, and so completing the
14456: contrast between the majestic lady in costume and the dishevelled
14457: Hecuba-like woman whom she had found half an hour before.
14458: 
14459: "I am not at rest!" Mrs. Transome said, with slow distinctness, moving
14460: from the mirror to the window, where the blind was not drawn down, and
14461: she could see the chill white landscape and the far-off unheeding stars.
14462: 
14463: Denner, more distressed by her mistress's suffering than she could have
14464: been by anything else, took up with the instinct of affection a gold
14465: vinaigrette which Mrs. Transome often liked to carry with her, and going
14466: up to her put it into her hand gently. Mrs. Transome grasped the little
14467: woman's hand hard, and held it so.
14468: 
14469: "Denner," she said, in a low tone, "if I could choose at this moment, I
14470: would choose that Harold should never have been born."
14471: 
14472: "Nay, my dear," (Denner had only once before in her life said "my dear"
14473: to her mistress), "it was a happiness to you then."
14474: 
14475: "I don't believe I felt the happiness then as I feel the misery now. It
14476: is foolish to say people can't feel much when they are getting old. Not
14477: pleasure, perhaps--little comes. But they can feel they are
14478: forsaken--why, every fibre in me seems to be a memory that makes a pang.
14479: They can feel that all the love in their lives is turned to hatred or
14480: contempt."
14481: 
14482: "Not mine, madam, not mine. Let what would be I should want to live for
14483: your sake, for fear you should have nobody to do for you as I would."
14484: 
14485: "Ah, then you are a happy woman, Denner; you have loved somebody for
14486: forty years who is old and weak now, and can't do without you."
14487: 
14488: The sound of the dinner-gong resounded below, and Mrs. Transome let the
14489: faithful hand fall again.
14490: 
14491: 
14492: 
14493: 
14494: CHAPTER XL.
14495: 
14496:     "She's beautiful; and therefore to be wooed:
14497:     She is a woman; therefore to be won."
14498: 
14499:                                                --_Henry VI._
14500: 
14501: 
14502: If Denner had had a suspicion that Esther's presence at Transome Court
14503: was not agreeable to her mistress, it was impossible to entertain such a
14504: suspicion with regard to the other members of the family. Between her
14505: and little Harry there was an extraordinary fascination. This creature,
14506: with the soft, broad, brown cheeks, low forehead, great black eyes,
14507: tiny, well-defined nose, fierce, biting tricks toward every person and
14508: thing he disliked, and insistence on entirely occupying those he liked,
14509: was a human specimen such as Esther had never seen before, and she
14510: seemed to be equally original in Harry's experience. At first sight her
14511: light complexion and her blue gown, probably also her sunny smile and
14512: her hands stretched out toward him, seemed to make a show for him as of
14513: a new sort of bird: he threw himself backward against his "Gappa," as he
14514: called old Mr. Transome, and stared at this new comer with the gravity
14515: of a wild animal. But she had no sooner sat down on the sofa in the
14516: library than he climbed up to her, and began to treat her as an
14517: attractive object in natural history, snatched up her curls with his
14518: brown fist, and, discovering that there was a little ear under them,
14519: pinched it and blew into it, pulled at her coronet of plaits, and seemed
14520: to discover with satisfaction that it did not grow at the summit of her
14521: head, but could be dragged down and altogether undone. Then finding that
14522: she laughed, tossed him back, kissed, and pretended to bite him--in
14523: fact, was an animal that understood fun--he rushed off and made Dominic
14524: bring a small menagerie of white mice, squirrels, and birds, with Moro,
14525: the black spaniel, to make her acquaintance. Whomsoever Harry liked, it
14526: followed that Mr. Transome must like: "Gappa," along with Nimrod the
14527: retriever, was part of the menagerie, and perhaps endured more than all
14528: the other live creatures in the way of being tumbled about. Seeing that
14529: Esther bore having her hair pulled down quite merrily, and that she was
14530: willing to be harnessed and beaten, the old man began to confide to her,
14531: in his feeble, smiling, and rather jerking fashion, Harry's remarkable
14532: feats: how he had one day, when Gappy was asleep, unpinned a whole
14533: drawerful of beetles, to see if they would fly away; then, disgusted
14534: with their stupidity, was about to throw them all on the ground and
14535: stamp on them, when Dominic came in and rescued these valuable
14536: specimens; also, how he had subtly watched Mrs. Transome at the cabinet
14537: where she kept her medicines, and, when she had left it for a little
14538: while without locking it, had gone to the drawers and scattered half the
14539: contents on the floor. But what old Mr. Transome thought the most
14540: wonderful proof of an almost preternatural cleverness was, that Harry
14541: would hardly ever talk, but preferred making inarticulate noises, or
14542: combining syllables after a method of his own.
14543: 
14544: "He can talk well enough if he likes," said Gappa, evidently thinking
14545: that Harry, like the monkeys, had deep reasons for his reticence.
14546: 
14547: "You mind him," he added, nodding at Esther, and shaking with low-toned
14548: laughter. "You'll hear: he knows the right names of things well enough,
14549: but he likes to make his own. He'll give you one all to yourself before
14550: long."
14551: 
14552: And when Harry seemed to have made up his mind distinctly that Esther's
14553: name was "Boo," Mr. Transome nodded at her with triumphant satisfaction,
14554: and then told her in a low whisper, looking round cautiously beforehand,
14555: that Harry would never call Mrs. Transome "Gamma," but always "Bite."
14556: 
14557: "It's wonderful!" said he, laughing slyly.
14558: 
14559: The old man seemed so happy now in the new world created for him by
14560: Dominic and Harry, that he would perhaps have made a holocaust of his
14561: flies and beetles if it had been necessary in order to keep this living,
14562: lively kindness about him. He no longer confined himself to the library,
14563: but shuffled along from room to room, staying and looking on at what was
14564: going forward whenever he did not find Mrs. Transome alone.
14565: 
14566: To Esther the sight of this feeble-minded, timid, paralytic man, who had
14567: long abdicated all mastery over the things that were his, was something
14568: piteous. Certainly this had never been part of the furniture she had
14569: imagined for the delightful aristocratic dwelling in her Utopia; and the
14570: sad irony of such a lot impressed her the more because in her father she
14571: was accustomed to age accompanied with mental acumen and activity. Her
14572: thoughts went back in conjecture over the past life of Mr. and Mrs.
14573: Transome, a couple so strangely different from each other. She found it
14574: impossible to arrange their existence in the seclusion of this fine park
14575: and in this lofty large-roomed house, where it seemed quite ridiculous
14576: to be anything so small as a human being, without finding it rather
14577: dull. Mr. Transome had always had his beetles, but Mrs. Transome----? it
14578: was not easy to conceive that the husband and wife had ever been very
14579: fond of each other.
14580: 
14581: Esther felt at her ease with Mrs. Transome: she was gratified by the
14582: consciousness--for on this point Esther was very quick--that Mrs.
14583: Transome admired her, and looked at her with satisfied eyes. But when
14584: they were together in the early days of her stay, the conversation
14585: turned chiefly on what happened in Mrs. Transome's youth--what she wore
14586: when she was presented at Court--who were the most distinguished and
14587: beautiful women at that time--the terrible excitement of the French
14588: Revolution--the emigrants she had known, and the history of various
14589: titled members of the Lingon family. And Esther, from native delicacy,
14590: did not lead to more recent topics of a personal kind. She was copiously
14591: instructed that the Lingon family was better than that even of the elder
14592: Transomes, and was privileged with an explanation of the various
14593: quarterings, which proved that the Lingon blood had been continually
14594: enriched. Poor Mrs. Transome, with her secret bitterness and dread,
14595: still found a flavor in this sort of pride; none the less because
14596: certain deeds of her own life had been in fatal inconsistency with it.
14597: Besides, genealogies entered into her stock of ideas, and her talk on
14598: such subjects was as necessary as the notes of the linnet or the
14599: blackbird. She had no ultimate analysis of things that went beyond blood
14600: and family--the Herons of Fenshore or the Badgers of Hillbury. She had
14601: never seen behind the canvas with which her life was hung. In the dim
14602: background there was the burning mount and the tables of the law; in the
14603: foreground there was Lady Debarry privately gossipping about her, and
14604: Lady Wyvern finally deciding not to send her invitations to dinner.
14605: Unlike that Semiramis who made laws to suit her practical license, she
14606: lived, poor soul, in the midst of desecrated sanctities, and of honors
14607: that looked tarnished in the light of monotonous and weary suns.
14608: Glimpses of the Lingon heraldry in their freshness were interesting to
14609: Esther; but it occurred to her that when she had known about them a good
14610: while they would cease to be succulent themes of converse or meditation,
14611: and Mrs. Transome, having known them all along, might have felt a vacuum
14612: in spite of them.
14613: 
14614: Nevertheless it was entertaining at present to be seated on soft
14615: cushions with her netting before her, while Mrs. Transome went on with
14616: her embroidery, and told in that easy phrase, and with that refined
14617: high-bred tone and accent which she possessed in perfection, family
14618: stories that to Esther were like so many novelettes; what diamonds were
14619: in the Earl's family, own cousins to Mrs. Transome; how poor Lady Sara's
14620: husband went off into jealous madness only a month after their marriage,
14621: and dragged that sweet blue-eyed thing by the hair; and how the
14622: brilliant Fanny, having married a country parson, became so niggardly
14623: that she had gone about almost begging for fresh eggs from the farmers'
14624: wives, though she had done very well with her six sons, as there was a
14625: bishop and no end of interest in the family, and two of them got
14626: appointments in India.
14627: 
14628: At present Mrs. Transome did not touch at all on her own time of
14629: privation, or her troubles with her eldest son, or on anything that lay
14630: very close to her heart. She conversed with Esther, and acted the part
14631: of hostess, as she performed her toilet and went on with her embroidery:
14632: these things were to be done whether one were happy or miserable. Even
14633: the patriarch Job, if he had been a gentleman of the modern West, would
14634: have avoided picturesque disorder and poetical laments; and the friends
14635: who called on him, though not less disposed than Bildad the Shuhite to
14636: hint that their unfortunate friend was in the wrong, would have sat on
14637: chairs and held their hats in their hands. The harder problems of our
14638: life have changed less than our manners; we wrestle with the old
14639: sorrows, but more decorously. Esther's inexperience prevented her from
14640: divining much about this fine gray-haired woman, whom she could not help
14641: perceiving to stand apart from the family group, as if there were some
14642: cause of isolation for her both within and without. To her young heart
14643: there was a peculiar interest in Mrs. Transome. An elderly woman, whose
14644: beauty, position, and graceful kindness toward herself, made deference
14645: to her spontaneous, was a new figure in Esther's experience. Her quick
14646: light movement was always ready to anticipate what Mrs. Transome wanted;
14647: her bright apprehension and silvery speech were always ready to cap Mrs.
14648: Transome's narratives or instructions even about doses and liniments,
14649: with some lively commentary. She must have behaved charmingly; for one
14650: day when she had tripped across the room to put the screen just in the
14651: right place, Mrs. Transome said, taking her hand, "My dear, you make me
14652: wish I had a daughter!"
14653: 
14654: That was pleasant; and so it was to be decked by Mrs. Transome's own
14655: hands in a set of turquoise ornaments, which became her wonderfully,
14656: worn with a white Cashmere dress, which was also insisted on. Esther
14657: never reflected that there was a double intention in these pretty ways
14658: toward her; with young generosity, she was rather preoccupied by the
14659: desire to prove that she herself entertained no low triumph in the fact
14660: that she had rights prejudicial to this family whose life she was
14661: learning. And besides, through all Mrs. Transome's perfect manners,
14662: there pierced some undefinable indications of a hidden anxiety much
14663: deeper than anything she could feel about this affair of the estate--to
14664: which she often alluded slightly as a reason for informing Esther of
14665: something. It was impossible to mistake her for a happy woman; and young
14666: speculation is always stirred by discontent for which there is no
14667: obvious cause. When we are older, we take the uneasy eyes and the bitter
14668: lips more as a matter of course.
14669: 
14670: But Harold Transome was more communicative about recent years than his
14671: mother was. He thought it well that Esther should know how the fortune
14672: of his family had been drained by law expenses, owing to suits
14673: mistakenly urged by her family; he spoke of his mother's lonely life
14674: and pinched circumstances, of her lack of comfort in her elder son, and
14675: of the habit she had consequently acquired of looking at the gloomy side
14676: of things. He hinted that she had been accustomed to dictate, and that,
14677: as he had left her when he was a boy, she had perhaps indulged the dream
14678: that he would come back a boy. She was still sore on the point of his
14679: politics. These things could not be helped, but so far as he could, he
14680: wished to make the rest of her life as cheerful as possible.
14681: 
14682: Esther listened eagerly, and took these things to heart. The claim to an
14683: inheritance, the sudden discovery of a right to a fortune held by
14684: others, was acquiring a very distinct and unexpected meaning for her.
14685: Every day she was getting more clearly into her imagination what it
14686: would be to abandon her own past, and what she would enter into in
14687: exchange for it; what it would be to disturb a long possession, and how
14688: difficult it was to fix a point at which the disturbance might begin, so
14689: as to be contemplated without pain.
14690: 
14691: Harold Transome's thoughts turned on the same subject, but accompanied
14692: by a different state of feeling and with more definite resolutions. He
14693: saw a mode of reconciling all difficulties, which looked pleasanter to
14694: him the longer he looked at Esther. When she had been hardly a week in
14695: the house, he had made up his mind to marry her; and it had never
14696: entered into that mind that the decision did not rest entirely with his
14697: inclination. It was not that he thought slightly of Esther's demands; he
14698: saw that she would require considerable attractions to please her, and
14699: that there were difficulties to be overcome. She was clearly a girl who
14700: must be wooed; but Harold did not despair of presenting the requisite
14701: attractions, and the difficulties gave more interest to the wooing than
14702: he could have believed. When he had said that he would not marry an
14703: Englishwoman, he had always made a mental reservation in favor of
14704: peculiar circumstances; and now the peculiar circumstances were come. To
14705: be deeply in love was a catastrophe not likely to happen to him; but he
14706: was readily amorous. No woman could make him miserable, but he was
14707: sensitive to the presence of women, and was kind to them; not with
14708: grimaces, like a man of mere gallantry, but beamingly, easily, like a
14709: man of genuine good-nature. And each day he was near Esther, the
14710: solution of all difficulties by marriage became a more pleasing
14711: prospect; though he had to confess to himself that the difficulties did
14712: not diminish on a nearer view, in spite of the flattering sense that
14713: she brightened at his approach.
14714: 
14715: Harold was not one to fail in a purpose for want of assiduity. After an
14716: hour or two devoted to business in the morning, he went to look for
14717: Esther, and if he did not find her at play with Harry and old Mr.
14718: Transome, or chatting with his mother, he went into the drawing-room,
14719: where she was usually either seated with a book on her knee and "making
14720: a bed for her cheek" with one little hand, while she looked out of the
14721: window, or else standing in front of one of the full-length family
14722: portraits with an air of rumination. Esther found it impossible to read
14723: in these days; her life was a book which she seemed herself to be
14724: constructing--trying to make character clear before her, and looking
14725: into the ways of destiny.
14726: 
14727: The active Harold had almost always something definite to propose by way
14728: of filling the time; if it were fine, she must walk out with him and see
14729: the grounds; and when the snow melted and it was no longer slippery, she
14730: must get on horseback and learn to ride. If they staid indoors, she must
14731: learn to play at billiards, or she must go over the house and see the
14732: pictures he had had hung anew, or the costumes he had brought from the
14733: East; or come into his study and look at the map of the estate, and hear
14734: what--if it had remained in his family--he had intended to do in every
14735: corner of it in order to make the most of its capabilities.
14736: 
14737: About a certain time in the morning Esther had learned to expect him.
14738: Let every wooer make himself strongly expected; he may succeed by dint
14739: of being absent, but hardly in the first instance. One morning Harold
14740: found her in the drawing-room, leaning against a console-table, and
14741: looking at the full-length portrait of a certain Lady Betty Transome,
14742: who had lived a century and a half before, and had the usual charm of
14743: ladies in Sir Peter Lely's style.
14744: 
14745: "Don't move, pray," he said on entering; "you look as if you were
14746: standing for your own portrait."
14747: 
14748: "I take that as an insinuation," said Esther, laughing, and moving
14749: toward her seat on an ottoman near the fire, "for I notice almost all
14750: the portraits are in a conscious, affected attitude. That fair Lady
14751: Betty looks as if she had been drilled into that posture, and had not
14752: will enough of her own ever to move again unless she had a little push
14753: given to her."
14754: 
14755: "She brightens up that panel well with her long satin skirt," said
14756: Harold, as he followed Esther, "but alive I dare say she would have been
14757: less cheerful company."
14758: 
14759: "One would certainly think that she had just been unpacked from silver
14760: paper. Ah, how chivalrous you are!" said Esther, as Harold, kneeling on
14761: one knee, held her silken netting-stirrup for her to put her foot
14762: through. She had often fancied pleasant scenes in which such homage was
14763: rendered to her, and the homage was not disagreeable now it was really
14764: come; but, strangely enough, a little darting sensation at that moment
14765: was accompanied by the vivid remembrance of some one who had never paid
14766: the least attention to her foot. There had been a slight blush, such as
14767: often came and went rapidly, and she was silent a moment. Harold
14768: naturally believed that it was he himself who was filling the field of
14769: vision. He would have liked to place himself on the ottoman near Esther,
14770: and behave very much more like a lover; but he took a chair opposite to
14771: her at a circumspect distance. He dared not do otherwise. Along with
14772: Esther's playful charm she conveyed an impression of personal pride and
14773: high spirit which warned Harold's acuteness that in the delicacy of
14774: their present position he might easily make a false move and offend her.
14775: A woman was likely to be credulous about adoration, and to find no
14776: difficulty in referring it to her intrinsic attractions; but Esther was
14777: too dangerously quick and critical not to discern the least awkwardness
14778: that looked like offering her marriage as a convenient compromise for
14779: himself. Beforehand, he might have said that such characteristics as
14780: hers were not loveable in a woman; but, as it was, he found that the
14781: hope of pleasing her had a piquancy quite new to him.
14782: 
14783: "I wonder," said Esther, breaking the silence in her usual light silvery
14784: tones--"I wonder whether the women who looked in that way ever felt any
14785: troubles. I see there are two old ones up-stairs in the billiard-room
14786: who have only got fat; the expression of their faces is just of the same
14787: sort."
14788: 
14789: "A woman ought never to have any trouble. There should always be a man
14790: to guard her from it. (Harold Transome was masculine and fallible; he
14791: had incautiously sat down this morning to pay his addresses by talk
14792: about nothing in particular; and, clever experienced man as he was, he
14793: fell into nonsense.)
14794: 
14795: "But suppose the man himself got into trouble--you would wish her to
14796: mind about that. Or suppose," added Esther, suddenly looking up merrily
14797: at Harold, "the man himself was troublesome?"
14798: 
14799: "Oh, you must not strain probabilities in that way. The generality of
14800: men are perfect. Take me, for example."
14801: 
14802: "You are a perfect judge of sauces," said Esther, who had her triumphs
14803: in letting Harold know that she was capable of taking notes.
14804: 
14805: "That is perfection number one. Pray go on."
14806: 
14807: "Oh, the catalogue is too long--I should be tired before I got to your
14808: magnificent ruby ring and your gloves always of the right color."
14809: 
14810: "If you would let me tell you your perfections, I should not be tired."
14811: 
14812: "That is not complimentary; it means that the list is short."
14813: 
14814: "No; it means that the list is pleasant to dwell upon."
14815: 
14816: "Pray don't begin," said Esther, with her pretty toss of the head; "it
14817: would be dangerous to our good understanding. The person I liked best in
14818: the world was one who did nothing but scold me and tell me of my
14819: faults."
14820: 
14821: When Esther began to speak, she meant to do no more than make a remote
14822: unintelligible allusion, feeling, it must be owned, a naughty will to
14823: flirt and be saucy, and thwart Harold's attempts to be felicitous in
14824: compliment. But she had no sooner uttered the words than they seemed to
14825: her like a confession. A deep flush spread itself over her face and
14826: neck, and the sense that she was blushing went on deepening her color.
14827: Harold felt himself unpleasantly illuminated as to a possibility that
14828: had never yet occurred to him. His surprise made an uncomfortable pause,
14829: in which Esther had time to feel much vexation.
14830: 
14831: "You speak in the past tense," said Harold, at last; "yet I am rather
14832: envious of that person. I shall never be able to win your regard in the
14833: same way. Is it anyone at Treby? Because in that case I can enquire
14834: about your faults."
14835: 
14836: "Oh, you know I have always lived among grave people," said Esther, more
14837: able to recover herself now she was spoken to. "Before I came home to be
14838: with my father I was nothing but a school-girl first, and then a teacher
14839: in different stages of growth. People in those circumstances are not
14840: usually flattered. But there are varieties in fault-finding. At our
14841: Paris school the master I liked best was an old man who stormed at me
14842: terribly when I read Racine, but yet showed that he was proud of me."
14843: 
14844: Esther was getting quite cool again. But Harold was not entirely
14845: satisfied; if there was any obstacle in his way, he wished to know
14846: exactly what it was.
14847: 
14848: "That must have been a wretched life for you at Treby," he said--"a
14849: person of your accomplishments."
14850: 
14851: "I used to be dreadfully discontented," said Esther, much occupied with
14852: mistakes she had made in her netting. "But I was becoming less so. I
14853: have had time to get rather wise, you know; I am two-and-twenty."
14854: 
14855: "Yes," said Harold, rising and walking a few paces backward and forward,
14856: "you are past your majority; you are empress of your own fortunes--and
14857: more besides."
14858: 
14859: "Dear me," said Esther, letting her work fall, and leaning back against
14860: the cushions; "I don't think I know very well what to do with my
14861: empire."
14862: 
14863: "Well," said Harold, pausing in front of her, leaning one arm on the
14864: mantelpiece, and speaking very gravely, "I hope that in any case, since
14865: you appear to have no near relative who understands affairs, you will
14866: confide in me, and trust me with all your intentions as if I had no
14867: other personal concern in the matter than a regard for you. I hope you
14868: believe me capable of acting as the guardian of your interest, even
14869: where it turns out to be inevitably opposed to my own."
14870: 
14871: "I am sure you have given me reason to believe it," said Esther, with
14872: seriousness, putting out her hand to Harold. She had not been left in
14873: ignorance that he had had opportunities twice offered of stifling her
14874: claims.
14875: 
14876: Harold raised the hand to his lips, but dared not retain it more than an
14877: instant. Still the sweet reliance in Esther's manner made an
14878: irresistible temptation to him. After standing still a moment or two,
14879: while she bent over her work, he glided to the ottoman and seated
14880: himself close by her, looking at her busy hands.
14881: 
14882: "I see you have made mistakes in your work," he said, bending still
14883: nearer, for he saw that she was conscious, yet not angry.
14884: 
14885: "Nonsense! you know nothing about it," said Esther, laughing, and
14886: crushing up the soft silk under her palms. "Those blunders have a design
14887: in them."
14888: 
14889: She looked round, and saw a handsome face very near her. Harold was
14890: looking, as he felt, thoroughly enamored of this bright woman, who was
14891: not at all to his preconceived taste. Perhaps a touch of hypothetic
14892: jealousy now helped to heighten the effect. But he mastered all
14893: indiscretion, and only looked at her as he said--
14894: 
14895: "I am wondering whether you have any deep wishes and secrets that I
14896: can't guess."
14897: 
14898: "Pray don't speak of my wishes," said Esther, quite overmastered by this
14899: new and apparently involuntary manifestation in Harold; "I could not
14900: possibly tell you one at this moment--I think I shall never find them
14901: out again. Oh, yes," she said, abruptly, struggling to relieve herself
14902: from the oppression of unintelligible feelings--"I do know one wish
14903: distinctly. I want to go and see my father. He writes me word that all
14904: is well with him, but still I want to see him."
14905: 
14906: "You shall be driven there when you like."
14907: 
14908: "May I go now--I mean as soon as it is convenient?" said Esther, rising.
14909: 
14910: "I will give the order immediately, if you wish it," said Harold,
14911: understanding that the audience was broken up.
14912: 
14913: 
14914: 
14915: 
14916: CHAPTER XLI.
14917: 
14918:     He rates me as the merchant does the wares
14919:     He will not purchase--"quality not high
14920:     'Twill lose its color opened to the sun,
14921:     Has no aroma, and, in fine, is naught--
14922:     I barter not for such commodities--
14923:     There is no ratio betwixt sands and gems."
14924:     'Tis wicked judgment! for the soul can grow,
14925:     As embryos, that live and move but blindly,
14926:     Burst from the dark, emerge, regenerate,
14927:     And lead a life of vision and of choice.
14928: 
14929: 
14930: Esther did not take the carriage into Malthouse Lane, but left it to
14931: wait for her outside the town; and when she entered the house she put
14932: her finger on her lip to Lyddy and ran lightly up-stairs. She wished to
14933: surprise her father by this visit, and she succeeded. The little
14934: minister was just then almost surrounded by a wall of books, with merely
14935: his head peeping above them, being much embarrassed to find a substitute
14936: for tables and desks on which to arrange the volumes he kept open for
14937: reference. He was absorbed in mastering all those painstaking
14938: interpretations of the Book of Daniel, which are by this time well gone
14939: to the limbo of mistaken criticism; and Esther, as she opened the door
14940: softly, heard him rehearsing aloud a passage in which he declared, with
14941: some parenthetic provisoes, that he conceived not how a perverse
14942: ingenuity could blunt the edge of prophetic explicitness, or how an open
14943: mind could fail to see in the chronology of "the little horn" the
14944: resplendent lamp of an inspired symbol searching out the germinal growth
14945: of an anti-Christian power.
14946: 
14947: "You will not like me to interrupt you, father?" said Esther, slyly.
14948: 
14949: "Ah, my beloved child!" he exclaimed, upsetting a pile of books, and
14950: thus unintentionally making a convenient breach in his wall, through
14951: which Esther could get up to him and kiss him. "Thy appearing is as a
14952: joy despaired of. I had thought of thee as the blinded think of the
14953: daylight--which indeed is a thing to rejoice in, like all other good,
14954: though we see it not nigh."
14955: 
14956: "Are you sure you have been as well and comfortable as you said you were
14957: in your letters?" said Esther, seating herself close in front of her
14958: father and laying her hand on his shoulder.
14959: 
14960: "I wrote truly, my dear, according to my knowledge at the time. But to
14961: an old memory like mine the present days are but as a little water
14962: poured on the deep. It seems now that all has been as usual, except my
14963: studies, which have gone somewhat curiously into prophetic history. But
14964: I fear you will rebuke me for my negligent apparel," said the little
14965: man, feeling in front of Esther's brightness like a bat overtaken by the
14966: morning.
14967: 
14968: "That is Lyddy's fault, who sits crying over her want of Christian
14969: assurance instead of brushing your clothes and putting out your clean
14970: cravat. She is always saying her righteousness is filthy rags, and
14971: really I don't think that is a very strong expression for it. I'm sure
14972: it is dusty clothes and furniture."
14973: 
14974: "Nay, my dear, your playfulness glances too severely on our faithful
14975: Lyddy. Doubtless I am myself deficient, in that I do not aid her infirm
14976: memory by admonition. But now tell me aught that you have left untold
14977: about yourself. Your heart has gone out somewhat toward this family--the
14978: old man and the child, whom I had not reckoned of?"
14979: 
14980: "Yes, father. It is more and more difficult to me to see how I can make
14981: up my mind to disturb these people at all."
14982: 
14983: "Something should doubtless be devised to lighten the loss and the
14984: change to the aged father and mother. I would have you in any case seek
14985: to temper a vicissitude, which is nevertheless a providential
14986: arrangement not to be wholly set aside."
14987: 
14988: "Do you think, father--do you feel assured that a case of inheritance
14989: like this of mine is a sort of providential arrangement that makes a
14990: command?"
14991: 
14992: "I have so held it," said Mr. Lyon, solemnly; "in all my meditations I
14993: have so held it. For you have to consider, my dear, that you have been
14994: led by a peculiar path, and into experience which is not ordinarily the
14995: lot of those who are seated in high places, and what I have hinted to
14996: you already in my letters on this head, I shall wish on a future
14997: opportunity to enter into more at large."
14998: 
14999: Esther was uneasily silent. On this great question of her lot she saw
15000: doubts and difficulties, in which it seemed as if her father could not
15001: help her. There was no illumination for her in this theory of
15002: providential arrangement. She said suddenly (what she had not thought of
15003: at all suddenly)--
15004: 
15005: "Have you been again to see Felix Holt, father? You have not mentioned
15006: him in your letters."
15007: 
15008: "I have been since I last wrote, my dear, and I took his mother with me,
15009: who, I fear, made the time heavy to him with her plaints. But afterward
15010: I carried her away to the house of a brother minister at Loamford, and
15011: returned to Felix, and then we had much discourse."
15012: 
15013: "Did you tell him of everything that has happened--I mean about
15014: me--about the Transomes?"
15015: 
15016: "Assuredly I told him, and he listened as one astonished. For he had
15017: much to hear, knowing naught of your birth, and that you had any other
15018: father than Rufus Lyon. 'Tis a narrative I trust I shall not be called
15019: on to give to others; but I was not without satisfaction in unfolding
15020: the truth to this young man, who hath wrought himself into my affection
15021: strangely--I would fain hope for ends that will be a visible good in his
15022: less way-worn life, when mine shall be no longer."
15023: 
15024: "And you told him how the Transomes had come, and that I was staying at
15025: Transome Court?"
15026: 
15027: "Yes, I told these things with some particularity, as is my wont
15028: concerning what hath imprinted itself on my mind."
15029: 
15030: "What did Felix say?"
15031: 
15032: "Truly, my dear, nothing desirable to recite," said Mr. Lyon, rubbing
15033: his hand over his brow.
15034: 
15035: "Dear father, he did say something, and you always remember what people
15036: say. Pray tell me; I want to know."
15037: 
15038: "It was a hasty remark, and rather escaped him than was consciously
15039: framed. He said, 'Then she will marry Transome; that is what Transome
15040: means.'"
15041: 
15042: "That was all?" said Esther, turning rather pale, and biting her lip
15043: with the determination that the tears should not start.
15044: 
15045: "Yes, we did not go further into that branch of the subject. I apprehend
15046: there is no warrant for his seeming prognostic, and I should not be
15047: without disquiet if I thought otherwise. For I confess that in your
15048: accession to this great position and property, I contemplate with
15049: hopeful satisfaction your remaining attached to that body of
15050: congregational Dissent, which, as I hold, hath retained most of pure and
15051: primitive discipline. Your education and peculiar history would thus be
15052: seen to have coincided with a long train of events in making this family
15053: property a means of honoring and illustrating a purer form of
15054: Christianity than that which hath unhappily obtained the pre-eminence in
15055: this land. I speak, my child, as you know, always in the hope that you
15056: will fully join our communion; and this dear wish of my heart--nay, this
15057: urgent prayer--would seem to be frustrated by your marriage with a man,
15058: of whom there is at least no visible indication that he would unite
15059: himself to our body."
15060: 
15061: If Esther had been less agitated, she would hardly have helped smiling
15062: at the picture her father's words suggested of Harold Transome "joining
15063: the church" in Malthouse Yard. But she was too seriously preoccupied
15064: with what Felix had said, which hurt her in a two-edged fashion that was
15065: highly significant. First, she was very angry with him for daring to say
15066: positively whom she would marry; and secondly, she was angry at the
15067: implication that there was from the first a cool deliberate design in
15068: Harold Transome to marry her. Esther said to herself that she was quite
15069: capable of discerning Harold Transome's disposition, and judging of his
15070: conduct. She felt sure he was generous and open. It did not lower him in
15071: her opinion that since circumstances had brought them together he
15072: evidently admired her--was in love with her--in short, desired to marry
15073: her; and she thought that she discerned the delicacy which hindered him
15074: from being more explicit. There is no point on which young women are
15075: more easily piqued than this of their sufficiency to judge the men who
15076: make love to them. And Esther's generous nature delighted to believe in
15077: generosity. All these thoughts were making a tumult in her mind while
15078: her father was suggesting the radiance her lot might cast on the cause
15079: of congregational Dissent. She heard what he said, and remembered it
15080: afterward, but she made no reply at present, and chose rather to start
15081: up in search of a brush--an action which would seem to her father quite
15082: a usual sequence with her. It served the purpose of diverting him from a
15083: lengthy subject.
15084: 
15085: "Have you yet spoken with Mr. Transome concerning Mrs. Holt, my dear?"
15086: he said, as Esther was moving about the room. "I hinted to him that you
15087: would best decide how assistance should be tendered to her."
15088: 
15089: "No, father, we have not approached the subject. Mr. Transome may have
15090: forgotten it, and, for several reasons, I would rather not talk of
15091: this--of money matters to him at present. There is money due to me from
15092: the Lukyns and the Pendrells."
15093: 
15094: "They have paid it," said Mr. Lyon, opening his desk. "I have it here
15095: ready to deliver to you."
15096: 
15097: "Keep it, father, and pay Mrs. Holt's rent with it, and do anything else
15098: that is wanted for her. We must consider everything temporary now," said
15099: Esther, enveloping her father in a towel, and beginning to brush his
15100: auburn fringe of hair, while he shut his eyes in preparation for this
15101: pleasant passivity. "Everything is uncertain--what may become of
15102: Felix--what may become of us all. Oh, dear!" she went on, changing
15103: suddenly to laughing merriment, "I am beginning to talk like Lyddy, I
15104: think."
15105: 
15106: "Truly," said Mr. Lyon, smiling, "the uncertainty of things is a text
15107: rather too wide and obvious for fruitful application; and to discourse
15108: of it is, as one may say, to bottle up the air, and make a present of it
15109: to those who are already standing out of doors."
15110: 
15111: "Do you think," said Esther, in the course of their chat, "that the
15112: Treby people know at all about the reasons of my being at Transome
15113: Court?"
15114: 
15115: "I have had no sign thereof: and indeed there is no one, as it appears,
15116: who could make the story public. The man Christian is away in London
15117: with Mr. Debarry, Parliament now beginning; and Mr. Jermyn would
15118: doubtless respect the confidence of the Transomes. I have not seen him
15119: lately. I know nothing of his movements. And so far as my own speech is
15120: concerned, and my strict command to Lyddy, I have withheld the means of
15121: information even as to your having returned to Transome Court in the
15122: carriage, not wishing to give any occasion to solicitous questioning
15123: till time hath somewhat inured me. But it hath got abroad that you are
15124: there, and is the subject of conjectures, whereof, I imagine, the chief
15125: is, that you are gone as companion to Mistress Transome; for some of our
15126: friends have already hinted a rebuke to me that I should permit your
15127: taking a position so little likely to further your spiritual welfare."
15128: 
15129: "Now, father, I think I shall be obliged to run away from you, not to
15130: keep the carriage too long," said Esther, as she finished her reforms on
15131: the minister's toilet. "You look beautiful now, and I must give Lyddy a
15132: little lecture before I go."
15133: 
15134: "Yes, my dear; I would not detain you, seeing that my duties demand me.
15135: But take with you this Treatise, which I have purposely selected. It
15136: concerns all the main questions between ourselves and the
15137: Establishment--government, discipline, state-support. It is seasonable
15138: that you should give a nearer attention to these polemics, lest you be
15139: drawn aside by the fallacious association of a State Church with
15140: elevated rank."
15141: 
15142: Esther chose to take the volume submissively, rather than to adopt the
15143: ungraceful sincerity of saying that she was unable at present to give
15144: her mind to the original functions of a bishop or the comparative merit
15145: of Endowments and Voluntaryism. But she did not run her eyes over the
15146: pages during her solitary drive to get a foretaste of the argument, for
15147: she was entirely occupied with Felix Holt's prophecy that she would
15148: marry Harold Transome.
15149: 
15150: 
15151: 
15152: 
15153: CHAPTER XLII.
15154: 
15155:     Thou sayst it, and not I; for thou hast done
15156:     The ugly deed that made these ugly words.
15157: 
15158:                                      --SOPHOCLES: _Electra_.
15159: 
15160:                        Yea, it becomes a man
15161:     To cherish memory, where he had delight.
15162:     For kindness is the natural birth of kindness.
15163:     Whose soul records not the great debt of joy,
15164:     Is stamped for ever an ignoble man.
15165: 
15166:                                         --SOPHOCLES: _Ajax_.
15167: 
15168: 
15169: It so happened that, on the morning of the day when Esther went to see
15170: her father, Jermyn had not yet heard of her presence at Transome Court.
15171: One fact conducing to keep him in this ignorance was, that some days
15172: after his critical interview with Harold--days during which he had been
15173: wondering how long it would be before Harold made up his mind to
15174: sacrifice the luxury of satisfied anger for the solid advantage of
15175: securing fortune and position--he was peremptorily called away by
15176: business to the south of England, and was obliged to inform Harold by
15177: letter of his absence. He took care also to notify his return; but
15178: Harold made no sign in reply. The days passed without bringing him any
15179: gossip concerning Esther's visit, for such gossip was almost confined to
15180: Mr. Lyon's congregation, her Church pupils, Miss Louisa Jermyn among
15181: them, having been satisfied by her father's written statement that she
15182: was gone on a visit of uncertain duration. But on this day of Esther's
15183: call in Malthouse Yard, the Miss Jermyns in their walk saw her getting
15184: into the Transomes' carriage, which they had previously observed to be
15185: waiting, and which they now saw bowled along on the road toward Little
15186: Treby. It followed that only a few hours later the news reached the
15187: astonished ears of Matthew Jermyn.
15188: 
15189: Entirely ignorant of those converging indications and small links of
15190: incident which had raised Christian's conjectures, and had gradually
15191: contributed to put him in possession of the facts; ignorant too of some
15192: busy motives in the mind of his obliged servant Johnson; Jermyn was not
15193: likely to see at once how the momentous information that Esther was the
15194: surviving Bycliffe could possibly have reached Harold. His daughters
15195: naturally leaped, as others had done, to the conclusion that the
15196: Transomes, seeking a governess for little Harry, had had their choice
15197: directed to Esther, and observed that they must have attracted her by a
15198: high salary to induce her to take charge of such a small pupil; though
15199: of course it was important that his English and French should be
15200: carefully attended to from the first. Jermyn, hearing this suggestion,
15201: was not without a momentary hope that it might be true, and that Harold
15202: was still safely unconscious of having under the same roof with him the
15203: legal claimant of the family estate.
15204: 
15205: But a mind in the grasp of a terrible anxiety is not credulous of easy
15206: solutions. The one stay that bears up our hopes is sure to appear frail,
15207: and if looked at long will seem to totter. Too much depended on that
15208: unconsciousness of Harold's; and although Jermyn did not see the course
15209: of things that could have disclosed and combined the various items of
15210: knowledge which he had imagined to be his own secret, and therefore his
15211: safeguard, he saw quite clearly what was likely to be the result of the
15212: disclosure. Not only would Harold Transome be no longer afraid of him,
15213: but also, by marrying Esther (and Jermyn at once felt sure of this
15214: issue), would be triumphantly freed from any unpleasant consequences,
15215: and could pursue much at his ease the gratification of ruining Matthew
15216: Jermyn. The prevision of an enemy's triumphant ease is in any case
15217: sufficiently irritating to hatred, and there were reasons why it was
15218: peculiarly exasperating here: but Jermyn had not the leisure now for
15219: mere fruitless emotion; he had to think of a possible device which might
15220: save him from imminent ruin--not an indefinite adversity, but a ruin in
15221: detail, which his thoughts painted out with the sharpest, ugliest
15222: intensity. A man of sixty, with an unsuspicious wife and daughters
15223: capable of shrieking and fainting at a sudden revelation, and of looking
15224: at him reproachfully in their daily misery under a shabby lot to which
15225: he had reduced them--with a mind and with habits dried hard by the
15226: years--with no glimpse of an endurable standing-ground except where he
15227: could domineer and be prosperous according to the ambitions of pushing
15228: middle-class gentility,--such a man is likely to find the prospect of
15229: worldly ruin ghastly enough to drive him to the most uninviting means of
15230: escape. He will probably prefer any private scorn that will save him
15231: from public infamy, or that will leave him with money in his pocket, to
15232: the humiliation and hardship of new servitude in old age, a shabby hat
15233: and a melancholy hearth, where the firing must be used charily and the
15234: women look sad. But though a man may be willing to escape through a
15235: sewer, a sewer with an outlet into the dry air is not always at hand.
15236: Running away, especially when spoken of as absconding, seems at a
15237: distance to offer a good modern substitute for the right of sanctuary;
15238: but seen closely, it is often found inconvenient and scarcely possible.
15239: 
15240: Jermyn, on thoroughly considering his position, saw that he had no very
15241: agreeable resources at command. But he soon made up his mind what he
15242: would do next. He wrote to Mrs. Transome requesting her to appoint an
15243: hour in which he could see her privately: he knew she would understand
15244: that it was to be an hour when Harold was not at home. As he sealed the
15245: letter, he indulged a faint hope that in this interview he might be
15246: assured of Esther's birth being unknown at Transome Court; but in the
15247: worst case, perhaps some help might be found in Mrs. Transome. To such
15248: uses may tender relations come when they have ceased to be tender! The
15249: Hazaels of our world who are pushed on quickly against their
15250: preconceived confidence in themselves to do doglike actions by the
15251: sudden suggestion of a wicked ambition, are much fewer than those who
15252: are led on through the years by the gradual demands of a selfishness
15253: which has spread its fibres far and wide through the intricate vanities
15254: and sordid cares of an everyday existence.
15255: 
15256: In consequence of that letter to Mrs. Transome, Jermyn was, two days
15257: afterward, ushered into the smaller drawing-room at Transome Court. It
15258: was a charming little room in its refurbished condition: it had two
15259: pretty inlaid cabinets, great china vases with contents that sent forth
15260: odors of paradise, groups of flowers in oval frames on the walls, and
15261: Mrs. Transome's own portrait in the evening costume of 1800, with a
15262: garden in the background. That brilliant young woman looked smilingly
15263: down on Mr. Jermyn as he passed in front of the fire; and at present
15264: hers was the only gaze in the room. He could not help meeting the gaze
15265: as he waited, holding his hat behind him--could not help seeing many
15266: memories lit up by it; but the strong bent of his mind was to go on
15267: arguing each memory into a claim, and to see in the regard others had
15268: for him a merit of his own. There had been plenty of roads open to him
15269: when he was a young man; perhaps if he had not allowed himself to be
15270: determined (chiefly, of course, by the feelings of others, for of what
15271: effect would his own feelings have been without them?) into the road he
15272: actually took, he might have done better for himself. At any rate, he
15273: was likely at last to get the worst of it, and it was he who had most
15274: reason to complain. The fortunate Jason, as we know from Euripides,
15275: piously thanked the goddess, and saw clearly that he was not at all
15276: obliged to Medea; Jermyn was, perhaps, not aware of the precedent, but
15277: thought out his own freedom from obligation and the indebtedness of
15278: others toward him with a native faculty not inferior to Jason's.
15279: 
15280: Before three minutes had passed, however, as if by some sorcery, the
15281: brilliant smiling young woman above the mantelpiece seemed to be
15282: appearing at the doorway withered and frosted by many winters, and with
15283: lips and eyes from which the smile had departed. Jermyn advanced, and
15284: they shook hands, but neither of them said anything by way of greeting.
15285: Mrs. Transome seated herself, and pointed to a chair opposite and near
15286: her.
15287: 
15288: "Harold has gone to Loamford," she said, in a subdued tone. "You had
15289: something particular to say to me?"
15290: 
15291: "Yes," said Jermyn, with his soft and deferential air. "The last time I
15292: was here I could not take the opportunity of speaking to you. But I am
15293: anxious to know whether you are aware of what has passed between me and
15294: Harold?"
15295: 
15296: "Yes, he has told me everything."
15297: 
15298: "About his proceedings against me? and the reason he stopped them?"
15299: 
15300: "Yes: have you had notice that he has begun them again?"
15301: 
15302: "No," said Jermyn, with a very unpleasant sensation.
15303: 
15304: "Of course he will now," said Mrs. Transome. "There is no reason in his
15305: mind why he should not."
15306: 
15307: "Has he resolved to risk the estate then?"
15308: 
15309: "He feels in no danger on that score. And if there were, the danger
15310: doesn't depend on you. The most likely thing is, that he will marry this
15311: girl."
15312: 
15313: "He knows everything then?" said Jermyn, the expression of his face
15314: getting clouded.
15315: 
15316: "Everything. It's of no use for you to think of mastering him: you can't
15317: do it. I used to wish Harold to be fortunate, and he is fortunate," said
15318: Mrs. Transome, with intense bitterness. "It's not my star that he
15319: inherits."
15320: 
15321: "Do you know how he came by the information about this girl?"
15322: 
15323: "No; but she knew it all before we spoke to her. It's no secret."
15324: 
15325: Jermyn was confounded by this hopeless frustration to which he had no
15326: key. Though he thought of Christian, the thought shed no light; but the
15327: more fatal point was clear: he held no secret that could help him.
15328: 
15329: "You are aware that these chancery proceedings may ruin me?"
15330: 
15331: "He told me they would. But if you are imagining I can do anything, pray
15332: dismiss the notion. I have told him as plainly as I dare that I wish him
15333: to drop all public quarrel with you, and that you could make an
15334: arrangement without scandal. I can do no more. He will not listen to me;
15335: he doesn't mind about my feelings. He cares more for Mr. Transome than
15336: he does for me. He will not listen to me any more than if I were an old
15337: ballad-singer."
15338: 
15339: "It's very hard on me, I know," said Jermyn, in the tone with which a
15340: man flings out a reproach.
15341: 
15342: "I besought you three months ago to bear anything rather than quarrel
15343: with him."
15344: 
15345: "I have not quarrelled with him. It is he who has been always seeking a
15346: quarrel with me. I have borne a great deal--more than any one else
15347: would. He set his teeth against me from the first."
15348: 
15349: "He saw things that annoyed him; and men are not like women," said Mrs.
15350: Transome. There was bitter innuendo in that truism.
15351: 
15352: "It's very hard on me--I know that," said Jermyn, with an
15353: intensification of his previous tone, rising and walking a step or two,
15354: then turning and laying his hand on the back of the chair. "Of course
15355: the law in this case can't in the least represent the justice of the
15356: matter. I made a good many sacrifices in times past. I gave up a great
15357: deal of fine business for the sake of attending to the family affairs,
15358: and in that lawsuit they would have gone to rack and ruin if it hadn't
15359: been for me."
15360: 
15361: He moved away again, laid down his hat, which he had been previously
15362: holding, and thrust his hands into his pockets as he returned. Mrs.
15363: Transome sat motionless as marble, and almost as pale. Her hands lay
15364: crossed on her knees. This man, young, slim, and graceful, with a
15365: selfishness which then took the form of homage to her, had at one time
15366: kneeled to her and kissed those hands fervently, and she had thought
15367: there was a poetry in such passion beyond any to be found in everyday
15368: domesticity.
15369: 
15370: "I stretched my conscience a good deal in that affair of Bycliffe, as
15371: you know perfectly well. I told you everything at the time. I told you I
15372: was very uneasy about those witnesses, and about getting him thrown into
15373: prison. I know it's the blackest thing anybody could charge me with, if
15374: they knew my life from beginning to end; and I should never have done
15375: it, if I had not been under an infatuation such as makes a man do
15376: anything. What did it signify to me about the loss of the lawsuit? I was
15377: a young bachelor--I had the world before me."
15378: 
15379: "Yes," said Mrs. Transome, in a low tone. "It was a pity you didn't make
15380: another choice."
15381: 
15382: "What would have become of you?" said Jermyn, carried along a climax,
15383: like other self-justifiers. "I had to think of you. You would not have
15384: liked me to make another choice then."
15385: 
15386: "Clearly," said Mrs. Transome, with concentrated bitterness, but still
15387: quietly; "the greater mistake was mine."
15388: 
15389: Egoism is usually stupid in a dialogue; but Jermyn's did not make him so
15390: stupid that he did not feel the edge of Mrs. Transome's words. They
15391: increased his irritation.
15392: 
15393: "I hardly see that," he replied, with a slight laugh of scorn. "You had
15394: an estate and a position to save, to go no farther. I remember very well
15395: what you said to me--'A clever lawyer can do anything if he has the
15396: will; if it's impossible, he will make it possible. And the property is
15397: sure to be Harold's some day.' He was a baby then."
15398: 
15399: "I remember most things a little too well; you had better say at once
15400: what is your object in recalling them."
15401: 
15402: "An object that is nothing more than justice. With the relation I stood
15403: in, it was not likely I should think myself bound by all the forms that
15404: are made to bind strangers. I had often immense trouble to raise the
15405: money necessary to pay off debts and carry on the affairs; and, as I
15406: said before, I had given up other lines of advancement which would have
15407: been open to me if I had not stayed in this neighborhood at a critical
15408: time when I was fresh to the world. Anybody who knew the whole
15409: circumstances would say that my being hunted and run down on the score
15410: of my past transactions with regard to the family affairs, is an
15411: abominably unjust and unnatural thing."
15412: 
15413: Jermyn paused a moment, and then added, "At my time of life----and with
15414: a family about me----and after what has passed----I should have thought
15415: there was nothing you would care more to prevent."
15416: 
15417: "I do care. It makes me miserable. That is the extent of my power--to
15418: feel miserable."
15419: 
15420: "No, it is not the extent of your power. You could save me if you would.
15421: It is not to be supposed that Harold would go on against me--if he knew
15422: the whole truth."
15423: 
15424: Jermyn had sat down before he uttered the last words. He had lowered his
15425: voice slightly. He had the air of one who thought that he had prepared
15426: the way for an understanding. That a man with so much sharpness, with so
15427: much suavity at command--a man who piqued himself on his persuasiveness
15428: toward women--should behave just as Jermyn did on this occasion, would
15429: be surprising but for the constant experience that temper and selfish
15430: insensibility will defeat excellent gifts--will make a sensible person
15431: shout when shouting is out of place, and will make a polished man rude
15432: when his polish might be of eminent use to him.
15433: 
15434: As Jermyn, sitting down and leaning forward with an elbow on his knee,
15435: uttered his last words--"if he knew the whole truth"--a slight shock
15436: seemed to pass through Mrs. Transome's hitherto motionless body,
15437: followed by a sudden light in her eyes, as in an animal's about to
15438: spring.
15439: 
15440: "And you expect me to tell him?" she said, not loudly, but yet with a
15441: clear metallic ring in her voice.
15442: 
15443: "Would it not be right for him to know?" said Jermyn, in a more bland
15444: and persuasive tone than he had yet used.
15445: 
15446: Perhaps some of the most terrible irony of the human lot is this of a
15447: deep truth coming to be uttered by lips that have no right to it.
15448: 
15449: "I will never tell him!" said Mrs. Transome, starting up, her whole
15450: frame thrilled with a passion that seemed almost to make her young
15451: again. Her hands hung beside her clenched tightly, her eyes and lips
15452: lost the helpless repressed bitterness of discontent, and seemed
15453: suddenly fed with energy. "You reckon up your sacrifices for me: you
15454: have kept a good account of them, and it is needful: they are some of
15455: them what no one else could guess or find out. But you made your
15456: sacrifices when they seemed pleasant to you; when you told me they were
15457: your happiness; when you told me that it was I who stooped, and I who
15458: bestowed favors."
15459: 
15460: Jermyn rose too, and laid his hand on the back of the chair. He had
15461: grown visibly paler, but seemed about to speak.
15462: 
15463: "Don't speak!" Mrs. Transome said peremptorily. "Don't open your lips
15464: again. You have said enough; I will speak now. I have made sacrifices
15465: too, but it was when I knew that they were not my happiness. It was
15466: after I saw that I had stooped--after I saw that your tenderness had
15467: turned into calculation--after I saw that you cared for yourself only,
15468: and not for me. I heard your explanations--of your duty in life--of our
15469: mutual reputation--of a virtuous young lady attached to you. I bore it;
15470: I let everything go; I shut my eyes: I might almost have let myself
15471: starve, rather than have scenes of quarrel with the man I had loved, in
15472: which I must accuse him of turning my love into a good bargain." There
15473: was a slight tremor in Mrs. Transome's voice in the last words, and for
15474: a moment she paused: but when she spoke again it seemed as if the tremor
15475: had frozen into a cutting icicle. "I suppose if a lover picked one's
15476: pocket, there's no woman would like to own it. I don't say I was not
15477: afraid of you: I was afraid of you, and I know now I was right."
15478: 
15479: "Mrs. Transome," said Jermyn, white to the lips, "it is needless to say
15480: more. I withdraw any words that have offended you."
15481: 
15482: "You can't withdraw them. Can a man apologize for being a dastard?--And
15483: I have caused you to strain your conscience, have I?--it is I who have
15484: sullied your purity? I should think the demons have more honor--they are
15485: not so impudent to one another. I would not lose the misery of being a
15486: woman, now I see what can be the baseness of a man. One must be a
15487: man--first to tell a woman that her love has made her your debtor, and
15488: then ask her to pay you by breaking the last poor threads between her
15489: and her son."
15490: 
15491: "I do not ask it," said Jermyn, with a certain asperity. He was
15492: beginning to find this intolerable. The mere brute strength of a
15493: masculine creature rebelled. He felt almost inclined to throttle the
15494: voice out of this woman.
15495: 
15496: "You do ask it: it is what you would like. I have had a terror on me
15497: lest evil should happen to you. From the first, after Harold came home,
15498: I had a terrible dread. It seemed as if murder might come between you--I
15499: didn't know what. I felt the horror of his not knowing the truth. I
15500: might have been dragged at last, by my own feeling--by my own memory--to
15501: tell him all, and make him as well as myself miserable, to save you."
15502: 
15503: Again there was a slight tremor, as if at the remembrance of womanly
15504: tenderness and pity. But immediately she launched forth again.
15505: 
15506: "But now you have asked me, I will never tell him! Be ruined--no--do
15507: something more dastardly to save yourself. If I sinned, my judgment went
15508: beforehand--that I should sin for a man like you."
15509: 
15510: Swiftly upon those last words Mrs. Transome passed out of the room. The
15511: softly padded door closed behind her making no noise, and Jermyn found
15512: himself alone.
15513: 
15514: For a brief space he stood still. Human beings in moments of passionate
15515: reproach and denunciation, especially when their anger is on their own
15516: account, are never so wholly in the right that the person who has to
15517: wince cannot possibly protest against some unreasonableness or
15518: unfairness in their outburst. And if Jermyn had been capable of feeling
15519: that he had thoroughly merited this infliction, he would not have
15520: uttered the words that drew it down on him. Men do not become penitent
15521: and learn to abhor themselves by having their backs cut open with the
15522: lash; rather, they learn to abhor the lash. What Jermyn felt about Mrs.
15523: Transome when she disappeared was, that she was a furious woman--who
15524: would not do what he wanted her to do. And he was supported as to his
15525: justifiableness by the inward repetition of what he had already said to
15526: her; it was right that Harold should know the truth. He did not take
15527: into account (how should he?) the exasperation and loathing excited by
15528: his daring to urge the plea of right. A man who had stolen the pyx, and
15529: got frightened when justice was at his heels, might feel the sort of
15530: penitence which would induce him to run back in the dark and lay the pyx
15531: where the sexton might find it; but if in doing so he whispered to the
15532: Blessed Virgin that he was moved by considering the sacredness of all
15533: property, and the peculiar sacredness of the pyx, it is not to be
15534: believed that she would like him the better for it. Indeed, one often
15535: seems to see why the saints should prefer candles to words, especially
15536: from penitents whose skin is in danger. Some salt of generosity would
15537: have made Jermyn conscious that he had lost the citizenship which
15538: authorized him to plead the right; still more, that his self-vindication
15539: to Mrs. Transome would be like the exhibition of a brand-mark, and only
15540: show that he was shame-proof. There is heroism even in the circles of
15541: hell for fellow-sinners who cling to each other in the fiery whirlwind
15542: and never recriminate. But these things, which are easy to discern when
15543: they are painted for us on the large canvas of poetic story, become
15544: confused and obscure even for well-read gentlemen when their affection
15545: for themselves is alarmed by pressing details of actual experience. If
15546: their comparison of instances is active at such times, it is chiefly in
15547: showing them that their own case has subtle distinctions from all other
15548: cases, which should free them from unmitigated condemnation.
15549: 
15550: And it was in this way with Matthew Jermyn. So many things were more
15551: distinctly visible to him, and touched him more acutely, than the effect
15552: of his acts or words on Mrs. Transome's feelings! In fact--he asked,
15553: with a touch of something that makes us all akin--was it not
15554: preposterous, this excess of feeling on points which he himself did not
15555: find powerfully moving? She had treated him most unreasonably. It would
15556: have been right for her to do what he had--not asked, but only hinted at
15557: in a mild and interrogatory manner. But the clearest and most unpleasant
15558: result of the interview was, that this right thing which he desired so
15559: much would certainly not be done for him by Mrs. Transome.
15560: 
15561: As he was moving his arm from the chair-back, and turning to take his
15562: hat, there was a boisterous noise in the entrance-hall; the door of the
15563: drawing-room, which had closed without latching, was pushed open, and
15564: old Mr. Transome appeared with a face of feeble delight, playing horse
15565: to little Harry, who roared and flogged behind him, while Moro yapped in
15566: a puppy voice at their heels. But when Mr. Transome saw Jermyn in the
15567: room he stood still in the doorway, as if he did not know whether
15568: entrance was permissible. The majority of his thoughts were but ravelled
15569: threads of the past. The attorney came forward to shake hands with due
15570: politeness, but the old man said, with a bewildered look, and in a
15571: hesitating way--
15572: 
15573: "Mr. Jermyn?--why--why--where is Mrs. Transome?"
15574: 
15575: Jermyn smiled his way out past the unexpected group; and little Harry,
15576: thinking he had an eligible opportunity, turned round to give a parting
15577: stroke on the stranger's coat-tails.
15578: 
15579: 
15580: 
15581: 
15582: CHAPTER XLIII.
15583: 
15584:     Whichever way my days decline,
15585:       I felt and feel, though left alone,
15586:       His being working in mine own,
15587:     The footsteps of his life in mine.
15588: 
15589:            *       *       *       *       *
15590: 
15591:     Dear friend, far off, my lost desire
15592:       So far, so near, in woe and weal;
15593:       Oh, loved the most when most I feel
15594:     There is a lower and a higher!
15595: 
15596:                                   --TENNYSON: _In Memoriam_.
15597: 
15598: 
15599: After that morning on which Esther found herself reddened and confused
15600: by the sense of having made a distant allusion to Felix Holt, she felt
15601: it impossible that she should even, as she had sometimes intended, speak
15602: of him explicitly to Harold, in order to discuss probabilities as to the
15603: issue of his trial. She was certain she could not do it without
15604: betraying emotion, and there were very complex reasons in Esther's mind
15605: why she could not bear that Harold should detect her sensibility on this
15606: subject. It was not only all the fibres of maidenly pride and reserve,
15607: of a bashfulness undefinably peculiar toward this man, who, while much
15608: older than herself, and bearing the stamp of an experience quite hidden
15609: from her imagination, was taking strongly the aspect of a lover--it was
15610: not only this exquisite kind of shame which was at work within her:
15611: there was another sort of susceptibility in Esther, which her present
15612: circumstances tended to encourage, though she had come to regard it as
15613: not at all lofty, but rather as something which condemned her to
15614: littleness in comparison with a mind she had learned to venerate. She
15615: knew quite well that, to Harold Transome, Felix Holt was one of the
15616: common people who could come into question in no other than a public
15617: light. She had a native capability for discerning that the sense of
15618: ranks and degrees has its repulsions corresponding to the repulsions
15619: dependent on difference of race and color; and she remembered her own
15620: impressions too well not to foresee that it would come on Harold
15621: Transome as a shock, if he suspected there had been any love-passages
15622: between her and this young man, who to him was of course no more than
15623: any other intelligent member of the working class. "To him," said Esther
15624: to herself, with a reaction of her newer, better pride, "who has not had
15625: the sort of intercourse in which Felix Holt's cultured nature would have
15626: asserted its superiority." And in her fluctuations on this matter, she
15627: found herself mentally protesting that, whatever Harold might think,
15628: there was a light in which he was vulgar compared with Felix. Felix had
15629: ideas and motives which she did not believe Harold could understand.
15630: More than all, there was this test: she herself had no sense of
15631: inferiority and just subjection when she was with Harold Transome; there
15632: were even points in him for which she felt a touch, not of anger, but of
15633: playful scorn; whereas with Felix she had always a sense of dependence
15634: and possible illumination. In those large, grave, candid gray eyes of
15635: his, love seemed something that belonged to the high enthusiasm of life,
15636: such as now might be forever shut out from her.
15637: 
15638: All the same, her vanity winced at the idea that Harold should discern
15639: what, from his point of view, would seem like a degradation of her taste
15640: and refinement. She could not help being gratified by all the
15641: manifestations from those around her that she was thought thoroughly
15642: fitted for a high position--could not help enjoying, with more or less
15643: keenness, a rehearsal of that demeanor amongst luxuries and dignities
15644: which had often been a part of her day-dreams, and the rehearsal
15645: included the reception of more and more emphatic attentions from Harold,
15646: and of an effusiveness in his manners, which, in proportion as it would
15647: have been offensive if it had appeared earlier, became flattering as the
15648: effect of a growing acquaintance and daily contact. It comes in so many
15649: forms in this life of ours--the knowledge that there is something
15650: sweetest and noblest of which we despair, and the sense of something
15651: present that solicits us with an immediate and easy indulgence. And
15652: there is a pernicious falsity in the pretence that a woman's love lies
15653: above the range of such temptations.
15654: 
15655: Day after day Esther had an arm offered her, had very beaming looks upon
15656: her, had opportunities for a great deal of light, airy talk, in which
15657: she knew herself to be charming, and had the attractive interest of
15658: noticing Harold's practical cleverness--the masculine ease with which he
15659: governed everybody and administered everything about him, without the
15660: least harshness, and with a facile good-nature which yet was not weak.
15661: In the background, too, there was the ever-present consideration, that
15662: if Harold Transome wished to marry her, and she accepted him, the
15663: problem of her lot would be more easily solved than in any other way. It
15664: was difficult, by any theory of Providence, or consideration of results,
15665: to see a course which she could call duty: if something would come and
15666: urge itself strongly as pleasure, and save her from the effort to find a
15667: clue of principle amid the labyrinthine confusions of right and
15668: possession, the promise could not but seem alluring. And yet, this life
15669: at Transome Court was _not_ the life of her day-dreams: there was
15670: dullness already in its ease, and in the absence of high demand; and
15671: there was a vague consciousness that the love of this not unfascinating
15672: man who hovered about her gave an air of moral mediocrity to all her
15673: prospects. She would not have been able perhaps to define this
15674: impression; but somehow or other by this elevation of fortune it seemed
15675: that the higher ambition which had begun to spring in her was forever
15676: nullified. All life seemed cheapened; as it might seem to a young
15677: student who, having believed that to gain a certain degree he must write
15678: a thesis in which he would bring his powers to bear with memorable
15679: effect, suddenly ascertained that no thesis was expected, but the sum
15680: (in English money) of twenty-seven pounds ten shillings and sixpence.
15681: 
15682: After all, she was a woman, and could not make her own lot. As she had
15683: once said to Felix, "A woman must choose meaner things, because only
15684: meaner things are offered to her." Her lot is made for her by the love
15685: she accepts. And Esther began to think that her lot was being made for
15686: her by the love that was surrounding her with the influence of a garden
15687: on a summer morning.
15688: 
15689: Harold, on his side, was conscious that the interest of his wooing was
15690: not standing still. He was beginning to think it a conquest, in which it
15691: would be disappointing to fail, even if this fair nymph had no claim to
15692: the estate. He would have liked--and yet he would not have liked--that
15693: just a slight shadow of doubt as to his success should be removed. There
15694: was something about Esther that he did not altogether understand. She
15695: was clearly a woman that could be governed: she was too charming for him
15696: to fear that she would ever be obstinate or interfering. Yet there was a
15697: lightning that shot out of her now and then, which seemed the sign of a
15698: dangerous judgment; as if she inwardly saw something more admirable than
15699: Harold Transome. Now, to be perfectly charming, a woman should not see
15700: this.
15701: 
15702: One fine February day, when already the golden and purple crocuses were
15703: out on the terrace--one of those flattering days which sometimes precede
15704: the north-east winds of March, and make believe that the coming spring
15705: will be enjoyable--a very striking group, of whom Esther and Harold made
15706: a part, came out at midday to walk upon the gravel at Transome Court.
15707: They did not, as usual, go toward the pleasure grounds on the eastern
15708: side, because Mr. Lingon, who was one of them, was going home, and his
15709: road lay through the stone gateway into the park.
15710: 
15711: Uncle Lingon, who disliked painful confidences, and preferred knowing
15712: "no mischief of anybody," had not objected to be let into the important
15713: secret about Esther, and was sure at once that the whole affair, instead
15714: of being a misfortune, was a piece of excellent luck. For himself, he
15715: did not profess to be a judge of women, but she seemed to have all the
15716: "points," and to carry herself as well as Arabella did, which was saying
15717: a good deal. Honest Jack Lingon's first impressions quickly became
15718: traditions, which no subsequent evidence could disturb. He was fond of
15719: his sister, and seemed never to be conscious of any change for the worse
15720: in her since their early time. He considered that man a beast who said
15721: anything unpleasant about the persons to whom he was attached. It was
15722: not that he winked; his wide-open eyes saw nothing but what his easy
15723: disposition inclined him to see. Harold was a good fellow, a clever
15724: chap; and Esther's peculiar fitness for him, under all the
15725: circumstances, was extraordinary; it reminded him of something in the
15726: classics, though he couldn't think exactly what--in fact, a memory was a
15727: nasty uneasy thing. Esther was always glad when the old rector came.
15728: With an odd contrariety to her former niceties she liked his rough
15729: attire and careless frank speech; they were something not point device
15730: that seemed to connect the life of Transome Court with that rougher,
15731: commoner world where her home had been.
15732: 
15733: She and Harold were walking a little in advance of the rest of the
15734: party, who were retarded by various causes. Old Mr. Transome, wrapped in
15735: a cloth cloak trimmed with sable, and with a soft warm cap also trimmed
15736: with fur on his head, had a shuffling uncertain walk. Little Harry was
15737: dragging a toy vehicle, on the seat of which he had insisted on tying
15738: Moro with a piece of scarlet drapery round him, making him look like a
15739: barbaric prince in a chariot. Moro, having little imagination, objected
15740: to this, and barked with feeble snappishness as the tyrannous lad ran
15741: forward, then whirled the chariot round, and ran back to "Gappa," then
15742: came to a dead stop, which overset the chariot, that he might watch
15743: Uncle Lingon's water-spaniel run for the hurled stick and bring it in
15744: his mouth. Nimrod kept close to his old master's legs, glancing with
15745: much indifference at this youthful ardor about sticks--he had "gone
15746: through all that"; and Dominic walked by, looking on blandly, and
15747: taking care both of young and old. Mrs. Transome was not there.
15748: 
15749: [Illustration: ESTHER LYON AND HAROLD TRANSOME.]
15750: 
15751: Looking back and seeing that they were a good deal in advance of the
15752: rest, Esther and Harold paused.
15753: 
15754: "What do you think about thinning the trees over there?" said Harold,
15755: pointing with his stick. "I have a bit of a notion that if they were
15756: divided into clumps so as to show the oaks beyond it would be a great
15757: improvement. It would give an idea of extent that is lost now. And there
15758: might be some very pretty clumps got out of those mixed trees. What do
15759: you think?"
15760: 
15761: "I should think it would be an improvement. One likes a 'beyond'
15762: everywhere. But I never heard you express yourself so dubiously," said
15763: Esther, looking at him rather archly: "you generally see things so
15764: clearly, and are so convinced, that I shall begin to feel quite
15765: tottering if I find you in uncertainty. Pray don't begin to be doubtful;
15766: it is infectious."
15767: 
15768: "You think me a great deal too sure--too confident?" said Harold.
15769: 
15770: "Not at all. It is an immense advantage to know your own will, when you
15771: always mean to have it."
15772: 
15773: "But suppose I couldn't get it, in spite of meaning?" said Harold, with
15774: a beaming inquiry in his eyes.
15775: 
15776: "Oh, then," said Esther, turning her head aside, carelessly, as if she
15777: were considering the distant birch-stems, "you would bear it quite
15778: easily, as you did your not getting into Parliament. You would know you
15779: could get it another time--or get something else as good."
15780: 
15781: "The fact is," said Harold, moving on a little, as if he did not want to
15782: be quite overtaken by the others, "you consider me a fat, fatuous,
15783: self-satisfied fellow."
15784: 
15785: "Oh, there are degrees," said Esther, with a silvery laugh; "you have
15786: just as much of those qualities as is becoming. There are different
15787: styles. You are perfect in your own."
15788: 
15789: "But you prefer another style, I suspect. A more submissive, tearful,
15790: devout worshipper, who would offer his incense with more trembling."
15791: 
15792: "You are quite mistaken," said Esther, still lightly. "I find I am very
15793: wayward. When anything is offered to me, it seems that I prize it less,
15794: and don't want to have it."
15795: 
15796: Here was a very baulking answer, but in spite of it Harold could not
15797: help believing that Esther was very far from objecting to the sort of
15798: incense he had been offering just then.
15799: 
15800: "I have often read that that is in human nature," she went on, "yet it
15801: takes me by surprise in myself. I suppose," she added, smiling, "I
15802: didn't think of myself as human nature."
15803: 
15804: "I don't confess to the same waywardness," said Harold. "I am very fond
15805: of things that I can get. And I never longed much for anything out of my
15806: reach. Whatever I feel sure of getting I like all the better. I think
15807: half those priggish maxims about human nature in the lump are no more to
15808: be relied on than universal remedies. There are different sorts of human
15809: nature. Some are given to discontent and longing, others to securing and
15810: enjoying. And let me tell you, the discontented longing style is
15811: unpleasant to live with."
15812: 
15813: Harold nodded with a meaning smile at Esther.
15814: 
15815: "Oh, I assure you I have abjured all admiration for it," she said,
15816: smiling up at him in return.
15817: 
15818: She was remembering the schooling Felix had given her about her Byronic
15819: heroes, and was inwardly adding a third sort of human nature to those
15820: varieties which Harold had mentioned. He naturally supposed that he
15821: might take the abjuration to be entirely in his own favor. And his face
15822: did look very pleasant; she could not help liking him, although he was
15823: certainly too particular about sauces, gravies, and wines, and had a way
15824: of virtually measuring the value of everything by the contribution it
15825: made to his own pleasure. His very good-nature was unsympathetic; it
15826: never came from any thorough understanding or deep respect for what was
15827: in the mind of the person he obliged or indulged; it was like his
15828: kindness to his mother--an arrangement of his for the happiness of
15829: others, which, if they were sensible, ought to succeed. And an
15830: inevitable comparison which haunted her, showed her the same quality in
15831: his political views: the utmost enjoyment of his own advantages was the
15832: solvent that blended pride in his family and position, with the adhesion
15833: to changes that were to obliterate tradition and melt down enchased gold
15834: heirlooms into plating for the egg-spoons of "the people." It is
15835: terrible--the keen bright eye of a woman when it has once been turned
15836: with admiration on what is severely true; but then, the severely true
15837: rarely comes within its range of vision. Esther had had an unusual
15838: illumination; Harold did not know how, but he discerned enough of the
15839: effect to make him more cautious than he had ever been in his life
15840: before. That caution would have prevented him just then from following
15841: up the question as to the style of person Esther would think pleasant to
15842: live with, even if Uncle Lingon had not joined them, as he did, to talk
15843: about soughing tiles, saying presently that he should turn across the
15844: grass and get on to the Home Farm, to have a look at the improvements
15845: that Harold was making with such racing speed.
15846: 
15847: "But you know, lad," said the rector, as they paused at the expected
15848: parting, "you can't do everything in a hurry. The wheat must have time
15849: to grow, even when you've reformed all us old Tories off the face of the
15850: ground. Dash it! now the election's over, I'm an old Tory again. You
15851: see, Harold, a Radical won't do for the county. At another election, you
15852: must be on the look-out for a borough where they want a bit of blood. I
15853: should have liked you uncommonly to stand for the county; and a Radical
15854: of good family squares well enough with a new-fashioned Tory like young
15855: Debarry; but you see, these riots--it's been a nasty business. I shall
15856: have my hair combed at the sessions for a year to come. But, heyday!
15857: What dame is this, with a small boy?--not one of my parishioners?"
15858: 
15859: Harold and Esther turned, and saw an elderly woman advancing with a tiny
15860: red-haired boy, scantily attired as to his jacket, which merged into a
15861: small sparrow-tail a little higher than his waist, but muffled as to his
15862: throat with a blue woollen comforter. Esther recognized the pair too
15863: well, and felt very uncomfortable. We are so pitiably in subjection to
15864: all sorts of vanity--even the very vanities we are practically
15865: renouncing! And in spite of the almost solemn memories connected with
15866: Mrs. Holt, Esther's first shudder was raised by the idea of what things
15867: this woman would say, and by the mortification of having Felix in any
15868: way represented by his mother.
15869: 
15870: As Mrs. Holt advanced into closer observation, it became more evident
15871: that she was attired with a view not to charm the eye, but rather to
15872: afflict it with all that expression of woe which belongs to very rusty
15873: bombazine and the limpest state of false hair. Still, she was not a
15874: woman to lose the sense of her own value, or become abject in her
15875: manners under any circumstances of depression; and she had a peculiar
15876: sense on the present occasion that she was justly relying on the force
15877: of her own character and judgment, in independence of anything that Mr.
15878: Lyon or the masterful Felix would have said, if she had thought them
15879: worthy to know of her undertaking. She courtesied once, as if to the
15880: entire group, now including even the dogs, who showed various degrees of
15881: curiosity, especially as to what kind of game the smaller animal Job
15882: might prove to be after due investigation; and then she proceeded at
15883: once toward Esther, who, in spite of her annoyance, took her arm from
15884: Harold's, said, "How do you do, Mrs. Holt?" very kindly, and stooped to
15885: pat little Job.
15886: 
15887: "Yes--you know him, Miss Lyon," said Mrs. Holt, in that tone which
15888: implies that the conversation is intended for the edification of the
15889: company generally; "you know the orphin child, as Felix brought home for
15890: me that am his mother to take care of. And it's what I've done--nobody
15891: more so--though it's trouble is my reward."
15892: 
15893: Esther had raised herself again, to stand in helpless endurance of
15894: whatever might be coming. But by this time young Harry, struck even more
15895: than the dogs by the appearance of Job Tudge, had come round dragging
15896: his chariot, and placed himself close to the pale child, whom he
15897: exceeded in height and breadth, as well as in depth of coloring. He
15898: looked into Job's eyes, peeped round at the tail of his jacket and
15899: pulled it a little, and then, taking off the tiny cloth-cap, observed
15900: with much interest the tight red curls which had been hidden underneath
15901: it. Job looked at his inspector with the round blue eyes of
15902: astonishment, until Harry, purely by way of experiment, took a bon-bon
15903: from a fantastic wallet which hung over his shoulder, and applied the
15904: test to Job's lips. The result was satisfactory to both. Every one had
15905: been watching this small comedy, and when Job crunched the bon-bon while
15906: Harry looked down at him inquiringly and patted his back, there was
15907: general laughter except on the part of Mrs. Holt, who was shaking her
15908: head slowly, and slapping the back of her left hand with the painful
15909: patience of a tragedian whose part is in abeyance to an ill-timed
15910: introduction of the humorous.
15911: 
15912: "I hope Job's cough has been better lately," said Esther, in mere
15913: uncertainty as to what it would be desirable to say or do.
15914: 
15915: "I dare say you hope so, Miss Lyon," said Mrs. Holt, looking at the
15916: distant landscape. "I've no reason to disbelieve but what you wish well
15917: to the child, and to Felix, and to me. I'm sure nobody has any occasion
15918: to wish me otherways. My character will bear enquiry, and what you, as
15919: are young, don't know, others can tell you. That was what I said to
15920: myself when I made up my mind to come here and see you, and ask you to
15921: get me the freedom to speak to Mr. Transome. I said, whatever Miss Lyon
15922: may be now, in the way of being lifted up among great people, she's our
15923: minister's daughter, and was not above coming to my house and walking
15924: with my son Felix--though I'll not deny he made that figure on the
15925: Lord's Day, that'll perhaps go against him with the judge, if anybody
15926: thinks well to tell him."
15927: 
15928: Here Mrs. Holt paused a moment, as with a mind arrested by the painful
15929: image it had called up.
15930: 
15931: Esther's face was glowing, when Harold glanced at her; and seeing this,
15932: he was considerate enough to address Mrs. Holt instead of her.
15933: 
15934: "You are then the mother of the unfortunate young man who is in prison?"
15935: 
15936: "Indeed I am, sir," said Mrs. Holt, feeling that she was now in deep
15937: water. "It's not likely I should claim him if he wasn't my own; though
15938: it's not by my will, nor my advice, sir, that he ever walked; for I gave
15939: him none but good. But if everybody's son was guided by their mothers,
15940: the world 'ud be different; my son is not worse than many another
15941: woman's son, and that in Treby, whatever they may say as haven't got
15942: their sons in prison. And as to his giving up the doctoring, and then
15943: stopping his father's medicines, I know it's bad--that I know--but it's
15944: me has had to suffer, and it's me a king and Parliament 'ud consider, if
15945: they meant to do the right thing, and had anybody to make it known to
15946: 'em. And as for the rioting and killing the constable--my son said most
15947: plain to me he never meant it, and there was his bit of potato-pie for
15948: dinner getting dry by the fire, the whole blessed time as I sat and
15949: never knew what was coming on me. And it's my opinion as if great people
15950: make elections to get themselves into Parliament, and there's riot and
15951: murder to do it, they ought to see as the widow and the widow's son
15952: doesn't suffer for it. I well know my duty: and I read my Bible; and I
15953: know in Jude where it's been stained with the dried tulip-leaves this
15954: many a year, as you're told not to rail at your betters if they was the
15955: devil himself; nor will I; but this I do say, if it's three Mr.
15956: Transomes instead of one as is listening to me, as there's them ought to
15957: go to the king and get him to let off my son Felix."
15958: 
15959: This speech, in its chief points, had been deliberately prepared. Mrs.
15960: Holt had set her face like a flint, to make the gentry know their duty
15961: as she knew hers: her defiant defensive tone was due to the
15962: consciousness, not only that she was braving a powerful audience, but
15963: that she was daring to stand on the strong basis of her own judgment in
15964: opposition to her son's. Her proposals had been waived off by Mr Lyon
15965: and Felix; but she had long had the feminine conviction that if she
15966: could "get to speak" in the right quarter, things might be different.
15967: The daring bit of impromptu about the three Mr. Transomes was
15968: immediately suggested by a movement of old Mr. Transome to the
15969: foreground in a line with Mr. Lingon and Harold; his furred and unusual
15970: costume appearing to indicate a mysterious dignity which she must hasten
15971: to include in her appeal.
15972: 
15973: And there were reasons that none could have foreseen, which made Mrs.
15974: Holt's remonstrance immediately effective. While old Mr. Transome
15975: stared, very much like a waxen image in which the expression is a
15976: failure, and the rector, accustomed to female parishioners and
15977: complainants, looked on with a smile in his eyes, Harold said at once,
15978: with cordial kindness--
15979: 
15980: "I think you are quite right, Mrs. Holt. And for my part, I am
15981: determined to do my best for your son, both in the witness-box and
15982: elsewhere. Take comfort; if it is necessary, the king shall be appealed
15983: to. And rely upon it, I shall bear you in mind as Felix Holt's mother."
15984: 
15985: Rapid thoughts had convinced Harold that in this way he was best
15986: commending himself to Esther.
15987: 
15988: "Well, sir," said Mrs. Holt, who was not going to pour forth
15989: disproportionate thanks, "I am glad to hear you speak so becoming; and
15990: if you had been the king himself, I should have made free to tell you my
15991: opinion. For the Bible says the king's favor is toward a wise servant;
15992: and it's reasonable to think he'd make all the more account of them as
15993: have never been in service, or took wage, which I never did, and never
15994: thought of my son doing; and his father left money, meaning otherways,
15995: so as he might have been a doctor on horseback at this very minute,
15996: instead of being in prison."
15997: 
15998: "What! was he regularly apprenticed to a doctor?" said Mr. Lingon, who
15999: had not understood this before.
16000: 
16001: "Sir, he was, and most clever, like his father before him, only he
16002: turned contrary. But as for harming anybody, Felix never meant to harm
16003: anybody but himself and his mother, which he certainly did in respect of
16004: his clothes, and taking to be a low workingman, and stopping my living
16005: respectable, more particular by the pills, which had a sale, as you may
16006: be sure they suited people's insides. And what folks can never have
16007: boxes enough of to swallow, I should think you have a right to sell. And
16008: there's many and many a text for it, as I've opened on without ever
16009: thinking; for if it's true, 'Ask, and you shall have,' I should think
16010: it's truer when you're willing to pay for what you have."
16011: 
16012: This was a little too much for Mr. Lingon's gravity; he exploded, and
16013: Harold could not help following him. Mrs. Holt fixed her eyes on the
16014: distance, and slapped the back of her left hand again; it might be that
16015: this kind of mirth was the peculiar effect produced by forcible truth on
16016: high and worldly people who were neither in the Independent nor the
16017: General Baptist connection.
16018: 
16019: "I'm sure you must be tired with your long walk, and little Job too,"
16020: said Esther, by way of breaking this awkward scene. "Aren't you, Job?"
16021: she added, stooping to caress the child, who was timidly shrinking from
16022: Harry's invitation to him to pull the little chariot--Harry's view being
16023: that Job would make a good horse for him to beat, and would run faster
16024: than Gappa.
16025: 
16026: "It's well you can feel for the orphin child, Miss Lyon," said Mrs.
16027: Holt, choosing an indirect answer rather than to humble herself by
16028: confessing fatigue before gentlemen who seemed to be taking her too
16029: lightly. "I didn't believe but what you'd behave pretty, as you always
16030: did to me, though everybody said you held yourself high. But I'm sure
16031: you never did to Felix, for you let him sit by you at the Free School
16032: before all the town, and him with never a bit of stock round his neck.
16033: And it shows you saw _that_ in him worth taking notice of;--and it is
16034: but right, if you know my words are true, as you should speak for him to
16035: the gentlemen."
16036: 
16037: "I assure you, Mrs. Holt," said Harold, coming to the rescue--"I assure
16038: you that enough has been said to make me use my best efforts for your
16039: son. And now, pray, go on to the house with the little boy and take some
16040: rest. Dominic, show Mrs. Holt the way, and ask Mrs. Hickes to make her
16041: comfortable, and see that somebody takes her back to Treby in the
16042: buggy."
16043: 
16044: "I will go back with Mrs. Holt," said Esther, making an effort against
16045: herself.
16046: 
16047: "No, pray," said Harold, with that kind of entreaty which is really a
16048: decision. "Let Mrs. Holt have time to rest. We shall have returned, and
16049: you can see her before she goes. We will say good-by for the present,
16050: Mrs. Holt."
16051: 
16052: The poor woman was not sorry to have the prospect of rest and food,
16053: especially for "the orphin child," of whom she was tenderly careful.
16054: Like many women who appear to others to have a masculine decisiveness of
16055: tone, and to themselves to have a masculine force of mind, and who come
16056: into severe collision with sons arrived at the masterful stage, she had
16057: the maternal cord vibrating strongly within her toward all tiny
16058: children. And when she saw Dominic pick up Job and hoist him on his arm
16059: for a little while, by way of making acquaintance, she regarded him with
16060: an approval which she had not thought it possible to extend to a
16061: foreigner. Since Dominic was going, Harry and old Mr. Transome chose to
16062: follow. Uncle Lingon shook hands and turned off across the grass, and
16063: thus Esther was left alone with Harold.
16064: 
16065: But there was a new consciousness between them. Harold's quick
16066: perception was least likely to be slow in seizing indications of
16067: anything that might affect his position with regard to Esther. Some time
16068: before, his jealousy had been awakened to the possibility that before
16069: she had known him she had been deeply interested in some one else.
16070: Jealousy of all sorts--whether for our fortune or our love--is ready at
16071: combinations, and likely even to outstrip the fact. And Esther's renewed
16072: confusion, united with her silence about Felix, which now first seemed
16073: noteworthy, and with Mrs. Holt's graphic details as to her walking with
16074: him and letting him sit by her before all the town were grounds not
16075: merely for a suspicion, but for a conclusion in Harold's mind. The
16076: effect of this which he at once regarded as a discovery, was rather
16077: different from what Esther had anticipated. It seemed to him that Felix
16078: was the least formidable person that he could have found as an object of
16079: interest antecedent to himself. A young workman who had got himself
16080: thrown into prison, whatever recommendations he might have had for a
16081: girl at a romantic age in the dreariness of Dissenting society at Treby,
16082: could hardly be considered by Harold in the light of a rival. Esther was
16083: too clever and tasteful a woman to make a ballad heroine of herself, by
16084: bestowing her beauty and her lands on this lowly lover. Besides, Harold
16085: cherished the belief that, at the present time, Esther was more wisely
16086: disposed to bestow these things on another lover in every way eligible.
16087: But in two directions this discovery had a determining effect on him;
16088: his curiosity was stirred to know exactly what the relation with Felix
16089: had been, and he was solicitous that his behavior with regard to this
16090: young man should be such as to enhance his own merit in Esther's eyes.
16091: At the same time he was not inclined to any euphemisms that would seem
16092: to bring Felix into the lists with himself.
16093: 
16094: Naturally when they were left alone, it was Harold who spoke first. "I
16095: should think there's a good deal of worth in this young fellow--this
16096: Holt, notwithstanding the mistakes he has made. A little queer and
16097: conceited, perhaps; but that is usually the case with men of his class
16098: when they are at all superior to their fellows."
16099: 
16100: "Felix Holt is a highly cultivated man; he is not at all conceited,"
16101: said Esther. The different kinds of pride within her were coalescing
16102: now. She was aware that there had been a betrayal.
16103: 
16104: "Ah?" said Harold, not quite liking the tone of this answer. "This
16105: eccentricity is a sort of fanaticism, then?--this giving up being a
16106: doctor on horseback, as the old woman calls it, and taking to--let me
16107: see--watchmaking, isn't it?"
16108: 
16109: "If it is eccentricity to be very much better than other men, he is
16110: certainly eccentric; and fanatical too, if it is fanatical to renounce
16111: all small selfish motives for the sake of a great and unselfish one. I
16112: never knew what nobleness of character really was before I knew Felix
16113: Holt."
16114: 
16115: It seemed to Esther as if in the excitement of this moment, her own
16116: words were bringing her a clearer revelation.
16117: 
16118: "God bless me!" said Harold, in a tone of surprised yet thorough belief,
16119: and looking in Esther's face. "I wish you had talked to me about this
16120: before."
16121: 
16122: Esther at that moment looked perfectly beautiful, with an expression
16123: which Harold had never hitherto seen. All the confusion which had
16124: depended on personal feeling had given way before the sense that she had
16125: to speak the truth about the man whom she felt to be admirable.
16126: 
16127: "I think I didn't see the meaning of anything fine--I didn't even see
16128: the value of my father's character, until I had been taught a little by
16129: hearing what Felix Holt said, and seeing that his life was like his
16130: words."
16131: 
16132: Harold looked and listened, and felt his slight jealousy allayed rather
16133: than heightened. "This is not like love," he said to himself, with some
16134: satisfaction. With all due regard to Harold Transome, he was one of
16135: those men who are liable to make the greater mistakes about a particular
16136: woman's feelings, because they pique themselves on a power of
16137: interpretation derived from much experience. Experience is enlightening,
16138: but with a difference. Experiments on live animals may go on for a long
16139: period, and yet the fauna on which they are made may be limited. There
16140: may be a passion in the mind of a woman which precipitates her, not
16141: along the path of easy beguilement, but into a great leap away from it.
16142: Harold's experience had not taught him this; and Esther's enthusiasm
16143: about Felix Holt did not seem to him to be dangerous.
16144: 
16145: "He's quite an apostolic sort of fellow, then," was the self-quieting
16146: answer he gave to her last words. "He didn't look like that; but I had
16147: only a short interview with him, and I was given to understand that he
16148: refused to see me in prison. I believe he's not very well inclined
16149: toward me. But you saw a great deal of him, I suppose, and your
16150: testimony to any one is enough for me," said Harold, lowering his voice
16151: rather tenderly. "Now I know what your opinion is, I shall spare no
16152: effort on behalf of such a young man. In fact, I had come to the same
16153: resolution before, but your wish would make difficult things easy."
16154: 
16155: After that energetic speech of Esther's, as often happens, the tears had
16156: just suffused her eyes. It was nothing more than might have been
16157: expected in a tender-hearted woman, considering Felix Holt's
16158: circumstances, and the tears only made more lovely the look with which
16159: she met Harold's when he spoke so kindly. She felt pleased with him; she
16160: was open to the fallacious delight of being assured that she had power
16161: over him to make him do what she liked, and quite forgot the many
16162: impressions which had convinced her that Harold had a padded yoke ready
16163: for the neck of every man, woman, and child that depended on him.
16164: 
16165: After a short silence, they were getting near the stone gateway, and
16166: Harold said, with an air of intimate consultation--
16167: 
16168: "What could we do for this young man, supposing he were let off? I shall
16169: send a letter with fifty pounds to the old woman to-morrow. I ought to
16170: have done it before, but it really slipped my memory, amongst the many
16171: things that have occupied me lately. But this young man--what do you
16172: think would be the best thing we could do for him, if he gets at large
16173: again. He should be put in a position where his qualities could be more
16174: telling."
16175: 
16176: Esther was recovering her liveliness a little, and was disposed to
16177: encourage it for the sake of veiling other feelings, about which she
16178: felt renewed reticence, now that the overpowering influence of her
16179: enthusiasm was past. She was rather wickedly amused and scornful at
16180: Harold's misconceptions and ill-placed intentions of patronage.
16181: 
16182: "You are hopelessly in the dark," she said, with a light laugh and toss
16183: of her head. "What would you offer Felix Holt? a place in the Excise?
16184: You might as well think of offering it to John the Baptist. Felix has
16185: chosen his lot. He means always to be a poor man."
16186: 
16187: "Means? Yes," said Harold, slightly piqued, "but what a man means
16188: usually depends on what happens. I mean to be a commoner; but a peerage
16189: might present itself under acceptable circumstances."
16190: 
16191: "Oh, there is no sum in proportion to be done there," said Esther, again
16192: gaily. "As you are to a peerage so is not Felix Holt to any offer of
16193: advantage that you could imagine for him."
16194: 
16195: "You must think him fit for any position--the first in the county."
16196: 
16197: "No, I don't," said Esther, shaking her head mischievously. "I think him
16198: too high for it."
16199: 
16200: "I see you can be ardent in your admiration."
16201: 
16202: "Yes, it is my champagne; you know I don't like the other kind."
16203: 
16204: "That would be satisfactory if one were sure of getting your
16205: admiration," said Harold, leading her up to the terrace, and amongst the
16206: crocuses, from whence they had a fine view of the park and river. They
16207: stood still near the east parapet, and saw the dash of light on the
16208: water, and the pencilled shadows of the trees on the grassy lawn.
16209: 
16210: "Would it do as well to admire you, instead of being worthy to be
16211: admired?" said Harold, turning his eyes from that landscape to Esther's
16212: face.
16213: 
16214: "It would be a thing to be put up with," said Esther, smiling at him
16215: rather roguishly. "But you are not in that state of self-despair."
16216: 
16217: "Well, I am conscious of not having those severe virtues that you have
16218: been praising."
16219: 
16220: "That is true. You are quite in another _genre_."
16221: 
16222: "A woman would not find me a tragic hero."
16223: 
16224: "Oh, no! She must dress for general comedy--such as your mother once
16225: described to me--where the most thrilling event is the drawing of a
16226: handsome check."
16227: 
16228: "You are a naughty fairy," said Harold, daring to press Esther's hand a
16229: little more closely to him, and drawing her down the eastern steps into
16230: the pleasure-ground, as if he were unwilling to give up the
16231: conversation. "Confess that you are disgusted with my want of romance."
16232: 
16233: "I shall not confess to being disgusted. I shall ask you to confess that
16234: you are not a romantic figure."
16235: 
16236: "I am a little too stout."
16237: 
16238: "For romance--yes. At least you must find security for not getting
16239: stouter."
16240: 
16241: "And I don't look languishing enough?"
16242: 
16243: "Oh, yes--rather too much so--at a fine cigar."
16244: 
16245: "And I am not in danger of committing suicide?"
16246: 
16247: "No; you are a widower."
16248: 
16249: Harold did not reply immediately to this last thrust of Esther's. She
16250: had uttered it with innocent thoughtlessness from the playful
16251: suggestions of the moment; but it was a fact that Harold's previous
16252: married life had entered strongly in her impressions about him. The
16253: presence of Harry made it inevitable. Harold took this allusion of
16254: Esther's as an indication that his quality of widower was a point that
16255: made against him; and after a brief silence he said, in an altered, more
16256: serious tone--
16257: 
16258: "You don't suppose, I hope, that any other woman has ever held the place
16259: that you could hold in my life?"
16260: 
16261: Esther began to tremble a little, as she always did when the love-talk
16262: between them seemed getting serious. She only gave the rather stumbling
16263: answer, "How so?"
16264: 
16265: "Harry's mother had been a slave--was bought, in fact."
16266: 
16267: It was impossible for Harold to preconceive the effect this had on
16268: Esther. His natural disqualification for judging of a girl's feelings
16269: was heightened by the blinding effect of an exclusive object--which was
16270: to assure her that her own place was peculiar and supreme. Hitherto
16271: Esther's acquaintance with oriental love was derived chiefly from
16272: Byronic poems, and this had not sufficed to adjust her mind to a new
16273: story, where the Giaour concerned was giving her his arm. She was unable
16274: to speak; and Harold went on--
16275: 
16276: "Though I am close on thirty-five, I never met with a woman at all like
16277: you before. There are new eras in one's life that are equivalent to
16278: youth--are something better than youth. I was never an aspirant till I
16279: knew you."
16280: 
16281: Esther was still silent.
16282: 
16283: "Not that I dare to call myself that. I am not so confident a personage
16284: as you imagine. I am necessarily in a painful position for a man who has
16285: any feeling."
16286: 
16287: Here at last Harold had stirred the right fibre. Esther's generosity
16288: seized at once the whole meaning implied in that last sentence. She had
16289: a fine sensibility to the line at which flirtation must cease; and she
16290: was now pale and shaken with feelings she had not yet defined for
16291: herself.
16292: 
16293: "Do not let us speak of difficult things any more now," she said, with
16294: gentle seriousness. "I am come into a new world of late, and have to
16295: learn life all over again. Let us go in. I must see poor Mrs. Holt
16296: again, and my little friend Job."
16297: 
16298: She paused at the glass door that opened on the terrace, and entered
16299: there, while Harold went round to the stables.
16300: 
16301: When Esther had been up-stairs and descended again into the large
16302: entrance-hall, she found its stony capaciousness made lively by human
16303: figures extremely unlike the statues. Since Harry insisted on playing
16304: with Job again, Mrs. Holt and her orphan, after dining, had just been
16305: brought to this delightful scene for a game at hide-and-seek, and for
16306: exhibiting the climbing powers of the two pet squirrels. Mrs. Holt sat
16307: on a stool, in singular relief against the pedestal of the Apollo, while
16308: Dominic and Denner (otherwise Mrs. Hickes) bore her company; Harry, in
16309: his bright red and purple, flitted about like a great tropic bird after
16310: the sparrow-tailed Job, who hid himself with much intelligence behind
16311: the scagliola pillars and the pedestals; while one of the squirrels
16312: perched itself on the head of the tallest statue, and the other was
16313: already peeping down from among the heavy stuccoed angels on the
16314: ceiling, near the summit of a pillar.
16315: 
16316: Mrs. Holt held on her lap a basket filled with good things for Job, and
16317: seemed much soothed by pleasant company and excellent treatment. As
16318: Esther, descending softly and unobserved, leaned over the stone
16319: banisters and looked at the scene for a minute or two, she saw that Mrs.
16320: Holt's attention, having been directed to the squirrel which had
16321: scampered on to the head of the Silenus carrying the infant Bacchus, had
16322: been drawn downward to the tiny babe looked at with so much affection by
16323: the rather ugly and hairy gentleman, of whom she nevertheless spoke with
16324: reserve as of one who possibly belonged to the Transome family.
16325: 
16326: "It's most pretty to see its little limbs, and the gentleman holding it.
16327: I should think he was amiable by his look; but it was odd he should have
16328: his likeness took without any clothes. Was he Transome by name?" (Mrs.
16329: Holt suspected that there might be a mild madness in the family.)
16330: 
16331: Denner, peering and smiling quietly, was about to reply, when she was
16332: prevented by the appearance of old Mr. Transome, who since his walk had
16333: been having "forty winks" on the sofa in the library, and now came out
16334: to look for Harry. He had doffed his fur cap and cloak, but in lying
16335: down to sleep he had thrown over his shoulders a soft Oriental scarf
16336: which Harold had given him, and this still hung over his scanty white
16337: hair and down to his knees, held fast by his wooden-looking arms and
16338: laxly-clasped hands, which fell in front of him.
16339: 
16340: This singular appearance of an undoubted Transome fitted exactly into
16341: Mrs. Holt's thought at the moment. It lay in the probabilities of things
16342: that gentry's intellects should be peculiar: since they had not to get
16343: their own living, the good Lord might have economized in their case that
16344: common-sense which others were so much more in need of; and in the
16345: shuffling figure before her she saw a descendant of the gentleman who
16346: had chosen to be represented without his clothes--all the more eccentric
16347: where there were the means of buying the best. But these oddities "said
16348: nothing" in great folks, who were powerful in high quarters all the
16349: same. And Mrs. Holt rose and courtesied with a proud respect, precisely
16350: as she would have done if Mr. Transome had looked as wise as Lord
16351: Burleigh.
16352: 
16353: "I hope I'm in no way taking a liberty, sir," she began, while the old
16354: gentleman looked at her with bland feebleness; "I'm not that woman to
16355: sit anywhere out of my own home without inviting and pressing to. But I
16356: was brought here to wait, because the little gentleman wanted to play
16357: with the orphin child."
16358: 
16359: "Very glad, my good woman--sit down--sit down," said Mr. Transome,
16360: nodding and smiling between his clauses. "Nice little boy. Your
16361: grandchild?"
16362: 
16363: "Indeed, sir, no," said Mrs. Holt, continuing to stand. Quite apart from
16364: any awe of Mr. Transome--sitting down, she felt, would be a too great
16365: familiarity with her own pathetic importance on this extra and
16366: unlooked-for occasion. "It's not me has any grandchild, nor ever shall
16367: have, though most fit. But with my only son saying he'll never be
16368: married, and in prison besides, and some saying he'll be transported,
16369: you may see yourself--though a gentleman--as there isn't much chance of
16370: my having grandchildren of my own. And this is old Master Tudge's
16371: grandchild, as my own Felix took to for pity because he was sickly and
16372: clemm'd, and I was noways against it, being of a tender heart. For I'm a
16373: widow myself, and my son Felix, though big, is fatherless, and I know my
16374: duty in consequence. And it's to be wished, sir, as others should know
16375: it as are more in power and live in great houses, and can ride in a
16376: carriage where they will. And if you're the gentleman as is the head of
16377: everything--and it's not to be thought you'd give up to your son as a
16378: poor widow's been forced to do--it behooves you to take the part of them
16379: as are deserving; for the Bible says gray hairs should speak."
16380: 
16381: "Yes, yes--poor woman--what shall I say?" said old Mr. Transome, feeling
16382: himself scolded, and, as usual, desirous of mollifying displeasure.
16383: 
16384: "Sir, I can tell you what to say fast enough; for it's what I should say
16385: myself if I could get to speak to the king. For I've asked them that
16386: know, and they say it's the truth, both out of the Bible, and in, as the
16387: king can pardon anything and anybody. And judging by his countenance on
16388: the new signs, and the talk there was a while ago about his being the
16389: people's friend, as the minister once said it from the very pulpit--if
16390: there's any meaning in words, he'll do the right thing by me and my son,
16391: if he's asked proper."
16392: 
16393: "Yes--a very good man--he'll do anything right," said Mr. Transome,
16394: whose own ideas about the king just then were somewhat misty, consisting
16395: chiefly in broken reminiscences of George III. "I'll ask him anything
16396: you like," he added, with a pressing desire to satisfy Mrs. Holt, who
16397: alarmed him slightly.
16398: 
16399: "Then, sir, if you'll go in your carriage and say, this young man, Felix
16400: Holt by name, as his father was known the country round, and his mother
16401: most respectable--he never meant harm to anybody, and so far from bloody
16402: murder and fighting, would part with his victual to them that needed it
16403: more--and if you'd get other gentlemen to say the same, and if they're
16404: not satisfied to enquire--I'll not believe but what the king 'ud let my
16405: son out of prison. Or if it's true he must stand his trial, the king 'ud
16406: take care no mischief happened to him. I've got my senses, and I'll
16407: never believe as in a country where there's a God above and a king
16408: below, the right thing can't be done if great people was willing to do
16409: it."
16410: 
16411: Mrs. Holt, like all orators, had waxed louder and more energetic,
16412: ceasing to propel her arguments, and being propelled by them. Poor old
16413: Mr. Transome, getting more and more frightened at this severe-spoken
16414: woman, who had the horrible possibility to his mind of being a novelty
16415: that was to become permanent, seemed to be fascinated by fear, and stood
16416: helplessly forgetful that if he liked he might turn round and walk away.
16417: 
16418: Little Harry, alive to anything that had relation to "Gappa," had paused
16419: in his game, and discerning what he thought a hostile aspect in this
16420: naughty black old woman, rushed toward her and proceeded first to beat
16421: her with his mimic jockey's whip, and then, suspecting that her
16422: bombazine was not sensitive, to set his teeth in her arm. While Dominic
16423: rebuked him and pulled him off, Nimrod began to bark anxiously, and the
16424: scene was become alarming even to the squirrels, which scrambled as far
16425: off as possible.
16426: 
16427: Esther, who had been waiting for an opportunity of intervention, now
16428: came up to Mrs. Holt to speak some soothing words; and old Mr. Transome,
16429: seeing a sufficient screen between himself and his formidable suppliant,
16430: at last gathered courage to turn round and shuffle away with unusual
16431: swiftness into the library.
16432: 
16433: "Dear Mrs. Holt," said Esther, "do rest comforted. I assure you, you
16434: have done the utmost that can be done by your words. Your visit has not
16435: been thrown away. See how the children have enjoyed it! I saw little Job
16436: actually laughing. I think I never saw him do more than smile before."
16437: Then turning round to Dominic, she said, "Will the buggy come round to
16438: this door?"
16439: 
16440: This hint was sufficient. Dominic went to see if the vehicle was ready,
16441: and Denner, remarking that Mrs. Holt would like to mount it in the inner
16442: court, invited her to go back into the housekeeper's room. But there was
16443: a fresh resistance raised in Harry by the threatened departure of Job,
16444: who had seemed an invaluable addition to the menagerie of tamed
16445: creatures; and it was barely in time that Esther had the relief of
16446: seeing the entrance hall cleared so as to prevent any further encounter
16447: of Mrs. Holt with Harold, who was now coming up the flight of steps at
16448: the entrance.
16449: 
16450: 
16451: 
16452: 
16453: CHAPTER XLIV.
16454: 
16455:            I'm sick at heart. The eye of day,
16456:     The insistent summer noon, seems pitiless,
16457:     Shining in all the barren crevices
16458:     Of weary life, leaving no shade, no dark,
16459:     Where I may dream that hidden waters lie.
16460: 
16461: 
16462: Shortly after Mrs. Holt's striking presentation of herself at Transome
16463: Court, Esther went on a second visit to her father. The Loamford Assizes
16464: were approaching; it was expected that in about ten days Felix Holt's
16465: trial would come on, and some hints in her father's letters had given
16466: Esther the impression that he was taking a melancholy view of the
16467: result. Harold Transome had once or twice mentioned the subject with a
16468: facile hopefulness as to "the young fellow's coming off easily," which,
16469: in her anxious mind, was not a counterpoise to disquieting suggestions,
16470: and she had not chosen to introduce another conversation about Felix
16471: Holt, by questioning Harold concerning the probabilities he relied on.
16472: Since those moments on the terrace, Harold had daily become more of the
16473: solicitous and indirectly beseeching lover; and Esther, from the very
16474: fact that she was weighed on by thoughts that were painfully bewildering
16475: to her--by thoughts which, in their newness to her young mind, seemed to
16476: shake her belief that life could be anything else than a compromise with
16477: things repugnant to the moral taste--had become more passive to his
16478: attentions at the very time that she had begun to feel more profoundly
16479: that in accepting Harold Transome she left the high mountain air, the
16480: passionate serenity of perfect love forever behind her, and must adjust
16481: her wishes to a life of middling delights, overhung with the languorous
16482: haziness of motiveless ease, where poetry was only literature, and the
16483: fine ideas had to be taken down from the shelves of the library when her
16484: husband's back was turned. But it seemed as if all outward conditions
16485: concurred, along with her generous sympathy for the Transomes, and with
16486: those native tendencies against which she had once begun to struggle, to
16487: make this middling lot the best she could attain to. She was in this
16488: half-sad, half-satisfied resignation to something like what is called
16489: worldly wisdom, when she went to see her father, and learn what she
16490: could from him about Felix.
16491: 
16492: The little minister was much depressed, unable to resign himself to the
16493: dread which had begun to haunt him, that Felix might have to endure the
16494: odious penalty of transportation for the manslaughter, which was the
16495: offence that no evidence in his favor could disprove.
16496: 
16497: "I had been encouraged by the assurances of men instructed in this
16498: regard," said Mr. Lyon, while Esther sat on the stool near him, and
16499: listened anxiously, "that though he were pronounced guilty in regard to
16500: this deed whereunto he hath calamitously fallen, yet that a judge mildly
16501: disposed, and with a due sense of that invisible activity of the soul
16502: whereby the deeds which are the same in outward appearance and effect,
16503: yet differ as the knife-stroke of the surgeon, even though it kill,
16504: differs from the knife-stroke of a wanton mutilater, might use his
16505: discretion in tempering the punishment, so that it would not be very
16506: evil to bear. But now it is said that the judge who cometh is a severe
16507: man, and one nourishing a prejudice against the bolder spirits who
16508: stand not in the old paths."
16509: 
16510: "I am going to be present at the trial, father," said Esther, who was
16511: preparing the way to express a wish, which she was timid about even with
16512: her father. "I mentioned to Mrs. Transome that I should like to do so,
16513: and she said that she used in old days always to attend the assizes, and
16514: that she would take me. You will be there, father?"
16515: 
16516: "Assuredly I shall be there, having been summoned to bear witness to
16517: Felix's character, and to his having uttered remonstrances and warnings
16518: long beforehand whereby he proved himself an enemy to riot. In our ears,
16519: who know him, it sounds strangely that aught else should be credible;
16520: but he hath few to speak for him, though I trust that Mr. Harold
16521: Transome's testimony will go far, if, as you say, he is disposed to set
16522: aside minor regards, and not to speak the truth grudgingly and
16523: reluctantly. For the very truth hath a color from the disposition of the
16524: utterer."
16525: 
16526: "He is kind; he is capable of being generous," said Esther.
16527: 
16528: "It is well. For I verily believe that evil-minded men have been at work
16529: against Felix. The _Duffield Watchman_ hath written continually in
16530: allusion to him as one of those mischievous men who seek to elevate
16531: themselves through the dishonor of their party; and as one of those who
16532: go not heart and soul with the needs of the people, but seek only to get
16533: a hearing for themselves by raising their voices in crotchety discord.
16534: It is these things that cause me heaviness of spirit: the dark secret of
16535: this young man's lot is a cross I carry daily."
16536: 
16537: "Father," said Esther, timidly, while the eyes of both were filling with
16538: tears, "I should like to see him again before his trial. Might I? Will
16539: you ask him? Will you take me?"
16540: 
16541: The minister raised his suffused eyes to hers, and did not speak for a
16542: moment or two. A new thought had visited him. But his delicate
16543: tenderness shrank even from an inward enquiry that was too curious--that
16544: seemed like an effort to peep at sacred secrets.
16545: 
16546: "I see naught against it, my dear child, if you arrived early enough,
16547: and would take the elderly lady into your confidence, so that you might
16548: descend from the carriage at some suitable place--the house of the
16549: Independent minister, for example--where I could meet and accompany you.
16550: I would forewarn Felix, who would doubtless delight to see your face
16551: again; seeing that he may go away, and be, as it were, buried from you,
16552: even though it may be only in prison, and not----"
16553: 
16554: This was too much for Esther. She threw her arms round her father's neck
16555: and sobbed like a child. It was an unspeakable relief to her after all
16556: the pent-up, stifling experience, all the inward incommunicable debate
16557: of the last few weeks. The old man was deeply moved, too, and held his
16558: arm close round the dear child, praying silently.
16559: 
16560: No word was spoken for some minutes, till Esther raised herself, dried
16561: her eyes, and, with an action that seemed playful, though there was no
16562: smile on her face, pressed her handkerchief against her father's cheeks.
16563: Then, when she had put her hand in his, he said, solemnly--
16564: 
16565: "'Tis a great and mysterious gift, this clinging of the heart, my
16566: Esther, whereby it hath often seemed to me that even in the very moment
16567: of suffering our souls have the keenest foretaste of heaven. I speak not
16568: lightly, but as one who hath endured. And 'tis a strange truth that only
16569: in the agony of parting we look into the depths of love."
16570: 
16571: So the interview ended, without any question from Mr. Lyon concerning
16572: what Esther contemplated as the ultimate arrangement between herself and
16573: the Transomes.
16574: 
16575: After this conversation, which showed him that what happened to Felix
16576: touched Esther more closely than he had supposed, the minister felt no
16577: impulse to raise the images of a future so unlike anything that Felix
16578: would share. And Esther would have been unable to answer any such
16579: questions. The successive weeks, instead of bringing her nearer to
16580: clearness and decision, had only brought that state of disenchantment
16581: belonging to the actual presence of things which have long dwelt in the
16582: imagination with all the factitious charms of arbitrary arrangement. Her
16583: imaginary mansion had not been inhabited just as Transome Court was; her
16584: imaginary fortune had not been attended with circumstances which she was
16585: unable to sweep away. She, herself, in her Utopia, had never been what
16586: she was now--a woman whose heart was divided and oppressed. The first
16587: spontaneous offering of her woman's devotion, the first great
16588: inspiration of her life, was a sort of vanished ecstasy which had left
16589: its wounds. It seemed to her a cruel misfortune of her young life that
16590: her best feeling, her most precious dependence, had been called forth
16591: just where the conditions were hardest, and that all the easy
16592: invitations of circumstance were toward something which that previous
16593: consecration of her longing had made a moral descent for her. It was
16594: characteristic of her that she scarcely at all entertained the
16595: alternative of such a compromise as would have given her the larger
16596: portion of the fortune to which she had a legal claim, and yet have
16597: satisfied her sympathy by leaving the Transomes in possession of their
16598: old home. Her domestication with this family had brought them into the
16599: foreground of her imagination; the gradual wooing of Harold had acted on
16600: her with a constant immediate influence that predominated over all
16601: indefinite prospects; and a solitary elevation to wealth, which out of
16602: Utopia she had no notion how she should manage, looked as chill and
16603: dreary as the offer of dignities in an unknown country.
16604: 
16605: In the ages since Adam's marriage, it has been good for some men to be
16606: alone, and for some women also. But Esther was not one of these women:
16607: she was intensely of the feminine type, verging neither toward the saint
16608: nor the angel. She was "a fair divided excellence, whose fullness of
16609: perfection" must be in marriage. And, like all youthful creatures, she
16610: felt as if the present conditions of choice were final. It belonged to
16611: the freshness of her heart that, having had her emotions strongly
16612: stirred by real objects, she never speculated on possible relations yet
16613: to come. It seemed to her that she stood at the first and last parting
16614: of the ways. And, in one sense she was under no illusion. It is only in
16615: that freshness of our time that the choice is possible which gives unity
16616: to life, and makes the memory a temple where all relics and all votive
16617: offerings, all worship and all grateful joy, are an unbroken history
16618: sanctified by one religion.
16619: 
16620: 
16621: 
16622: 
16623: CHAPTER XLV.
16624: 
16625:     We may not make this world a paradise
16626:     By walking it together with clasped hands
16627:     And eyes that meeting feed a double strength.
16628:     We must be only joined by pains divine,
16629:     Of spirits blent in mutual memories.
16630: 
16631: 
16632: It was a consequence of that interview with her father, that when Esther
16633: stepped early on a gray March morning into the carriage with Mrs.
16634: Transome, to go to the Loamford Assizes, she was full of an expectation
16635: that held her lips in trembling silence, and gave her eyes that
16636: sightless beauty which tells that the vision is all within.
16637: 
16638: Mrs. Transome did not disturb her with unnecessary speech. Of late,
16639: Esther's anxious observation had been drawn to a change in Mrs.
16640: Transome, shown in many small ways which only women notice. It was not
16641: only that when they sat together the talk seemed more of an effort to
16642: her: that might have come from the gradual draining away of matter for
16643: discourse pertaining to most sorts of companionship, in which repetition
16644: is not felt to be as desirable as novelty. But while Mrs. Transome was
16645: dressed just as usual, took her seat as usual, trifled with her drugs
16646: and had her embroidery before her as usual, and still made her morning
16647: greetings with that finished easy politeness and consideration of tone
16648: which to rougher people seems like affectation, Esther noticed a strange
16649: fitfulness in her movements. Sometimes the stitches of her embroidery
16650: went on with silent unbroken swiftness for a quarter of an hour, as if
16651: she had to work out her deliverance from bondage by finishing a
16652: scroll-patterned border; then her hands dropped suddenly and her gaze
16653: fell blankly on the table before her, and she would sit in that way
16654: motionless as a seated statue, apparently unconscious of Esther's
16655: presence, till some thought darting within her seemed to have the effect
16656: of an external shock and rouse her with a start, when she looked around
16657: hastily like a person ashamed of having slept. Esther, touched with
16658: wondering pity at signs of unhappiness that were new in her experience,
16659: took the most delicate care to appear inobservant, and only tried to
16660: increase the gentle attention that might help to soothe or gratify this
16661: uneasy woman. But, one morning, Mrs. Transome had said, breaking a
16662: rather long silence--
16663: 
16664: "My dear, I shall make this house dull for you. You sit with me like an
16665: embodied patience. I am unendurable; I am getting into a melancholy
16666: dotage. A fidgety old woman like me is as unpleasant to see as a rook
16667: with its wing broken. Don't mind me, my dear. Run away from me without
16668: ceremony. Every one else does, you see. I am part of the old furniture
16669: with new drapery."
16670: 
16671: "Dear Mrs. Transome," said Esther, gliding to the low ottoman close by
16672: the basket of embroidery, "do you dislike my sitting with you?"
16673: 
16674: "Only for your own sake, my fairy," said Mrs. Transome, smiling faintly,
16675: and putting her hand under Esther's chin. "Doesn't it make you shudder
16676: to look at me?"
16677: 
16678: "Why will you say such naughty things?" said Esther, affectionately. "If
16679: you had had a daughter, she would have desired to be with you most when
16680: you most wanted cheering. And surely every young woman has something of
16681: a daughter's feeling toward an older one who has been kind to her."
16682: 
16683: "I should like you to be really my daughter," said Mrs. Transome,
16684: rousing herself to look a little brighter. "That is something still for
16685: an old woman to hope for."
16686: 
16687: Esther blushed: she had not foreseen this application of words that came
16688: from pitying tenderness. To divert the train of thought as quickly as
16689: possible, she at once asked what she had previously had in her mind to
16690: ask. Before her blush had disappeared she said:
16691: 
16692: "Oh, you are so good; I shall ask you to indulge me very much. It is to
16693: let us set out very early to Loamford on Wednesday, and put me down at a
16694: particular house, that I may keep an appointment with my father. It is a
16695: private matter, that I wish no one to know about, if possible. And he
16696: will bring me back to you wherever you appoint."
16697: 
16698: In that way Esther won her end without needing to betray it; and as
16699: Harold was already away at Loamford, she was the more secure.
16700: 
16701: The Independent minister's house at which she was set down, and where
16702: she was received by her father, was in a quiet street not far from the
16703: jail. Esther had thrown a dark cloak over the handsomer coverings which
16704: Denner had assured her were absolutely required of ladies who sat
16705: anywhere near the judge at a great trial; and as the bonnet of that day
16706: did not throw the face into high relief, but rather into perspective, a
16707: veil drawn down gave her a sufficiently inconspicuous appearance.
16708: 
16709: "I have arranged all things, my dear," said Mr. Lyon, "and Felix expects
16710: us. We will lose no time."
16711: 
16712: They walked away at once, Esther not asking a question. She had no
16713: consciousness of the road along which they passed; she could never
16714: remember anything but a dim sense of entering within high walls and
16715: going along passages, till they were ushered into a larger space than
16716: she had expected, and her father said:
16717: 
16718: "It is here that we are permitted to see Felix, my Esther. He will
16719: presently appear."
16720: 
16721: Esther automatically took off her gloves and bonnet, as if she had
16722: entered the house after a walk. She had lost the complete consciousness
16723: of everything except that she was going to see Felix. She trembled. It
16724: seemed to her as if he too would look altered after her new life--as if
16725: even the past would change for her and be no longer a steadfast
16726: remembrance, but something she had been mistaken about, as she had been
16727: about the new life. Perhaps she was growing out of that childhood to
16728: which common things have rareness, and all objects look larger. Perhaps
16729: from henceforth the whole world was to be meaner for her. The dread
16730: concentrated in those few moments seemed worse than anything she had
16731: known before. It was what the dread of the pilgrim might be who has it
16732: whispered to him that the holy places are a delusion, or that he will
16733: see them with a soul unstirred and unbelieving. Every minute that passes
16734: may be charged with some such crisis in the little inner world of man or
16735: woman.
16736: 
16737: But soon the door opened slightly; someone looked in; then it opened
16738: wide, and Felix Holt entered.
16739: 
16740: "Miss Lyon--Esther!" and her hand was in his grasp.
16741: 
16742: He was just the same--no, something inexpressibly better, because of the
16743: distance and separation, and the half-weary novelties, which made him
16744: like the return of the morning.
16745: 
16746: "Take no heed of me, children," said Mr. Lyon. "I have some notes to
16747: make, and my time is precious. We may remain here only a quarter of an
16748: hour." And the old man sat down at a window with his back to them,
16749: writing with his head bent close to the paper.
16750: 
16751: "You are very pale; you look ill, compared with your old self," said
16752: Esther. She had taken her hand away, but they stood still near each
16753: other, she looking up at him.
16754: 
16755: "The fact is, I'm not fond of prison," said Felix, smiling; "but I
16756: suppose the best I can hope for is to have a good deal more of it."
16757: 
16758: "It is thought that in the worst case a pardon may be obtained," said
16759: Esther, avoiding Harold Transome's name.
16760: 
16761: "I don't rely on that," said Felix, shaking his head. "My wisest course
16762: is to make up my mind to the very ugliest penalty they can condemn me
16763: to. If I can face that, anything less will seem easy. But you know," he
16764: went on, smiling at her brightly, "I never went in for fine company and
16765: cushions. I can't be very heavily disappointed in that way."
16766: 
16767: "Do you see things just as you used to do?" said Esther, turning pale as
16768: she said it--"I mean--about poverty, and the people you will live among.
16769: Has all the misunderstanding and sadness left you just as obstinate?"
16770: She tried to smile, but could not succeed.
16771: 
16772: "What--about the sort of life I should lead if I were free again?" said
16773: Felix.
16774: 
16775: "Yes. I can't help being discouraged for you by all these things that
16776: have happened. See how you may fail!" Esther spoke timidly. She saw a
16777: peculiar smile, which she knew well, gathering in his eyes. "Ah, I dare
16778: say I am silly," she said, deprecatingly.
16779: 
16780: "No, you are dreadfully inspired," said Felix. "When the wicked Tempter
16781: is tired of snarling that word failure in a man's cell, he sends a voice
16782: like a thrush to say it for him. See now what a messenger of darkness
16783: you are!" He smiled, and took her two hands between his, pressed
16784: together as children hold them up in prayer. Both of them felt too
16785: solemnly to be bashful. They looked straight into each other's eyes, as
16786: angels do when they tell some truth. And they stood in that way while he
16787: went on speaking.
16788: 
16789: "But I'm proof against that word failure. I've seen behind it. The only
16790: failure a man ought to fear is failure in cleaving to the purpose he
16791: sees to be best. As to just the amount of result he may see from his
16792: particular work--that's a tremendous uncertainty: the universe has not
16793: been arranged for the gratification of his feelings. As long as a man
16794: sees and believes in some great good, he'll prefer working toward that
16795: in the way he's best fit for, come what may. I put effects at their
16796: minimum, but I'd rather have the maximum of effect, if it's of the sort
16797: I care for, than the maximum of effect I don't care for--a lot of fine
16798: things that are not to my taste--and if they were, the conditions of
16799: holding them while the world is what it is, are such as would jar on me
16800: like grating metal."
16801: 
16802: "Yes," said Esther, in a low tone, "I think I understand that now,
16803: better than I used to do." The words of Felix at last seemed strangely
16804: to fit her own experience. But she said no more, though he seemed to
16805: wait for it a moment or two, looking at her. But then he went on--
16806: 
16807: "I don't mean to be illustrious, you know, and make a new era, else it
16808: would be kind of you to get a raven and teach it to croak 'failure' in
16809: my ears. Where great things can't happen, I care for very small things,
16810: such as will never be known beyond a few garrets and workshops. And
16811: then, as to one thing I believe in, I don't think I can altogether fail.
16812: If there's anything our people want convincing of, it is, that there's
16813: some dignity and happiness for a man other than changing his station.
16814: That's one of the beliefs I choose to consecrate my life to. If anybody
16815: could demonstrate to me that I was a flat for it, I shouldn't think it
16816: would follow that I must borrow money to set up genteelly and order new
16817: clothes. That's not a rigorous consequence to my understanding."
16818: 
16819: They smiled at each other, with the old sense of amusement they had so
16820: often had together.
16821: 
16822: "You are just the same," said Esther.
16823: 
16824: "And you?" said Felix. "My affairs have been settled long ago. But
16825: yours--a great change has come in them--magic at work."
16826: 
16827: "Yes," said Esther, rather falteringly.
16828: 
16829: "Well," said Felix, looking at her gravely again, "it's a case of
16830: fitness that seems to give a chance sanction to that musty law. The
16831: first time I saw you your birth was an immense puzzle to me. However,
16832: the appropriate conditions are come at last."
16833: 
16834: These words seemed cruel to Esther. But Felix could not know all the
16835: reasons for their seeming so. She could not speak; she was turning cold
16836: and feeling her heart beat painfully.
16837: 
16838: "All your tastes are gratified now," he went on innocently. "But you'll
16839: remember the old pedagogue and his lectures?"
16840: 
16841: One thought in the mind of Felix was, that Esther was sure to marry
16842: Harold Transome. Men readily believe these things of the women who love
16843: them. But he could not allude to the marriage more directly. He was
16844: afraid of this destiny for her, without having any very distinct
16845: knowledge by which to justify his fear to the mind of another. It did
16846: not satisfy him that Esther should marry Harold Transome.
16847: 
16848: "My children," said Mr. Lyon at this moment, not looking round, but only
16849: looking close at his watch, "we have just two minutes more." Then he
16850: went on writing.
16851: 
16852: Esther did not speak, but Felix could not help observing now that her
16853: hands had turned to a deathly coldness, and that she was trembling. He
16854: believed, he knew, that whatever prospects she had, this feeling was for
16855: his sake. An overpowering impulse from mingled love, gratitude, and
16856: anxiety, urged him to say--
16857: 
16858: "I had a horrible struggle, Esther. But you see I was right. There was a
16859: fitting lot in reserve for you. But remember you have cost a great
16860: price--don't throw what is precious away. I shall want the news that you
16861: have a happiness worthy of you."
16862: 
16863: Esther felt too miserable for tears to come. She looked helplessly at
16864: Felix for a moment, then took her hands from his, and, turning away
16865: mutely, walked dreamily toward her father, and said, "Father, I am
16866: ready--there is no more to say."
16867: 
16868: She turned back again, toward the chair where her bonnet lay, with a
16869: face quite corpse-like above her dark garments.
16870: 
16871: "Esther!"
16872: 
16873: She heard Felix say the word, with an entreating cry, and went toward
16874: him with the swift movement of a frightened child toward its protector.
16875: He clasped her, and they kissed each other.
16876: 
16877: She never could recall anything else that happened, till she was in the
16878: carriage again with Mrs. Transome.
16879: 
16880: 
16881: 
16882: 
16883: CHAPTER XLVI.
16884: 
16885:     Why, there are maidens of heroic touch,
16886:     And yet they seem like things of gossamer
16887:     You'd pinch the life out of, as out of moths.
16888:     Oh, it is not loud tones and mouthingness,
16889:     'Tis not the arms akimbo and large strides,
16890:     That make a woman's force. The tiniest birds,
16891:     With softest downy breasts, have passions in them,
16892:     And are brave with love.
16893: 
16894: 
16895: Esther was so placed in the Court, under Mrs. Transome's wing, as to see
16896: and hear everything without effort: Harold had received them at the
16897: hotel, and had observed that Esther looked ill, and was unusually
16898: abstracted in her manner; but this seemed to be sufficiently accounted
16899: for by her sympathetic anxiety about the result of a trial in which the
16900: prisoner at the bar was a friend, and in which both her father and
16901: himself were important witnesses. Mrs. Transome had no reluctance to
16902: keep a small secret from her son, and no betrayal was made of that
16903: previous "engagement" of Esther's with her father. Harold was
16904: particularly delicate and unobtrusive in his attentions to-day: he had
16905: the consciousness that he was going to behave in a way that would
16906: gratify Esther and win her admiration, and we are all of us made more
16907: graceful by the inward presence of what we believe to be a generous
16908: purpose; our actions move to a hidden music--"a melody that's sweetly
16909: played in tune."
16910: 
16911: If Esther had been less absorbed by supreme feelings, she would have
16912: been aware that she was an object of special notice. In the bare
16913: squareness of a public hall, where there was not one jutting angle to
16914: hang a guess or a thought upon, not an image or a bit of color to stir
16915: the fancy, and where the only objects of speculation, of admiration, or
16916: of any interest whatever were human beings, that occupied positions
16917: indicating some importance, the notice bestowed on Esther would not have
16918: been surprising, even if it had been merely a tribute to her youthful
16919: charm, which was well championed by Mrs. Transome's elderly majesty. But
16920: it was due also to whisperings that she was an hereditary claimant of
16921: the Transome estates, whom Harold Transome was about to marry. Harold
16922: himself had of late not cared to conceal either the fact or the
16923: probability: they both tended rather to his honor than his dishonor. And
16924: to-day, when there was a good proportion of Trebians present, the
16925: whisperings spread rapidly.
16926: 
16927: The Court was still more crowded than on the previous day, when our poor
16928: acquaintance Dredge and his two collier companions were sentenced to a
16929: year's imprisonment with hard labor, and the more enlightened prisoner,
16930: who stole the Debarry's plate, to transportation for life. Poor Dredge
16931: had cried, had wished he'd "never heared of 'lection," and in spite of
16932: sermons from the jail chaplain, fell back on the explanation that this
16933: was a world in which Spratt and Old Nick were sure to get the best of
16934: it; so that in Dredge's case, at least, most observers must have had the
16935: melancholy conviction that there had been no enhancement of public
16936: spirit and faith in progress from that wave of political agitation which
16937: had reached the Sproxton Pits.
16938: 
16939: But curiosity was necessarily at a higher pitch to-day, when the
16940: character of the prisoner and the circumstances of his offence were of a
16941: highly unusual kind. Soon as Felix appeared at the bar, a murmur rose
16942: and spread into a loud buzz, which continued until there had been
16943: repeated authoritative calls for silence in the Court. Rather
16944: singularly, it was now for the first time that Esther had a feeling of
16945: pride in him on the ground simply of his appearance. At this moment,
16946: when he was the centre of a multitudinous gaze, which seemed to act on
16947: her own vision like a broad unmitigated daylight, she felt that there
16948: was something pre-eminent in him, notwithstanding the vicinity of
16949: numerous gentlemen. No apple-woman would have admired him; not only to
16950: feminine minds like Mrs. Tiliot's, but to many minds in coat and
16951: waistcoat, there was something dangerous and perhaps unprincipled in his
16952: bare throat and great Gothic head; and his somewhat massive person would
16953: doubtless have come out very oddly from the hands of a fashionable
16954: tailor of that time. But as Esther saw his large gray eyes looking round
16955: calmly and undefiantly, first at the audience generally, and then with a
16956: more observant expression at the lawyers and other persons immediately
16957: around him, she felt that he bore the outward stamp of a distinguished
16958: nature. Forgive her if she needed this satisfaction; all of us, whether
16959: men or women, are liable to this weakness of liking to have our
16960: preference justified before others as well as ourselves. Esther said
16961: inwardly, with a certain triumph, that Felix Holt looked as worthy to
16962: be chosen in the midst of this large assembly, as he had ever looked in
16963: their _tête-à-tête_ under the sombre light of the little parlor in
16964: Malthouse Yard.
16965: 
16966: Esther had felt some relief in hearing from her father that Felix had
16967: insisted on doing without his mother's presence; and since to Mrs.
16968: Holt's imagination, notwithstanding her general desire to have her
16969: character enquired into, there was no greatly consolatory difference
16970: between being a witness and a criminal, and an appearance of any kind
16971: "before the judge" could hardly be made to suggest anything definite
16972: that would overcome the dim sense of unalleviated disgrace, she had been
16973: less inclined than usual to complain of her son's decision. Esther had
16974: shuddered beforehand at the inevitable farce there would be in Mrs.
16975: Holt's testimony. But surely Felix would lose something for want of a
16976: witness who could testify to his behavior in the morning before he
16977: became involved in the tumult?
16978: 
16979: "He is really a fine young fellow," said Harold, coming to speak to
16980: Esther after a colloquy with the prisoner's solicitor. "I hope he will
16981: not make a blunder in defending himself."
16982: 
16983: "He is not likely to make a blunder," said Esther. She had recovered her
16984: color a little, and was brighter than she had been all the morning
16985: before.
16986: 
16987: Felix had seemed to include her in his general glance, but had avoided
16988: looking at her particularly. She understood how delicate feeling for her
16989: would prevent this, and that she might safely look at him, and toward
16990: her father, whom she could see in the same direction. Turning to Harold,
16991: to make an observation, she saw that he was looking toward the same
16992: point, but with an expression on his face that surprised her.
16993: 
16994: "Dear me," she said, prompted to speak without any reflection; "--how
16995: angry you look! I never saw you look so angry before. It is not my
16996: father you are looking at?"
16997: 
16998: "Oh, no! I am angry at something I'm looking away from," said Harold,
16999: making an effort to drive back the troublesome demon who would stare out
17000: at window. "It's that Jermyn," he added, glancing at his mother as well
17001: as Esther. "He will thrust himself under my eyes everywhere since I
17002: refused him an interview and returned his letter. I'm determined never
17003: to speak to him directly again, if I can help it."
17004: 
17005: Mrs. Transome heard with a changeless face. She had for some time been
17006: watching, and had taken on her marble look of immobility. She said an
17007: inward bitter "Of course!" to everything that was unpleasant.
17008: 
17009: After this Esther soon became impatient of all speech; her attention was
17010: rivetted on the proceedings of the Court, and on the mode in which Felix
17011: bore himself. In the case for the prosecution there was nothing more
17012: than a reproduction, with irrelevancies added by witnesses, of the facts
17013: already known to us. Spratt had retained consciousness enough, in the
17014: midst of his terror, to swear that, when he was tied to the finger-post,
17015: Felix was presiding over the actions of the mob. The landlady of the
17016: Seven Stars, who was indebted to Felix for rescue from pursuit by some
17017: drunken rioters, gave evidence that went to prove his assumption of
17018: leadership prior to the assault on Spratt,--remembering only that he had
17019: called away her pursuers to "better sport." Various respectable
17020: witnesses swore to Felix's "encouragement" of the rioters who were
17021: dragging Spratt in King Street; to his fatal assault on Tucker; and to
17022: his attitude in front of the drawing-room window at the Manor.
17023: 
17024: Three other witnesses gave evidence of expressions used by the prisoner,
17025: tending to show the character of the acts with which he was charged. Two
17026: were Treby tradesmen, the third was a clerk from Duffield. The clerk had
17027: heard Felix speak at Duffield; the Treby men had frequently heard him
17028: declare himself on public matters; and they all quoted expressions which
17029: tended to show that he had a virulent feeling against the respectable
17030: shopkeeping class, and that nothing was likely to be more congenial to
17031: him than the gutting of retailer's shops. No one else knew--the
17032: witnesses themselves did not know fully--how far their strong perception
17033: and memory on these points was due to a fourth mind, namely, that of Mr.
17034: John Johnson, the attorney, who was nearly related to one of the Treby
17035: witnesses, and a familiar acquaintance of the Duffield clerk. Man cannot
17036: be defined as an evidence-giving animal; and in the difficulty of
17037: getting up evidence on any subject, there is room for much unrecognized
17038: action of diligent persons who have the extra stimulus of some private
17039: motive. Mr. Johnson was present in Court to-day, but in a modest,
17040: retired situation. He had come down to give information to Mr. Jermyn,
17041: and to gather information in other quarters, which was well illuminated
17042: by the appearance of Esther in company with the Transomes.
17043: 
17044: When the case for the prosecution closed, all strangers thought that it
17045: looked very black for the prisoner. In two instances only Felix had
17046: chosen to put a cross-examining question. The first was to ask Spratt if
17047: he did not believe that his having been tied to the post had saved him
17048: from a probably mortal injury? The second was to ask the tradesman who
17049: swore to his having heard Felix tell the rioters to leave Tucker alone
17050: and come along with him, whether he had not, shortly before, heard cries
17051: among the mob summoning to an attack on the wine-vaults and brewery.
17052: 
17053: Esther had hitherto listened closely but calmly. She knew that there
17054: would be this strong adverse testimony; and all her hopes and fears were
17055: bent on what was to come beyond it. It was when the prisoner was asked
17056: what he had to adduce in reply that she felt herself in the grasp of
17057: that tremor which does not disable the mind, but rather gives keener
17058: consciousness of a mind having a penalty of body attached to it.
17059: 
17060: There was a silence as of night when Felix Holt began to speak. His
17061: voice was firm and clear: he spoke with simple gravity, and evidently
17062: without any enjoyment of the occasion. Esther had never seen his face
17063: look so weary.
17064: 
17065: "My Lord, I am not going to occupy the time of the Court with
17066: unnecessary words. I believe the witnesses for the prosecution have
17067: spoken the truth as far as a superficial observation would enable them
17068: to do it; and I see nothing that can weigh with the jury in my favor,
17069: unless they believe my statement of my own motives, and the testimony
17070: that certain witnesses will give to my character and purposes as being
17071: inconsistent with my willingly abetting disorder. I will tell the Court
17072: in as few words as I can, how I got entangled in the mob, how I came to
17073: attack the constable, and how I was led to take a course which seems
17074: rather mad to myself, now I look back upon it."
17075: 
17076: Felix then gave a concise narrative of his motives and conduct on the
17077: day of the riot, from the moment when he was startled into quitting his
17078: work by the earlier uproar of the morning. He omitted, of course, his
17079: visit to Malthouse Yard, and merely said that he went out to walk again
17080: after returning to quiet his mother's mind. He got warmed by the story
17081: of his experience, which moved him more strongly than ever, now he
17082: recalled it in vibrating words before a large audience of his
17083: fellow-men. The sublime delight of truthful speech to one who has the
17084: great gift of uttering it, will make itself felt even through the pangs
17085: of sorrow.
17086: 
17087: "That is all I have to say for myself, my Lord. I pleaded 'Not guilty'
17088: to the charge of manslaughter, because I know that word may carry a
17089: meaning which would not fairly apply to my act. When I threw Tucker
17090: down, I did not see the possibility that he would die from a sort of
17091: attack which ordinarily occurs in fighting without any fatal effect. As
17092: to my assaulting a constable, it was a quick choice between two evils: I
17093: should else have been disabled. And he attacked me under a mistake about
17094: my intentions. I'm not prepared to say I never would assault a constable
17095: where I had more chance of deliberation. I certainly should assault him
17096: if I saw him doing anything that made my blood boil: I reverence the
17097: law, but not where it is a pretext for wrong, which it should be the
17098: very object of law to hinder. I consider that I should be making an
17099: unworthy defence, if I let the Court infer from what I say myself, or
17100: from what is said by my witnesses, that because I am a man who hates
17101: drunken, motiveless disorder, or any wanton harm, therefore I am a man
17102: who would never fight against authority: I hold it blasphemy to say that
17103: a man ought not to fight against authority: there is no great religion
17104: and no great freedom that has not done it, in the beginning. It would be
17105: impertinent for me to speak of this now, if I did not need to say in my
17106: own defence, that I should hold myself the worst sort of traitor if I
17107: put my hand to either fighting or disorder--which must mean to injure
17108: somebody--if I were not urged to it by what I hold to be sacred
17109: feelings, making a sacred duty either to my own manhood or to my
17110: fellow-man. And certainly," Felix ended, with a strong ring of scorn in
17111: his voice, "I never held it a sacred duty to try and get a Radical
17112: candidate returned for North Loamshire, by willingly heading a drunken
17113: howling mob, whose public action must consist in breaking windows,
17114: destroying hard-got produce, and endangering the lives of men and women.
17115: I have no more to say, my Lord."
17116: 
17117: "I foresaw he would make a blunder," said Harold, in a low voice to
17118: Esther. Then, seeing her shrink a little, he feared she might suspect
17119: him of being merely stung by the allusion to himself. "I don't mean what
17120: he said about the Radical candidate," he added, hastily, in correction.
17121: "I don't mean the last sentence. I mean that whole peroration of his,
17122: which he ought to have left unsaid. It has done him harm with the
17123: jury--they won't understand it, or rather will misunderstand it. And
17124: I'll answer for it, it has soured the judge. It remains to be seen what
17125: we witnesses can say for him, to nullify the effect of what he has said
17126: for himself. I hope the attorney has done his best in collecting the
17127: evidence: I understand the expense of the witnesses is undertaken by
17128: some Liberals at Glasgow and in Lancashire, friends of Holt's. But I
17129: suppose your father has told you."
17130: 
17131: The first witness called to the defence was Mr. Lyon. The gist of his
17132: statements was, that from the beginning of September last till the day
17133: of the election he was in very frequent intercourse with the prisoner;
17134: that he had become intimately acquainted with his character and views of
17135: life, and his conduct with respect to the election, and that these were
17136: totally inconsistent with any other supposition than his being involved
17137: in the riot, and his fatal encounter with the constable, were due to the
17138: calamitous failure of a bold but good purpose. He stated further that he
17139: had been present when an interview had occurred in his own house between
17140: the prisoner and Mr. Harold Transome, who was then canvassing for the
17141: representation of North Loamshire. That the object of the prisoner in
17142: seeking this interview had been to inform Mr. Transome of treating given
17143: in his name to the workmen in the pits and on the canal at Sproxton, and
17144: to remonstrate against its continuance; the prisoner fearing that
17145: disturbance and mischief might result from what he believed to be the
17146: end toward which this treating was directed--namely, the presence of
17147: these men on the occasions of the nomination and polling. Several times
17148: after this interview, Mr. Lyon said, he had heard Felix Holt recur to
17149: the subject therein discussed with expressions of grief and anxiety. He
17150: himself was in the habit of visiting Sproxton in his ministerial
17151: capacity: he knew fully what the prisoner had done there in order to
17152: found a night school, and was certain that the prisoner's interest in
17153: the workingmen of that district turned entirely on the possibility of
17154: converting them somewhat to habits of soberness and to a due care for
17155: the instruction of their children. Finally, he stated that the prisoner,
17156: in compliance with his request, had been present at Duffield on the day
17157: of the nomination, and had on his return expressed himself with strong
17158: indignation concerning the employment of the Sproxton men on that
17159: occasion, and what he called the wickedness of hiring blind violence.
17160: 
17161: The quaint appearance and manner of the little Dissenting minister could
17162: not fail to stimulate the peculiar wit of the bar. He was subjected to
17163: a troublesome cross-examination, which he bore with wide-eyed
17164: short-sighted quietude and absorption in the duty of truthful response.
17165: On being asked rather sneeringly, if the prisoner was not one of his
17166: flock? he answered, in that deeper tone which made one of the most
17167: effective transitions of his varying voice--
17168: 
17169: "Nay--would to God he were! I should then feel that the great virtues
17170: and the pure life I have beheld in him were a witness to the efficacy of
17171: the faith I believe in and the discipline of the Church whereunto I
17172: belong."
17173: 
17174: Perhaps it required a larger power of comparison than was possessed by
17175: any of that audience to appreciate the moral elevation of an Independent
17176: minister who could utter those words. Nevertheless there was a murmur
17177: which was clearly one of sympathy.
17178: 
17179: The next witness, and the one on whom the interest of the spectators was
17180: chiefly concentrated, was Harold Transome. There was a decided
17181: predominance of Tory feeling in the Court, and the human disposition to
17182: enjoy the infliction of a little punishment on an opposite party, was in
17183: this instance, of a Tory complexion. Harold was keenly alive to this,
17184: and to everything else that might prove disagreeable to him in his
17185: having to appear in the witness-box. But he was not likely to lose his
17186: self-possession, or to fail in adjusting himself gracefully, under
17187: conditions which most men would find it difficult to carry without
17188: awkwardness. He had generosity and candor enough to bear Felix Holt's
17189: proud rejection of his advances without any petty resentment; he had all
17190: the susceptibilities of a gentleman; and these moral qualities gave the
17191: right direction to his acumen, in judging of the behavior that would
17192: best secure his dignity. Everything requiring self-command was easier to
17193: him because of Esther's presence; for her admiration was just then the
17194: object which this well-tanned man of the world had it most at heart to
17195: secure.
17196: 
17197: When he entered the witness-box he was much admired by the ladies
17198: amongst the audience, many of whom sighed a little at the thought of his
17199: wrong course in politics. He certainly looked like a handsome portrait
17200: by Sir Thomas Lawrence, in which that remarkable artist had happily
17201: omitted the usual excess of honeyed blandness mixed with alert
17202: intelligence, which is hardly compatible with the state of man out of
17203: paradise. He stood not far off Felix; and the two Radicals certainly
17204: made a striking contrast. Felix might have come from the hands of a
17205: sculptor in the later Roman period, when the plastic impulse was stirred
17206: by the grandeur of barbaric forms--when rolled collars were not yet
17207: conceived, and satin stocks were not.
17208: 
17209: Harold Transome declared he had had only one interview with the
17210: prisoner: it was the interview referred to by the previous witness, in
17211: whose presence and in whose house it was begun. The interview, however,
17212: was continued beyond the observation of Mr. Lyon. The prisoner and
17213: himself quitted the Dissenting minister's house in Malthouse Yard
17214: together, and proceeded to the office of Mr. Jermyn, who was then
17215: conducting electioneering business on his behalf. His object was to
17216: comply with Holt's remonstrance by enquiring into the alleged
17217: proceedings at Sproxton, and, if possible, to put a stop to them. Holt's
17218: language, both in the Malthouse Yard and in the attorney's office, was
17219: strong: he was evidently indignant, and his indignation turned on the
17220: danger of employing ignorant men excited by drink on an occasion of
17221: popular concourse. He believed that Holt's sole motive was the
17222: prevention of disorder, and what he considered the demoralization of the
17223: workmen by treating. The event had certainly justified his
17224: remonstrances. He had not had any subsequent opportunities of observing
17225: the prisoner; but if any reliance was to be placed on a rational
17226: conclusion, it must, he thought, be plain that the anxiety thus
17227: manifested by Holt was a guarantee of the statement he had made as to
17228: his motives on the day of the riot. His entire impression from Holt's
17229: manner in that single interview was that he was a moral and political
17230: enthusiast, who, if he sought to coerce others, would seek to coerce
17231: them into a difficult, and perhaps impracticable, scrupulosity.
17232: 
17233: Harold spoke with as noticeable directness and emphasis, as if what he
17234: said could have no reaction on himself. He had of course not entered
17235: unnecessarily into what occurred in Jermyn's office. But now he was
17236: subjected to a cross-examination on this subject, which gave rise to
17237: some subdued shrugs, smiles, and winks, among county gentlemen.
17238: 
17239: The questions were directed so as to bring out, if possible, some
17240: indication that Felix Holt was moved to his remonstrance by personal
17241: resentment against the political agents concerned in setting on foot the
17242: treating at Sproxton, but such questioning is a sort of target-shooting
17243: that sometimes hits about widely. The cross-examining counsel had close
17244: connections among the Tories of Loamshire, and enjoyed his business
17245: to-day. Under the fire of various questions about Jermyn and the agent
17246: employed by him at Sproxton, Harold got warm, and in one of his replies
17247: said, with rapid sharpness--
17248: 
17249: "Mr. Jermyn was my agent then, not now: I have no longer any but hostile
17250: relations with him."
17251: 
17252: The sense that he had shown a slight heat would have vexed Harold more
17253: if he had not got some satisfaction out of the thought that Jermyn heard
17254: those words. He recovered his good temper quickly, and when,
17255: subsequently, the question came--
17256: 
17257: "You acquiesced in the treating of the Sproxton men, as necessary to the
17258: efficient working of the reformed constituency?" Harold replied, with
17259: quiet fluency--"Yes; on my return to England, before I put up for North
17260: Loamshire, I got the best advice from practised agents, both Whig and
17261: Tory. They all agreed as to electioneering measures."
17262: 
17263: The next witness was Michael Brincey, otherwise Mike Brindle, who gave
17264: evidence of the sayings and doings of the prisoner among the Sproxton
17265: men. Mike declared that Felix went "uncommon again' drink, and
17266: pitch-and-toss, and quarrelling, and sich," and was "all for schooling
17267: and bringing up the little chaps"; but on being cross-examined, he
17268: admitted that he "couldn't give much account"; that Felix did talk
17269: again' idle folks, whether poor or rich, and that most like he meant the
17270: rich, who had "a rights to be idle," which was what he, Mike, liked
17271: himself sometimes, though for the most part he was "a hard-working
17272: butty." On being checked for this superfluous allegation of his own
17273: theory and practice, Mike became timidly conscious that answering was a
17274: great mystery beyond the reach of a butty's soul, and began to err from
17275: defect instead of excess. However, he reasserted that what Felix most
17276: wanted was, "to get 'em to set up a school for the little chaps."
17277: 
17278: With the two succeeding witnesses, who swore to the fact that Felix had
17279: tried to lead the mob along Hobb's Lane instead of toward the Manor, and
17280: to the violently threatening character of Tucker's attack on him, the
17281: case for the defence was understood to close.
17282: 
17283: Meanwhile Esther had been looking on and listening with growing misery,
17284: in the sense that all had not been said which might have been said on
17285: behalf of Felix. If it was the jury who were to be acted on, she argued
17286: to herself, there might have been an impression made on their feelings
17287: which would determine their verdict. Was it not constantly said and seen
17288: that juries pronounced Guilty or Not Guilty from sympathy for or against
17289: the accused? She was too inexperienced to check her own argument by
17290: thoroughly representing to herself the course of things: how the counsel
17291: for the prosecution would reply, and how the judge would sum up, with
17292: the object of cooling down sympathy into deliberation. What she had
17293: painfully pressing on her inward vision was that the trial was coming to
17294: an end, and that the voice of right and truth had not been strong
17295: enough.
17296: 
17297: When a woman feels purely and nobly, that ardor of hers which breaks
17298: through formulas too rigorously urged on men by daily practical needs,
17299: makes one of her most precious influences: she is the added impulse that
17300: shatters the stiffening crust of cautious experience. Her inspired
17301: ignorance gives a sublimity to actions so incongruously simple, that
17302: otherwise they would make men smile. Some of that ardor which has
17303: flashed out and illuminated all poetry and history was burning to-day in
17304: the bosom of sweet Esther Lyon. In this, at least, her woman's lot was
17305: perfect: that the man she loved was her hero; that her woman's passion
17306: and her reverence for rarest goodness rushed together in an undivided
17307: current. And to-day they were making one danger, one terror, one
17308: irresistible impulse for her heart. Her feelings were growing into a
17309: necessity for action, rather than a resolve to act. She could not
17310: support the thought that the trial would come to an end, that sentence
17311: would be passed on Felix, and that all the while something had been
17312: omitted which might have been said for him. There had been no witness to
17313: tell what had been his behavior and state of mind just before the riot.
17314: She must do it. It was possible. There was time. But not too much time.
17315: All other agitation became merged in eagerness not to let the moment
17316: escape. The last witness was being called. Harold Transome had not been
17317: able to get back to her on leaving the witness-box, but Mr. Lingon was
17318: close by her. With firm quickness she said to him--
17319: 
17320: "Pray tell the attorney that I have evidence to give for the
17321: prisoner--lose no time."
17322: 
17323: "Do you know what you are going to say, my dear?" said Mr. Lingon,
17324: looking at her in astonishment.
17325: 
17326: "Yes--I entreat you, for God's sake," said Esther, in that low tone of
17327: urgent beseeching which is equivalent to a cry; and with a look of
17328: appeal more penetrating still, "I would rather die than not do it."
17329: 
17330: The old rector, always leaning to the good-natured view of things, felt
17331: chiefly that there seemed to be an additional chance for the poor fellow
17332: who had got himself into trouble. He disputed no farther, but went to
17333: the attorney.
17334: 
17335: Before Harold was aware of Esther's intention she was on her way to the
17336: witness-box. When she appeared there, it was as if a vibration, quick as
17337: light, had gone through the Court and had shaken Felix himself, who had
17338: hitherto seemed impassive. A sort of a gleam seemed to shoot across his
17339: face, and any one close to him would have seen that his hand, which lay
17340: on the edge of the dock, trembled.
17341: 
17342: At the first moment Harold was startled and alarmed; the next, he felt
17343: delight in Esther's beautiful aspect, and in the admiration of the
17344: Court. There was no blush on her face: she stood, divested of all
17345: personal considerations whether of vanity or shyness. Her clear voice
17346: sounded as it might have done if she had been making a confession of
17347: faith. She began and went on without query or interruption. Every face
17348: looked grave and respectful.
17349: 
17350: "I am Esther Lyon, the daughter of Mr. Lyon, the Independent minister at
17351: Treby, who has been one of the witnesses for the prisoner. I know Felix
17352: Holt well. On the day of the election at Treby, when I had been much
17353: alarmed by the noises that reached me from the main street, Felix Holt
17354: came to call upon me. He knew that my father was away, and he thought
17355: that I should be alarmed by the sounds of disturbance. It was about the
17356: middle of the day, and he came to tell me that the disturbance was
17357: quieted, and that the streets were nearly emptied. But he said he feared
17358: that the men would collect again after drinking, and that something
17359: worse might happen later in the day. And he was in much sadness at this
17360: thought. He stayed a little while, and then he left me. He was very
17361: melancholy. His mind was full of great resolutions that came from his
17362: kind feeling toward others. It was the last thing he would have done to
17363: join in riot or to hurt any man, if he could have helped it. His nature
17364: is very noble; he is tender-hearted; he could never have had any
17365: intention that was not brave and good."
17366: 
17367: There was something so naive and beautiful in this action of Esther's,
17368: that it conquered every low or petty suggestion even in the commonest
17369: minds. The three men in that assembly who knew her best--even her father
17370: and Felix Holt--felt a thrill of surprise mingling with their
17371: admiration. This bright, delicate, beautiful-shaped thing that seemed
17372: most like a toy or ornament--some hand had touched the chords, and there
17373: came forth music that brought tears. Half a year before, Esther's dread
17374: of being ridiculous spread over the surface of her life; but the depth
17375: below was sleeping.
17376: 
17377: Harold Transome was ready to give her his hand and lead her back to her
17378: place. When she was there, Felix, for the first time, could not help
17379: looking toward her, and their eyes met in one solemn glance.
17380: 
17381: Afterward Esther found herself unable to listen so as to form any
17382: judgment on what she heard. The acting out of that strong impulse had
17383: exhausted every energy. There was a brief pause, filled with a murmur, a
17384: buzz, and much coughing. The audience generally felt as if dull weather
17385: was setting in again. And under those auspices the counsel for the
17386: prosecution got up to make his reply. Esther's deed had its effect
17387: beyond the momentary one, but the effect was not visible in the rigid
17388: necessities of legal procedure. The counsel's duty of restoring all
17389: unfavorable facts to due prominence in the minds of the jurors, had its
17390: effect altogether reinforced by the summing-up of the judge. Even the
17391: bare discernment of facts, much more their arrangement with a view to
17392: inferences, must carry a bias: human impartiality, whether judicial or
17393: not, can hardly escape being more or less loaded. It was not that the
17394: judge had severe intentions; it was only that he saw with severity. The
17395: conduct of Felix was not such as inclined him to indulgent
17396: consideration, and, in his directions to the jury, that mental attitude
17397: necessarily told on the light in which he placed the homicide. Even to
17398: many in the Court who were not constrained by judicial duty, it seemed
17399: that though this high regard felt for the prisoner by his friends, and
17400: especially by a generous-hearted woman, was very pretty, such conduct as
17401: his was not the less dangerous and foolish, and assaulting and killing a
17402: constable was not the less an offence to be regarded without leniency.
17403: 
17404: Esther seemed now so tremulous, and looked so ill, that Harold begged
17405: her to leave the Court with his mother and Mr. Lingon. He would come and
17406: tell her the issue. But she said, quietly, that she would rather stay;
17407: she was only a little overcome by the exertion of speaking. She was
17408: inwardly resolved to see Felix to the last moment before he left the
17409: Court.
17410: 
17411: Though she could not follow the address of the counsel or the judge, she
17412: had a keen ear for what was brief and decisive. She heard the verdict,
17413: "Guilty of manslaughter." And every word uttered by the judge in
17414: pronouncing sentence fell upon her like an unforgetable sound that would
17415: come back in dreaming and in waking. She had her eyes on Felix, and at
17416: the words, "Imprisonment for four years," she saw his lip tremble. But
17417: otherwise he stood firm and calm.
17418: 
17419: Esther gave a start from her seat. Her heart swelled with a horrible
17420: sensation of pain; but, alarmed lest she should lose her self-command,
17421: she grasped Mrs. Transome's hand, getting some strength from that human
17422: contact.
17423: 
17424: Esther saw that Felix had turned. She could no longer see his face.
17425: "Yes," she said, drawing down her veil, "let us go."
17426: 
17427: 
17428: 
17429: 
17430: CHAPTER XLVII.
17431: 
17432:     The devil tempts us not--'tis we tempt him,
17433:     Beckoning his skill with opportunity.
17434: 
17435: 
17436: The more permanent effect of Esther's action in the trial was visible in
17437: a meeting which took place the next day in the principal room of the
17438: White Hart of Loamford. To the magistrates and other county gentlemen
17439: who were drawn together about noon, some of the necessary impulse might
17440: have been lacking but for that stirring of heart in certain
17441: just-spirited men and good fathers among them, which had been raised to
17442: a high pitch of emotion by Esther's maidenly fervor. Among these one of
17443: the foremost was Sir Maximus Debarry, who had come to the assizes with a
17444: mind, as usual, slightly rebellious under an influence which he never
17445: ultimately resisted--the influence of his son. Philip Debarry himself
17446: was detained in London, but in his correspondence with his father he had
17447: urged him, as well as his uncle Augustus, to keep eyes and interest
17448: awake on the subject of Felix Holt, whom, from all the knowledge of the
17449: case he had been able to obtain, he was inclined to believe peculiarly
17450: unfortunate rather than guilty. Philip had said he was the more anxious
17451: that his family should intervene benevolently in this affair, if it were
17452: possible, because he understood that Mr. Lyon took the young man's case
17453: particularly to heart, and he should always regard himself as obliged to
17454: the old preacher. At this superfineness of consideration Sir Maximus had
17455: vented a few "pshaws!" and, in relation to the whole affair, had
17456: grumbled that Phil was always setting him to do he didn't know
17457: what--always seeming to turn nothing into something by dint of words
17458: which hadn't so much substance as a mote behind them. Nevertheless he
17459: was coerced; and in reality he was willing to do anything fair or
17460: good-natured which had a handle that his understanding could lay hold
17461: of. His brother, the rector, desired to be rigorously just; but he had
17462: come to Loamford with a severe opinion concerning Felix, thinking that
17463: some sharp punishment might be a wholesome check on the career of a
17464: young man disposed to rely too much on his own crude devices.
17465: 
17466: Before the trial commenced, Sir Maximus had naturally been one of those
17467: who had observed Esther with curiosity, owing to the report of her
17468: inheritance, and her probable marriage to his once welcome but now
17469: exasperating neighbor, Harold Transome; and he had made the emphatic
17470: comment--"A fine girl! something thoroughbred in the look of her. Too
17471: good for a Radical; that's all I have to say." But during the trial Sir
17472: Maximus was wrought into a state of sympathetic ardor that needed no
17473: fanning. As soon as he could take his brother by the buttonhole, he
17474: said--
17475: 
17476: "I tell you what, Gus! we must exert ourselves to get a pardon for this
17477: young fellow. Confound it! what's the use of mewing him up for four
17478: years? Example? Nonsense. Will there be a man knocked down the less for
17479: it? That girl made me cry. Depend upon it, whether she's going to marry
17480: Transome or not, she's been fond of Holt--in her poverty, you know.
17481: She's a modest, brave, beautiful woman. I'd ride a steeple-chase, old as
17482: I am, to gratify her feelings. Hang it! the fellow's a good fellow if
17483: she thinks so. And he threw out a fine sneer, I thought, at the Radical
17484: candidate. Depend upon it, he's a good fellow at bottom."
17485: 
17486: The rector had not exactly the same kind of ardor, nor was he open too
17487: precisely that process of proof which appeared to have convinced Sir
17488: Maximus; but he had been so far influenced as to be inclined to unite in
17489: an effort on the side of mercy, observing also that he "knew Phil would
17490: be on that side." And by the co-operation of similar movements in the
17491: minds of other men whose names were of weight, a meeting had been
17492: determined on to consult about getting up a memorial to the Home
17493: Secretary on behalf of Felix Holt. His case had never had the sort of
17494: significance that could rouse political partisanship; and such interest
17495: as was now felt in him was still more unmixed with that inducement. The
17496: gentlemen who gathered in the room at the White Hart were--not as the
17497: large imagination of the _North_ _Loamshire Herald_ suggested, "of all
17498: shades of political opinion," but--of as many shades as were to be found
17499: among the gentlemen of that county.
17500: 
17501: Harold Transome had been energetically active in bringing about this
17502: meeting. Over and above the stings of conscience and a determination to
17503: act up to the level of all recognized honorableness, he had the powerful
17504: motive of desiring to do what would satisfy Esther. His gradually
17505: heightened perception that she had a strong feeling toward Felix Holt
17506: had not made him uneasy. Harold had a conviction that might have seemed
17507: like fatuity if it had not been that he saw the effect he produced on
17508: Esther by the light of his opinions about women in general. The
17509: conviction was, that Felix Holt could not be his rival in any formidable
17510: sense. Esther's admiration for this eccentric young man was, he thought,
17511: a moral enthusiasm, a romantic fervor, which was one among those many
17512: attractions quite novel in his own experience; her distress about the
17513: trouble of one who had been a familiar object in her former home, was no
17514: more than naturally followed from a tender woman's compassion. The place
17515: young Holt had held in her regard had necessarily changed its relations
17516: now that her lot was so widely changed. It is undeniable, that what most
17517: conduced to the quieting nature of Harold's conclusions was the
17518: influence on his imagination of the more or less detailed reasons that
17519: Felix Holt was a watchmaker, that his home and dress were of a certain
17520: quality, that his person and manners--that, in short (for Harold, like
17521: the rest of us, had many impressions which saved him the trouble of
17522: distinct ideas), Felix Holt was not the sort of a man a woman would be
17523: in love with when she was wooed by Harold Transome.
17524: 
17525: Thus, he was sufficiently at rest on this point not to be exercising any
17526: painful self-conquest in acting as the zealous advocate of Felix Holt's
17527: cause with all persons worth influencing; but it was by no direct
17528: intercourse between him and Sir Maximus that they found themselves in
17529: co-operation, for the old baronet would not recognize Harold by more
17530: than the faintest bow, and Harold was not a man to expose himself to a
17531: rebuff. Whatever he in his inmost soul regarded as nothing more than a
17532: narrow prejudice, he could defy, not with airs of importance, but with
17533: easy indifference. He could bear most things good-humoredly where he
17534: felt that he had the superiority. The object of the meeting was
17535: discussed, and the memorial agreed upon without any clashing. Mr.
17536: Lingon was gone home, but it was expected that his concurrence and
17537: signature would be given, as well as those of other gentlemen who were
17538: absent. The business gradually reached that stage at which the
17539: concentration of interest ceases--when the attention of all but a few
17540: who are more practically concerned drops off and disperses itself in
17541: private chat, and there is no longer any particular reason why everybody
17542: stays except that everybody is there. The room was rather a long one,
17543: and invited to a little movement; one gentleman drew another aside to
17544: speak in an undertone about Scotch bullocks; another had something to
17545: say about the North Loamshire hunt to a friend who was the reverse of
17546: good-looking, but who, nevertheless, while listening, showed his
17547: strength of mind by giving a severe attention also to his full-length
17548: reflection in the handsome tall mirror that filled the space between two
17549: windows. And in this way the groups were continually shifting.
17550: 
17551: But in the meantime there were moving toward this room at the White Hart
17552: the footsteps of a person whose presence had not been invited, and who,
17553: very far from being drawn thither by the belief that he would be
17554: welcome, knew well that his entrance would, to one person at least, be
17555: bitterly disagreeable. They were the footsteps of Mr. Jermyn, whose
17556: appearance that morning was not less comely and less carefully tended
17557: than usual, but who was suffering the torment of a compressed rage,
17558: which, if not impotent to inflict pain on another, was impotent to avert
17559: evil from himself. After his interview with Mrs. Transome there had been
17560: for some reasons a delay of positive procedures against him by Harold,
17561: of which delay Jermyn had twice availed himself; first, to seek an
17562: interview with Harold, and then to send him a letter. The interview had
17563: been refused; and the letter had been returned, with the statement that
17564: no communication could take place except through Harold's lawyers. And
17565: yesterday Johnson had brought Jermyn the information that he would
17566: quickly hear of the proceedings in Chancery being resumed: the watch
17567: Johnson kept in town had given him secure knowledge on this head. A
17568: doomed animal, with every issue earthed up except that where its enemy
17569: stands, must, if it has teeth and fierceness, try its one chance without
17570: delay. And a man may reach a point in his life in which his impulses are
17571: not distinguished from those of a hunted brute by any capability of
17572: scruples. Our selfishness is so robust and many-clutching, that, well
17573: encouraged, it easily devours all sustenance away from our poor little
17574: scruples.
17575: 
17576: Since Harold would not give Jermyn access to him, that vigorous attorney
17577: was resolved to take it. He knew all about the meeting at the White
17578: Hart, and he was going thither with the determination of accosting
17579: Harold. He thought he knew what he should say, and the tone in which he
17580: should say it. It would be a vague intimation, carrying the effect of a
17581: threat, which should compel Harold to give him a private interview. To
17582: any counter-consideration that presented itself in his mind--to anything
17583: that an imagined voice might say--the imagined answer arose, "That's all
17584: very fine, but I'm not going to be ruined if I can help it--least of
17585: all, ruined in that way." Shall we call it degeneration or gradual
17586: development--this effect of thirty additional winters on the
17587: soft-glancing, versifying young Jermyn?
17588: 
17589: When Jermyn entered the room at the White Hart he did not immediately
17590: see Harold. The door was at the extremity of the room, and the view was
17591: obstructed by groups of gentlemen with figures broadened by overcoats.
17592: His entrance excited no particular observation: several persons had come
17593: in late. Only one or two, who knew Jermyn well, were not too much
17594: preoccupied to have a glancing remembrance of what had been chatted
17595: about freely the day before--Harold's irritated reply about his agent,
17596: from the witness box. Receiving and giving a slight nod here and there,
17597: Jermyn pushed his way, looking round keenly, until he saw Harold
17598: standing near the other end of the room. The solicitor who had acted for
17599: Felix was just then speaking to him, but having put a paper into his
17600: hand turned away; and Harold, standing isolated, though at no great
17601: distance from others, bent his eyes on the paper. He looked brilliant
17602: that morning; his blood was flowing prosperously. He had come in after a
17603: ride, and was additionally brightened by rapid talk and the excitement
17604: of seeking to impress himself favorably, or at least powerfully, on the
17605: minds of neighbors nearer or more remote. He had just that amount of
17606: flush which indicates that life is more enjoyable than usual; and as he
17607: stood with his left hand caressing his whisker, and his right holding
17608: the paper and his riding-whip, his dark eyes running rapidly along the
17609: written lines, and his lips reposing in a curve of good-humor which had
17610: more happiness in it than a smile, all beholders might have seen that
17611: his mind was at ease.
17612: 
17613: Jermyn walked quickly and quietly close up to him. The two men were of
17614: the same height, and before Harold looked round Jermyn's voice was
17615: saying, close to his ear, not in a whisper, but in a hard, incisive,
17616: disrespectful and yet not loud tone--
17617: 
17618: "Mr. Transome, I must speak to you in private."
17619: 
17620: The sound jarred through Harold with a sensation all the more
17621: insufferable because of the revulsion from the satisfied, almost elated,
17622: state in which it had seized him. He started and looked round into
17623: Jermyn's eyes. For an instant, which seemed long, there was no sound
17624: between them, but only angry hatred gathering in the two faces. Harold
17625: felt himself going to crush this insolence: Jermyn felt that he had
17626: words within him that were fangs to clutch this obstinate strength, and
17627: wring forth the blood and compel submission. And Jermyn's impulse was
17628: the more urgent. He said, in a tone that was rather lower, but yet
17629: harder and more biting--
17630: 
17631: "You will repent else--for your mother's sake."
17632: 
17633: At that sound, quick as a leaping flame, Harold had struck Jermyn across
17634: the face with his whip. The brim of the hat had been a defense. Jermyn,
17635: a powerful man, had instantly thrust out his hand and clutched Harold
17636: hard by the clothes just below the throat, pushing him slightly so as to
17637: make him stagger.
17638: 
17639: By this time everybody's attention had been called to this end of the
17640: room, but both Jermyn and Harold were beyond being arrested by any
17641: consciousness of spectators.
17642: 
17643: "Let me go, you scoundrel!" said Harold, fiercely, "or I'll be the death
17644: of you."
17645: 
17646: "Do," said Jermyn, in a grating voice; "_I am your father_."
17647: 
17648: In the thrust by which Harold had been made to stagger backward a
17649: little, the two men had got very near the long mirror. They were both
17650: white; both had anger and hatred in their faces; the hands of both were
17651: upraised. As Harold heard the last terrible words he started at a
17652: leaping throb that went through him, and in the start turned his eyes
17653: away from Jermyn's face. He turned them on the same face in the glass
17654: with his own beside it, and saw the hated fatherhood reasserted.
17655: 
17656: The strong man reeled with a sick faintness. But in the same moment
17657: Jermyn released his hold, and Harold felt himself supported by the arm.
17658: It was Sir Maximus Debarry who had taken hold of him.
17659: 
17660: "Leave the room, sir!" the baronet said to Jermyn, in a voice of
17661: imperious scorn. "This is a meeting of gentlemen."
17662: 
17663: "Come, Harold," he said, in the old friendly voice, "come away with
17664: me."
17665: 
17666: 
17667: 
17668: 
17669: CHAPTER XLVIII.
17670: 
17671:     'Tis law as steadfast as the throne of Zeus--
17672:     Our days are heritors of days gone by.
17673: 
17674:                                   ÆSCHYLUS: _Agamemnon_.
17675: 
17676: 
17677: A little after five o'clock that day, Harold arrived at Transome Court.
17678: As he was winding along the broad road of the park, some parting gleams
17679: of the March sun pierced the trees here and there, and threw on the
17680: grass a long shadow of himself and the groom riding, and illuminated a
17681: window or two of the home he was approaching. But the bitterness in his
17682: mind made these sunny gleams almost as odious as an artificial smile. He
17683: wished he had never come back to this pale English sunshine.
17684: 
17685: In the course of his eighteen miles' drive he had made up his mind what
17686: he would do. He understood now, as he had never understood before, the
17687: neglected solitariness of his mother's life, the allusions and
17688: innuendoes which had come out during the election. But with a proud
17689: insurrection against the hardship of an ignominy which was not of his
17690: own making, he inwardly said, that if the circumstances of his birth
17691: were such as to warrant any man in regarding his character of gentleman
17692: with ready suspicion, that character should be the more strongly
17693: asserted in his conduct. No one should be able to allege with any show
17694: of proof that he had inherited meanness.
17695: 
17696: As he stepped from the carriage and entered the hall, there were the
17697: voice and the trotting feet of little Harry as usual, and the rush to
17698: clasp his father's leg and make his joyful puppy-like noises. Harold
17699: just touched the boy's head, and then said to Dominic in a weary voice--
17700: 
17701: "Take the child away. Ask where my mother is."
17702: 
17703: Mrs. Transome, Dominic said, was up-stairs. He had seen her go up after
17704: coming in from her walk with Miss Lyon, and she had not come down again.
17705: 
17706: Harold throwing off his hat and greatcoat, went straight to his mother's
17707: dressing-room. There was still a hope in his mind. He might be suffering
17708: simply from a lie. There is much misery created in the world by mere
17709: mistake or slander, and he might have been stunned by a lie suggested by
17710: such slander. He rapped at his mother's door.
17711: 
17712: Her voice said immediately, "Come in."
17713: 
17714: Mrs. Transome was resting in her easy-chair, as she often did between an
17715: afternoon walk and dinner. She had taken off her walking-dress and
17716: wrapped herself in a soft dressing-gown. She was neither more nor less
17717: empty of joy than usual. But when she saw Harold, a dreadful certainty
17718: took possession of her. It was as if a long expected letter, with a
17719: black seal, had come at last.
17720: 
17721: Harold's face told her what to fear the more decisively, because she had
17722: never before seen it express a man's deep agitation. Since the time of
17723: its pouting childhood and careless youth she had seen only the confident
17724: strength and good-humored imperiousness of maturity. The last five hours
17725: had made a change as great as illness makes. Harold looked as if he had
17726: been wrestling, and had had some terrible blow. His eyes had that sunken
17727: look which, because it is unusual, seems to intensify expression.
17728: 
17729: He looked at his mother as he entered, and her eyes followed him as he
17730: moved, till he came and stood in front of her, she looking up at him,
17731: with white lips.
17732: 
17733: "Mother," he said, speaking with a distinct slowness, in strange
17734: contrast with his habitual manner, "tell me the truth, that I may know
17735: how to act."
17736: 
17737: He paused a moment, and then said, "Who is my father?"
17738: 
17739: She was mute: her lips only trembled. Harold stood silent for a few
17740: moments, as if waiting. Then he spoke again.
17741: 
17742: "_He_ has said--said it before others--that _he_ is my father."
17743: 
17744: He looked still at his mother. She seemed as if age were striking her
17745: with a sudden wand--as if her trembling face were getting haggard before
17746: him. She was mute. But her eyes had not fallen; they looked up in
17747: helpless misery at her son.
17748: 
17749: Her son turned away his eyes from her, and left her. In that moment
17750: Harold felt hard: he could show no pity. All the pride of his nature
17751: rebelled against his sonship.
17752: 
17753: 
17754: 
17755: 
17756: CHAPTER XLIX.
17757: 
17758:     Nay, falter not--'tis an assured good
17759:     To seek the noblest--'tis your only good
17760:     Now you have seen it; for that higher vision
17761:     Poisons all meaner choice forevermore.
17762: 
17763: 
17764: That day Esther dined with old Mr. Transome only. Harold sent word that
17765: he was engaged and had already dined, and Mrs. Transome that she was
17766: feeling ill. Esther was much disappointed that any tidings Harold might
17767: have brought relating to Felix were deferred in this way; and, her
17768: anxiety making her fearful, she was haunted by the thought that if there
17769: had been anything cheering to tell, he would have found time to tell it
17770: without delay. Old Mr. Transome went as usual to his sofa in the library
17771: to sleep after dinner, and Esther had to seat herself in the small
17772: drawing-room, in a well-lit solitude that was unusually dispiriting to
17773: her. Pretty as this room was, she did not like it. Mrs. Transome's
17774: full-length portrait, being the only picture there, urged itself too
17775: strongly on her attention: the youthful brilliancy it represented
17776: saddened Esther by its inevitable association with what she daily saw
17777: had come instead of it--a joyless, embittered age. The sense that Mrs.
17778: Transome was unhappy, affected Esther more and more deeply as the
17779: growing familiarity which relaxed the efforts of the hostess revealed
17780: more and more the threadbare tissue of this majestic lady's life. Even
17781: the flowers and the pure sunshine and the sweet waters of Paradise would
17782: have been spoiled for a young heart, if the bowered walks had been
17783: haunted by an Eve gone gray with bitter memories of an Adam who had
17784: complained. "The woman----she gave me of the tree, and I did eat." And
17785: many of us know how, even in our childhood, some blank discontented face
17786: on the background of our home has marred our summer mornings. Why was
17787: it, when the birds were singing, when the fields were a garden, and when
17788: we were clasping another little hand just larger than our own, there was
17789: somebody who found it hard to smile? Esther had got far beyond that
17790: childhood to a time and circumstances when this daily presence of
17791: elderly dissatisfaction amidst such outward things as she had always
17792: thought must greatly help to satisfy, awaked, not merely vague
17793: questioning emotion, but strong determining thought. And now, in these
17794: hours since her return from Loamford, her mind was in that state of
17795: highly-wrought activity, that large discourse, in which we seem to stand
17796: aloof from our own life--weighing impartially our own temptations and
17797: the weak desires that most habitually solicit us. "I think I am getting
17798: that power Felix wished me to have: I shall soon see strong visions,"
17799: she said to herself, with a melancholy smile flitting across her face,
17800: as she put out her wax lights that she might get rid of the oppressive
17801: urgency of walls and upholstery and that portrait smiling with deluded
17802: brightness, unwitting of the future.
17803: 
17804: Just then Dominic came to say that Mr. Harold sent his compliments, and
17805: begged that she would grant him an interview in his study. He disliked
17806: the small drawing-room: if she would oblige him by going to the study at
17807: once, he would join her very soon. Esther went, in some wonder and
17808: anxiety. What she most feared or hoped in these moments related to Felix
17809: Holt, and it did not occur to her that Harold could have anything
17810: special to say to her that evening on other subjects.
17811: 
17812: Certainly the study was pleasanter than the small drawing-room. A quiet
17813: light shone on nothing but greenness and dark wood, and Dominic had
17814: placed a delightful chair for her opposite to his master's, which was
17815: still empty. All the little objects of luxury around indicated Harold's
17816: habitual occupancy; and as Esther sat opposite all these things along
17817: with the empty chair which suggested the coming presence, the
17818: expectation of his beseeching homage brought with it an impatience and
17819: repugnance which she had never felt before. While these feelings were
17820: strongly upon her, the door opened and Harold appeared.
17821: 
17822: He had recovered his self-possession since his interview with his
17823: mother: he had dressed and was perfectly calm. He had been occupied with
17824: resolute thoughts, determining to do what he knew that perfect honor
17825: demanded, let it cost him what it would. It is true he had a tacit hope
17826: behind, that it might not cost him what he prized most highly: it is
17827: true he had a glimpse even of reward; but it was not less true that he
17828: would have acted as he did without that hope or glimpse. It was the most
17829: serious moment in Harold Transome's life; for the first time the iron
17830: had entered into his soul, and he felt the hard pressure of our common
17831: lot, the yoke of that mighty resistless destiny laid upon us by the acts
17832: of other men as well as our own.
17833: 
17834: When Esther looked at him she relented, and felt ashamed of her
17835: gratuitous impatience. She saw that his mind was in some way burdened.
17836: But then immediately sprang the dread that he had to say something
17837: hopeless about Felix.
17838: 
17839: They shook hands in silence, Esther looking at him with anxious
17840: surprise. He released her hand, but it did not occur to her to sit down,
17841: and they both continued standing on the hearth.
17842: 
17843: "Don't let me alarm you," said Harold, seeing that her face gathered
17844: solemnity from his. "I suppose I carry the marks of a past agitation. It
17845: relates entirely to troubles of my own--of my own family. No one beyond
17846: is involved in them."
17847: 
17848: Esther wondered still more, and felt still more relenting.
17849: 
17850: "But," said Harold, after a slight pause, and in a voice that was
17851: weighted with new feeling, "it involves a difference in my position with
17852: regard to you; and it is on this point that I wished to speak to you at
17853: once. When a man sees what ought to be done, he had better do it
17854: forthwith. He can't answer for himself to-morrow."
17855: 
17856: While Esther continued to look at him, with eyes widened by anxious
17857: expectation, Harold turned a little, leaned on the mantelpiece, and
17858: ceased to look at her as he spoke.
17859: 
17860: "My feelings drag me another way. I need not tell you that your regard
17861: has become very important to me--that if our mutual position had been
17862: different--that, in short, you must have seen--if it had not seemed to
17863: be a matter of worldly interest, I should have told you plainly already
17864: that I loved you, and that my happiness could be complete only if you
17865: would consent to marry me."
17866: 
17867: Esther felt her heart beginning to beat painfully. Harold's voice and
17868: words moved her so much that her own task seemed more difficult than she
17869: had before imagined. It seemed as if the silence, unbroken by anything
17870: but the clicking of the fire, had been long, before Harold turned round
17871: toward her again and said--
17872: 
17873: "But to-day I have heard something that affects my own position. I
17874: cannot tell you what it is. There is no need. It is not any culpability
17875: of my own. But I have not just the same unsullied name and fame in the
17876: eyes of the world around us, as I believed that I had when I allowed
17877: myself to entertain that wish about you. You are very young, entering on
17878: a fresh life with bright prospects--you are worthy of everything that is
17879: best. I may be too vain in thinking it was at all necessary; but I take
17880: this precaution against myself. I shut myself out from the chance of
17881: trying, after to-day, to induce you to accept anything which others may
17882: regard as specked and stained by any obloquy, however slight."
17883: 
17884: Esther was keenly touched. With a paradoxical longing, such as often
17885: happens to us, she wished at that moment that she could have loved this
17886: man with her whole heart. The tears came into her eyes; she did not
17887: speak, but, with an angel's tenderness in her face, she laid her hand on
17888: his sleeve. Harold commanded himself strongly and said--
17889: 
17890: "What is to be done now is, that we should proceed at once to the
17891: necessary legal measures for putting you in possession of your own, and
17892: arranging mutual claims. After that I shall probably leave England."
17893: 
17894: Esther was oppressed by an overpowering difficulty. Her sympathy with
17895: Harold at this moment was so strong, that it spread itself like a mist
17896: over all previous thought and resolve. It was impossible now to wound
17897: him afresh. With her hand still resting on his arm, she said, timidly--
17898: 
17899: "Should you be urged--obliged to go--in any case?"
17900: 
17901: "Not in every case, perhaps," Harold said, with an evident movement of
17902: the blood toward his face; "at least not for long, not for always."
17903: 
17904: Esther was conscious of the gleam in his eyes. With terror at herself,
17905: she said, in difficult haste, "I can't speak. I can't say anything
17906: to-night. A great decision has to be made: I must wait--till to-morrow."
17907: 
17908: She was moving her hand from his arm, when Harold took it reverentially
17909: and raised it to his lips. She turned toward her chair, and as he
17910: released her hand she sank down on the seat with a sense that she needed
17911: that support. She did not want to go away from Harold yet. All the while
17912: there was something she needed to know, and yet she could not bring
17913: herself to ask it. She must resign herself to depend entirely on his
17914: recollection of anything beyond his own immediate trial. She sat
17915: helpless under contending sympathies while Harold stood at some distance
17916: from her, feeling more harassed by weariness and uncertainty, now that
17917: he had fulfilled his resolve, and was no longer under the excitement of
17918: actually fulfilling it.
17919: 
17920: Esther's last words had forbidden his revival of the subject that was
17921: necessarily supreme with him. But still she sat there, and his mind,
17922: busy as to the probabilities of her feeling, glanced over all she had
17923: done and said in the later days of their intercourse. It was this
17924: retrospect that led him to say at last--
17925: 
17926: "You will be glad to hear that we shall get a very powerfully signed
17927: memorial to the Home Secretary about young Holt. I think your speaking
17928: for him helped a great deal. You made all the men wish what you wished."
17929: 
17930: This was what Esther had been yearning to hear and dared not ask, as
17931: well from respect for Harold's absorption in his own sorrow, as from the
17932: shrinking that belongs to our dearest need. The intense relief of
17933: hearing what she longed to hear, affected her whole frame: her color,
17934: her expression, changed as if she had been suddenly freed from some
17935: torturing constraint. But we interpret signs of emotion as we interpret
17936: other signs--often quite erroneously, unless we have the right key to
17937: what they signify. Harold did not gather that this was what Esther had
17938: waited for, or that the change in her indicated more than he had
17939: expected her to feel at this allusion to an unusual act which she had
17940: done under a strong impulse.
17941: 
17942: Besides the introduction of a new subject after very momentous words
17943: have passed, and are still dwelling on the mind, is necessarily a sort
17944: of concussion, shaking us into a new adjustment of ourselves.
17945: 
17946: It seemed natural that soon afterward Esther put out her hand and said,
17947: "Good-night."
17948: 
17949: Harold went to his bedroom on the same level with his study, thinking of
17950: the morning with an uncertainty that dipped on the side of hope. This
17951: sweet woman, for whom he felt a passion newer than any he had expected
17952: to feel, might possibly make some hard things more bearable--if she
17953: loved him. If not--well, he had acted so that he could defy anyone to
17954: say he was not a gentleman.
17955: 
17956: Esther went up-stairs to her bedroom, thinking that she should not sleep
17957: that night. She set her light on a high stand, and did not touch her
17958: dress. What she desired to see with undisturbed clearness were things
17959: not present: the rest she needed was the rest of a final choice. It was
17960: difficult. On each side there was renunciation.
17961: 
17962: She drew up her blinds, liking to see the gray sky, where there were
17963: some veiled glimmerings of moonlight, and the lines of the forever
17964: running river, and the bending movement of the black trees. She wanted
17965: the largeness of the world to help her thought. This young creature, who
17966: trod lightly backward and forward, and leaned against the window-frame,
17967: and shook back her brown curls as she looked at something not visible,
17968: had lived hardly more than six months since she saw Felix Holt for the
17969: first time. But life is measured by the rapidity of change, the
17970: succession of influences that modify the being; and Esther had undergone
17971: something little short of an inward revolution. The revolutionary
17972: struggle, however, was not quite at an end.
17973: 
17974: There was something which she now felt profoundly to be the best thing
17975: that life could give her. But--if it was to be had at all--it was not to
17976: be had without paying a heavy price for it, such as we must pay for all
17977: that is greatly good. A supreme love, a motive that gives a sublime
17978: rhythm to a woman's life, and exalts habit into partnership with the
17979: soul's highest needs, is not to be had where and how she wills: to know
17980: that high initiation, she must often tread where it is hard to tread,
17981: and feel the chill air, and watch through darkness. It is not true that
17982: love makes all things easy: it makes us choose what is difficult.
17983: Esther's previous life had brought her into close acquaintance with many
17984: negations, and with many positive ills too, not of the acutely painful,
17985: but of the distasteful sort. What if she chose the hardship, and had to
17986: bear it alone, with no strength to lean upon--no other better self to
17987: make a place for trust and joy? Her past experience saved her from
17988: illusions. She knew the dim life of the back street, the contact with
17989: sordid vulgarity, the lack of refinement for the senses, the summons to
17990: a daily task; and the gain that was to make that life of privation
17991: something on which she dreaded to turn her back, as if it were
17992: heaven--the presence and the love of Felix Holt--was only a quivering
17993: hope, not a certainty. It was not in her woman's nature that the hope
17994: should not spring within her and make a strong impulse. She knew that he
17995: loved her: had he not said how a woman might help a man if she were
17996: worthy? and if she proved herself worthy? But still there was the dread
17997: that after all she might find herself on the stony road alone, and faint
17998: and be weary. Even with the fulfillment of her hope, she knew that she
17999: pledged herself to meet high demands.
18000: 
18001: And on the other side there was a lot where everything seemed easy--but
18002: for the fatal absence of those feelings which, now she had once known
18003: them, it seemed nothing less than a fall and degradation to do without.
18004: With a terrible prescience which a multitude of impressions during her
18005: stay at Transome Court had contributed to form, she saw herself in a
18006: silken bondage that arrested all motive, and was nothing better than a
18007: well-cushioned despair. To be restless amidst ease, to be languid among
18008: all appliances for pleasure, was a possibility that seemed to haunt the
18009: rooms of this house, and wander with her under the oaks and elms of the
18010: park. And Harold Transome's love, no longer a hovering fancy with which
18011: she played, but become a serious fact, seemed to threaten her with a
18012: stifling oppression. The homage of a man may be delightful until he asks
18013: straight for love, by which a woman renders homage. Since she and Felix
18014: had kissed each other in the prison, she felt as if she had vowed
18015: herself away, as if memory lay on her lips like a seal of possession.
18016: Yet what had happened that very evening had strengthened her liking for
18017: Harold, and her care for all that regarded him: it had increased her
18018: repugnance to turning him out of anything he had expected to be his, or
18019: to snatching anything from him on the ground of an arbitrary claim. It
18020: had even made her dread, as a coming pain, the task of saying anything
18021: to him that was not a promise of the utmost comfort under this
18022: newly-disclosed trouble of his.
18023: 
18024: It was already near midnight, but with these thoughts succeeding and
18025: returning in her mind like scenes through which she was living, Esther
18026: had a more intense wakefulness than any she had known by day. All had
18027: been stillness hitherto, except the fitful wind outside. But her ears
18028: now caught a sound within--slight, but sudden. She moved near her door,
18029: and heard the sweep of something on the matting outside. It came closer,
18030: and paused. Then it began again, and seemed to sweep away from her. Then
18031: it approached, and paused as it had done before. Esther listened,
18032: wondering. The same thing happened again and again, till she could bear
18033: it no longer. She opened the door, and in the dim light of the corridor,
18034: where the glass above seemed to make a glimmering sky, she saw Mrs.
18035: Transome's tall figure pacing slowly, with her cheek upon her hand.
18036: 
18037: 
18038: 
18039: 
18040: CHAPTER L.
18041: 
18042:     The great question in life is the suffering we cause: and the
18043:     utmost ingenuity of metaphysics cannot justify the man who has
18044:     pierced the heart that loved him.
18045: 
18046:                                                 --BENJAMIN CONSTANT.
18047: 
18048: 
18049: When Denner had gone up to her mistress's room to dress her for dinner,
18050: she had found her seated just as Harold had found her, only with eyelids
18051: drooping and trembling over slowly-rolling tears--nay, with a face in
18052: which every sensitive feature, every muscle, seemed to be quivering with
18053: a silent endurance of some agony.
18054: 
18055: Denner went and stood by the chair a minute without speaking, only
18056: laying her hand gently on Mrs. Transome's. At last she said
18057: beseechingly, "Pray, speak, madam. What has happened?"
18058: 
18059: "The worst, Denner--the worst."
18060: 
18061: "You are ill. Let me undress you, and put you to bed."
18062: 
18063: "No, I am not ill. I am not going to die! I shall live--I shall live!"
18064: 
18065: "What may I do?"
18066: 
18067: "Go and say I shall not dine. Then you may come back, if you will."
18068: 
18069: The patient waiting-woman came back and sat by her mistress in
18070: motionless silence, Mrs. Transome would not let her dress be touched,
18071: and waved away all proffers with a slight movement of her hand. Denner
18072: dared not even light a candle without being told. At last, when the
18073: evening was far gone, Mrs. Transome said:
18074: 
18075: "Go down, Denner, and find out where Harold is, and come back and tell
18076: me."
18077: 
18078: "Shall I ask him to come to you, madam?"
18079: 
18080: "No; don't dare to do it, if you love me. Come back."
18081: 
18082: Denner brought word that Mr. Harold was in his study, and that Miss Lyon
18083: was with him. He had not dined, but had sent later to ask Miss Lyon to
18084: go into his study.
18085: 
18086: "Light the candles and leave me."
18087: 
18088: "Mayn't I come again?"
18089: 
18090: "No. It may be that my son will come to me."
18091: 
18092: "Mayn't I sleep on the little bed in your bedroom?"
18093: 
18094: "No, good Denner; I am not ill. You can't help me."
18095: 
18096: "That's the hardest word of all, madam."
18097: 
18098: "The time will come--but not now. Kiss me. Now go."
18099: 
18100: The small quiet old woman obeyed, as she had always done. She shrank
18101: from seeming to claim an equal's share in her mistress's sorrow.
18102: 
18103: For two hours Mrs. Transome's mind hung on what was hardly a
18104: hope--hardly more than the listening for a bare possibility. She began
18105: to create the sounds that her anguish craved to hear--began to imagine a
18106: footfall, and a hand upon the door. Then, checked by continual
18107: disappointment, she tried to rouse a truer consciousness by rising from
18108: her seat and walking to her window, where she saw streaks of light
18109: moving and disappearing on the grass, and heard the sound of bolts and
18110: closing doors. She hurried away and threw herself into her seat again,
18111: and buried her head in the deafening down of the cushions. There was no
18112: sound of comfort to her.
18113: 
18114: Then her heart cried out within her against the cruelty of this son.
18115: When he turned from her in the first moment, he had not had time to feel
18116: anything but the blow that had fallen on himself. But afterward--was it
18117: possible that he should not be touched with a son's pity--was it
18118: possible that he should not have been visited by some thought of the
18119: long years through which she had suffered? The memory of those years
18120: came back to her now with a protest against the cruelty that had all
18121: fallen on _her_. She started up with a new restlessness from this spirit
18122: of resistance. She was not penitent. She had borne too hard a
18123: punishment. Always the edge of calamity had fallen on _her_. Who had
18124: felt for her? She was desolate. God had no pity, else her son would not
18125: have been so hard. What dreary future was there after this dreary past?
18126: She, too, looked out into the dim night; but the black boundary of trees
18127: and the long line of the river seemed only part of the loneliness and
18128: monotony of her life.
18129: 
18130: Suddenly she saw a light on the stone balustrades of the balcony that
18131: projected in front of Esther's window, and the flash of a moving candle
18132: falling on a shrub below. Esther was still awake and up. What had Harold
18133: told her--what had passed between them? Harold was fond of this young
18134: creature, who had been always sweet and reverential to her. There was
18135: mercy in her young heart; she might be a daughter who had no impulse to
18136: punish and to strike her whom fate had stricken. On the dim loneliness
18137: before her she seemed to see Esther's gentle look; it was possible still
18138: that the misery of this night might be broken by some comfort. The proud
18139: woman yearned for the caressing pity that must dwell in that young
18140: bosom. She opened her door gently, but when she had reached Esther's she
18141: hesitated. She had never yet in her life asked for compassion--had never
18142: thrown herself in faith on an unproffered love. And she might have gone
18143: on pacing the corridor like an uneasy spirit without a goal, if Esther's
18144: thought, leaping toward her, had not saved her from the need to ask
18145: admission.
18146: 
18147: Mrs. Transome was walking toward the door when it opened. As Esther saw
18148: that image of restless misery, it blent itself by a rapid flash with all
18149: that Harold had said in the evening. She divined that the son's new
18150: trouble must be one with the mother's long sadness. But there was no
18151: waiting. In an instant Mrs. Transome felt Esther's arm round her neck,
18152: and a voice saying softly--
18153: 
18154: "Oh, why didn't you call me before?"
18155: 
18156: They turned hand and hand into the room, and sat down on a sofa at the
18157: foot of the bed. The disordered gray hair--the haggard face--the
18158: reddened eyelids under which the tears seemed to be coming again with
18159: pain, pierced Esther to the heart. A passionate desire to soothe this
18160: suffering woman came over her. She clung round her again, and kissed her
18161: poor quivering lips and eyelids, and laid her young cheek against the
18162: pale and haggard one. Words could not be quick or strong enough to utter
18163: her yearning. As Mrs. Transome felt that soft clinging, she said--
18164: 
18165: "God has some pity on me."
18166: 
18167: "Rest on my bed," said Esther. "You are so tired. I will cover you up
18168: warmly, and then you will sleep."
18169: 
18170: "No--tell me, dear--tell me what Harold said."
18171: 
18172: "That he has had some new trouble."
18173: 
18174: "He said nothing hard about me?"
18175: 
18176: "No--nothing. He did not mention you."
18177: 
18178: "I have been an unhappy woman, dear."
18179: 
18180: "I feared it," said Esther, pressing her gently.
18181: 
18182: "Men are selfish. They are selfish and cruel. What they care for is
18183: their own pleasure and their own pride."
18184: 
18185: "Not all," said Esther, on whom these words fell with a painful jar.
18186: 
18187: "All I have ever loved," said Mrs. Transome. She paused a moment or two,
18188: and then said, "For more than twenty years I have not had an hour's
18189: happiness. Harold knows it, and yet he is hard to me."
18190: 
18191: "He will not be. To-morrow he will not be. I am sure he will be good,"
18192: said Esther, pleadingly. "Remember--he said to me his trouble was
18193: new--he has not had time."
18194: 
18195: "It is too hard to bear, dear," Mrs. Transome said, a new sob rising as
18196: she clung fast to Esther in return. "I am old, and expect so little
18197: now--a very little thing would seem great. Why should I be punished any
18198: more?"
18199: 
18200: Esther found it difficult to speak. The dimly-suggested tragedy of this
18201: woman's life, the dreary waste of years empty of sweet trust and
18202: affection, afflicted her even to horror. It seemed to have come as a
18203: last vision to urge her toward the life where the draughts of joy sprang
18204: from the unchanging fountains of reverence and devout love.
18205: 
18206: But all the more she longed to still the pain of this heart that beat
18207: against hers.
18208: 
18209: "Do let me go to your own room with you, and let me undress you, and let
18210: me tend upon you," she said, with a woman's gentle instinct. "It will be
18211: a very great thing to me. I shall seem to have a mother again. Do let
18212: me."
18213: 
18214: Mrs. Transome yielded at last, and let Esther soothe her with a
18215: daughter's tendance. She was undressed and went to bed; and at last
18216: dozed fitfully, with frequent starts. But Esther watched by her till the
18217: chills of morning came, and then she only wrapped more warmth around
18218: her, and slept fast in the chair till Denner's movement in the room
18219: roused her. She started out of a dream in which she was telling Felix
18220: what had happened to her that night.
18221: 
18222: Mrs. Transome was now in the sounder morning sleep which sometimes
18223: comes after a long night of misery. Esther beckoned Denner into the
18224: dressing-room, and said:
18225: 
18226: "It is late, Mrs. Hickes. Do you think Mr. Harold is out of his room?"
18227: 
18228: "Yes, a long while; he was out earlier than usual."
18229: 
18230: "Will you ask him to come up here? Say I begged you."
18231: 
18232: When Harold entered Esther was leaning against the back of the empty
18233: chair where yesterday he had seen his mother sitting. He was in a state
18234: of wonder and suspense, and when Esther approached him and gave him her
18235: hand, he said, in a startled way--
18236: 
18237: "Good God! how ill you look! Have you been sitting up with my mother?"
18238: 
18239: "Yes. She is asleep now," said Esther. They had merely pressed hands by
18240: way of greeting, and now stood apart looking at each other solemnly.
18241: 
18242: "Has she told you anything?" said Harold.
18243: 
18244: "No, only that she is wretched. Oh, I think I would bear a great deal of
18245: unhappiness to save her from having any more."
18246: 
18247: A painful thrill passed through Harold, and showed itself in his face
18248: with that pale rapid flash which can never be painted. Esther pressed
18249: her hands together, and said, timidly, though it was from an urgent
18250: prompting--
18251: 
18252: "There is nothing in all this place--nothing since ever I came here--I
18253: could care for so much as that you should sit down by her now, and that
18254: she should see you when she wakes."
18255: 
18256: Then with delicate instinct, she added, just laying her hand on his
18257: sleeve, "I know you would have come. I know you meant it. But she is
18258: asleep now. Go gently before she wakes."
18259: 
18260: Harold just laid his right hand for an instant on the back of Esther's
18261: as it rested on his sleeve, and then stepped softly to his mother's
18262: bedside.
18263: 
18264:        *       *       *       *       *
18265: 
18266: An hour afterward, when Harold had laid his mother's pillow afresh, and
18267: sat down again by her, she said--
18268: 
18269: "If that dear thing will marry you, Harold, it will make up to you for a
18270: great deal."
18271: 
18272: But before the day closed Harold knew that this was not to be. That
18273: young presence, which had flitted like a white new-winged dove over all
18274: the saddening relics and new finery of Transome Court, could not find
18275: its home there. Harold heard from Esther's lips that she loved some one
18276: else, and that she resigned all claim to the Transome estates. She
18277: wished to go back to her father.
18278: 
18279: 
18280: 
18281: 
18282: CHAPTER LI.
18283: 
18284:     The maiden said, I wis the londe
18285:       Is very fair to see,
18286:     But my true-love that is in bonde
18287:       Is fairer still to me.
18288: 
18289: 
18290: One April day, when the sun shone on the lingering raindrops, Lyddy was
18291: gone out, and Esther chose to sit in the kitchen, in the wicker-chair
18292: against the white table, between the fire and the window. The kettle was
18293: singing, and the clock was ticking steadily toward four o'clock.
18294: 
18295: She was not reading, but stitching; and as her fingers moved nimbly,
18296: something played about her parted lips like a ray. Suddenly she laid
18297: down her work, pressed her hands together on her knees, and bent forward
18298: a little. The next moment there came a loud rap at the door. She started
18299: up and opened it, but kept herself hidden behind it.
18300: 
18301: "Mr. Lyon at home?" said Felix, in his firm tones.
18302: 
18303: "No, sir," said Esther from behind her screen; "but Miss Lyon is, if
18304: you'll please to walk in."
18305: 
18306: "Esther!" exclaimed Felix, amazed.
18307: 
18308: They held each other by both hands, and looked into each other's faces
18309: with delight.
18310: 
18311: "You are out of prison?"
18312: 
18313: "Yes, till I do something bad again. But you?--how is it all?"
18314: 
18315: "Oh, it is," said Esther, smiling brightly as she moved toward the
18316: wicker chair, and seated herself again, "that everything is as usual: my
18317: father is gone to see the sick; Lyddy is gone in deep despondency to buy
18318: the grocery; and I am sitting here, with some vanity in me, needing to
18319: be scolded."
18320: 
18321: Felix had seated himself on a chair that happened to be near her, at the
18322: corner of the table. He looked at her still with questioning eyes--he
18323: grave, she mischievously smiling.
18324: 
18325: "Are you come back to live here then?"
18326: 
18327: "Yes."
18328: 
18329: "You are not going to be married to Harold Transome, or to be rich?"
18330: 
18331: "No." Something made Esther take up her work again, and begin to stitch.
18332: The smiles were dying into a tremor.
18333: 
18334: "Why?" said Felix, in rather a low tone, leaning his elbow on the table,
18335: and resting his head on his hand while he looked at her.
18336: 
18337: "I did not wish to marry him, or to be rich."
18338: 
18339: "You have given it all up?" said Felix, leaning forward a little, and
18340: speaking in a still lower tone. Esther did not speak. They heard the
18341: kettle singing and the clock loudly ticking. There was no knowing how it
18342: was: Esther's work fell, their eyes met; and the next instant their arms
18343: were round each other's necks, and once more they kissed each other.
18344: 
18345: When their hands fell again, their eyes were bright with tears. Felix
18346: laid his hand on her shoulder.
18347: 
18348: "Could you share the life of a poor man, then, Esther?"
18349: 
18350: "If I thought well enough of him," she said, the smile coming again,
18351: with the pretty saucy movement of her head.
18352: 
18353: "Have you considered well what it would be?--that it would be a very
18354: bare and simple life?"
18355: 
18356: "Yes--without atta of rose."
18357: 
18358: Felix suddenly removed his hand from her shoulder, rose from his chair,
18359: and walked a step or two; then he turned round and said, with deep
18360: gravity--
18361: 
18362: "And the people I shall live among, Esther? They have not just the same
18363: follies and vices as the rich, but they have their own forms of folly
18364: and vice; and they have not what are called the refinements of the rich
18365: to make their faults more bearable. I don't say more bearable to me--I'm
18366: not fond of those refinements; but you are."
18367: 
18368: Felix paused an instant, and then added--
18369: 
18370: "It is very serious, Esther."
18371: 
18372: "I know it is serious," said Esther, looking up at him. "Since I have
18373: been at Transome Court I have seen many things very seriously. If I had
18374: not, I should not have left what I did leave. I made a deliberate
18375: choice."
18376: 
18377: Felix stood a moment or two, dwelling on her with a face where the
18378: gravity gathered tenderness.
18379: 
18380: "And these curls?" he said, with a sort of relenting, seating himself
18381: again, and putting his hand on them.
18382: 
18383: "They cost nothing--they are natural."
18384: 
18385: "You are such a delicate creature."
18386: 
18387: "I am very healthy. Poor women, I think, are healthier than the rich.
18388: Besides," Esther went on, with a mischievous meaning, "I think of having
18389: some wealth."
18390: 
18391: "How?" said Felix, with an anxious start. "What do you mean?"
18392: 
18393: "I think even of two pounds a week: one needn't live up to the splendor
18394: of all that, you know; we might live as simply as you liked: there would
18395: be money to spare, and you could do wonders, and be obliged to work too,
18396: only not if sickness came. And then I think of a little income for your
18397: mother, enough for her to live as she has been used to live; and a
18398: little income for my father, to save him from being dependent when he is
18399: no longer able to preach."
18400: 
18401: Esther said all this in a playful tone, but she ended, with a grave look
18402: of appealing submission----
18403: 
18404: "I mean--if you approve. I wish to do what you think it will be right to
18405: do."
18406: 
18407: Felix put his hand on her shoulder again and reflected a little while,
18408: looking on the hearth: then he said, lifting up his eyes, with a smile
18409: at her----
18410: 
18411: "Why, I shall be able to set up a great library, and lend the books to
18412: be dog's-eared and marked with bread-crumbs."
18413: 
18414: Esther said, laughing, "You think you are to be everything. You don't
18415: know how clever I am. I mean to go on teaching a great many things."
18416: 
18417: "Teaching me?"
18418: 
18419: "Oh, yes," she said, with a little toss; "I shall improve your French
18420: accent."
18421: 
18422: "You won't want me to wear a stock," said Felix, with a defiant shake of
18423: the head.
18424: 
18425: "No; and you will not attribute stupid thoughts to me before I've
18426: uttered them."
18427: 
18428: They laughed merrily, each holding the other's arms, like girl and boy.
18429: There was the ineffable sense of youth in common.
18430: 
18431: Then Felix leaned forward, that their lips might meet again, and after
18432: that his eyes roved tenderly over her face and curls.
18433: 
18434: "I'm a rough, severe fellow, Esther. Shall you never repent?--never be
18435: inwardly reproaching me that I was not a man who could have shared your
18436: wealth? Are you quite sure?"
18437: 
18438: "Quite sure!" said Esther, shaking her head; "for then I should have
18439: honored you less. I am weak--my husband must be greater and nobler than
18440: I am."
18441: 
18442: "Oh, I tell you what, though!" said Felix, starting up, thrusting his
18443: hands into his pockets, and creasing his brow playfully, "if you take me
18444: in that way I shall be forced to be a much better fellow than I ever
18445: thought of being."
18446: 
18447: "I call that retribution," said Esther, with a laugh as sweet as the
18448: morning thrush.
18449: 
18450: 
18451: 
18452: 
18453: EPILOGUE.
18454: 
18455:     Our finest hope is finest memory;
18456:     And those who love in age think youth is happy,
18457:     Because it has a life to fill with love.
18458: 
18459: 
18460: The very next May, Felix and Esther were married. Every one in those
18461: days was married at the parish church; but Mr. Lyon was not satisfied
18462: without an additional private solemnity, "wherein there was no bondage
18463: to questionable forms, so that he might have a more enlarged utterance
18464: of joy and supplication."
18465: 
18466: It was a very simple wedding; but no wedding, even the gayest, ever
18467: raised so much interest and debate in Treby Magna. Even very great
18468: people, like Sir Maximus and his family, went to the church to look at
18469: this bride, who had renounced wealth, and chosen to be the wife of a man
18470: who said he would always be poor.
18471: 
18472: Some few shook their heads; could not quite believe it; and thought
18473: there was "more behind." But the majority of honest Trebians were
18474: affected somewhat in the same way as happy-looking Mr. Wace was, who
18475: observed to his wife, as they walked from under the churchyard
18476: chestnuts, "It's wonderful how things go through you--you don't know
18477: how. I feel somehow as if I believed more in everything that's good."
18478: 
18479: Mrs. Holt, that day, said she felt herself to be receiving "some
18480: reward," implying that justice certainly had much more in reserve.
18481: Little Job Tudge had an entirely new suit, of which he fingered every
18482: separate brass button in a way that threatened an arithmetical mania;
18483: and Mrs. Holt had out her best tea-trays and put down her carpet again,
18484: with the satisfaction of thinking that there would no more be boys
18485: coming in all weathers with dirty shoes.
18486: 
18487: For Felix and Esther did not take up their abode in Treby Magna; and
18488: after a while Mr. Lyon left the town too, and joined them where they
18489: dwelt. On his resignation the church in Malthouse Yard chose a successor
18490: to him whose doctrine was rather higher.
18491: 
18492: There were other departures from Treby. Mr. Jermyn's establishment was
18493: broken up, and he was understood to have gone to reside at a great
18494: distance: some said "abroad," that large home of ruined reputations. Mr.
18495: Johnson continued blond and sufficiently prosperous till he got gray
18496: and rather more prosperous. Some persons who did not think highly of
18497: him, held that his prosperity was a fact to be kept in the background,
18498: as being dangerous to the morals of the young; judging that it was not
18499: altogether creditable to the Divine Providence that anything but virtue
18500: should be rewarded by a front and back drawing-room in Bedford Row.
18501: 
18502: As for Mr. Christian, he had no more profitable secrets at his disposal.
18503: But he got his thousand pounds from Harold Transome.
18504: 
18505: The Transome family were absent some time from Transome Court. The place
18506: was kept up and shown to visitors, but not by Denner, who was away with
18507: her mistress. After a while the family came back, and Mrs. Transome died
18508: there. Sir Maximus was at her funeral, and throughout that neighborhood
18509: there was silence about the past.
18510: 
18511: Uncle Lingon continued to watch over the shooting on the Manor and the
18512: covers until that event occurred which he had predicted as a part of
18513: Church reform sure to come. Little Treby had a new rector, but others
18514: were sorry besides the old pointers.
18515: 
18516: As to all that wide parish of Treby Magna, it has since prospered as the
18517: rest of England has prospered. Doubtless there is more enlightenment
18518: now. Whether the farmers are all public-spirited, the shopkeepers nobly
18519: independent, the Sproxton men entirely sober and judicious, the
18520: Dissenters quite without narrowness or asperity in religion and
18521: politics, and the publicans all fit, like Gaius, to be the friends of an
18522: apostle--these things I have not heard; not having correspondence in
18523: those parts. Whether any presumption may be drawn from the fact that
18524: North Loamshire does not yet return a Radical candidate, I leave to the
18525: all-wise--I mean the newspapers.
18526: 
18527: As to the town in which Felix Holt now resides, I will keep that a
18528: secret, lest he should be troubled by any visitor having the
18529: insufferable motive of curiosity.
18530: 
18531: I will only say that Esther has never repented. Felix, however, grumbles
18532: a little that she has made his life too easy, and that, if it were not
18533: for much walking, he should be a sleek dog.
18534: 
18535: There is a young Felix, who has a great deal more science than his
18536: father, but not much more money.
18537: 
18538: 
18539: THE END.
