18: Among the many fatalities attending the bloom of young desire, that of
19: blindly taking to the confectionery line has not, perhaps, been
20: sufficiently considered. How is the son of a British yeoman, who has
21: been fed principally on salt pork and yeast dumplings, to know that
22: there is satiety for the human stomach even in a paradise of glass jars
23: full of sugared almonds and pink lozenges, and that the tedium of life
24: can reach a pitch where plum-buns at discretion cease to offer the
25: slightest excitement? Or how, at the tender age when a confectioner
26: seems to him a very prince whom all the world must envy—who breakfasts
27: on macaroons, dines on meringues, sups on twelfth-cake, and fills up
28: the intermediate hours with sugar-candy or peppermint—how is he to
29: foresee the day of sad wisdom, when he will discern that the
30: confectioner’s calling is not socially influential, or favourable to a
31: soaring ambition? I have known a man who turned out to have a
32: metaphysical genius, incautiously, in the period of youthful buoyancy,
33: commence his career as a dancing-master; and you may imagine the use
34: that was made of this initial mistake by opponents who felt themselves
35: bound to warn the public against his doctrine of the Inconceivable. He
36: could not give up his dancing-lessons, because he made his bread by
37: them, and metaphysics would not have found him in so much as salt to
38: his bread. It was really the same with Mr. David Faux and the
39: confectionery business. His uncle, the butler at the great house close
40: by Brigford, had made a pet of him in his early boyhood, and it was on
41: a visit to this uncle that the confectioners’ shops in that brilliant
42: town had, on a single day, fired his tender imagination. He carried
43: home the pleasing illusion that a confectioner must be at once the
44: happiest and the foremost of men, since the things he made were not
45: only the most beautiful to behold, but the very best eating, and such
46: as the Lord Mayor must always order largely for his private recreation;
47: so that when his father declared he must be put to a trade, David chose
48: his line without a moment’s hesitation; and, with a rashness inspired
49: by a sweet tooth, wedded himself irrevocably to confectionery. Soon,
50: however, the tooth lost its relish and fell into blank indifference;
51: and all the while, his mind expanded, his ambition took new shapes,
52: which could hardly be satisfied within the sphere his youthful ardour
53: had chosen. But what was he to do? He was a young man of much mental
54: activity, and, above all, gifted with a spirit of contrivance; but
55: then, his faculties would not tell with great effect in any other
56: medium than that of candied sugars, conserves, and pastry. Say what you
57: will about the identity of the reasoning process in all branches of
58: thought, or about the advantage of coming to subjects with a fresh
59: mind, the adjustment of butter to flour, and of heat to pastry, is
60: _not_ the best preparation for the office of prime minister; besides,
61: in the present imperfectly-organized state of society, there are social
62: barriers. David could invent delightful things in the way of
63: drop-cakes, and he had the widest views of the sugar department; but in
64: other directions he certainly felt hampered by the want of knowledge
65: and practical skill; and the world is so inconveniently constituted,
66: that the vague consciousness of being a fine fellow is no guarantee of
67: success in any line of business.
68: 
69: This difficulty pressed with some severity on Mr. David Faux, even
70: before his apprenticeship was ended. His soul swelled with an impatient
71: sense that he ought to become something very remarkable—that it was
72: quite out of the question for him to put up with a narrow lot as other
73: men did: he scorned the idea that he could accept an average. He was
74: sure there was nothing average about him: even such a person as Mrs.
75: Tibbits, the washer-woman, perceived it, and probably had a preference
76: for his linen. At that particular period he was weighing out
77: gingerbread nuts; but such an anomaly could not continue. No position
78: could be suited to Mr. David Faux that was not in the highest degree
79: easy to the flesh and flattering to the spirit. If he had fallen on the
80: present times, and enjoyed the advantages of a Mechanic’s Institute, he
81: would certainly have taken to literature and have written reviews; but
82: his education had not been liberal. He had read some novels from the
83: adjoining circulating library, and had even bought the story of _Inkle
84: and Yarico_, which had made him feel very sorry for poor Mr. Inkle; so
85: that his ideas might not have been below a certain mark of the literary
86: calling; but his spelling and diction were too unconventional.
87: 
88: When a man is not adequately appreciated or comfortably placed in his
89: own country, his thoughts naturally turn towards foreign climes; and
90: David’s imagination circled round and round the utmost limits of his
91: geographical knowledge, in search of a country where a young gentleman
92: of pasty visage, lipless mouth, and stumpy hair, would be likely to be
93: received with the hospitable enthusiasm which he had a right to expect.
94: Having a general idea of America as a country where the population was
95: chiefly black, it appeared to him the most propitious destination for
96: an emigrant who, to begin with, had the broad and easily recognizable
97: merit of whiteness; and this idea gradually took such strong possession
98: of him that Satan seized the opportunity of suggesting to him that he
99: might emigrate under easier circumstances, if he supplied himself with
100: a little money from his master’s till. But that evil spirit, whose
101: understanding, I am convinced, has been much overrated, quite wasted
102: his time on this occasion. David would certainly have liked well to
103: have some of his master’s money in his pocket, if he had been sure his
104: master would have been the only man to suffer for it; but he was a
105: cautious youth, and quite determined to run no risks on his own
106: account. So he stayed out his apprenticeship, and committed no act of
107: dishonesty that was at all likely to be discovered, reserving his plan
108: of emigration for a future opportunity. And the circumstances under
109: which he carried it out were in this wise. Having been at home a week
110: or two partaking of the family beans, he had used his leisure in
111: ascertaining a fact which was of considerable importance to him,
112: namely, that his mother had a small sum in guineas painfully saved from
113: her maiden perquisites, and kept in the corner of a drawer where her
114: baby-linen had reposed for the last twenty years—ever since her son
115: David had taken to his feet, with a slight promise of bow-legs which
116: had not been altogether unfulfilled. Mr. Faux, senior, had told his son
117: very frankly, that he must not look to being set up in business by
118: _him_: with seven sons, and one of them a very healthy and
119: well-developed idiot, who consumed a dumpling about eight inches in
120: diameter every day, it was pretty well if they got a hundred apiece at
121: his death. Under these circumstances, what was David to do? It was
122: certainly hard that he should take his mother’s money; but he saw no
123: other ready means of getting any, and it was not to be expected that a
124: young man of his merit should put up with inconveniences that could be
125: avoided. Besides, it is not robbery to take property belonging to your
126: mother: she doesn’t prosecute you. And David was very well behaved to
127: his mother; he comforted her by speaking highly of himself to her, and
128: assuring her that he never fell into the vices he saw practised by
129: other youths of his own age, and that he was particularly fond of
130: honesty. If his mother would have given him her twenty guineas as a
131: reward of this noble disposition, he really would not have stolen them
132: from her, and it would have been more agreeable to his feelings.
133: Nevertheless, to an active mind like David’s, ingenuity is not without
134: its pleasures: it was rather an interesting occupation to become
135: stealthily acquainted with the wards of his mother’s simple key (not in
136: the least like Chubb’s patent), and to get one that would do its work
137: equally well; and also to arrange a little drama by which he would
138: escape suspicion, and run no risk of forfeiting the prospective hundred
139: at his father’s death, which would be convenient in the improbable case
140: of his _not_ making a large fortune in the “Indies.”
141: 
142: First, he spoke freely of his intention to start shortly for Liverpool
143: and take ship for America; a resolution which cost his good mother some
144: pain, for, after Jacob the idiot, there was not one of her sons to whom
145: her heart clung more than to her youngest-born, David. Next, it
146: appeared to him that Sunday afternoon, when everybody was gone to
147: church except Jacob and the cowboy, was so singularly favourable an
148: opportunity for sons who wanted to appropriate their mothers’ guineas,
149: that he half thought it must have been kindly intended by Providence
150: for such purposes. Especially the third Sunday in Lent; because Jacob
151: had been out on one of his occasional wanderings for the last two days;
152: and David, being a timid young man, had a considerable dread and hatred
153: of Jacob, as of a large personage who went about habitually with a
154: pitchfork in his hand.
155: 
156: Nothing could be easier, then, than for David on this Sunday afternoon
157: to decline going to church, on the ground that he was going to tea at
158: Mr. Lunn’s, whose pretty daughter Sally had been an early flame of his,
159: and, when the church-goers were at a safe distance, to abstract the
160: guineas from their wooden box and slip them into a small canvas
161: bag—nothing easier than to call to the cowboy that he was going, and
162: tell him to keep an eye on the house for fear of Sunday tramps. David
163: thought it would be easy, too, to get to a small thicket and bury his
164: bag in a hole he had already made and covered up under the roots of an
165: old hollow ash, and he had, in fact, found the hole without a moment’s
166: difficulty, had uncovered it, and was about gently to drop the bag into
167: it, when the sound of a large body rustling towards him with something
168: like a bellow was such a surprise to David, who, as a gentleman gifted
169: with much contrivance, was naturally only prepared for what he
170: expected, that instead of dropping the bag gently he let it fall so as
171: to make it untwist and vomit forth the shining guineas. In the same
172: moment he looked up and saw his dear brother Jacob close upon him,
173: holding the pitchfork so that the bright smooth prongs were a yard in
174: advance of his own body, and about a foot off David’s. (A learned
175: friend, to whom I once narrated this history, observed that it was
176: David’s guilt which made these prongs formidable, and that the “mens
177: nil conscia sibi” strips a pitchfork of all terrors. I thought this
178: idea so valuable, that I obtained his leave to use it on condition of
179: suppressing his name.) Nevertheless, David did not entirely lose his
180: presence of mind; for in that case he would have sunk on the earth or
181: started backward; whereas he kept his ground and smiled at Jacob, who
182: nodded his head up and down, and said, “Hoich, Zavy!” in a painfully
183: equivocal manner. David’s heart was beating audibly, and if he had had
184: any lips they would have been pale; but his mental activity, instead of
185: being paralysed, was stimulated. While he was inwardly praying (he
186: always prayed when he was much frightened)—“Oh, save me this once, and
187: I’ll never get into danger again!”—he was thrusting his hand into his
188: pocket in search of a box of yellow lozenges, which he had brought with
189: him from Brigford among other delicacies of the same portable kind, as
190: a means of conciliating proud beauty, and more particularly the beauty
191: of Miss Sarah Lunn. Not one of these delicacies had he ever offered to
192: poor Jacob, for David was not a young man to waste his jujubes and
193: barley-sugar in giving pleasure to people from whom he expected
194: nothing. But an idiot with equivocal intentions and a pitchfork is as
195: well worth flattering and cajoling as if he were Louis Napoleon. So
196: David, with a promptitude equal to the occasion, drew out his box of
197: yellow lozenges, lifted the lid, and performed a pantomime with his
198: mouth and fingers, which was meant to imply that he was delighted to
199: see his dear brother Jacob, and seized the opportunity of making him a
200: small present, which he would find particularly agreeable to the taste.
201: Jacob, you understand, was not an intense idiot, but within a certain
202: limited range knew how to choose the good and reject the evil: he took
203: one lozenge, by way of test, and sucked it as if he had been a
204: philosopher; then, in as great an ecstacy at its new and complex savour
205: as Caliban at the taste of Trinculo’s wine, chuckled and stroked this
206: suddenly beneficent brother, and held out his hand for more; for,
207: except in fits of anger, Jacob was not ferocious or needlessly
208: predatory. David’s courage half returned, and he left off praying;
209: pouring a dozen lozenges into Jacob’s palm, and trying to look very
210: fond of him. He congratulated himself that he had formed the plan of
211: going to see Miss Sally Lunn this afternoon, and that, as a
212: consequence, he had brought with him these propitiatory delicacies: he
213: was certainly a lucky fellow; indeed, it was always likely Providence
214: should be fonder of him than of other apprentices, and since he _was_
215: to be interrupted, why, an idiot was preferable to any other sort of
216: witness. For the first time in his life, David thought he saw the
217: advantage of idiots.
218: 
219: As for Jacob, he had thrust his pitchfork into the ground, and had
220: thrown himself down beside it, in thorough abandonment to the
221: unprecedented pleasure of having five lozenges in his mouth at once,
222: blinking meanwhile, and making inarticulate sounds of gustative
223: content. He had not yet given any sign of noticing the guineas, but in
224: seating himself he had laid his broad right hand on them, and
225: unconsciously kept it in that position, absorbed in the sensations of
226: his palate. If he could only be kept so occupied with the lozenges as
227: not to see the guineas before David could manage to cover them! That
228: was David’s best hope of safety; for Jacob knew his mother’s guineas;
229: it had been part of their common experience as boys to be allowed to
230: look at these handsome coins, and rattle them in their box on high days
231: and holidays, and among all Jacob’s narrow experiences as to money,
232: this was likely to be the most memorable.
233: 
234: “Here, Jacob,” said David, in an insinuating tone, handing the box to
235: him, “I’ll give ’em all to you. Run!—make haste!—else somebody’ll come
236: and take ’em.”
237: 
238: David, not having studied the psychology of idiots, was not aware that
239: they are not to be wrought upon by imaginative fears. Jacob took the
240: box with his left hand, but saw no necessity for running away. Was ever
241: a promising young man wishing to lay the foundation of his fortune by
242: appropriating his mother’s guineas obstructed by such a day-mare as
243: this? But the moment must come when Jacob would move his right hand to
244: draw off the lid of the tin box, and then David would sweep the guineas
245: into the hole with the utmost address and swiftness, and immediately
246: seat himself upon them. Ah, no! It’s of no use to have foresight when
247: you are dealing with an idiot: he is not to be calculated upon. Jacob’s
248: right hand was given to vague clutching and throwing; it suddenly
249: clutched the guineas as if they had been so many pebbles, and was
250: raised in an attitude which promised to scatter them like seed over a
251: distant bramble, when, from some prompting or other—probably of an
252: unwonted sensation—it paused, descended to Jacob’s knee, and opened
253: slowly under the inspection of Jacob’s dull eyes. David began to pray
254: again, but immediately desisted—another resource having occurred to
255: him.
256: 
257: “Mother! zinnies!” exclaimed the innocent Jacob. Then, looking at
258: David, he said, interrogatively, “Box?”
259: 
260: “Hush! hush!” said David, summoning all his ingenuity in this severe
261: strait. “See, Jacob!” He took the tin box from his brother’s hand, and
262: emptied it of the lozenges, returning half of them to Jacob, but
263: secretly keeping the rest in his own hand. Then he held out the empty
264: box, and said, “Here’s the box, Jacob! The box for the guineas!” gently
265: sweeping them from Jacob’s palm into the box.
266: 
267: This procedure was not objectionable to Jacob; on the contrary, the
268: guineas clinked so pleasantly as they fell, that he wished for a
269: repetition of the sound, and seizing the box, began to rattle it very
270: gleefully. David, seizing the opportunity, deposited his reserve of
271: lozenges in the ground and hastily swept some earth over them. “Look,
272: Jacob!” he said, at last. Jacob paused from his clinking, and looked
273: into the hole, while David began to scratch away the earth, as if in
274: doubtful expectation. When the lozenges were laid bare, he took them
275: out one by one, and gave them to Jacob. “Hush!” he said, in a loud
276: whisper, “Tell nobody—all for Jacob—hush—sh—sh! Put guineas in the
277: hole—they’ll come out like this!” To make the lesson more complete, he
278: took a guinea, and lowering it into the hole, said, “Put in _so_.”
279: Then, as he took the last lozenge out, he said, “Come out _so_,” and
280: put the lozenge into Jacob’s hospitable mouth.
281: 
282: Jacob turned his head on one side, looked first at his brother and then
283: at the hole, like a reflective monkey, and, finally, laid the box of
284: guineas in the hole with much decision. David made haste to add every
285: one of the stray coins, put on the lid, and covered it well with earth,
286: saying in his meet coaxing tone—
287: 
288: “Take ’m out to-morrow, Jacob; all for Jacob! Hush—sh—sh!”
289: 
290: Jacob, to whom this once indifferent brother had all at once become a
291: sort of sweet-tasted fetish, stroked David’s best coat with his
292: adhesive fingers, and then hugged him with an accompaniment of that
293: mingled chuckling and gurgling by which he was accustomed to express
294: the milder passions. But if he had chosen to bite a small morsel out of
295: his beneficent brother’s cheek, David would have been obliged to bear
296: it.
297: 
298: And here I must pause, to point out to you the short-sightedness of
299: human contrivance. This ingenious young man, Mr. David Faux, thought he
300: had achieved a triumph of cunning when he had associated himself in his
301: brother’s rudimentary mind with the flavour of yellow lozenges. But he
302: had yet to learn that it is a dreadful thing to make an idiot fond of
303: you, when you yourself are not of an affectionate disposition:
304: especially an idiot with a pitchfork—obviously a difficult friend to
305: shake off by rough usage.
306: 
307: It may seem to you rather a blundering contrivance for a clever young
308: man to bury the guineas. But, if everything had turned out as David had
309: calculated, you would have seen that his plan was worthy of his
310: talents. The guineas would have lain safely in the earth while the
311: theft was discovered, and David, with the calm of conscious innocence,
312: would have lingered at home, reluctant to say good-bye to his dear
313: mother while she was in grief about her guineas; till at length, on the
314: eve of his departure, he would have disinterred them in the strictest
315: privacy, and carried them on his own person without inconvenience. But
316: David, you perceive, had reckoned without his host, or, to speak more
317: precisely, without his idiot brother—an item of so uncertain and
318: fluctuating a character, that I doubt whether he would not have puzzled
319: the astute heroes of M. de Balzac, whose foresight is so remarkably at
320: home in the future.
321: 
322: It was clear to David now that he had only one alternative before him:
323: he must either renounce the guineas, by quietly putting them back in
324: his mother’s drawer (a course not unattended with difficulty); or he
325: must leave more than a suspicion behind him, by departing early the
326: next morning without giving notice, and with the guineas in his pocket.
327: For if he gave notice that he was going, his mother, he knew, would
328: insist on fetching from her box of guineas the three she had always
329: promised him as his share; indeed, in his original plan, he had counted
330: on this as a means by which the theft would be discovered under
331: circumstances that would themselves speak for his innocence; but now,
332: as I need hardly explain, that well-combined plan was completely
333: frustrated. Even if David could have bribed Jacob with perpetual
334: lozenges, an idiot’s secrecy is itself betrayal. He dared not even go
335: to tea at Mr. Lunn’s, for in that case he would have lost sight of
336: Jacob, who, in his impatience for the crop of lozenges, might scratch
337: up the box again while he was absent, and carry it home—depriving him
338: at once of reputation and guineas. No! he must think of nothing all the
339: rest of this day, but of coaxing Jacob and keeping him out of mischief.
340: It was a fatiguing and anxious evening to David; nevertheless, he dared
341: not go to sleep without tying a piece of string to his thumb and great
342: toe, to secure his frequent waking; for he meant to be up with the
343: first peep of dawn, and be far out of reach before breakfast-time. His
344: father, he thought, would certainly cut him off with a shilling; but
345: what then? Such a striking young man as he would be sure to be well
346: received in the West Indies: in foreign countries there are always
347: openings—even for cats. It was probable that some Princess Yarico would
348: want him to marry her, and make him presents of very large jewels
349: beforehand; after which, he needn’t marry her unless he liked. David
350: had made up his mind not to steal any more, even from people who were
351: fond of him: it was an unpleasant way of making your fortune in a world
352: where you were likely to surprised in the act by brothers. Such alarms
353: did not agree with David’s constitution, and he had felt so much nausea
354: this evening that no doubt his liver was affected. Besides, he would
355: have been greatly hurt not to be thought well of in the world: he
356: always meant to make a figure, and be thought worthy of the best seats
357: and the best morsels.
358: 
359: Ruminating to this effect on the brilliant future in reserve for him,
360: David by the help of his check-string kept himself on the alert to
361: seize the time of earliest dawn for his rising and departure. His
362: brothers, of course, were early risers, but he should anticipate them
363: by at least an hour and a half, and the little room which he had to
364: himself as only an occasional visitor, had its window over the
365: horse-block, so that he could slip out through the window without the
366: least difficulty. Jacob, the horrible Jacob, had an awkward trick of
367: getting up before everybody else, to stem his hunger by emptying the
368: milk-bowl that was “duly set” for him; but of late he had taken to
369: sleeping in the hay-loft, and if he came into the house, it would be on
370: the opposite side to that from which David was making his exit. There
371: was no need to think of Jacob; yet David was liberal enough to bestow a
372: curse on him—it was the only thing he ever did bestow gratuitously. His
373: small bundle of clothes was ready packed, and he was soon treading
374: lightly on the steps of the horse-block, soon walking at a smart pace
375: across the fields towards the thicket. It would take him no more than
376: two minutes to get out the box; he could make out the tree it was under
377: by the pale strip where the bark was off, although the dawning light
378: was rather dimmer in the thicket. But what, in the name of—burnt
379: pastry—was that large body with a staff planted beside it, close at the
380: foot of the ash-tree? David paused, not to make up his mind as to the
381: nature of the apparition—he had not the happiness of doubting for a
382: moment that the staff was Jacob’s pitchfork—but to gather the
383: self-command necessary for addressing his brother with a sufficiently
384: honeyed accent. Jacob was absorbed in scratching up the earth, and had
385: not heard David’s approach.
386: 
387: “I say, Jacob,” said David in a loud whisper, just as the tin box was
388: lifted out of the hole.
389: 
390: Jacob looked up, and discerning his sweet-flavoured brother, nodded and
391: grinned in the dim light in a way that made him seem to David like a
392: triumphant demon. If he had been of an impetuous disposition, he would
393: have snatched the pitchfork from the ground and impaled this fraternal
394: demon. But David was by no means impetuous; he was a young man greatly
395: given to calculate consequences, a habit which has been held to be the
396: foundation of virtue. But somehow it had not precisely that effect in
397: David: he calculated whether an action would harm himself, or whether
398: it would only harm other people. In the former case he was very timid
399: about satisfying his immediate desires, but in the latter he would risk
400: the result with much courage.
401: 
402: “Give it me, Jacob,” he said, stooping down and patting his brother.
403: “Let us see.”
404: 
405: Jacob, finding the lid rather tight, gave the box to his brother in
406: perfect faith. David raised the lids and shook his head, while Jacob
407: put his finger in and took out a guinea to taste whether the
408: metamorphosis into lozenges was complete and satisfactory.
409: 
410: “No, Jacob; too soon, too soon,” said David, when the guinea had been
411: tasted. “Give it me; we’ll go and bury it somewhere else; we’ll put it
412: in yonder,” he added, pointing vaguely toward the distance.
413: 
414: David screwed on the lid, while Jacob, looking grave, rose and grasped
415: his pitchfork. Then, seeing David’s bundle, he snatched it, like a too
416: officious Newfoundland, stuck his pitchfork into it and carried it over
417: his shoulder in triumph as he accompanied David and the box out of the
418: thicket.
419: 
420: What on earth was David to do? It would have been easy to frown at
421: Jacob, and kick him, and order him to get away; but David dared as soon
422: have kicked the bull. Jacob was quiet as long as he was treated
423: indulgently; but on the slightest show of anger, he became
424: unmanageable, and was liable to fits of fury which would have made him
425: formidable even without his pitchfork. There was no mastery to be
426: obtained over him except by kindness or guile. David tried guile.
427: 
428: “Go, Jacob,” he said, when they were out of the thicket—pointing
429: towards the house as he spoke; “go and fetch me a spade—a spade. But
430: give _me_ the bundle,” he added, trying to reach it from the fork,
431: where it hung high above Jacob’s tall shoulder.
432: 
433: But Jacob showed as much alacrity in obeying as a wasp shows in leaving
434: a sugar-basin. Near David, he felt himself in the vicinity of lozenges:
435: he chuckled and rubbed his brother’s back, brandishing the bundle
436: higher out of reach. David, with an inward groan, changed his tactics,
437: and walked on as fast as he could. It was not safe to linger. Jacob
438: would get tired of following him, or, at all events, could be eluded.
439: If they could once get to the distant highroad, a coach would overtake
440: them, David would mount it, having previously by some ingenious means
441: secured his bundle, and then Jacob might howl and flourish his
442: pitchfork as much as he liked. Meanwhile he was under the fatal
443: necessity of being very kind to this ogre, and of providing a large
444: breakfast for him when they stopped at a roadside inn. It was already
445: three hours since they had started, and David was tired. Would no coach
446: be coming up soon? he inquired. No coach for the next two hours. But
447: there was a carrier’s cart to come immediately, on its way to the next
448: town. If he could slip out, even leaving his bundle behind, and get
449: into the cart without Jacob! But there was a new obstacle. Jacob had
450: recently discovered a remnant of sugar-candy in one of his brother’s
451: tail-pockets; and, since then, had cautiously kept his hold on that
452: limb of the garment, perhaps with an expectation that there would be a
453: further development of sugar-candy after a longer or shorter interval.
454: Now every one who has worn a coat will understand the sensibilities
455: that must keep a man from starting away in a hurry when there is a
456: grasp on his coat-tail. David looked forward to being well received
457: among strangers, but it might make a difference if he had only one tail
458: to his coat.
459: 
460: He felt himself in a cold perspiration. He could walk no more: he must
461: get into the cart and let Jacob get in with him. Presently a cheering
462: idea occurred to him: after so large a breakfast, Jacob would be sure
463: to go to sleep in the cart; you see at once that David meant to seize
464: his bundle, jump out, and be free. His expectation was partly
465: fulfilled: Jacob did go to sleep in the cart, but it was in a peculiar
466: attitude—it was with his arms tightly fastened round his dear brother’s
467: body; and if ever David attempted to move, the grasp tightened with the
468: force of an affectionate boa-constrictor.
469: 
470: “Th’ innicent’s fond on you,” observed the carrier, thinking that David
471: was probably an amiable brother, and wishing to pay him a compliment.
472: 
473: David groaned. The ways of thieving were not ways of pleasantness. Oh,
474: why had he an idiot brother? Oh, why, in general, was the world so
475: constituted that a man could not take his mother’s guineas comfortably?
476: David became grimly speculative.
477: 
478: Copious dinner at noon for Jacob; but little dinner, because little
479: appetite, for David. Instead of eating, he plied Jacob with beer; for
480: through this liberality he descried a hope. Jacob fell into a dead
481: sleep, at last, without having his arms round David, who paid the
482: reckoning, took his bundle, and walked off. In another half-hour he was
483: on the coach on his way to Liverpool, smiling the smile of the
484: triumphant wicked. He was rid of Jacob—he was bound for the Indies,
485: where a gullible princess awaited him. He would never steal any more,
486: but there would be no need; he would show himself so deserving, that
487: people would make him presents freely. He must give up the notion of
488: his father’s legacy; but it was not likely he would ever want that
489: trifle; and even if he did—why, it was a compensation to think that in
490: being for ever divided from his family he was divided from Jacob, more
491: terrible than Gorgon or Demogorgon to David’s timid green eyes. Thank
492: heaven, he should never see Jacob any more!
493: 
494: 
495: 
496: 
497: CHAPTER II
498: 
499: 
500: It was nearly six years after the departure of Mr. David Faux for the
501: West Indies, that the vacant shop in the market-place at Grimworth was
502: understood to have been let to the stranger with a sallow complexion
503: and a buff cravat, whose first appearance had caused some excitement in
504: the bar of the Woolpack, where he had called to wait for the coach.
505: 
506: Grimworth, to a discerning eye, was a good place to set up shopkeeping
507: in. There was no competition in it at present; the Church-people had
508: their own grocer and draper; the Dissenters had theirs; and the two or
509: three butchers found a ready market for their joints without strict
510: reference to religious persuasion—except that the rector’s wife had
511: given a general order for the veal sweet-breads and the mutton kidneys,
512: while Mr. Rodd, the Baptist minister, had requested that, so far as was
513: compatible with the fair accommodation of other customers, the sheep’s
514: trotters might be reserved for him. And it was likely to be a growing
515: place, for the trustees of Mr. Zephaniah Crypt’s Charity, under the
516: stimulus of a late visitation by commissioners, were beginning to apply
517: long-accumulating funds to the rebuilding of the Yellow Coat School,
518: which was henceforth to be carried forward on a greatly-extended scale,
519: the testator having left no restrictions concerning the curriculum, but
520: only concerning the coat.
521: 
522: The shopkeepers at Grimworth were by no means unanimous as to the
523: advantages promised by this prospect of increased population and
524: trading, being substantial men, who liked doing a quiet business in
525: which they were sure of their customers, and could calculate their
526: returns to a nicety. Hitherto, it had been held a point of honour by
527: the families in Grimworth parish, to buy their sugar and their flannel
528: at the shop where their fathers and mothers had bought before them;
529: but, if newcomers were to bring in the system of neck-and-neck trading,
530: and solicit feminine eyes by gown-pieces laid in fan-like folds, and
531: surmounted by artificial flowers, giving them a factitious charm (for
532: on what human figure would a gown sit like a fan, or what female head
533: was like a bunch of China-asters?), or, if new grocers were to fill
534: their windows with mountains of currants and sugar, made seductive by
535: contrast and tickets,—what security was there for Grimworth, that a
536: vagrant spirit in shopping, once introduced, would not in the end carry
537: the most important families to the larger market town of Cattleton,
538: where, business being done on a system of small profits and quick
539: returns, the fashions were of the freshest, and goods of all kinds
540: might be bought at an advantage?
541: 
542: With this view of the times predominant among the tradespeople at
543: Grimworth, their uncertainty concerning the nature of the business
544: which the sallow-complexioned stranger was about to set up in the
545: vacant shop, naturally gave some additional strength to the fears of
546: the less sanguine. If he was going to sell drapery, it was probable
547: that a pale-faced fellow like that would deal in showy and inferior
548: articles—printed cottons and muslins which would leave their dye in the
549: wash-tub, jobbed linen full of knots, and flannel that would soon look
550: like gauze. If grocery, then it was to be hoped that no mother of a
551: family would trust the teas of an untried grocer. Such things had been
552: known in some parishes as tradesmen going about canvassing for custom
553: with cards in their pockets: when people came from nobody knew where,
554: there was no knowing what they might do. It was a thousand pities that
555: Mr. Moffat, the auctioneer and broker, had died without leaving anybody
556: to follow him in the business, and Mrs. Cleve’s trustee ought to have
557: known better than to let a shop to a stranger. Even the discovery that
558: ovens were being put up on the premises, and that the shop was, in
559: fact, being fitted up for a confectioner and pastry-cook’s business,
560: hitherto unknown in Grimworth, did not quite suffice to turn the scale
561: in the newcomer’s favour, though the landlady at the Woolpack defended
562: him warmly, said he seemed to be a very clever young man, and from what
563: she could make out, came of a very good family; indeed, was most likely
564: a good many people’s betters.
565: 
566: It certainly made a blaze of light and colour, almost as if a rainbow
567: had suddenly descended into the market-place, when, one fine morning,
568: the shutters were taken down from the new shop, and the two windows
569: displayed their decorations. On one side, there were the variegated
570: tints of collared and marbled meats, set off by bright green leaves,
571: the pale brown of glazed pies, the rich tones of sauces and bottled
572: fruits enclosed in their veil of glass—altogether a sight to bring
573: tears into the eyes of a Dutch painter; and on the other, there was a
574: predominance of the more delicate hues of pink, and white, and yellow,
575: and buff, in the abundant lozenges, candies, sweet biscuits and icings,
576: which to the eyes of a bilious person might easily have been blended
577: into a faëry landscape in Turner’s latest style. What a sight to dawn
578: upon the eyes of Grimworth children! They almost forgot to go to their
579: dinner that day, their appetites being preoccupied with imaginary
580: sugar-plums; and I think even Punch, setting up his tabernacle in the
581: market-place, would not have succeeded in drawing them away from those
582: shop-windows, where they stood according to gradations of size and
583: strength, the biggest and strongest being nearest the window, and the
584: little ones in the outermost rows lifting wide-open eyes and mouths
585: towards the upper tier of jars, like small birds at meal-time.
586: 
587: The elder inhabitants pished and pshawed a little at the folly of the
588: new shopkeeper in venturing on such an outlay in goods that would not
589: keep; to be sure, Christmas was coming, but what housewife in Grimworth
590: would not think shame to furnish forth her table with articles that
591: were not home-cooked? No, no. Mr. Edward Freely, as he called himself,
592: was deceived, if he thought Grimworth money was to flow into his
593: pockets on such terms.
594: 
595: Edward Freely was the name that shone in gilt letters on a mazarine
596: ground over the doorplace of the new shop—a generous-sounding name,
597: that might have belonged to the open-hearted, improvident hero of an
598: old comedy, who would have delighted in raining sugared almonds, like a
599: new manna-gift, among that small generation outside the windows. But
600: Mr. Edward Freely was a man whose impulses were kept in due
601: subordination: he held that the desire for sweets and pastry must only
602: be satisfied in a direct ratio with the power of paying for them. If
603: the smallest child in Grimworth would go to him with a halfpenny in its
604: tiny fist, he would, after ringing the halfpenny, deliver a just
605: equivalent in “rock.” He was not a man to cheat even the smallest
606: child—he often said so, observing at the same time that he loved
607: honesty, and also that he was very tender-hearted, though he didn’t
608: show his feelings as some people did.
609: 
610: Either in reward of such virtue, or according to some more hidden law
611: of sequence, Mr. Freely’s business, in spite of prejudice, started
612: under favourable auspices. For Mrs. Chaloner, the rector’s wife, was
613: among the earliest customers at the shop, thinking it only right to
614: encourage a new parishioner who had made a decorous appearance at
615: church; and she found Mr. Freely a most civil, obliging young man, and
616: intelligent to a surprising degree for a confectioner; well-principled,
617: too, for in giving her useful hints about choosing sugars he had thrown
618: much light on the dishonesty of other tradesmen. Moreover, he had been
619: in the West Indies, and had seen the very estate which had been her
620: poor grandfather’s property; and he said the missionaries were the only
621: cause of the negro’s discontent—an observing young man, evidently. Mrs.
622: Chaloner ordered wine-biscuits and olives, and gave Mr. Freely to
623: understand that she should find his shop a great convenience. So did
624: the doctor’s wife, and so did Mrs. Gate, at the large carding-mill,
625: who, having high connexions frequently visiting her, might be expected
626: to have a large consumption of ratafias and macaroons.
627: 
628: The less aristocratic matrons of Grimworth seemed likely at first to
629: justify their husbands’ confidence that they would never pay a
630: percentage of profits on drop-cakes, instead of making their own, or
631: get up a hollow show of liberal housekeeping by purchasing slices of
632: collared meat when a neighbour came in for supper. But it is my task to
633: narrate the gradual corruption of Grimworth manners from their
634: primitive simplicity—a melancholy task, if it were not cheered by the
635: prospect of the fine peripateia or downfall by which the progress of
636: the corruption was ultimately checked.
637: 
638: It was young Mrs. Steene, the veterinary surgeons wife, who first gave
639: way to temptation. I fear she had been rather over-educated for her
640: station in life, for she knew by heart many passages in _Lalla Rookh_,
641: the _Corsair_, and the _Siege of Corinth_, which had given her a
642: distaste for domestic occupations, and caused her a withering
643: disappointment at the discovery that Mr. Steene, since his marriage,
644: had lost all interest in the “bulbul,” openly preferred discussing the
645: nature of spavin with a coarse neighbour, and was angry if the pudding
646: turned out watery—indeed, was simply a top-booted “vet.”, who came in
647: hungry at dinner-time; and not in the least like a nobleman turned
648: Corsair out of pure scorn for his race, or like a renegade with a
649: turban and crescent, unless it were in the irritability of his temper.
650: And scorn is such a very different thing in top-boots!
651: 
652: This brutal man had invited a supper-party for Christmas eve, when he
653: would expect to see mince-pies on the table. Mrs. Steene had prepared
654: her mince-meat, and had devoted much butter, fine flour, and labour, to
655: the making of a batch of pies in the morning; but they proved to be so
656: very heavy when they came out of the oven, that she could only think
657: with trembling of the moment when her husband should catch sight of
658: them on the supper-table. He would storm at her, she was certain; and
659: before all the company; and then she should never help crying: it was
660: so dreadful to think she had come to that, after the bulbul and
661: everything! Suddenly the thought darted through her mind that _this
662: once_ she might send for a dish of mince-pies from Freely’s: she knew
663: he had some. But what was to become of the eighteen heavy mince-pies?
664: Oh, it was of no use thinking about that; it was very expensive—indeed,
665: making mince-pies at all was a great expense, when they were not sure
666: to turn out well: it would be much better to buy them ready-made. You
667: paid a little more for them, but there was no risk of waste.
668: 
669: Such was the sophistry with which this misguided young woman—enough.
670: Mrs. Steene sent for the mince-pies, and, I am grieved to add, garbled
671: her household accounts in order to conceal the fact from her husband.
672: This was the second step in a downward course, all owing to a young
673: woman’s being out of harmony with her circumstances, yearning after
674: renegades and bulbuls, and being subject to claims from a veterinary
675: surgeon fond of mince-pies. The third step was to harden herself by
676: telling the fact of the bought mince-pies to her intimate friend Mrs.
677: Mole, who had already guessed it, and who subsequently encouraged
678: herself in buying a mould of jelly, instead of exerting her own skill,
679: by the reflection that “other people” did the same sort of thing. The
680: infection spread; soon there was a party or clique in Grimworth on the
681: side of “buying at Freely’s”; and many husbands, kept for some time in
682: the dark on this point, innocently swallowed at two mouthfuls a tart on
683: which they were paying a profit of a hundred per cent., and as
684: innocently encouraged a fatal disingenuousness in the partners of their
685: bosoms by praising the pastry. Others, more keen-sighted, winked at the
686: too frequent presentation on washing-days, and at impromptu suppers, of
687: superior spiced-beef, which flattered their palates more than the cold
688: remnants they had formerly been contented with. Every housewife who had
689: once “bought at Freely’s” felt a secret joy when she detected a similar
690: perversion in her neighbour’s practice, and soon only two or three
691: old-fashioned mistresses of families held out in the protest against
692: the growing demoralization, saying to their neighbours who came to sup
693: with them, “I can’t offer you Freely’s beef, or Freely’s cheesecakes;
694: everything in our house is home-made; I’m afraid you’ll hardly have any
695: appetite for our plain pastry.” The doctor, whose cook was not
696: satisfactory, the curate, who kept no cook, and the mining agent, who
697: was a great _bon vivant_, even began to rely on Freely for the greater
698: part of their dinner, when they wished to give an entertainment of some
699: brilliancy. In short, the business of manufacturing the more fanciful
700: viands was fast passing out of the hinds of maids and matrons in
701: private families, and was becoming the work of a special commercial
702: organ.
703: 
704: I am not ignorant that this sort of thing is called the inevitable
705: course of civilization, division of labour, and so forth, and that the
706: maids and matrons may be said to have had their hands set free from
707: cookery to add to the wealth of society in some other way. Only it
708: happened at Grimworth, which, to be sure, was a low place, that the
709: maids and matrons could do nothing with their hands at all better than
710: cooking: not even those who had always made heavy cakes and leathery
711: pastry. And so it came to pass, that the progress of civilization at
712: Grimworth was not otherwise apparent than in the impoverishment of men,
713: the gossiping idleness of women, and the heightening prosperity of Mr.
714: Edward Freely.
715: 
716: The Yellow Coat School was a double source of profit to the calculating
717: confectioner; for he opened an eating-room for the superior workmen
718: employed on the new school, and he accommodated the pupils at the old
719: school by giving great attention to the fancy-sugar department. When I
720: think of the sweet-tasted swans and other ingenious white shapes
721: crunched by the small teeth of that rising generation, I am glad to
722: remember that a certain amount of calcareous food has been held good
723: for young creatures whose bones are not quite formed; for I have
724: observed these delicacies to have an inorganic flavour which would have
725: recommended them greatly to that young lady of the _Spectator’s_
726: acquaintance who habitually made her dessert on the stems of
727: tobacco-pipes.
728: 
729: As for the confectioner himself, he made his way gradually into
730: Grimworth homes, as his commodities did, in spite of some initial
731: repugnance. Somehow or other, his reception as a guest seemed a thing
732: that required justifying, like the purchasing of his pastry. In the
733: first place, he was a stranger, and therefore open to suspicion;
734: secondly, the confectionery business was so entirely new at Grimworth,
735: that its place in the scale of rank had not been distinctly
736: ascertained. There was no doubt about drapers and grocers, when they
737: came of good old Grimworth families, like Mr. Luff and Mr. Prettyman:
738: they visited with the Palfreys, who farmed their own land, played many
739: a game at whist with the doctor, and condescended a little towards the
740: timber-merchant, who had lately taken to the coal-trade also, and had
741: got new furniture; but whether a confectioner should be admitted to
742: this higher level of respectability, or should be understood to find
743: his associates among butchers and bakers, was a new question on which
744: tradition threw no light. His being a bachelor was in his favour, and
745: would perhaps have been enough to turn the scale, even if Mr. Edward
746: Freely’s other personal pretensions had been of an entirely
747: insignificant cast. But so far from this, it very soon appeared that he
748: was a remarkable young man, who had been in the West Indies, and had
749: seen many wonders by sea and land, so that he could charm the ears of
750: Grimworth Desdemonas with stories of strange fishes, especially sharks,
751: which he had stabbed in the nick of time by bravely plunging overboard
752: just as the monster was turning on his side to devour the cook’s mate;
753: of terrible fevers which he had undergone in a land where the wind
754: blows from all quarters at once; of rounds of toast cut straight from
755: the breadfruit trees; of toes bitten off by land-crabs; of large
756: honours that had been offered to him as a man who knew what was what,
757: and was therefore particularly needed in a tropical climate; and of a
758: Creole heiress who had wept bitterly at his departure. Such
759: conversational talents as these, we know, will overcome disadvantages
760: of complexion; and young Towers, whose cheeks were of the finest pink,
761: set off by a fringe of dark whisker, was quite eclipsed by the presence
762: of the sallow Mr. Freely. So exceptional a confectioner elevated the
763: business, and might well begin to make disengaged hearts flutter a
764: little.
765: 
766: Fathers and mothers were naturally more slow and cautious in their
767: recognition of the newcomer’s merits.
768: 
769: “He’s an amusing fellow,” said Mr. Prettyman, the highly respectable
770: grocer. (Mrs. Prettyman was a Miss Fothergill, and her sister had
771: married a London mercer.) “He’s an amusing fellow; and I’ve no
772: objection to his making one at the Oyster Club; but he’s a bit too fond
773: of riding the high horse. He’s uncommonly knowing, I’ll allow; but how
774: came he to go to the Indies? I should like that answered. It’s
775: unnatural in a confectioner. I’m not fond of people that have been
776: beyond seas, if they can’t give a good account how they happened to go.
777: When folks go so far off, it’s because they’ve got little credit nearer
778: home—that’s my opinion. However, he’s got some good rum; but I don’t
779: want to be hand and glove with him, for all that.”
780: 
781: It was this kind of dim suspicion which beclouded the view of Mr.
782: Freely’s qualities in the maturer minds of Grimworth through the early
783: months of his residence there. But when the confectioner ceased to be a
784: novelty, the suspicions also ceased to be novel, and people got tired
785: of hinting at them, especially as they seemed to be refuted by his
786: advancing prosperity and importance. Mr. Freely was becoming a person
787: of influence in the parish; he was found useful as an overseer of the
788: poor, having great firmness in enduring other people’s pain, which
789: firmness, he said, was due to his great benevolence; he always did what
790: was good for people in the end. Mr. Chaloner had even selected him as
791: clergyman’s churchwarden, for he was a very handy man, and much more of
792: Mr. Chaloner’s opinion in everything about church business than the
793: older parishioners. Mr. Freely was a very regular churchman, but at the
794: Oyster Club he was sometimes a little free in his conversation, more
795: than hinting at a life of Sultanic self-indulgence which he had passed
796: in the West Indies, shaking his head now and then and smiling rather
797: bitterly, as men are wont to do when they intimate that they have
798: become a little too wise to be instructed about a world which has long
799: been flat and stale to them.
800: 
801: For some time he was quite general in his attentions to the fair sex,
802: combining the gallantries of a lady’s man with a severity of criticism
803: on the person and manners of absent belles, which tended rather to
804: stimulate in the feminine breast the desire to conquer the approval of
805: so fastidious a judge. Nothing short of the very best in the department
806: of female charms and virtues could suffice to kindle the ardour of Mr.
807: Edward Freely, who had become familiar with the most luxuriant and
808: dazzling beauty in the West Indies. It may seem incredible that a
809: confectioner should have ideas and conversation so much resembling
810: those to be met with in a higher walk of life, but it must be
811: remembered that he had not merely travelled, he had also bow-legs and a
812: sallow, small-featured visage, so that nature herself had stamped him
813: for a fastidious connoisseur of the fair sex.
814: 
815: At last, however, it seemed clear that Cupid had found a sharper arrow
816: than usual, and that Mr. Freely’s heart was pierced. It was the general
817: talk among the young people at Grimworth. But was it really love, and
818: not rather ambition? Miss Fullilove, the timber-merchant’s daughter,
819: was quite sure that if _she_ were Miss Penny Palfrey, she would be
820: cautious; it was not a good sign when men looked so much above
821: themselves for a wife. For it was no less a person than Miss Penelope
822: Palfrey, second daughter of the Mr. Palfrey who farmed his own land,
823: that had attracted Mr. Freely’s peculiar regard, and conquered his
824: fastidiousness; and no wonder, for the Ideal, as exhibited in the
825: finest waxwork, was perhaps never so closely approached by the Real as
826: in the person of the pretty Penelope. Her yellowish flaxen hair did not
827: curl naturally, I admit, but its bright crisp ringlets were such
828: smooth, perfect miniature tubes, that you would have longed to pass
829: your little finger through them, and feel their soft elasticity. She
830: wore them in a crop, for in those days, when society was in a healthier
831: state, young ladies wore crops long after they were twenty, and
832: Penelope was not yet nineteen. Like the waxen ideal, she had round blue
833: eyes, and round nostrils in her little nose, and teeth such as the
834: ideal would be seen to have, if it ever showed them. Altogether, she
835: was a small, round thing, as neat as a pink and white double daisy, and
836: as guileless; for I hope it does not argue guile in a pretty damsel of
837: nineteen, to think that she should like to have a beau and be
838: “engaged,” when her elder sister had already been in that position a
839: year and a half. To be sure, there was young Towers always coming to
840: the house; but Penny felt convinced he only came to see her brother,
841: for he never had anything to say to her, and never offered her his arm,
842: and was as awkward and silent as possible.
843: 
844: It is not unlikely that Mr. Freely had early been smitten by Penny’s
845: charms, as brought under his observation at church, but he had to make
846: his way in society a little before he could come into nearer contact
847: with them; and even after he was well received in Grimworth families,
848: it was a long while before he could converse with Penny otherwise than
849: in an incidental meeting at Mr. Luff’s. It was not so easy to get
850: invited to Long Meadows, the residence of the Palfreys; for though Mr.
851: Palfrey had been losing money of late years, not being able quite to
852: recover his feet after the terrible murrain which forced him to borrow,
853: his family were far from considering themselves on the same level even
854: as the old-established tradespeople with whom they visited. The
855: greatest people, even kings and queens, must visit with somebody, and
856: the equals of the great are scarce. They were especially scarce at
857: Grimworth, which, as I have before observed, was a low parish,
858: mentioned with the most scornful brevity in gazetteers. Even the great
859: people there were far behind those of their own standing in other parts
860: of this realm. Mr. Palfrey’s farmyard doors had the paint all worn off
861: them, and the front garden walks had long been merged in a general
862: weediness. Still, his father had been called Squire Palfrey, and had
863: been respected by the last Grimworth generation as a man who could
864: afford to drink too much in his own house.
865: 
866: Pretty Penny was not blind to the fact that Mr. Freely admired her, and
867: she felt sure that it was he who had sent her a beautiful valentine;
868: but her sister seemed to think so lightly of him (all young ladies
869: think lightly of the gentlemen to whom they are not engaged), that
870: Penny never dared mention him, and trembled and blushed whenever they
871: met him, thinking of the valentine, which was very strong in its
872: expressions, and which she felt guilty of knowing by heart. A man who
873: had been to the Indies, and knew the sea so well, seemed to her a sort
874: of public character, almost like Robinson Crusoe or Captain Cook; and
875: Penny had always wished her husband to be a remarkable personage,
876: likely to be put in Mangnall’s Questions, with which register of the
877: immortals she had become acquainted during her one year at a
878: boarding-school. Only it seemed strange that a remarkable man should be
879: a confectioner and pastry-cook, and this anomaly quite disturbed
880: Penny’s dreams. Her brothers, she knew, laughed at men who couldn’t sit
881: on horseback well, and called them tailors; but her brothers were very
882: rough, and were quite without that power of anecdote which made Mr.
883: Freely such a delightful companion. He was a very good man, she
884: thought, for she had heard him say at Mr. Luff’s, one day, that he
885: always wished to do his duty in whatever state of life he might be
886: placed; and he knew a great deal of poetry, for one day he had repeated
887: a verse of a song. She wondered if he had made the words of the
888: valentine!—it ended in this way:—
889: 
890: “Without thee, it is pain to live,
891: But with thee, it were sweet to die.”
892: 
893: 
894: Poor Mr. Freely! her father would very likely object—she felt sure he
895: would, for he always called Mr. Freely “that sugar-plum fellow.” Oh, it
896: was very cruel, when true love was crossed in that way, and all because
897: Mr. Freely was a confectioner: well, Penny would be true to him, for
898: all that, and since his being a confectioner gave her an opportunity of
899: showing her faithfulness, she was glad of it. Edward Freely was a
900: pretty name, much better than John Towers. Young Towers had offered her
901: a rose out of his button-hole the other day, blushing very much; but
902: she refused it, and thought with delight how much Mr. Freely would be
903: comforted if he knew her firmness of mind.
904: 
905: Poor little Penny! the days were so very long among the daisies on a
906: grazing farm, and thought is so active—how was it possible that the
907: inward drama should not get the start of the outward? I have known
908: young ladies, much better educated, and with an outward world
909: diversified by instructive lectures, to say nothing of literature and
910: highly-developed fancy-work, who have spun a cocoon of visionary joys
911: and sorrows for themselves, just as Penny did. Her elder sister
912: Letitia, who had a prouder style of beauty, and a more worldly
913: ambition, was engaged to a wool-factor, who came all the way from
914: Cattelton to see her; and everybody knows that a wool-factor takes a
915: very high rank, sometimes driving a double-bodied gig. Letty’s notions
916: got higher every day, and Penny never dared to speak of her cherished
917: griefs to her lofty sister—never dared to propose that they should call
918: at Mr. Freely’s to buy liquorice, though she had prepared for such an
919: incident by mentioning a slight sore throat. So she had to pass the
920: shop on the other side of the market-place, and reflect, with a
921: suppressed sigh, that behind those pink and white jars somebody was
922: thinking of her tenderly, unconscious of the small space that divided
923: her from him.
924: 
925: And it was quite true that, when business permitted, Mr. Freely thought
926: a great deal of Penny. He thought her prettiness comparable to the
927: loveliest things in confectionery; he judged her to be of submissive
928: temper—likely to wait upon him as well as if she had been a negress,
929: and to be silently terrified when his liver made him irritable; and he
930: considered the Palfrey family quite the best in the parish, possessing
931: marriageable daughters. On the whole, he thought her worthy to become
932: Mrs. Edward Freely, and all the more so, because it would probably
933: require some ingenuity to win her. Mr. Palfrey was capable of
934: horse-whipping a too rash pretender to his daughter’s hand; and,
935: moreover, he had three tall sons: it was clear that a suitor would be
936: at a disadvantage with such a family, unless travel and natural acumen
937: had given him a countervailing power of contrivance. And the first idea
938: that occurred to him in the matter was, that Mr. Palfrey would object
939: less if he knew that the Freelys were a much higher family than his
940: own. It had been foolish modesty in him hitherto to conceal the fact
941: that a branch of the Freelys held a manor in Yorkshire, and to shut up
942: the portrait of his great uncle the admiral, instead of hanging it up
943: where a family portrait should be hung—over the mantelpiece in the
944: parlour. Admiral Freely, K.C.B., once placed in this conspicuous
945: position, was seen to have had one arm only, and one eye—in these
946: points resembling the heroic Nelson—while a certain pallid
947: insignificance of feature confirmed the relationship between himself
948: and his grand-nephew.
949: 
950: Next, Mr. Freely was seized with an irrepressible ambition to posses
951: Mrs. Palfrey’s receipt for brawn, hers being pronounced on all hands to
952: be superior to his own—as he informed her in a very flattering letter
953: carried by his errand-boy. Now Mrs. Palfrey, like other geniuses,
954: wrought by instinct rather than by rule, and possessed no
955: receipts—indeed, despised all people who used them, observing that
956: people who pickled by book, must pickle by weights and measures, and
957: such nonsense; as for herself, her weights and measures were the tip of
958: her finger and the tip of her tongue, and if you went nearer, why, of
959: course, for dry goods like flour and spice, you went by handfuls and
960: pinches, and for wet, there was a middle-sized jug—quite the best thing
961: whether for much or little, because you might know how much a teacupful
962: was if you’d got any use of your senses, and you might be sure it would
963: take five middle-sized jugs to make a gallon. Knowledge of this kind is
964: like Titian’s colouring, difficult to communicate; and as Mrs. Palfrey,
965: once remarkably handsome, had now become rather stout and asthmatical,
966: and scarcely ever left home, her oral teaching could hardly be given
967: anywhere except at Long Meadows. Even a matron is not insusceptible to
968: flattery, and the prospect of a visitor whose great object would be to
969: listen to her conversation, was not without its charms to Mrs. Palfrey.
970: Since there was no receipt to be sent in reply to Mr. Freely’s humble
971: request, she called on her more docile daughter, Penny, to write a
972: note, telling him that her mother would be glad to see him and talk
973: with him on brawn, any day that he could call at Long Meadows. Penny
974: obeyed with a trembling hand, thinking how wonderfully things came
975: about in this world.
976: 
977: In this way, Mr. Freely got himself introduced into the home of the
978: Palfreys, and notwithstanding a tendency in the male part of the family
979: to jeer at him a little as “peaky” and bow-legged, he presently
980: established his position as an accepted and frequent guest. Young
981: Towers looked at him with increasing disgust when they met at the house
982: on a Sunday, and secretly longed to try his ferret upon him, as a piece
983: of vermin which that valuable animal would be likely to tackle with
984: unhesitating vigour. But—so blind sometimes are parents—neither Mr. nor
985: Mrs. Palfrey suspected that Penny would have anything to say to a
986: tradesman of questionable rank whose youthful bloom was much withered.
987: Young Towers, they thought, had an eye to her, and _that_ was likely
988: enough to be a match some day; but Penny was a child at present. And
989: all the while Penny was imagining the circumstances under which Mr.
990: Freely would make her an offer: perhaps down by the row of
991: damson-trees, when they were in the garden before tea; perhaps by
992: letter—in which case, how would the letter begin? “Dearest Penelope?”
993: or “My dear Miss Penelope?” or straight off, without dear anything, as
994: seemed the most natural when people were embarrassed? But, however he
995: might make the offer, she would not accept it without her father’s
996: consent: she would always be true to Mr. Freely, but she would not
997: disobey her father. For Penny was a good girl, though some of her
998: female friends were afterwards of opinion that it spoke ill for her not
999: to have felt an instinctive repugnance to Mr. Freely.
1000: 
1001: But he was cautious, and wished to be quite sure of the ground he trod
1002: on. His views on marriage were not entirely sentimental, but were as
1003: duly mingled with considerations of what would be advantageous to a man
1004: in his position, as if he had had a very large amount of money spent on
1005: his education. He was not a man to fall in love in the wrong place; and
1006: so, he applied himself quite as much to conciliate the favour of the
1007: parents, as to secure the attachment of Penny. Mrs. Palfrey had not
1008: been inaccessible to flattery, and her husband, being also of mortal
1009: mould, would not, it might be hoped, be proof against rum—that very
1010: fine Jamaica rum—of which Mr. Freely expected always to have a supply
1011: sent him from Jamaica. It was not easy to get Mr. Palfrey into the
1012: parlour behind the shop, where a mild back-street light fell on the
1013: features of the heroic admiral; but by getting hold of him rather late
1014: one evening as he was about to return home from Grimworth, the aspiring
1015: lover succeeded in persuading him to sup on some collared beef which,
1016: after Mrs. Palfrey’s brawn, he would find the very best of cold eating.
1017: 
1018: From that hour Mr. Freely felt sure of success: being in privacy with
1019: an estimable man old enough to be his father, and being rather lonely
1020: in the world, it was natural he should unbosom himself a little on
1021: subjects which he could not speak of in a mixed circle—especially
1022: concerning his expectations from his uncle in Jamaica, who had no
1023: children, and loved his nephew Edward better than any one else in the
1024: world, though he had been so hurt at his leaving Jamaica, that he had
1025: threatened to cut him off with a shilling. However, he had since
1026: written to state his full forgiveness, and though he was an eccentric
1027: old gentleman and could not bear to give away money during his life,
1028: Mr. Edward Freely could show Mr. Palfrey the letter which declared,
1029: plainly enough, who would be the affectionate uncle’s heir. Mr. Palfrey
1030: actually saw the letter, and could not help admiring the spirit of the
1031: nephew who declared that such brilliant hopes as these made no
1032: difference to his conduct; he should work at his humble business and
1033: make his modest fortune at it all the same. If the Jamaica estate was
1034: to come to him—well and good. It was nothing very surprising for one of
1035: the Freely family to have an estate left him, considering the lands
1036: that family had possessed in time gone by—nay, still possessed in the
1037: Northumberland branch. Would not Mr. Palfrey take another glass of rum?
1038: and also look at the last year’s balance of the accounts? Mr. Freely
1039: was a man who cared to possess personal virtues, and did not pique
1040: himself on his family, though some men would.
1041: 
1042: We know how easily the great Leviathan may be led, when once there is a
1043: hook in his nose or a bridle in his jaws. Mr. Palfrey was a large man,
1044: but, like Leviathan’s, his bulk went against him when once he had taken
1045: a turning. He was not a mercurial man, who easily changed his point of
1046: view. Enough. Before two months were over, he had given his consent to
1047: Mr. Freely’s marriage with his daughter Penny, and having hit on a
1048: formula by which he could justify it, fenced off all doubts and
1049: objections, his own included. The formula was this: “I’m not a man to
1050: put my head up an entry before I know where it leads.”
1051: 
1052: Little Penny was very proud and fluttering, but hardly so happy as she
1053: expected to be in an engagement. She wondered if young Towers cared
1054: much about it, for he had not been to the house lately, and her sister
1055: and brothers were rather inclined to sneer than to sympathize.
1056: Grimworth rang with the news. All men extolled Mr. Freely’s good
1057: fortune; while the women, with the tender solicitude characteristic of
1058: the sex, wished the marriage might turn out well.
1059: 
1060: While affairs were at this triumphant juncture, Mr. Freely one morning
1061: observed that a stone-carver who had been breakfasting in the
1062: eating-room had left a newspaper behind. It was the _X-shire Gazette_,
1063: and X-shire being a county not unknown to Mr. Freely, he felt some
1064: curiosity to glance over it, and especially over the advertisements. A
1065: slight flush came over his face as he read. It was produced by the
1066: following announcement:—“If David Faux, son of Jonathan Faux, late of
1067: Gilsbrook, will apply at the office of Mr. Strutt, attorney, of Rodham,
1068: he will hear of something to his advantage.”
1069: 
1070: “Father’s dead!” exclaimed Mr. Freely, involuntarily. “Can he have left
1071: me a legacy?”
1072: 
1073: 
1074: 
1075: 
1076: CHAPTER III
1077: 
1078: 
1079: Perhaps it was a result quite different from your expectations, that
1080: Mr. David Faux should have returned from the West Indies only a few
1081: years after his arrival there, and have set up in his old business,
1082: like any plain man who has never travelled. But these cases do occur in
1083: life. Since, as we know, men change their skies and see new
1084: constellations without changing their souls, it will follow sometimes
1085: that they don’t change their business under those novel circumstances.
1086: 
1087: Certainly, this result was contrary to David’s own expectations. He had
1088: looked forward, you are aware, to a brilliant career among “the
1089: blacks”; but, either because they had already seen too many white men,
1090: or for some other reason, they did not at once recognize him as a
1091: superior order of human being; besides, there were no princesses among
1092: them. Nobody in Jamaica was anxious to maintain David for the mere
1093: pleasure of his society; and those hidden merits of a man which are so
1094: well known to himself were as little recognized there as they
1095: notoriously are in the effete society of the Old World. So that in the
1096: dark hints that David threw out at the Oyster Club about that life of
1097: Sultanic self-indulgence spent by him in the luxurious Indies, I really
1098: think he was doing himself a wrong; I believe he worked for his bread,
1099: and, in fact, took to cooking as, after all, the only department in
1100: which he could offer skilled labour. He had formed several ingenious
1101: plans by which he meant to circumvent people of large fortune and small
1102: faculty; but then he never met with exactly the right circumstances.
1103: David’s devices for getting rich without work had apparently no direct
1104: relation with the world outside him, as his confectionery receipts had.
1105: It is possible to pass a great many bad half pennies and bad
1106: half-crowns, but I believe there has no instance been known of passing
1107: a halfpenny or a half-crown as a sovereign. A sharper can drive a brisk
1108: trade in this world: it is undeniable that there may be a fine career
1109: for him, if he will dare consequences; but David was too timid to be a
1110: sharper, or venture in any way among the mantraps of the law. He dared
1111: rob nobody but his mother. And so he had to fall back on the genuine
1112: value there was in him—to be content to pass as a good halfpenny, or,
1113: to speak more accurately, as a good confectioner. For in spite of some
1114: additional reading and observation, there was nothing else he could
1115: make so much money by; nay, he found in himself even a capability of
1116: extending his skill in this direction, and embracing all forms of
1117: cookery; while, in other branches of human labour, he began to see that
1118: it was not possible for him to shine. Fate was too strong for him; he
1119: had thought to master her inclination and had fled over the seas to
1120: that end; but she caught him, tied an apron round him, and snatching
1121: him from all other devices, made him devise cakes and patties in a
1122: kitchen at Kingstown. He was getting submissive to her, since she paid
1123: him with tolerable gains; but fevers and prickly heat, and other evils
1124: incidental to cooks in ardent climates, made him long for his native
1125: land; so he took ship once more, carrying his six years’ savings, and
1126: seeing distinctly, this time, what were Fate’s intentions as to his
1127: career. If you question me closely as to whether all the money with
1128: which he set up at Grimworth consisted of pure and simple earnings, I
1129: am obliged to confess that he got a sum or two for charitably
1130: abstaining from mentioning some other people’s misdemeanours.
1131: Altogether, since no prospects were attached to his family name, and
1132: since a new christening seemed a suitable commencement of a new life,
1133: Mr. David Faux thought it as well to call himself Mr. Edward Freely.
1134: 
1135: But lo! now, in opposition to all calculable probability, some benefit
1136: appeared to be attached to the name of David Faux. Should he neglect
1137: it, as beneath the attention of a prosperous tradesman? It might bring
1138: him into contact with his family again, and he felt no yearnings in
1139: that direction: moreover, he had small belief that the “something to
1140: his advantage” could be anything considerable. On the other hand, even
1141: a small gain is pleasant, and the promise of it in this instance was so
1142: surprising, that David felt his curiosity awakened. The scale dipped at
1143: last on the side of writing to the lawyer, and, to be brief, the
1144: correspondence ended in an appointment for a meeting between David and
1145: his eldest brother at Mr. Strutt’s, the vague “something” having been
1146: defined as a legacy from his father of eighty-two pounds, three
1147: shillings.
1148: 
1149: David, you know, had expected to be disinherited; and so he would have
1150: been, if he had not, like some other indifferent sons, come of
1151: excellent parents, whose conscience made them scrupulous where much
1152: more highly-instructed people often feel themselves warranted in
1153: following the bent of their indignation. Good Mrs. Faux could never
1154: forget that she had brought this ill-conditioned son into the world
1155: when he was in that entirely helpless state which excluded the smallest
1156: choice on his part; and, somehow or other, she felt that his going
1157: wrong would be his father’s and mother’s fault, if they failed in one
1158: tittle of their parental duty. Her notion of parental duty was not of a
1159: high and subtle kind, but it included giving him his due share of the
1160: family property; for when a man had got a little honest money of his
1161: own, was he so likely to steal? To cut the delinquent son off with a
1162: shilling, was like delivering him over to his evil propensities. No;
1163: let the sum of twenty guineas which he had stolen be deducted from his
1164: share, and then let the sum of three guineas be put back from it,
1165: seeing that his mother had always considered three of the twenty
1166: guineas as his; and, though he had run away, and was, perhaps, gone
1167: across the sea, let the money be left to him all the same, and be kept
1168: in reserve for his possible return. Mr. Faux agreed to his wife’s
1169: views, and made a codicil to his will accordingly, in time to die with
1170: a clear conscience. But for some time his family thought it likely that
1171: David would never reappear; and the eldest son, who had the charge of
1172: Jacob on his hands, often thought it a little hard that David might
1173: perhaps be dead, and yet, for want of certitude on that point, his
1174: legacy could not fall to his legal heir. But in this state of things
1175: the opposite certitude—namely, that David was still alive and in
1176: England—seemed to be brought by the testimony of a neighbour, who,
1177: having been on a journey to Cattelton, was pretty sure he had seen
1178: David in a gig, with a stout man driving by his side. He could “swear
1179: it was David,” though he could “give no account why, for he had no
1180: marks on him; but no more had a white dog, and that didn’t hinder folks
1181: from knowing a white dog.” It was this incident which had led to the
1182: advertisement.
1183: 
1184: The legacy was paid, of course, after a few preliminary disclosures as
1185: to Mr. David’s actual position. He begged to send his love to his
1186: mother, and to say that he hoped to pay her a dutiful visit by and by;
1187: but, at present, his business and near prospect of marriage made it
1188: difficult for him to leave home. His brother replied with much
1189: frankness.
1190: 
1191: “My mother may do as she likes about having you to see her, but, for my
1192: part, I don’t want to catch sight of you on the premises again. When
1193: folks have taken a new name, they’d better keep to their new
1194: ’quinetance.”
1195: 
1196: David pocketed the insult along with the eighty-two pounds three, and
1197: travelled home again in some triumph at the ease of a transaction which
1198: had enriched him to this extent. He had no intention of offending his
1199: brother by further claims on his fraternal recognition, and relapsed
1200: with full contentment into the character of Mr. Edward Freely, the
1201: orphan, scion of a great but reduced family, with an eccentric uncle in
1202: the West Indies. (I have already hinted that he had some acquaintance
1203: with imaginative literature; and being of a practical turn, he had, you
1204: perceive, applied even this form of knowledge to practical purposes.)
1205: 
1206: It was little more than a week after the return from his fruitful
1207: journey, that the day of his marriage with Penny having been fixed, it
1208: was agreed that Mrs. Palfrey should overcome her reluctance to move
1209: from home, and that she and her husband should bring their two
1210: daughters to inspect little Penny’s future abode and decide on the new
1211: arrangements to be made for the reception of the bride. Mr. Freely
1212: meant her to have a house so pretty and comfortable that she need not
1213: envy even a wool-factor’s wife. Of course, the upper room over the shop
1214: was to be the best sitting-room; but also the parlour behind the shop
1215: was to be made a suitable bower for the lovely Penny, who would
1216: naturally wish to be near her husband, though Mr. Freely declared his
1217: resolution never to allow _his_ wife to wait in the shop. The decisions
1218: about the parlour furniture were left till last, because the party was
1219: to take tea there; and, about five o’clock, they were all seated there
1220: with the best muffins and buttered buns before them, little Penny
1221: blushing and smiling, with her “crop” in the best order, and a blue
1222: frock showing her little white shoulders, while her opinion was being
1223: always asked and never given. She secretly wished to have a particular
1224: sort of chimney ornaments, but she could not have brought herself to
1225: mention it. Seated by the side of her yellow and rather withered lover,
1226: who, though he had not reached his thirtieth year, had already
1227: crow’s-feet about his eyes, she was quite tremulous at the greatness of
1228: her lot in being married to a man who had travelled so much—and before
1229: her sister Letty! The handsome Letitia looked rather proud and
1230: contemptuous, thought her future brother-in-law an odious person, and
1231: was vexed with her father and mother for letting Penny marry him. Dear
1232: little Penny! She certainly did look like a fresh white-heart cherry
1233: going to be bitten off the stem by that lipless mouth. Would no
1234: deliverer come to make a slip between that cherry and that mouth
1235: without a lip?
1236: 
1237: “Quite a family likeness between the admiral and you, Mr. Freely,”
1238: observed Mrs. Palfrey, who was looking at the family portrait for the
1239: first time. “It’s wonderful! and only a grand-uncle. Do you feature the
1240: rest of your family, as you know of?”
1241: 
1242: “I can’t say,” said Mr. Freely, with a sigh. “My family have mostly
1243: thought themselves too high to take any notice of me.”
1244: 
1245: At this moment an extraordinary disturbance was heard in the shop, as
1246: of a heavy animal stamping about and making angry noises, and then of a
1247: glass vessel falling in shivers, while the voice of the apprentice was
1248: heard calling “Master” in great alarm.
1249: 
1250: Mr. Freely rose in anxious astonishment, and hastened into the shop,
1251: followed by the four Palfreys, who made a group at the parlour-door,
1252: transfixed with wonder at seeing a large man in a smock-frock, with a
1253: pitchfork in his hand, rush up to Mr. Freely and hug him, crying
1254: out,—“Zavy, Zavy, b’other Zavy!”
1255: 
1256: It was Jacob, and for some moments David lost all presence of mind. He
1257: felt arrested for having stolen his mother’s guineas. He turned cold,
1258: and trembled in his brother’s grasp.
1259: 
1260: “Why, how’s this?” said Mr. Palfrey, advancing from the door. “Who is
1261: he?”
1262: 
1263: Jacob supplied the answer by saying over and over again—
1264: 
1265: “I’se Zacob, b’other Zacob. Come ’o zee Zavy”—till hunger prompted him
1266: to relax his grasp, and to seize a large raised pie, which he lifted to
1267: his mouth.
1268: 
1269: By this time David’s power of device had begun to return, but it was a
1270: very hard task for his prudence to master his rage and hatred towards
1271: poor Jacob.
1272: 
1273: “I don’t know who he is; he must be drunk,” he said, in a low tone to
1274: Mr. Palfrey. “But he’s dangerous with that pitchfork. He’ll never let
1275: it go.” Then checking himself on the point of betraying too great an
1276: intimacy with Jacob’s habits, he added “You watch him, while I run for
1277: the constable.” And he hurried out of the shop.
1278: 
1279: “Why, where do you come from, my man?” said Mr. Palfrey, speaking to
1280: Jacob in a conciliatory tone. Jacob was eating his pie by large
1281: mouthfuls, and looking round at the other good things in the shop,
1282: while he embraced his pitchfork with his left arm, and laid his left
1283: hand on some Bath buns. He was in the rare position of a person who
1284: recovers a long absent friend and finds him richer than ever in the
1285: characteristics that won his heart.
1286: 
1287: “I’s Zacob—b’other Zacob—’t home. I love Zavy—b’other Zavy,” he said,
1288: as soon as Mr. Palfrey had drawn his attention. “Zavy come back from z’
1289: Indies—got mother’s zinnies. Where’s Zavy?” he added, looking round and
1290: then turning to the others with a questioning air, puzzled by David’s
1291: disappearance.
1292: 
1293: “It’s very odd,” observed Mr. Palfrey to his wife and daughters. “He
1294: seems to say Freely’s his brother come back from th’ Indies.”
1295: 
1296: “What a pleasant relation for us!” said Letitia, sarcastically. “I
1297: think he’s a good deal like Mr. Freely. He’s got just the same sort of
1298: nose, and his eyes are the same colour.”
1299: 
1300: Poor Penny was ready to cry.
1301: 
1302: But now Mr. Freely re-entered the shop without the constable. During
1303: his walk of a few yards he had had time and calmness enough to widen
1304: his view of consequences, and he saw that to get Jacob taken to the
1305: workhouse or to the lock-up house as an offensive stranger might have
1306: awkward effects if his family took the trouble of inquiring after him.
1307: He must resign himself to more patient measures.
1308: 
1309: “On second thoughts,” he said, beckoning to Mr. Palfrey and whispering
1310: to him while Jacob’s back was turned, “he’s a poor half-witted fellow.
1311: Perhaps his friends will come after him. I don’t mind giving him
1312: something to eat, and letting him lie down for the night. He’s got it
1313: into his head that he knows me—they do get these fancies, idiots do.
1314: He’ll perhaps go away again in an hour or two, and make no more ado.
1315: I’m a kind-hearted man _myself_—I shouldn’t like to have the poor
1316: fellow ill-used.”
1317: 
1318: “Why, he’ll eat a sovereign’s worth in no time,” said Mr. Palfrey,
1319: thinking Mr. Freely a little too magnificent in his generosity.
1320: 
1321: “Eh, Zavy, come back?” exclaimed Jacob, giving his dear brother another
1322: hug, which crushed Mr. Freely’s features inconveniently against the
1323: handle of the pitchfork.
1324: 
1325: “Aye, aye,” said Mr. Freely, smiling, with every capability of murder
1326: in his mind, except the courage to commit it. He wished the Bath buns
1327: might by chance have arsenic in them.
1328: 
1329: “Mother’s zinnies?” said Jacob, pointing to a glass jar of yellow
1330: lozenges that stood in the window. “Zive ’em me.”
1331: 
1332: David dared not do otherwise than reach down the glass jar and give
1333: Jacob a handful. He received them in his smock-frock, which he held out
1334: for more.
1335: 
1336: “They’ll keep him quiet a bit, at any rate,” thought David, and emptied
1337: the jar. Jacob grinned and mowed with delight.
1338: 
1339: “You’re very good to this stranger, Mr. Freely,” said Letitia; and then
1340: spitefully, as David joined the party at the parlour-door, “I think you
1341: could hardly treat him better, if he was really your brother.”
1342: 
1343: “I’ve always thought it a duty to be good to idiots,” said Mr. Freely,
1344: striving after the most moral view of the subject. “We might have been
1345: idiots ourselves—everybody might have been born idiots, instead of
1346: having their right senses.”
1347: 
1348: “I don’t know where there’d ha’ been victual for us all then,” observed
1349: Mrs. Palfrey, regarding the matter in a housewifely light.
1350: 
1351: “But let us sit down again and finish our tea,” said Mr. Freely. “Let
1352: us leave the poor creature to himself.”
1353: 
1354: They walked into the parlour again; but Jacob, not apparently
1355: appreciating the kindness of leaving him to himself, immediately
1356: followed his brother, and seated himself, pitchfork grounded, at the
1357: table.
1358: 
1359: “Well,” said Miss Letitia, rising, “I don’t know whether _you_ mean to
1360: stay, mother; but I shall go home.”
1361: 
1362: “Oh, me too,” said Penny, frightened to death at Jacob, who had begun
1363: to nod and grin at her.
1364: 
1365: “Well, I think we _had_ better be going, Mr. Palfrey,” said the mother,
1366: rising more slowly.
1367: 
1368: Mr. Freely, whose complexion had become decidedly yellower during the
1369: last half-hour, did not resist this proposition. He hoped they should
1370: meet again “under happier circumstances.”
1371: 
1372: “It’s my belief the man is his brother,” said Letitia, when they were
1373: all on their way home.
1374: 
1375: “Nonsense!” said Mr. Palfrey. “Freely’s got no brother—he’s said so
1376: many and many a time; he’s an orphan; he’s got nothing but
1377: uncles—leastwise, one. What’s it matter what an idiot says? What call
1378: had Freely to tell lies?”
1379: 
1380: Letitia tossed her head and was silent.
1381: 
1382: Mr. Freely, left alone with his affectionate brother Jacob, brooded
1383: over the possibility of luring him out of the town early the next
1384: morning, and getting him conveyed to Gilsbrook without further
1385: betrayals. But the thing was difficult. He saw clearly that if he took
1386: Jacob himself, his absence, conjoined with the disappearance of the
1387: stranger, would either cause the conviction that he was really a
1388: relative, or would oblige him to the dangerous course of inventing a
1389: story to account for his disappearance, and his own absence at the same
1390: time. David groaned. There come occasions when falsehood is felt to be
1391: inconvenient. It would, perhaps, have been a longer-headed device, if
1392: he had never told any of those clever fibs about his uncles, grand and
1393: otherwise; for the Palfreys were simple people, and shared the popular
1394: prejudice against lying. Even if he could get Jacob away this time,
1395: what security was there that he would not come again, having once found
1396: the way? O guineas! O lozenges! what enviable people those were who had
1397: never robbed their mothers, and had never told fibs! David spent a
1398: sleepless night, while Jacob was snoring close by. Was this the upshot
1399: of travelling to the Indies, and acquiring experience combined with
1400: anecdote?
1401: 
1402: He rose at break of day, as he had once before done when he was in fear
1403: of Jacob, and took all gentle means to rouse this fatal brother from
1404: his deep sleep; he dared not be loud, because his apprentice was in the
1405: house, and would report everything. But Jacob was not to be roused. He
1406: fought out with his fist at the unknown cause of disturbance, turned
1407: over, and snored again. He must be left to wake as he would. David,
1408: with a cold perspiration on his brow, confessed to himself that Jacob
1409: could not be got away that day.
1410: 
1411: Mr. Palfrey came over to Grimworth before noon, with a natural
1412: curiosity to see how his future son-in-law got on with the stranger to
1413: whom he was so benevolently inclined. He found a crowd round the shop.
1414: All Grimworth by this time had heard how Freely had been fastened on by
1415: an idiot, who called him “Brother Zavy”; and the younger population
1416: seemed to find the singular stranger an unwearying source of
1417: fascination, while the householders dropped in one by one to inquire
1418: into the incident.
1419: 
1420: “Why don’t you send him to the workhouse?” said Mr. Prettyman. “You’ll
1421: have a row with him and the children presently, and he’ll eat you up.
1422: The workhouse is the proper place for him; let his kin claim him, if
1423: he’s got any.”
1424: 
1425: “Those may be _your_ feelings, Mr. Prettyman,” said David, his mind
1426: quite enfeebled by the torture of his position.
1427: 
1428: “What! _is_ he your brother, then?” said Mr. Prettyman, looking at his
1429: neighbour Freely rather sharply.
1430: 
1431: “All men are our brothers, and idiots particular so,” said Mr. Freely,
1432: who, like many other travelled men, was not master of the English
1433: language.
1434: 
1435: “Come, come, if he’s your brother, tell the truth, man,” said Mr.
1436: Prettyman, with growing suspicion. “Don’t be ashamed of your own flesh
1437: and blood.”
1438: 
1439: Mr. Palfrey was present, and also had his eye on Freely. It is
1440: difficult for a man to believe in the advantage of a truth which will
1441: disclose him to have been a liar. In this critical moment, David shrank
1442: from this immediate disgrace in the eyes of his future father-in-law.
1443: 
1444: “Mr. Prettyman,” he said, “I take your observations as an insult. I’ve
1445: no reason to be otherwise than proud of my own flesh and blood. If this
1446: poor man was my brother more than all men are, I should say so.”
1447: 
1448: A tall figure darkened the door, and David, lifting his eyes in that
1449: direction, saw his eldest brother, Jonathan, on the door-sill.
1450: 
1451: “I’ll stay wi’ Zavy,” shouted Jacob, as he, too, caught sight of his
1452: eldest brother; and, running behind the counter, he clutched David
1453: hard.
1454: 
1455: “What, he _is_ here?” said Jonathan Faux, coming forward. “My mother
1456: would have no nay, as he’d been away so long, but I must see after him.
1457: And it struck me he was very like come after you, because we’d been
1458: talking of you o’ late, and where you lived.”
1459: 
1460: David saw there was no escape; he smiled a ghastly smile.
1461: 
1462: “What! is this a relation of yours, sir?” said Mr. Palfrey to Jonathan.
1463: 
1464: “Aye, it’s my innicent of a brother, sure enough,” said honest
1465: Jonathan. “A fine trouble and cost he is to us, in th’ eating and other
1466: things, but we must bear what’s laid on us.”
1467: 
1468: “And your name’s Freely, is it?” said Mr. Prettyman.
1469: 
1470: “Nay, nay, my name’s Faux, I know nothing o’ Freelys,” said Jonathan,
1471: curtly. “Come,” he added, turning to David, “I must take some news to
1472: mother about Jacob. Shall I take him with me, or will you undertake to
1473: send him back?”
1474: 
1475: “Take him, if you can make him loose his hold of me,” said David,
1476: feebly.
1477: 
1478: “Is this gentleman here in the confectionery line your brother, then,
1479: sir?” said Mr. Prettyman, feeling that it was an occasion on which
1480: formal language must be used.
1481: 
1482: “_I_ don’t want to own him,” said Jonathan, unable to resist a movement
1483: of indignation that had never been allowed to satisfy itself. “He ran
1484: away from home with good reasons in his pocket years ago: he didn’t
1485: want to be owned again, I reckon.”
1486: 
1487: Mr. Palfrey left the shop; he felt his own pride too severely wounded
1488: by the sense that he had let himself be fooled, to feel curiosity for
1489: further details. The most pressing business was to go home and tell his
1490: daughter that Freely was a poor sneak, probably a rascal, and that her
1491: engagement was broken off.
1492: 
1493: Mr. Prettyman stayed, with some internal self-gratulation that _he_ had
1494: never given in to Freely, and that Mr. Chaloner would see now what sort
1495: of fellow it was that he had put over the heads of older parishioners.
1496: He considered it due from him (Mr. Prettyman) that, for the interests
1497: of the parish, he should know all that was to be known about this
1498: “interloper.” Grimworth would have people coming from Botany Bay to
1499: settle in it, if things went on in this way.
1500: 
1501: It soon appeared that Jacob could not be made to quit his dear brother
1502: David except by force. He understood, with a clearness equal to that of
1503: the most intelligent mind, that Jonathan would take him back to skimmed
1504: milk, apple-dumpling, broad beans, and pork. And he had found a
1505: paradise in his brother’s shop. It was a difficult matter to use force
1506: with Jacob, for he wore heavy nailed boots; and if his pitchfork had
1507: been mastered, he would have resorted without hesitation to kicks.
1508: Nothing short of using guile to bind him hand and foot would have made
1509: all parties safe.
1510: 
1511: “Let him stay,” said David, with desperate resignation, frightened
1512: above all things at the idea of further disturbances in his shop, which
1513: would make his exposure all the more conspicuous. “_You_ go away again,
1514: and to-morrow I can, perhaps, get him to go to Gilsbrook with me. He’ll
1515: follow me fast enough, I daresay,” he added, with a half-groan.
1516: 
1517: “Very well,” said Jonathan, gruffly. “I don’t see why _you_ shouldn’t
1518: have some trouble and expense with him as well as the rest of us. But
1519: mind you bring him back safe and soon, else mother’ll never rest.”
1520: 
1521: On this arrangement being concluded, Mr. Prettyman begged Mr. Jonathan
1522: Faux to go and take a snack with him, an invitation which was quite
1523: acceptable; and as honest Jonathan had nothing to be ashamed of, it is
1524: probable that he was very frank in his communications to the civil
1525: draper, who, pursuing the benefit of the parish, hastened to make all
1526: the information he could gather about Freely common parochial property.
1527: You may imagine that the meeting of the Club at the Woolpack that
1528: evening was unusually lively. Every member was anxious to prove that he
1529: had never liked Freely, as he called himself. Faux was his name, was
1530: it? Fox would have been more suitable. The majority expressed a desire
1531: to see him hooted out of the town.
1532: 
1533: Mr. Freely did not venture over his door-sill that day, for he knew
1534: Jacob would keep at his side, and there was every probability that they
1535: would have a train of juvenile followers. He sent to engage the
1536: Woolpack gig for an early hour the next morning; but this order was not
1537: kept religiously a secret by the landlord. Mr. Freely was informed that
1538: he could not have the gig till seven; and the Grimworth people were
1539: early risers. Perhaps they were more alert than usual on this
1540: particular morning; for when Jacob, with a bag of sweets in his hand,
1541: was induced to mount the gig with his brother David, the inhabitants of
1542: the market-place were looking out of their doors and windows, and at
1543: the turning of the street there was even a muster of apprentices and
1544: schoolboys, who shouted as they passed in what Jacob took to be a very
1545: merry and friendly way, nodding and grinning in return. “Huzzay, David
1546: Faux! how’s your uncle?” was their morning’s greeting. Like other
1547: pointed things, it was not altogether impromptu.
1548: 
1549: Even this public derision was not so crushing to David as the horrible
1550: thought that though he might succeed now in getting Jacob home again
1551: there would never be any security against his coming back, like a wasp
1552: to the honey-pot. As long as David lived at Grimworth, Jacob’s return
1553: would be hanging over him. But could he go on living at Grimworth—an
1554: object of ridicule, discarded by the Palfreys, after having revelled in
1555: the consciousness that he was an envied and prosperous confectioner?
1556: David liked to be envied; he minded less about being loved.
1557: 
1558: His doubts on this point were soon settled. The mind of Grimworth
1559: became obstinately set against him and his viands, and the new school
1560: being finished, the eating-room was closed. If there had been no other
1561: reason, sympathy with the Palfreys, that respectable family who had
1562: lived in the parish time out of mind, would have determined all
1563: well-to-do people to decline Freely’s goods. Besides, he had absconded
1564: with his mother’s guineas: who knew what else he had done, in Jamaica
1565: or elsewhere, before he came to Grimworth, worming himself into
1566: families under false pretences? Females shuddered. Dreadful suspicions
1567: gathered round him: his green eyes, his bow-legs had a criminal aspect.
1568: The rector disliked the sight of a man who had imposed upon him; and
1569: all boys who could not afford to purchase, hooted “David Faux” as they
1570: passed his shop. Certainly no man now would pay anything for the
1571: “goodwill” of Mr. Freely’s business, and he would be obliged to quit it
1572: without a peculium so desirable towards defraying the expense of
1573: moving.
1574: 
1575: In a few months the shop in the market-place was again to let, and Mr.
1576: David Faux, _alias_ Mr. Edward Freely, had gone—nobody at Grimworth
1577: knew whither. In this way the demoralization of Grimworth women was
1578: checked. Young Mrs. Steene renewed her efforts to make light
1579: mince-pies, and having at last made a batch so excellent that Mr.
1580: Steene looked at her with complacency as he ate them, and said they
1581: were the best he had ever eaten in his life, she thought less of
1582: bulbuls and renegades ever after. The secrets of the finer cookery were
1583: revived in the breasts of matronly house-wives, and daughters were
1584: again anxious to be initiated in them.
1585: 
1586: You will further, I hope, be glad to hear, that some purchases of
1587: drapery made by pretty Penny, in preparation for her marriage with Mr.
1588: Freely, came in quite as well for her wedding with young Towers as if
1589: they had been made expressly for the latter occasion. For Penny’s
1590: complexion had not altered, and blue always became it best.
1591: 
1592: Here ends the story of Mr. David Faux, confectioner, and his brother
1593: Jacob. And we see in it, I think, an admirable instance of the
