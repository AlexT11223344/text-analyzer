26: INTRODUCTION
27: 
28: 
29: George Eliot, or Mary Ann Evans, was born at Arbury Farm, in the parish
30: of Chilvers Coton, Warwickshire, on the 22nd of November, 1819. She was
31: the fifth and last child of her father by his second wife--of that father
32: whose sound sense and integrity she so keenly appreciated, and who was to
33: a certain extent the original of her famous characters of Adam Bede and
34: Caleb Garth.
35: 
36: Both during and after her schooldays George Eliot’s history was that of a
37: mind continually out-growing its conditions. She became an excellent
38: housewife and a devoted daughter, but her nature was too large for so
39: cramped a life. ‘You may try,’ she writes in Daniel Deronda, ‘but you can
40: never imagine what it is to have a man’s force of genius in you, and to
41: suffer the slavery of being a girl.’
42: 
43: While her powers were growing she necessarily passed through many phases.
44: She became deeply religious, and wrote poetry, pious and sweet, fair of
45: its kind. Music was a passion with her; in a characteristic letter
46: written at the age of twenty to a friend she tries but fails to describe
47: her experience on hearing the ‘Messiah’ of Birmingham: ‘With a stupid,
48: drowsy sensation, produced by standing sentinel over damson cheese and a
49: warm stove, I cannot do better than ask you to read, if accessible,
50: Wordsworth’s short poem on the “Power of Sound.”’ There you have a
51: concise history of George Eliot’s life at this period, divided as it was
52: between music, literature, and damson cheese.
53: 
54: Sixteen years of mental work and effort then lay between her and her
55: first achievement; years during which she read industriously and thought
56: more than she read. The classics, French, German, and Italian literature,
57: she laid them all under contribution. She had besides the art of
58: fortunate friendship: her mind naturally chose out the greater
59: intelligences among those she encountered; it was through a warm and
60: enduring friendship with Herbert Spencer that she met at last with George
61: Henry Lewes whose wife she became.
62: 
63: In this way she served no trifling apprenticeship. Natural genius,
64: experience of life, culture, and great companionship had joined to make
65: her what she was, a philosopher both natural and developed; and, what is
66: more rare, a philosopher with a sense of humour and a perception of the
67: dramatic. Thus when her chance came she was fully equipped to meet it.
68: 
69: It came when, at the age of thirty-six she began to write ‘Amos Barton,’
70: her first attempt at fiction, and one that fixed her career. The story
71: appeared in ‘Blackwood’s Magazine,’ and was followed by ‘Mr. Gilfil’s
72: Love Story’ and ‘Janet’s Repentance.’ Of the three, ‘Mr. Gilfil’s Love
73: Story’ is perhaps the most finished and artistic; while ‘Amos Barton’ has
74: qualities of humour and tenderness that have not often been equalled.
75: ‘Janet’s Repentance,’ strong though it is, and containing the remarkable
76: sketch of Mr. Tryan, is perhaps less surely attractive.
77: 
78: The stories, all three of them, have a particular value as records of an
79: English country life that is rapidly passing away. Moreover, it is
80: country life seen through the medium of a powerful and right-judging
81: personality. It is her intimate and thorough knowledge of big things and
82: small, of literature and damson cheese, enabling her and us to see all
83: round her characters, that provides these characters with their ample
84: background of light and shade.
85: 
86: It is well to realise that since George Eliot’s day the fashion of
87: writing, the temper of the modern mind, are quite changed; it is a
88: curious fact that the more sophisticated we become the simpler grows our
89: speech. Nowadays we talk as nearly as we may in words of one syllable.
90: Our style is stripped more and more of its Latinity. Our writers are more
91: and more in love with French methods--with the delicate clearness of
92: short phrases in which every word tells; with the rejection of all
93: intellectual ambulations round about a subject. To the fanatics of this
94: modern method the style of George Eliot appears strange, impossible. It
95: does not occur to them that her method has virtues which lack to theirs.
96: They may give us a little laboured masterpiece of art in which the vital
97: principle is wanting. George Eliot was great because she gave us passages
98: from life as it was lived in her day which will be vital so long as they
99: are sympathetically read.
100: 
101: George Eliot can be simple enough when she goes straight forward with her
102: narrative, as, for instance, in the scene of Milly Barton’s death; then
103: her English is clear and sweet for she writes from the heart. But take
104: the opening chapter of the same story, and then you find her
105: philosophical Latinity in full swing: the curious and interesting thing
106: being that this otherwise ponderous work, which is quite of a sort to
107: alarm a Frenchman, is entirely suffused by humour, and enshrines moreover
108: the most charming character studies.
109: 
110: These lively and acute portraits drawn from English country life give its
111: abiding value to George Eliot’s work. Take the character of Mr. Pilgrim
112: the doctor who ‘is never so comfortable as when relaxing his professional
113: legs in one of those excellent farmhouses where the mice are sleek and
114: the mistress sickly;’ or of Mrs. Hackit, ‘a thin woman with a chronic
115: liver complaint which would have secured her Mr. Pilgrim’s entire regard
116: and unreserved good word, even if he had not been in awe of her tongue.’
117: 
118: Or take Mrs. Patten, ‘a pretty little old woman of eighty, with a close
119: cap and tiny flat white curls round her face,’ whose function is
120: ‘quiescence in an easy-chair under the sense of compound interest
121: gradually accumulating,’ and who ‘does her malevolence gently;’ or Mr.
122: Hackit, a shrewd, substantial man, ‘who was fond of soothing the
123: acerbities of the feminine mind by a jocose compliment.’ Where but in
124: George Eliot would you get a tea-party described with such charming
125: acceptance of whim?
126: 
127: George Eliot wrote poems at various times which showed she never could
128: have won fame as a poet; but there are moments of her prose that prove
129: she shared at times the poet’s vision. Such a moment is that when the
130: half broken-hearted little Catarina looks out on a windy night landscape
131: lit by moonlight: ‘The trees are harassed by that tossing motion when
132: they would like to be at rest; the shivering grass makes her quake with
133: sympathetic cold; the willows by the pool, _bent low and white under that
134: invisible harshness_, seem agitated and helpless like herself.’ The
135: italicised sentence represents the high-water mark of George Eliot’s
136: prose; that passage alone should vindicate her imaginative power.

164: Chapter 1
165: 
166: 
167: Shepperton Church was a very different-looking building five-and-twenty
168: years ago. To be sure, its substantial stone tower looks at you through
169: its intelligent eye, the clock, with the friendly expression of former
170: days; but in everything else what changes! Now there is a wide span of
171: slated roof flanking the old steeple; the windows are tall and
172: symmetrical; the outer doors are resplendent with oak-graining, the inner
173: doors reverentially noiseless with a garment of red baize; and the walls,
174: you are convinced, no lichen will ever again effect a settlement on--they
175: are smooth and innutrient as the summit of the Rev. Amos Barton’s head,
176: after ten years of baldness and supererogatory soap. Pass through the
177: baize doors and you will see the nave filled with well-shaped benches,
178: understood to be free seats; while in certain eligible corners, less
179: directly under the fire of the clergyman’s eye, there are pews reserved
180: for the Shepperton gentility. Ample galleries are supported on iron
181: pillars, and in one of them stands the crowning glory, the very clasp or
182: aigrette of Shepperton church-adornment--namely, an organ, not very much
183: out of repair, on which a collector of small rents, differentiated by the
184: force of circumstances into an organist, will accompany the alacrity of
185: your departure after the blessing, by a sacred minuet or an easy
186: ‘Gloria’.
187: 
188: Immense improvement! says the well-regulated mind, which unintermittingly
189: rejoices in the New Police, the Tithe Commutation Act, the penny-post,
190: and all guarantees of human advancement, and has no moments when
191: conservative-reforming intellect takes a nap, while imagination does a
192: little Toryism by the sly, revelling in regret that dear, old, brown,
193: crumbling, picturesque inefficiency is everywhere giving place to
194: spick-and-span new-painted, new-varnished efficiency, which will yield
195: endless diagrams, plans, elevations, and sections, but alas! no picture.
196: Mine, I fear, is not a well-regulated mind: it has an occasional
197: tenderness for old abuses; it lingers with a certain fondness over the
198: days of nasal clerks and top-booted parsons, and has a sigh for the
199: departed shades of vulgar errors. So it is not surprising that I recall
200: with a fond sadness Shepperton Church as it was in the old days, with its
201: outer coat of rough stucco, its red-tiled roof, its heterogeneous windows
202: patched with desultory bits of painted glass, and its little flight of
203: steps with their wooden rail running up the outer wall, and leading to
204: the school-children’s gallery.
205: 
206: Then inside, what dear old quaintnesses! which I began to look at with
207: delight, even when I was so crude a member of the congregation, that my
208: nurse found it necessary to provide for the reinforcement of my
209: devotional patience by smuggling bread-and-butter into the sacred
210: edifice. There was the chancel, guarded by two little cherubims looking
211: uncomfortably squeezed between arch and wall, and adorned with the
212: escutcheons of the Oldinport family, which showed me inexhaustible
213: possibilities of meaning in their blood-red hands, their death’s-heads
214: and cross-bones, their leopards’ paws, and Maltese crosses. There were
215: inscriptions on the panels of the singing-gallery, telling of
216: benefactions to the poor of Shepperton, with an involuted elegance of
217: capitals and final flourishes, which my alphabetic erudition traced with
218: ever-new delight. No benches in those days; but huge roomy pews, round
219: which devout church-goers sat during ‘lessons’, trying to look anywhere
220: else than into each other’s eyes. No low partitions allowing you, with a
221: dreary absence of contrast and mystery, to see everything at all moments;
222: but tall dark panels, under whose shadow I sank with a sense of
223: retirement through the Litany, only to feel with more intensity my burst
224: into the conspicuousness of public life when I was made to stand up on
225: the seat during the psalms or the singing.
226: 
227: And the singing was no mechanical affair of official routine; it had
228: a drama. As the moment of psalmody approached, by some process to me
229: as mysterious and untraceable as the opening of the flowers or the
230: breaking-out of the stars, a slate appeared in front of the gallery,
231: advertising in bold characters the psalm about to be sung, lest the
232: sonorous announcement of the clerk should still leave the bucolic
233: mind in doubt on that head. Then followed the migration of the clerk
234: to the gallery, where, in company with a bassoon, two key-bugles, a
235: carpenter understood to have an amazing power of singing ‘counter’, and
236: two lesser musical stars, he formed the complement of a choir regarded
237: in Shepperton as one of distinguished attraction, occasionally known
238: to draw hearers from the next parish. The innovation of hymn-books
239: was as yet undreamed of; even the New Version was regarded with a
240: sort of melancholy tolerance, as part of the common degeneracy in a
241: time when prices had dwindled, and a cotton gown was no longer stout
242: enough to last a lifetime; for the lyrical taste of the best heads in
243: Shepperton had been formed on Sternhold and Hopkins. But the greatest
244: triumphs of the Shepperton choir were reserved for the Sundays when
245: the slate announced an ANTHEM, with a dignified abstinence from
246: particularization, both words and music lying far beyond the reach of
247: the most ambitious amateur in the congregation: an anthem in which the
248: key-bugles always ran away at a great pace, while the bassoon every now
249: and then boomed a flying shot after them.
250: 
251: As for the clergyman, Mr. Gilfil, an excellent old gentleman, who smoked
252: very long pipes and preached very short sermons, I must not speak of him,
253: or I might be tempted to tell the story of his life, which had its little
254: romance, as most lives have between the ages of teetotum and tobacco. And
255: at present I am concerned with quite another sort of clergyman--the Rev.
256: Amos Barton, who did not come to Shepperton until long after Mr. Gilfil
257: had departed this life--until after an interval in which Evangelicalism
258: and the Catholic Question had begun to agitate the rustic mind with
259: controversial debates. A Popish blacksmith had produced a strong
260: Protestant reaction by declaring that, as soon as the Emancipation Bill
261: was passed, he should do a great stroke of business in gridirons; and the
262: disinclination of the Shepperton parishioners generally to dim the unique
263: glory of St Lawrence, rendered the Church and Constitution an affair of
264: their business and bosoms. A zealous Evangelical preacher had made the
265: old sounding-board vibrate with quite a different sort of elocution from
266: Mr. Gilfil’s; the hymn-book had almost superseded the Old and New
267: Versions; and the great square pews were crowded with new faces from
268: distant corners of the parish--perhaps from Dissenting chapels.
269: 
270: You are not imagining, I hope, that Amos Barton was the incumbent of
271: Shepperton. He was no such thing. Those were days when a man could hold
272: three small livings, starve a curate a-piece on two of them, and live
273: badly himself on the third. It was so with the Vicar of Shepperton; a
274: vicar given to bricks and mortar, and thereby running into debt far away
275: in a northern county--who executed his vicarial functions towards
276: Shepperton by pocketing the sum of thirty-five pounds ten per annum, the
277: net surplus remaining to him from the proceeds of that living, after the
278: disbursement of eighty pounds as the annual stipend of his curate. And
279: now, pray, can you solve me the following problem? Given a man with a
280: wife and six children: let him be obliged always to exhibit himself when
281: outside his own door in a suit of black broadcloth, such as will not
282: undermine the foundations of the Establishment by a paltry plebeian
283: glossiness or an unseemly whiteness at the edges; in a snowy cravat,
284: which is a serious investment of labour in the hemming, starching, and
285: ironing departments; and in a hat which shows no symptom of taking to the
286: hideous doctrine of expediency, and shaping itself according to
287: circumstances; let him have a parish large enough to create an external
288: necessity for abundant shoe-leather, and an internal necessity for
289: abundant beef and mutton, as well as poor enough to require frequent
290: priestly consolation in the shape of shillings and sixpences; and,
291: lastly, let him be compelled, by his own pride and other people’s, to
292: dress his wife and children with gentility from bonnet-strings to
293: shoe-strings. By what process of division can the sum of eighty pounds
294: per annum be made to yield a quotient which will cover that man’s weekly
295: expenses? This was the problem presented by the position of the Rev. Amos
296: Barton, as curate of Shepperton, rather more than twenty years ago.
297: 
298: What was thought of this problem, and of the man who had to work it out,
299: by some of the well-to-do inhabitants of Shepperton, two years or more
300: after Mr. Barton’s arrival among them, you shall hear, if you will
301: accompany me to Cross Farm, and to the fireside of Mrs. Patten, a
302: childless old lady, who had got rich chiefly by the negative process of
303: spending nothing. Mrs. Patten’s passive accumulation of wealth, through
304: all sorts of ‘bad times’, on the farm of which she had been sole tenant
305: since her husband’s death, her epigrammatic neighbour, Mrs. Hackit,
306: sarcastically accounted for by supposing that ‘sixpences grew on the
307: bents of Cross Farm;’ while Mr. Hackit, expressing his views more
308: literally, reminded his wife that ‘money breeds money’. Mr. and Mrs.
309: Hackit, from the neighbouring farm, are Mrs. Patten’s guests this
310: evening; so is Mr. Pilgrim, the doctor from the nearest market-town, who,
311: though occasionally affecting aristocratic airs, and giving late dinners
312: with enigmatic side-dishes and poisonous port, is never so comfortable as
313: when he is relaxing his professional legs in one of those excellent
314: farmhouses where the mice are sleek and the mistress sickly. And he is at
315: this moment in clover.
316: 
317: For the flickering of Mrs. Patten’s bright fire is reflected in her
318: bright copper tea-kettle, the home-made muffins glisten with an inviting
319: succulence, and Mrs. Patten’s niece, a single lady of fifty, who has
320: refused the most ineligible offers out of devotion to her aged aunt, is
321: pouring the rich cream into the fragrant tea with a discreet liberality.
322: 
323: Reader! _did_ you ever taste such a cup of tea as Miss Gibbs is this
324: moment handing to Mr. Pilgrim? Do you know the dulcet strength, the
325: animating blandness of tea sufficiently blended with real farmhouse
326: cream? No--most likely you are a miserable town-bred reader, who think of
327: cream as a thinnish white fluid, delivered in infinitesimal pennyworths
328: down area steps; or perhaps, from a presentiment of calves’ brains, you
329: refrain from any lacteal addition, and rasp your tongue with unmitigated
330: bohea. You have a vague idea of a milch cow as probably a white-plaster
331: animal standing in a butterman’s window, and you know nothing of the
332: sweet history of genuine cream, such as Miss Gibbs’s: how it was this
333: morning in the udders of the large sleek beasts, as they stood lowing a
334: patient entreaty under the milking-shed; how it fell with a pleasant
335: rhythm into Betty’s pail, sending a delicious incense into the cool air;
336: how it was carried into that temple of moist cleanliness, the dairy,
337: where it quietly separated itself from the meaner elements of milk, and
338: lay in mellowed whiteness, ready for the skimming-dish which transferred
339: it to Miss Gibbs’s glass cream-jug. If I am right in my conjecture, you
340: are unacquainted with the highest possibilities of tea; and Mr. Pilgrim,
341: who is holding that cup in his hands, has an idea beyond you.
342: 
343: Mrs. Hackit declines cream; she has so long abstained from it with an eye
344: to the weekly butter-money, that abstinence, wedded to habit, has
345: begotten aversion. She is a thin woman with a chronic liver-complaint,
346: which would have secured her Mr. Pilgrim’s entire regard and unreserved
347: good word, even if he had not been in awe of her tongue, which was as
348: sharp as his own lancet. She has brought her knitting--no frivolous fancy
349: knitting, but a substantial woollen stocking; the click-click of her
350: knitting-needles is the running accompaniment to all her conversation,
351: and in her utmost enjoyment of spoiling a friend’s self-satisfaction, she
352: was never known to spoil a stocking. Mrs. Patten does not admire this
353: excessive click-clicking activity. Quiescence in an easy-chair, under the
354: sense of compound interest perpetually accumulating, has long seemed an
355: ample function to her, and she does her malevolence gently. She is a
356: pretty little old woman of eighty, with a close cap and tiny flat white
357: curls round her face, as natty and unsoiled and invariable as the waxen
358: image of a little old lady under a glass-case; once a lady’s-maid, and
359: married for her beauty. She used to adore her husband, and now she adores
360: her money, cherishing a quiet blood-relation’s hatred for her niece,
361: Janet Gibbs, who, she knows, expects a large legacy, and whom she is
362: determined to disappoint. Her money shall all go in a lump to a distant
363: relation of her husband’s, and Janet shall be saved the trouble of
364: pretending to cry, by finding that she is left with a miserable pittance.
365: 
366: Mrs. Patten has more respect for her neighbour Mr. Hackit than for most
367: people. Mr. Hackit is a shrewd substantial man, whose advice about crops
368: is always worth listening to, and who is too well off to want to borrow
369: money.
370: 
371: And now that we are snug and warm with this little tea-party, while it is
372: freezing with February bitterness outside, we will listen to what they
373: are talking about.
374: 
375: ‘So,’ said Mr. Pilgrim, with his mouth only half empty of muffin, ‘you
376: had a row in Shepperton Church last Sunday. I was at Jim Hood’s, the
377: bassoon-man’s, this morning, attending his wife, and he swears he’ll be
378: revenged on the parson--a confounded, methodistical, meddlesome chap, who
379: must be putting his finger in every pie. What was it all about?’
380: 
381: ‘O, a passill o’ nonsense,’ said Mr. Hackit, sticking one thumb between
382: the buttons of his capacious waistcoat, and retaining a pinch of snuff
383: with the other--for he was but moderately given to ‘the cups that cheer
384: but not inebriate’, and had already finished his tea; ‘they began to sing
385: the wedding psalm for a new-married couple, as pretty a psalm an’ as
386: pretty a tune as any in the prayer-book. It’s been sung for every
387: new-married couple since I was a boy. And what can be better?’ Here Mr.
388: Hackit stretched out his left arm, threw back his head, and broke into
389: melody--
390: 
391:      ‘O what a happy thing it is,
392:        And joyful for to see,
393:      Brethren to dwell together in
394:        Friendship and unity.
395: 
396: But Mr. Barton is all for th’ hymns, and a sort o’ music as I can’t join
397: in at all.’
398: 
399: ‘And so,’ said Mr. Pilgrim, recalling Mr. Hackit from lyrical
400: reminiscences to narrative, ‘he called out Silence! did he? when he got
401: into the pulpit; and gave a hymn out himself to some meeting-house tune?’
402: 
403: ‘Yes,’ said Mrs. Hackit, stooping towards the candle to pick up a stitch,
404: ‘and turned as red as a turkey-cock. I often say, when he preaches about
405: meekness, he gives himself a slap in the face. He’s like me--he’s got a
406: temper of his own.’
407: 
408: ‘Rather a low-bred fellow, I think, Barton,’ said Mr. Pilgrim, who hated
409: the Reverend Amos for two reasons--because he had called in a new doctor,
410: recently settled in Shepperton; and because, being himself a dabbler in
411: drugs, he had the credit of having cured a patient of Mr. Pilgrim’s.
412: ‘They say his father was a Dissenting shoemaker; and he’s half a
413: Dissenter himself. Why, doesn’t he preach extempore in that cottage up
414: here, of a Sunday evening?’
415: 
416: ‘Tchuh!’--this was Mr. Hackit’s favourite interjection--‘that preaching
417: without book’s no good, only when a man has a gift, and has the Bible at
418: his fingers’ ends. It was all very well for Parry--he’d a gift; and in my
419: youth I’ve heard the Ranters out o’ doors in Yorkshire go on for an hour
420: or two on end, without ever sticking fast a minute. There was one clever
421: chap, I remember, as used to say, “You’re like the woodpigeon; it says
422: do, do, do all day, and never sets about any work itself.” That’s
423: bringing it home to people. But our parson’s no gift at all that way; he
424: can preach as good a sermon as need be heard when he writes it down. But
425: when he tries to preach wi’out book, he rambles about, and doesn’t stick
426: to his text; and every now and then he flounders about like a sheep as
427: has cast itself, and can’t get on’ts legs again. You wouldn’t like that,
428: Mrs. Patten, if you was to go to church now?’
429: 
430: ‘Eh, dear,’ said Mrs. Patten, falling back in her chair, and lifting up
431: her little withered hands, ‘what ’ud Mr. Gilfil say, if he was worthy to
432: know the changes as have come about i’ the Church these last ten years? I
433: don’t understand these new sort o’ doctrines. When Mr. Barton comes to
434: see me, he talks about nothing but my sins and my need o’ marcy. Now, Mr.
435: Hackit, I’ve never been a sinner. From the fust beginning, when I went
436: into service, I al’ys did my duty by my emplyers. I was a good wife as
437: any in the county--never aggravated my husband. The cheese-factor used to
438: say my cheese was al’ys to be depended on. I’ve known women, as their
439: cheeses swelled a shame to be seen, when their husbands had counted on
440: the cheese-money to make up their rent; and yet they’d three gowns to my
441: one. If I’m not to be saved, I know a many as are in a bad way. But it’s
442: well for me as I can’t go to church any longer, for if th’ old singers
443: are to be done away with, there’ll be nothing left as it was in Mr.
444: Patten’s time; and what’s more, I hear you’ve settled to pull the church
445: down and build it up new?’
446: 
447: Now the fact was that the Rev. Amos Barton, on his last visit to Mrs.
448: Patten, had urged her to enlarge her promised subscription of twenty
449: pounds, representing to her that she was only a steward of her riches,
450: and that she could not spend them more for the glory of God than by
451: giving a heavy subscription towards the rebuilding of Shepperton
452: Church--a practical precept which was not likely to smooth the way to her
453: acceptance of his theological doctrine. Mr. Hackit, who had more
454: doctrinal enlightenment than Mrs. Patten, had been a little shocked by
455: the heathenism of her speech, and was glad of the new turn given to the
456: subject by this question, addressed to him as churchwarden and an
457: authority in all parochial matters.
458: 
459: ‘Ah,’ he answered, ‘the parson’s bothered us into it at last, and we’re
460: to begin pulling down this spring. But we haven’t got money enough yet. I
461: was for waiting till we’d made up the sum, and, for my part, I think the
462: congregation’s fell off o’ late; though Mr. Barton says that’s because
463: there’s been no room for the people when they’ve come. You see, the
464: congregation got so large in Parry’s time, the people stood in the
465: aisles; but there’s never any crowd now, as I can see.’
466: 
467: ‘Well,’ said Mrs. Hackit, whose good-nature began to act now that it was
468: a little in contradiction with the dominant tone of the conversation,
469: ‘_I_ like Mr. Barton. I think he’s a good sort o’ man, for all he’s not
470: overburthen’d i’ th’ upper storey; and his wife’s as nice a lady-like
471: woman as I’d wish to see. How nice she keeps her children! and little
472: enough money to do’t with; and a delicate creatur’--six children, and
473: another a-coming. I don’t know how they make both ends meet, I’m sure,
474: now her aunt has left ’em. But I sent ’em a cheese and a sack o’ potatoes
475: last week; that’s something towards filling the little mouths.’
476: 
477: ‘Ah!’ said Mr. Hackit, ‘and my wife makes Mr. Barton a good stiff glass
478: o’ brandy-and-water, when he comes into supper after his cottage
479: preaching. The parson likes it; it puts a bit o’ colour into ’is face,
480: and makes him look a deal handsomer.’
481: 
482: This allusion to brandy-and-water suggested to Miss Gibbs the
483: introduction of the liquor decanters, now that the tea was cleared away;
484: for in bucolic society five-and-twenty years ago, the human animal of the
485: male sex was understood to be perpetually athirst, and ‘something to
486: drink’ was as necessary a ‘condition of thought’ as Time and Space.
487: 
488: ‘Now, that cottage preaching,’ said Mr. Pilgrim, mixing himself a strong
489: glass of ‘cold without,’ ‘I was talking about it to our Parson Ely the
490: other day, and he doesn’t approve of it at all. He said it did as much
491: harm as good to give a too familiar aspect to religious teaching. That
492: was what Ely said--it does as much harm as good to give a too familiar
493: aspect to religious teaching.’
494: 
495: Mr. Pilgrim generally spoke with an intermittent kind of splutter;
496: indeed, one of his patients had observed that it was a pity such a clever
497: man had a ‘pediment’ in his speech. But when he came to what he conceived
498: the pith of his argument or the point of his joke, he mouthed out his
499: words with slow emphasis; as a hen, when advertising her accouchement,
500: passes at irregular intervals from pianissimo semiquavers to fortissimo
501: crotchets. He thought this speech of Mr. Ely’s particularly metaphysical
502: and profound, and the more decisive of the question because it was a
503: generality which represented no particulars to his mind.
504: 
505: ‘Well, I don’t know about that,’ said Mrs. Hackit, who had always the
506: courage of her opinion, ‘but I know, some of our labourers and
507: stockingers as used never to come to church, come to the cottage, and
508: that’s better than never hearing anything good from week’s end to week’s
509: end. And there’s that Track Society as Mr. Barton has begun--I’ve seen
510: more o’ the poor people with going tracking, than all the time I’ve lived
511: in the parish before. And there’d need be something done among ’em; for
512: the drinking at them Benefit Clubs is shameful. There’s hardly a steady
513: man or steady woman either, but what’s a dissenter.’
514: 
515: During this speech of Mrs. Hackit’s, Mr. Pilgrim had emitted a succession
516: of little snorts, something like the treble grunts of a guinea-pig, which
517: were always with him the sign of suppressed disapproval. But he never
518: contradicted Mrs. Hackit--a woman whose ‘pot-luck’ was always to be
519: relied on, and who on her side had unlimited reliance on bleeding,
520: blistering, and draughts.
521: 
522: Mrs. Patten, however, felt equal disapprobation, and had no reasons for
523: suppressing it.
524: 
525: ‘Well,’ she remarked, ‘I’ve heared of no good from interfering with one’s
526: neighbours, poor or rich. And I hate the sight o’ women going about
527: trapesing from house to house in all weathers, wet or dry, and coming in
528: with their petticoats dagged and their shoes all over mud. Janet wanted
529: to join in the tracking, but I told her I’d have nobody tracking out o’
530: my house; when I’m gone, she may do as she likes. I never dagged my
531: petticoats in _my_ life, and I’ve no opinion o’ that sort o’ religion.’
532: 
533: ‘No,’ said Mr. Hackit, who was fond of soothing the acerbities of the
534: feminine mind with a jocose compliment, ‘you held your petticoats so
535: high, to show your tight ankles: it isn’t everybody as likes to show her
536: ankles.’
537: 
538: This joke met with general acceptance, even from the snubbed Janet, whose
539: ankles were only tight in the sense of looking extremely squeezed by her
540: boots. But Janet seemed always to identify herself with her aunt’s
541: personality, holding her own under protest.
542: 
543: Under cover of the general laughter the gentlemen replenished their
544: glasses, Mr. Pilgrim attempting to give his the character of a
545: stirrup-cup by observing that he ‘must be going’. Miss Gibbs seized this
546: opportunity of telling Mrs. Hackit that she suspected Betty, the
547: dairymaid, of frying the best bacon for the shepherd, when he sat up with
548: her to ‘help brew’; whereupon Mrs. Hackit replied that she had always
549: thought Betty false; and Mrs. Patten said there was no bacon stolen when
550: _she_ was able to manage. Mr. Hackit, who often complained that he ‘never
551: saw the like to women with their maids--he never had any trouble with his
552: men’, avoided listening to this discussion, by raising the question of
553: vetches with Mr. Pilgrim. The stream of conversation had thus diverged:
554: and no more was said about the Rev. Amos Barton, who is the main object
555: of interest to us just now. So we may leave Cross Farm without waiting
556: till Mrs. Hackit, resolutely donning her clogs and wrappings, renders it
557: incumbent on Mr. Pilgrim also to fulfil his frequent threat of going.
558: 
559: 
560: 
561: 
562: Chapter 2
563: 
564: 
565: It was happy for the Rev. Amos Barton that he did not, like us, overhear
566: the conversation recorded in the last chapter. Indeed, what mortal is
567: there of us, who would find his satisfaction enhanced by an opportunity
568: of comparing the picture he presents to himself of his own doings, with
569: the picture they make on the mental retina of his neighbours? We are poor
570: plants buoyed up by the air-vessels of our own conceit: alas for us, if
571: we get a few pinches that empty us of that windy self-subsistence! The
572: very capacity for good would go out of us. For, tell the most impassioned
573: orator, suddenly, that his wig is awry, or his shirt-lap hanging out, and
574: that he is tickling people by the oddity of his person, instead of
575: thrilling them by the energy of his periods, and you would infallibly dry
576: up the spring of his eloquence. That is a deep and wide saying, that no
577: miracle can be wrought without faith--without the worker’s faith in
578: himself, as well as the recipient’s faith in him. And the greater part of
579: the worker’s faith in himself is made up of the faith that others believe
580: in him.
581: 
582: Let me be persuaded that my neighbour Jenkins considers me a blockhead,
583: and I shall never shine in conversation with him any more. Let me
584: discover that the lovely Phœbe thinks my squint intolerable, and I shall
585: never be able to fix her blandly with my disengaged eye again. Thank
586: heaven, then, that a little illusion is left to us, to enable us to be
587: useful and agreeable--that we don’t know exactly what our friends think
588: of us--that the world is not made of looking-glass, to show us just the
589: figure we are making, and just what is going on behind our backs! By the
590: help of dear friendly illusion, we are able to dream that we are charming
591: and our faces wear a becoming air of self-possession; we are able to
592: dream that other men admire our talents--and our benignity is
593: undisturbed; we are able to dream that we are doing much good--and we do
594: a little. Thus it was with Amos Barton on that very Thursday evening,
595: when he was the subject of the conversation at Cross Farm. He had been
596: dining at Mr. Farquhar’s, the secondary squire of the parish, and,
597: stimulated by unwonted gravies and port-wine, had been delivering his
598: opinion on affairs parochial and otherwise with considerable animation.
599: And he was now returning home in the moonlight--a little chill, it is
600: true, for he had just now no greatcoat compatible with clerical dignity,
601: and a fur boa round one’s neck, with a waterproof cape over one’s
602: shoulders, doesn’t frighten away the cold from one’s legs; but entirely
603: unsuspicious, not only of Mr. Hackit’s estimate of his oratorical powers,
604: but also of the critical remarks passed on him by the Misses Farquhar as
605: soon as the drawing-room door had closed behind him. Miss Julia had
606: observed that she _never_ heard any one sniff so frightfully as Mr.
607: Barton did--she had a great mind to offer him her pocket-handkerchief;
608: and Miss Arabella wondered why he always said he was going _for_ to do a
609: thing. He, excellent man! was meditating fresh pastoral exertions on the
610: morrow; he would set on foot his lending library; in which he had
611: introduced some books that would be a pretty sharp blow to the
612: Dissenters--one especially, purporting to be written by a working man
613: who, out of pure zeal for the welfare of his class, took the trouble to
614: warn them in this way against those hypocritical thieves, the Dissenting
615: preachers. The Rev. Amos Barton profoundly believed in the existence of
616: that working man, and had thoughts of writing to him. Dissent, he
617: considered, would have its head bruised in Shepperton, for did he not
618: attack it in two ways? He preached Low-Church doctrine--as evangelical as
619: anything to be heard in the Independent Chapel; and he made a High-Church
620: assertion of ecclesiastical powers and functions. Clearly, the Dissenters
621: would feel that ‘the parson’ was too many for them. Nothing like a man
622: who combines shrewdness with energy. The wisdom of the serpent, Mr.
623: Barton considered, was one of his strong points.
624: 
625: Look at him as he winds through the little churchyard! The silver light
626: that falls aslant on church and tomb, enables you to see his slim black
627: figure, made all the slimmer by tight pantaloons, as it flits past the
628: pale gravestones. He walks with a quick step, and is now rapping with
629: sharp decision at the vicarage door. It is opened without delay by the
630: nurse, cook, and housemaid, all at once--that is to say, by the robust
631: maid-of-all-work, Nanny; and as Mr. Barton hangs up his hat in the
632: passage, you see that a narrow face of no particular complexion--even the
633: small-pox that has attacked it seems to have been of a mongrel,
634: indefinite kind--with features of no particular shape, and an eye of no
635: particular expression is surmounted by a slope of baldness gently rising
636: from brow to crown. You judge him, rightly, to be about forty. The house
637: is quiet, for it is half-past ten, and the children have long been gone
638: to bed. He opens the sitting-room door, but instead of seeing his wife,
639: as he expected, stitching with the nimblest of fingers by the light of
640: one candle, he finds her dispensing with the light of a candle
641: altogether. She is softly pacing up and down by the red firelight,
642: holding in her arms little Walter, the year-old baby, who looks over her
643: shoulder with large wide-open eyes, while the patient mother pats his
644: back with her soft hand, and glances with a sigh at the heap of large and
645: small stockings lying unmended on the table.
646: 
647: She was a lovely woman--Mrs. Amos Barton, a large, fair, gentle Madonna,
648: with thick, close, chestnut curls beside her well-rounded cheeks, and
649: with large, tender, short-sighted eyes. The flowing lines of her tall
650: figure made the limpest dress look graceful, and her old frayed black
651: silk seemed to repose on her bust and limbs with a placid elegance and
652: sense of distinction, in strong contrast with the uneasy sense of being
653: no fit, that seemed to express itself in the rustling of Mrs. Farquhar’s
654: _gros de Naples_. The caps she wore would have been pronounced, when off
655: her head, utterly heavy and hideous--for in those days even fashionable
656: caps were large and floppy; but surmounting her long arched neck, and
657: mingling their borders of cheap lace and ribbon with her chestnut curls,
658: they seemed miracles of successful millinery. Among strangers she was shy
659: and tremulous as a girl of fifteen; she blushed crimson if any one
660: appealed to her opinion; yet that tall, graceful, substantial presence
661: was so imposing in its mildness, that men spoke to her with an agreeable
662: sensation of timidity.
663: 
664: Soothing, unspeakable charm of gentle womanhood! which supersedes all
665: acquisitions, all accomplishments. You would never have asked, at any
666: period of Mrs. Amos Barton’s life, if she sketched or played the piano.
667: You would even perhaps have been rather scandalized if she had descended
668: from the serene dignity of _being_ to the assiduous unrest of _doing_.
669: Happy the man, you would have thought, whose eye will rest on her in the
670: pauses of his fireside reading--whose hot aching forehead will be soothed
671: by the contact of her cool soft hand--who will recover himself from
672: dejection at his mistakes and failures in the loving light of her
673: unreproaching eyes! You would not, perhaps, have anticipated that this
674: bliss would fall to the share of precisely such a man as Amos Barton,
675: whom you have already surmised not to have the refined sensibilities for
676: which you might have imagined Mrs. Barton’s qualities to be destined by
677: pre-established harmony. But I, for one, do not grudge Amos Barton this
678: sweet wife. I have all my life had a sympathy for mongrel ungainly dogs,
679: who are nobody’s pets; and I would rather surprise one of them by a pat
680: and a pleasant morsel, than meet the condescending advances of the
681: loveliest Skye-terrier who has his cushion by my lady’s chair. That, to
682: be sure, is not the way of the world: if it happens to see a fellow of
683: fine proportions and aristocratic mien, who makes no _faux pas_, and wins
684: golden opinions from all sorts of men, it straightway picks out for him
685: the loveliest of unmarried women, and says, _There_ would be a proper
686: match! Not at all, say I: let that successful, well-shapen, discreet and
687: able gentleman put up with something less than the best in the
688: matrimonial department; and let the sweet woman go to make sunshine and a
689: soft pillow for the poor devil whose legs are not models, whose efforts
690: are often blunders, and who in general gets more kicks than halfpence.
691: She--the sweet woman--will like it as well; for her sublime capacity of
692: loving will have all the more scope; and I venture to say, Mrs. Barton’s
693: nature would never have grown half so angelic if she had married the man
694: you would perhaps have had in your eye for her--a man with sufficient
695: income and abundant personal _éclat_. Besides, Amos was an affectionate
696: husband, and, in his way, valued his wife as his best treasure.
697: 
698: But now he has shut the door behind him, and said, ‘Well, Milly!’
699: 
700: ‘Well, dear!’ was the corresponding greeting, made eloquent by a smile.
701: 
702: ‘So that young rascal won’t go to sleep! Can’t you give him to Nanny?’
703: 
704: ‘Why, Nanny has been busy ironing this evening; but I think I’ll take him
705: to her now.’ And Mrs. Barton glided towards the kitchen, while her
706: husband ran up-stairs to put on his maize-coloured dressing-gown, in
707: which costume he was quietly filling his long pipe when his wife returned
708: to the sitting-room. Maize is a colour that decidedly did _not_ suit his
709: complexion, and it is one that soon soils; why, then, did Mr. Barton
710: select it for domestic wear? Perhaps because he had a knack of hitting on
711: the wrong thing in garb as well as in grammar.
712: 
713: Mrs. Barton now lighted her candle, and seated herself before her heap of
714: stockings. She had something disagreeable to tell her husband, but she
715: would not enter on it at once. ‘Have you had a nice evening, dear?’
716: 
717: ‘Yes, pretty well. Ely was there to dinner, but went away rather early.
718: Miss Arabella is setting her cap at him with a vengeance. But I don’t
719: think he’s much smitten. I’ve a notion Ely’s engaged to some one at a
720: distance, and will astonish all the ladies who are languishing for him
721: here, by bringing home his bride one of these days. Ely’s a sly dog;
722: he’ll like that.’
723: 
724: ‘Did the Farquhars say anything about the singing last Sunday?’
725: 
726: ‘Yes; Farquhar said he thought it was time there was some improvement in
727: the choir. But he was rather scandalized at my setting the tune of
728: “Lydia.” He says he’s always hearing it as he passes the Independent
729: meeting.’ Here Mr. Barton laughed--he had a way of laughing at criticisms
730: that other people thought damaging--and thereby showed the remainder of a
731: set of teeth which, like the remnants of the Old Guard, were few in
732: number, and very much the worse for wear. ‘But,’ he continued, ‘Mrs.
733: Farquhar talked the most about Mr. Bridmain and the Countess. She has
734: taken up all the gossip about them, and wanted to convert me to her
735: opinion, but I told her pretty strongly what I thought.’
736: 
737: ‘Dear me! why will people take so much pains to find out evil about
738: others? I have had a note from the Countess since you went, asking us to
739: dine with them on Friday.’
740: 
741: Here Mrs. Barton reached the note from the mantelpiece, and gave it to
742: her husband. We will look over his shoulder while he reads it:--
743: 
744: ‘SWEETEST MILLY,--Bring your lovely face with your husband to dine with us
745: on Friday at seven--do. If not, I will be sulky with you till Sunday,
746: when I shall be obliged to see you, and shall long to kiss you that very
747: moment. Yours, according to your answer,
748: 
749: ‘CAROLINE CZERLASKI.
750: 
751: ‘Just like her, isn’t it?’ said Mrs. Barton. ‘I suppose we can go?’
752: 
753: ‘Yes; I have no engagement. The Clerical Meeting is to-morrow, you know.’
754: 
755: ‘And, dear, Woods the butcher called, to say he must have some money next
756: week. He has a payment to make up.’
757: 
758: This announcement made Mr. Barton thoughtful. He puffed more rapidly, and
759: looked at the fire.
760: 
761: ‘I think I must ask Hackit to lend me twenty pounds, for it is nearly two
762: months till Lady-day, and we can’t give Woods our last shilling.’
763: 
764: ‘I hardly like you to ask Mr. Hackit, dear--he and Mrs. Hackit have been
765: so very kind to us; they have sent us so many things lately.’
766: 
767: ‘Then I must ask Oldinport. I’m going to write to him to-morrow morning,
768: for to tell him the arrangement I’ve been thinking of about having
769: service in the workhouse while the church is being enlarged. If he agrees
770: to attend service there once or twice, the other people will come. Net
771: the large fish, and you’re sure to have the small fry.’
772: 
773: ‘I wish we could do without borrowing money, and yet I don’t see how we
774: can. Poor Fred must have some new shoes; I couldn’t let him go to Mrs.
775: Bond’s yesterday because his toes were peeping out, dear child! and I
776: can’t let him walk anywhere except in the garden. He must have a pair
777: before Sunday. Really, boots and shoes are the greatest trouble of my
778: life. Everything else one can turn and turn about, and make old look like
779: new; but there’s no coaxing boots and shoes to look better than they
780: are.’
781: 
782: Mrs. Barton was playfully undervaluing her skill in metamorphosing boots
783: and shoes. She had at that moment on her feet a pair of slippers which
784: had long ago lived through the prunella phase of their existence, and
785: were now running a respectable career as black silk slippers, having been
786: neatly covered with that material by Mrs. Barton’s own neat fingers.
787: Wonderful fingers those! they were never empty; for if she went to spend
788: a few hours with a friendly parishioner, out came her thimble and a piece
789: of calico or muslin, which, before she left, had become a mysterious
790: little garment with all sorts of hemmed ins and outs. She was even trying
791: to persuade her husband to leave off tight pantaloons, because if he
792: would wear the ordinary gun-cases, she knew she could make them so well
793: that no one would suspect the sex of the tailor.
794: 
795: But by this time Mr. Barton has finished his pipe, the candle begins to
796: burn low, and Mrs. Barton goes to see if Nanny has succeeded in lulling
797: Walter to sleep. Nanny is that moment putting him in the little cot by
798: his mother’s bedside; the head, with its thin wavelets of brown hair,
799: indents the little pillow; and a tiny, waxen, dimpled fist hides the rosy
800: lips, for baby is given to the infantile peccadillo of thumb-sucking.
801: 
802: So Nanny could now join in the short evening prayer, and all could go
803: to bed.
804: 
805: Mrs. Barton carried up-stairs the remainder of her heap of
806: stockings, and laid them on a table close to her bedside, where also she
807: placed a warm shawl, removing her candle, before she put it out, to a tin
808: socket fixed at the head of her bed. Her body was very weary, but her
809: heart was not heavy, in spite of Mr. Woods the butcher, and the
810: transitory nature of shoe-leather; for her heart so overflowed with love,
811: she felt sure she was near a fountain of love that would care for husband
812: and babes better than she could foresee; so she was soon asleep. But
813: about half-past five o’clock in the morning, if there were any angels
814: watching round her bed--and angels might be glad of such an office--they
815: saw Mrs. Barton rise up quietly, careful not to disturb the slumbering
816: Amos, who was snoring the snore of the just, light her candle, prop
817: herself upright with the pillows, throw the warm shawl round her
818: shoulders, and renew her attack on the heap of undarned stockings. She
819: darned away until she heard Nanny stirring, and then drowsiness came with
820: the dawn; the candle was put out, and she sank into a doze. But at nine
821: o’clock she was at the breakfast-table, busy cutting bread-and-butter for
822: five hungry mouths, while Nanny, baby on one arm, in rosy cheeks, fat
823: neck, and night-gown, brought in a jug of hot milk-and-water. Nearest her
824: mother sits the nine-year-old Patty, the eldest child, whose sweet fair
825: face is already rather grave sometimes, and who always wants to run
826: up-stairs to save mamma’s legs, which get so tired of an evening. Then
827: there are four other blond heads--two boys and two girls, gradually
828: decreasing in size down to Chubby, who is making a round O of her mouth
829: to receive a bit of papa’s ‘baton’. Papa’s attention was divided between
830: petting Chubby, rebuking the noisy Fred, which he did with a somewhat
831: excessive sharpness, and eating his own breakfast. He had not yet looked
832: at Mamma, and did not know that her cheek was paler than usual. But Patty
833: whispered, ‘Mamma, have you the headache?’
834: 
835: Happily coal was cheap in the neighbourhood of Shepperton, and Mr. Hackit
836: would any time let his horses draw a load for ‘the parson’ without
837: charge; so there was a blazing fire in the sitting-room, and not without
838: need, for the vicarage garden, as they looked out on it from the
839: bow-window, was hard with black frost, and the sky had the white woolly
840: look that portends snow.
841: 
842: Breakfast over, Mr. Barton mounted to his study, and occupied himself in
843: the first place with his letter to Mr. Oldinport. It was very much the
844: same sort of letter as most clergymen would have written under the same
845: circumstances, except that instead of perambulate, the Rev. Amos wrote
846: preambulate, and instead of ‘if haply’, ‘if happily’, the contingency
847: indicated being the reverse of happy. Mr. Barton had not the gift of
848: perfect accuracy in English orthography and syntax, which was
849: unfortunate, as he was known not to be a Hebrew scholar, and not in the
850: least suspected of being an accomplished Grecian. These lapses, in a man
851: who had gone through the Eleusinian mysteries of a university education,
852: surprised the young ladies of his parish extremely; especially the Misses
853: Farquhar, whom he had once addressed in a letter as Dear Mads.,
854: apparently an abbreviation for Madams. The persons least surprised at the
855: Rev. Amos’s deficiencies were his clerical brethren, who had gone through
856: the mysteries themselves.
857: 
858: At eleven o’clock, Mr. Barton walked forth in cape and boa, with the
859: sleet driving in his face, to read prayers at the workhouse,
860: euphemistically called the ‘College’. The College was a huge square stone
861: building, standing on the best apology for an elevation of ground that
862: could be seen for about ten miles around Shepperton. A flat ugly district
863: this; depressing enough to look at even on the brightest days. The roads
864: are black with coal-dust, the brick houses dingy with smoke; and at that
865: time--the time of handloom weavers--every other cottage had a loom at its
866: window, where you might see a pale, sickly-looking man or woman pressing
867: a narrow chest against a board, and doing a sort of treadmill work with
868: legs and arms. A troublesome district for a clergyman; at least to one
869: who, like Amos Barton, understood the ‘cure of souls’ in something more
870: than an official sense; for over and above the rustic stupidity furnished
871: by the farm-labourers, the miners brought obstreperous animalism, and the
872: weavers an acrid Radicalism and Dissent. Indeed, Mrs. Hackit often
873: observed that the colliers, who many of them earned better wages than Mr.
874: Barton, ‘passed their time in doing nothing but swilling ale and smoking,
875: like the beasts that perish’ (speaking, we may presume, in a remotely
876: analogical sense); and in some of the alehouse corners the drink was
877: flavoured by a dingy kind of infidelity, something like rinsings of Tom
878: Paine in ditch-water. A certain amount of religious excitement created by
879: the popular preaching of Mr. Parry, Amos’s predecessor, had nearly died
880: out, and the religious life of Shepperton was falling back towards
881: low-water mark. Here, you perceive, was a terrible stronghold of Satan;
882: and you may well pity the Rev. Amos Barton, who had to stand
883: single-handed and summon it to surrender. We read, indeed, that the walls
884: of Jericho fell down before the sound of trumpets; but we nowhere hear
885: that those trumpets were hoarse and feeble. Doubtless they were trumpets
886: that gave forth clear ringing tones, and sent a mighty vibration through
887: brick and mortar. But the oratory of the Rev. Amos resembled rather a
888: Belgian railway-horn, which shows praiseworthy intentions inadequately
889: fulfilled. He often missed the right note both in public and private
890: exhortation, and got a little angry in consequence. For though Amos
891: thought himself strong, he did not _feel_ himself strong. Nature had
892: given him the opinion, but not the sensation. Without that opinion he
893: would probably never have worn cambric bands, but would have been an
894: excellent cabinetmaker and deacon of an Independent church, as his father
895: was before him (he was not a shoemaker, as Mr. Pilgrim had reported). He
896: might then have sniffed long and loud in the corner of his pew in Gun
897: Street Chapel; he might have indulged in halting rhetoric at
898: prayer-meetings, and have spoken faulty English in private life; and
899: these little infirmities would not have prevented him, honest faithful
900: man that he was, from being a shining light in the dissenting circle of
901: Bridgeport. A tallow dip, of the long-eight description, is an excellent
902: thing in the kitchen candlestick, and Betty’s nose and eye are not
903: sensitive to the difference between it and the finest wax; it is only
904: when you stick it in the silver candlestick, and introduce it into the
905: drawing-room, that it seems plebeian, dim, and ineffectual. Alas for the
906: worthy man who, like that candle, gets himself into the wrong place! It
907: is only the very largest souls who will be able to appreciate and pity
908: him--who will discern and love sincerity of purpose amid all the bungling
909: feebleness of achievement.
910: 
911: But now Amos Barton has made his way through the sleet as far as the
912: College, has thrown off his hat, cape, and boa, and is reading, in the
913: dreary stone-floored dining-room, a portion of the morning service to the
914: inmates seated on the benches before him. Remember, the New Poor-law had
915: not yet come into operation, and Mr. Barton was not acting as paid
916: chaplain of the Union, but as the pastor who had the cure of all souls in
917: his parish, pauper as well as other. After the prayers he always
918: addressed to them a short discourse on some subject suggested by the
919: lesson for the day, striving if by this means some edifying matter might
920: find its way into the pauper mind and conscience--perhaps a task as
921: trying as you could well imagine to the faith and patience of any honest
922: clergyman. For, on the very first bench, these were the faces on which
923: his eye had to rest, watching whether there was any stirring under the
924: stagnant surface.
925: 
926: Right in front of him--probably because he was stone-deaf, and it was
927: deemed more edifying to hear nothing at a short distance than at a long
928: one--sat ‘Old Maxum’, as he was familiarly called, his real patronymic
929: remaining a mystery to most persons. A fine philological sense discerns
930: in this cognomen an indication that the pauper patriarch had once been
931: considered pithy and sententious in his speech; but now the weight of
932: ninety-five years lay heavy on his tongue as well as in his ears, and he
933: sat before the clergyman with protruded chin, and munching mouth, and
934: eyes that seemed to look at emptiness.
935: 
936: Next to him sat Poll Fodge--known to the magistracy of her county as Mary
937: Higgins--a one-eyed woman, with a scarred and seamy face, the most
938: notorious rebel in the workhouse, said to have once thrown her broth over
939: the master’s coat-tails, and who, in spite of nature’s apparent
940: safeguards against that contingency, had contributed to the perpetuation
941: of the Fodge characteristics in the person of a small boy, who was
942: behaving naughtily on one of the back benches. Miss Fodge fixed her one
943: sore eye on Mr. Barton with a sort of hardy defiance.
944: 
945: Beyond this member of the softer sex, at the end of the bench, sat ‘Silly
946: Jim’, a young man afflicted with hydrocephalus, who rolled his head from
947: side to side, and gazed at the point of his nose. These were the
948: supporters of Old Maxum on his right.
949: 
950: On his left sat Mr. Fitchett, a tall fellow, who had once been a footman
951: in the Oldinport family, and in that giddy elevation had enunciated a
952: contemptuous opinion of boiled beef, which had been traditionally handed
953: down in Shepperton as the direct cause of his ultimate reduction to
954: pauper commons. His calves were now shrunken, and his hair was grey
955: without the aid of powder; but he still carried his chin as if he were
956: conscious of a stiff cravat; he set his dilapidated hat on with a knowing
957: inclination towards the left ear; and when he was on field-work, he
958: carted and uncarted the manure with a sort of flunkey grace, the ghost of
959: that jaunty demeanour with which he used to usher in my lady’s morning
960: visitors. The flunkey nature was nowhere completely subdued but in his
961: stomach, and he still divided society into gentry, gentry’s flunkeys, and
962: the people who provided for them. A clergyman without a flunkey was an
963: anomaly, belonging to neither of these classes. Mr. Fitchett had an
964: irrepressible tendency to drowsiness under spiritual instruction, and in
965: the recurrent regularity with which he dozed off until he nodded and
966: awaked himself, he looked not unlike a piece of mechanism, ingeniously
967: contrived for measuring the length of Mr. Barton’s discourse.
968: 
969: Perfectly wide-awake, on the contrary, was his left-hand neighbour, Mrs.
970: Brick, one of those hard undying old women, to whom age seems to have
971: given a network of wrinkles, as a coat of magic armour against the
972: attacks of winters, warm or cold. The point on which Mrs. Brick was still
973: sensitive--the theme on which you might possibly excite her hope and
974: fear--was snuff. It seemed to be an embalming powder, helping her soul to
975: do the office of salt.
976: 
977: And now, eke out an audience of which this front benchful was a sample,
978: with a certain number of refractory children, over whom Mr. Spratt, the
979: master of the workhouse, exercised an irate surveillance, and I think you
980: will admit that the university-taught clergyman, whose office it is to
981: bring home the gospel to a handful of such souls, has a sufficiently hard
982: task. For, to have any chance of success, short of miraculous
983: intervention, he must bring his geographical, chronological, exegetical
984: mind pretty nearly to the pauper point of view, or of no view; he must
985: have some approximate conception of the mode in which the doctrines that
986: have so much vitality in the plenum of his own brain will comport
987: themselves _in vacuo_--that is to say, in a brain that is neither
988: geographical, chronological, nor exegetical. It is a flexible imagination
989: that can take such a leap as that, and an adroit tongue that can adapt
990: its speech to so unfamiliar a position. The Rev. Amos Barton had neither
991: that flexible imagination, nor that adroit tongue. He talked of Israel
992: and its sins, of chosen vessels, of the Paschal lamb, of blood as a
993: medium of reconciliation; and he strove in this way to convey religious
994: truth within reach of the Fodge and Fitchett mind. This very morning, the
995: first lesson was the twelfth chapter of Exodus, and Mr. Barton’s
996: exposition turned on unleavened bread. Nothing in the world more suited
997: to the simple understanding than instruction through familiar types and
998: symbols! But there is always this danger attending it, that the interest
999: or comprehension of your hearers may stop short precisely at the point
1000: where your spiritual interpretation begins. And Mr. Barton this morning
1001: succeeded in carrying the pauper imagination to the dough-tub, but
1002: unfortunately was not able to carry it upwards from that well-known
1003: object to the unknown truths which it was intended to shadow forth.
1004: 
1005: Alas! a natural incapacity for teaching, finished by keeping ‘terms’ at
1006: Cambridge, where there are able mathematicians, and butter is sold by the
1007: yard, is not apparently the medium through which Christian doctrine will
1008: distil as welcome dew on withered souls.
1009: 
1010: And so, while the sleet outside was turning to unquestionable snow, and
1011: the stony dining-room looked darker and drearier, and Mr. Fitchett was
1012: nodding his lowest, and Mr. Spratt was boxing the boys’ ears with a
1013: constant _rinforzando_, as he felt more keenly the approach of
1014: dinner-time, Mr. Barton wound up his exhortation with something of the
1015: February chill at his heart as well as his feet. Mr. Fitchett, thoroughly
1016: roused now the instruction was at an end, obsequiously and gracefully
1017: advanced to help Mr. Barton in putting on his cape, while Mrs. Brick
1018: rubbed her withered forefinger round and round her little shoe-shaped
1019: snuff-box, vainly seeking for the fraction of a pinch. I can’t help
1020: thinking that if Mr. Barton had shaken into that little box a small
1021: portion of Scotch high-dried, he might have produced something more like
1022: an amiable emotion in Mrs. Brick’s mind than anything she had felt under
1023: his morning’s exposition of the unleavened bread. But our good Amos
1024: laboured under a deficiency of small tact as well as of small cash; and
1025: when he observed the action of the old woman’s forefinger, he said, in
1026: his brusque way, ‘So your snuff is all gone, eh?’
1027: 
1028: Mrs. Brick’s eyes twinkled with the visionary hope that the parson might
1029: be intending to replenish her box, at least mediately, through the
1030: present of a small copper.
1031: 
1032: ‘Ah, well! you’ll soon be going where there is no more snuff. You’ll be
1033: in need of mercy then. You must remember that you may have to seek for
1034: mercy and not find it, just as you’re seeking for snuff.’
1035: 
1036: At the first sentence of this admonition, the twinkle subsided from Mrs.
1037: Brick’s eyes. The lid of her box went ‘click!’ and her heart was shut up
1038: at the same moment.
1039: 
1040: But now Mr. Barton’s attention was called for by Mr. Spratt, who was
1041: dragging a small and unwilling boy from the rear. Mr. Spratt was a
1042: small-featured, small-statured man, with a remarkable power of language,
1043: mitigated by hesitation, who piqued himself on expressing unexceptionable
1044: sentiments in unexceptional language on all occasions.
1045: 
1046: ‘Mr. Barton, sir--aw--aw--excuse my trespassing on your time--aw--to beg
1047: that you will administer a rebuke to this boy; he is--aw--aw--most
1048: inveterate in ill-behaviour during service-time.’
1049: 
1050: The inveterate culprit was a boy of seven, vainly contending against
1051: ‘candles’ at his nose by feeble sniffing. But no sooner had Mr. Spratt
1052: uttered his impeachment, than Miss Fodge rushed forward and placed
1053: herself between Mr. Barton and the accused.
1054: 
1055: ‘That’s _my_ child, Muster Barton,’ she exclaimed, further manifesting
1056: her maternal instincts by applying her apron to her offspring’s nose.
1057: ‘He’s al’ys a-findin’ faut wi’ him, and a-poundin’ him for nothin’. Let
1058: him goo an’ eat his roost goose as is a-smellin’ up in our noses while
1059: we’re a-swallering them greasy broth, an’ let my boy alooan.’
1060: 
1061: Mr. Spratt’s small eyes flashed, and he was in danger of uttering
1062: sentiments not unexceptionable before the clergyman; but Mr. Barton,
1063: foreseeing that a prolongation of this episode would not be to
1064: edification, said ‘Silence!’ in his severest tones.
1065: 
1066: ‘Let me hear no abuse. Your boy is not likely to behave well, if you set
1067: him the example of being saucy.’ Then stooping down to Master Fodge, and
1068: taking him by the shoulder, ‘Do you like being beaten?’
1069: 
1070: ‘No-a.’
1071: 
1072: ‘Then what a silly boy you are to be naughty. If you were not naughty,
1073: you wouldn’t be beaten. But if you are naughty, God will be angry, as
1074: well as Mr. Spratt; and God can burn you for ever. That will be worse
1075: than being beaten.’
1076: 
1077: Master Fodge’s countenance was neither affirmative nor negative of this
1078: proposition.
1079: 
1080: ‘But,’ continued Mr. Barton, ‘if you will be a good boy, God will love
1081: you, and you will grow up to be a good man. Now, let me hear next
1082: Thursday that you have been a good boy.’
1083: 
1084: Master Fodge had no distinct vision of the benefit that would accrue to
1085: him from this change of courses. But Mr. Barton, being aware that Miss
1086: Fodge had touched on a delicate subject in alluding to the roast goose,
1087: was determined to witness no more polemics between her and Mr. Spratt,
1088: so, saying good morning to the latter, he hastily left the College.
1089: 
1090: The snow was falling in thicker and thicker flakes, and already the
1091: vicarage-garden was cloaked in white as he passed through the gate. Mrs.
1092: Barton heard him open the door, and ran out of the sitting-room to meet
1093: him.
1094: 
1095: ‘I’m afraid your feet are very wet, dear. What a terrible morning! Let me
1096: take your hat. Your slippers are at the fire.’
1097: 
1098: Mr. Barton was feeling a little cold and cross. It is difficult, when you
1099: have been doing disagreeable duties, without praise, on a snowy day, to
1100: attend to the very minor morals. So he showed no recognition of Milly’s
1101: attentions, but simply said, ‘Fetch me my dressing-gown, will you?’
1102: 
1103: ‘It is down, dear. I thought you wouldn’t go into the study, because you
1104: said you would letter and number the books for the Lending Library. Patty
1105: and I have been covering them, and they are all ready in the
1106: sitting-room.’
1107: 
1108: ‘Oh, I can’t do those this morning,’ said Mr. Barton, as he took off his
1109: boots and put his feet into the slippers Milly had brought him; ‘you must
1110: put them away into the parlour.’
1111: 
1112: The sitting-room was also the day nursery and schoolroom; and while
1113: Mamma’s back was turned, Dickey, the second boy, had insisted on
1114: superseding Chubby in the guidance of a headless horse, of the
1115: red-wafered species, which she was drawing round the room, so that when
1116: Papa opened the door Chubby was giving tongue energetically.
1117: 
1118: ‘Milly, some of these children must go away. I want to be quiet.’
1119: 
1120: ‘Yes, dear. Hush, Chubby; go with Patty, and see what Nanny is getting
1121: for our dinner. Now, Fred and Sophy and Dickey, help me to carry these
1122: books into the parlour. There are three for Dickey. Carry them steadily.’
1123: 
1124: Papa meanwhile settled himself in his easy-chair, and took up a work on
1125: Episcopacy, which he had from the Clerical Book Society; thinking he
1126: would finish it and return it this afternoon, as he was going to the
1127: Clerical Meeting at Milby Vicarage, where the Book Society had its
1128: headquarters.
1129: 
1130: The Clerical Meetings and Book Society, which had been founded some eight
1131: or ten months, had had a noticeable effect on the Rev. Amos Barton. When
1132: he first came to Shepperton he was simply an evangelical clergyman, whose
1133: Christian experiences had commenced under the teaching of the Rev. Mr.
1134: Johns, of Gun Street Chapel, and had been consolidated at Cambridge under
1135: the influence of Mr. Simeon. John Newton and Thomas Scott were his
1136: doctrinal ideals; he would have taken in the “Christian Observer” and the
1137: “Record,” if he could have afforded it; his anecdotes were chiefly of the
1138: pious-jocose kind, current in dissenting circles; and he thought an
1139: Episcopalian Establishment unobjectionable.
1140: 
1141: But by this time the effect of the Tractarian agitation was beginning to
1142: be felt in backward provincial regions, and the Tractarian satire on the
1143: Low-Church party was beginning to tell even on those who disavowed or
1144: resisted Tractarian doctrines. The vibration of an intellectual movement
1145: was felt from the golden head to the miry toes of the Establishment; and
1146: so it came to pass that, in the district round Milby, the market-town
1147: close to Shepperton, the clergy had agreed to have a clerical meeting
1148: every month, wherein they would exercise their intellects by discussing
1149: theological and ecclesiastical questions, and cement their brotherly love
1150: by discussing a good dinner. A Book Society naturally suggested itself as
1151: an adjunct of this agreeable plan; and thus, you perceive, there was
1152: provision made for ample friction of the clerical mind.
1153: 
1154: Now, the Rev. Amos Barton was one of those men who have a decided will
1155: and opinion of their own; he held himself bolt upright, and had no
1156: self-distrust. He would march very determinedly along the road he thought
1157: best; but then it was wonderfully easy to convince him which was the best
1158: road. And so a very little unwonted reading and unwonted discussion made
1159: him see that an Episcopalian Establishment was much more than
1160: unobjectionable, and on many other points he began to feel that he held
1161: opinions a little too far-sighted and profound to be crudely and suddenly
1162: communicated to ordinary minds. He was like an onion that has been rubbed
1163: with spices; the strong original odour was blended with something new and
1164: foreign. The Low-Church onion still offended refined High Church
1165: nostrils, and the new spice was unwelcome to the palate of the genuine
1166: onion-eater.
1167: 
1168: We will not accompany him to the Clerical Meeting to-day, because we shall
1169: probably want to go thither some day when he will be absent. And just now
1170: I am bent on introducing you to Mr. Bridmain and the Countess Czerlaski,
1171: with whom Mr. and Mrs. Barton are invited to dine to-morrow.
1172: 
1173: 
1174: 
1175: 
1176: Chapter 3
1177: 
1178: 
1179: Outside, the moon is shedding its cold light on the cold snow, and the
1180: white-bearded fir-trees round Camp Villa are casting a blue shadow across
1181: the white ground, while the Rev. Amos Barton and his wife are audibly
1182: crushing the crisp snow beneath their feet, as, about seven o’clock on
1183: Friday evening, they approach the door of the above-named desirable
1184: country residence, containing dining, breakfast, and drawing rooms, etc.,
1185: situated only half a mile from the market-town of Milby.
1186: 
1187: Inside, there is a bright fire in the drawing-room, casting a pleasant
1188: but uncertain light on the delicate silk dress of a lady who is reclining
1189: behind a screen in the corner of the sofa, and allowing you to discern
1190: that the hair of the gentleman who is seated in the arm-chair opposite,
1191: with a newspaper over his knees, is becoming decidedly grey. A little
1192: ‘King Charles’, with a crimson ribbon round his neck, who has been lying
1193: curled up in the very middle of the hearth-rug, has just discovered that
1194: that zone is too hot for him, and is jumping on the sofa, evidently with
1195: the intention of accommodating his person on the silk gown. On the table
1196: there are two wax-candles, which will be lighted as soon as the expected
1197: knock is heard at the door.
1198: 
1199: The knock is heard, the candles are lighted, and presently Mr. and Mrs.
1200: Barton are ushered in--Mr. Barton erect and clerical, in a faultless tie
1201: and shining cranium; Mrs. Barton graceful in a newly-turned black silk.
1202: 
1203: ‘Now this is charming of you,’ said the Countess Czerlaski, advancing to
1204: meet them, and embracing Milly with careful elegance. ‘I am really
1205: ashamed of my selfishness in asking my friends to come and see me in this
1206: frightful weather.’ Then, giving her hand to Amos, ‘And you, Mr. Barton,
1207: whose time is so precious! But I am doing a good deed in drawing you away
1208: from your labours. I have a plot to prevent you from martyrizing
1209: yourself.’
1210: 
1211: While this greeting was going forward, Mr. Bridmain, and Jet the spaniel,
1212: looked on with the air of actors who had no idea of by-play. Mr.
1213: Bridmain, a stiff and rather thick-set man, gave his welcome with a
1214: laboured cordiality. It was astonishing how very little he resembled his
1215: beautiful sister.
1216: 
1217: For the Countess Czerlaski was undeniably beautiful. As she seated
1218: herself by Mrs. Barton on the sofa, Milly’s eyes, indeed, rested--must it
1219: be confessed?--chiefly on the details of the tasteful dress, the rich
1220: silk of a pinkish lilac hue (the Countess always wore delicate colours in
1221: an evening), the black lace pelerine, and the black lace veil falling at
1222: the back of the small closely-braided head. For Milly had one
1223: weakness--don’t love her any the less for it, it was a pretty woman’s
1224: weakness--she was fond of dress; and often, when she was making up her
1225: own economical millinery, she had romantic visions how nice it would be
1226: to put on really handsome stylish things--to have very stiff balloon
1227: sleeves, for example, without which a woman’s dress was nought in those
1228: days. You and I, too, reader, have our weakness, have we not? which makes
1229: us think foolish things now and then. Perhaps it may lie in an excessive
1230: admiration for small hands and feet, a tall lithe figure, large dark
1231: eyes, and dark silken braided hair. All these the Countess possessed, and
1232: she had, moreover, a delicately-formed nose, the least bit curved, and a
1233: clear brunette complexion. Her mouth it must be admitted, receded too
1234: much from her nose and chin and to a prophetic eye threatened
1235: ‘nut-crackers’ in advanced age. But by the light of fire and wax candles
1236: that age seemed very far off indeed, and you would have said that the
1237: Countess was not more than thirty.
1238: 
1239: Look at the two women on the sofa together! The large, fair, mild-eyed
1240: Milly is timid even in friendship: it is not easy to her to speak of the
1241: affection of which her heart is full. The lithe, dark, thin-lipped
1242: Countess is racking her small brain for caressing words and charming
1243: exaggerations.
1244: 
1245: ‘And how are all the cherubs at home?’ said the Countess, stooping to
1246: pick up Jet, and without waiting for an answer. ‘I have been kept
1247: in-doors by a cold ever since Sunday, or I should not have rested without
1248: seeing you. What have you done with those wretched singers, Mr. Barton?’
1249: 
1250: ‘O, we have got a new choir together, which will go on very well with a
1251: little practice. I was quite determined that the old set of singers
1252: should be dismissed. I had given orders that they should not sing the
1253: wedding psalm, as they call it, again, to make a new-married couple look
1254: ridiculous, and they sang it in defiance of me. I could put them into the
1255: Ecclesiastical Court, if I chose for to do so, for lifting up their
1256: voices in church in opposition to the clergyman.’
1257: 
1258: ‘And a most wholesome discipline that would be,’ said the Countess,
1259: ‘indeed, you are too patient and forbearing, Mr. Barton. For my part, _I_
1260: lose _my_ temper when I see how far you are from being appreciated in
1261: that miserable Shepperton.’
1262: 
1263: If, as is probable, Mr. Barton felt at a loss what to say in reply to the
1264: insinuated compliment, it was a relief to him that dinner was announced
1265: just then, and that he had to offer his arm to the Countess.
1266: 
1267: As Mr. Bridmain was leading Mrs. Barton to the dining-room, he observed,
1268: ‘The weather is very severe.’
1269: 
1270: ‘Very, indeed,’ said Milly.
1271: 
1272: Mr. Bridmain studied conversation as an art. To ladies he spoke of the
1273: weather, and was accustomed to consider it under three points of view: as
1274: a question of climate in general, comparing England with other countries
1275: in this respect; as a personal question, inquiring how it affected his
1276: lady interlocutor in particular; and as a question of probabilities,
1277: discussing whether there would be a change or a continuance of the
1278: present atmospheric conditions. To gentlemen he talked politics, and he
1279: read two daily papers expressly to qualify himself for this function. Mr.
1280: Barton thought him a man of considerable political information, but not
1281: of lively parts.
1282: 
1283: ‘And so you are always to hold your Clerical Meetings at Mr. Ely’s?’ said
1284: the Countess, between her spoonfuls of soup. (The soup was a little
1285: over-spiced. Mrs. Short of Camp Villa, who was in the habit of letting
1286: her best apartments, gave only moderate wages to her cook.)
1287: 
1288: ‘Yes,’ said Mr. Barton; ‘Milby is a central place, and there are many
1289: conveniences in having only one point of meeting.’
1290: 
1291: ‘Well,’ continued the Countess, ‘every one seems to agree in giving the
1292: precedence to Mr. Ely. For my part, I _cannot_ admire him. His preaching
1293: is too cold for me. It has no fervour--no heart. I often say to my
1294: brother, it is a great comfort to me that Shepperton Church is not too
1295: far off for us to go to; don’t I, Edmund?’
1296: 
1297: ‘Yes,’ answered Mr. Bridmain; ‘they show us into such a bad pew at
1298: Milby--just where there is a draught from that door. I caught a stiff
1299: neck the first time I went there.’
1300: 
1301: ‘O, it is the cold in the pulpit that affects me, not the cold in the
1302: pew. I was writing to my friend Lady Porter this morning, and telling her
1303: all about my feelings. She and I think alike on such matters. She is most
1304: anxious that when Sir William has an opportunity of giving away the
1305: living at their place, Dippley, they should have a thoroughly zealous
1306: clever man there. I have been describing a certain friend of mine to her,
1307: who, I think, would be just to her mind. And there is such a pretty
1308: rectory, Milly; shouldn’t I like to see you the mistress of it?’
1309: 
1310: Milly smiled and blushed slightly. The Rev. Amos blushed very red, and
1311: gave a little embarrassed laugh--he could rarely keep his muscles within
1312: the limits of a smile. At this moment John, the man-servant, approached
1313: Mrs. Barton with a gravy-tureen, and also with a slight odour of the
1314: stable, which usually adhered to him through his in-door functions. John
1315: was rather nervous; and the Countess happening to speak to him at this
1316: inopportune moment, the tureen slipped and emptied itself on Mrs.
1317: Barton’s newly-turned black silk.
1318: 
1319: ‘O, horror! Tell Alice to come directly and rub Mrs. Barton’s dress,’
1320: said the Countess to the trembling John, carefully abstaining from
1321: approaching the gravy-sprinkled spot on the floor with her own lilac
1322: silk. But Mr. Bridmain, who had a strictly private interest in silks,
1323: good-naturedly jumped up and applied his napkin at once to Mrs. Barton’s
1324: gown.
1325: 
1326: Milly felt a little inward anguish, but no ill-temper, and tried to make
1327: light of the matter for the sake of John as well as others. The Countess
1328: felt inwardly thankful that her own delicate silk had escaped, but threw
1329: out lavish interjections of distress and indignation.
1330: 
1331: ‘Dear saint that you are,’ she said, when Milly laughed, and suggested
1332: that, as her silk was not very glossy to begin with, the dim patch would
1333: not be much seen; ‘you don’t mind about these things, I know. Just the
1334: same sort of thing happened to me at the Princess Wengstein’s one day, on
1335: a pink satin. I was in an agony. But you are so indifferent to dress; and
1336: well you may be. It is you who make dress pretty, and not dress that
1337: makes you pretty.’
1338: 
1339: Alice, the buxom lady’s-maid, wearing a much better dress than Mrs.
1340: Barton’s, now appeared to take Mr. Bridmain’s place in retrieving the
1341: mischief, and after a great amount of supplementary rubbing, composure
1342: was restored, and the business of dining was continued. When John was
1343: recounting his accident to the cook in the kitchen, he observed, ‘Mrs.
1344: Barton’s a hamable woman; I’d a deal sooner ha’ throwed the gravy o’er
1345: the Countess’s fine gownd. But laws! what tantrums she’d ha’ been in
1346: arter the visitors was gone.’
1347: 
1348: ‘You’d a deal sooner not ha’ throwed it down at all, _I_ should think,’
1349: responded the unsympathetic cook, to whom John did _not_ make love. ‘Who
1350: d’you think’s to mek gravy anuff, if you’re to baste people’s gownds wi’
1351: it?’
1352: 
1353: ‘Well,’ suggested John, humbly, ‘you should wet the bottom of the _duree_
1354: a bit, to hold it from slippin’.’
1355: 
1356: ‘Wet your granny!’ returned the cook; a retort which she probably
1357: regarded in the light of a _reductio ad absurdum_, and which in fact
1358: reduced John to silence.
1359: 
1360: Later on in the evening, while John was removing the tea things from the
1361: drawing-room, and brushing the crumbs from the table-cloth with an
1362: accompanying hiss, such as he was wont to encourage himself with in
1363: rubbing down Mr. Bridmain’s horse, the Rev. Amos Barton drew from his
1364: pocket a thin green-covered pamphlet, and, presenting it to the Countess,
1365: said,--‘You were pleased, I think, with my sermon on Christmas Day. It
1366: has been printed in “The Pulpit,” and I thought you might like a copy.’
1367: 
1368: ‘That indeed I shall. I shall quite value the opportunity of reading that
1369: sermon. There was such depth in it!--such argument! It was not a sermon
1370: to be heard only once. I am delighted that it should become generally
1371: known, as it will be now it is printed in “The Pulpit.”’
1372: 
1373: ‘Yes,’ said Milly, innocently, ‘I was so pleased with the editor’s
1374: letter.’ And she drew out her little pocket-book, where she carefully
1375: treasured the editorial autograph, while Mr. Barton laughed and blushed,
1376: and said, ‘Nonsense, Milly!’
1377: 
1378: ‘You see,’ she said, giving the letter to the Countess, ‘I am very proud
1379: of the praise my husband gets.’
1380: 
1381: The sermon in question, by the by, was an extremely argumentative one on
1382: the Incarnation; which, as it was preached to a congregation not one of
1383: whom had any doubt of that doctrine, and to whom the Socinians therein
1384: confuted were as unknown as the Arimaspians, was exceedingly well adapted
1385: to trouble and confuse the Sheppertonian mind.
1386: 
1387: ‘Ah,’ said the Countess, returning the editor’s letter, ‘he may well say
1388: he will be glad of other sermons from the same source. But I would rather
1389: you should publish your sermons in an independent volume, Mr. Barton; it
1390: would be so desirable to have them in that shape. For instance, I could
1391: send a copy to the Dean of Radborough. And there is Lord Blarney, whom I
1392: knew before he was chancellor. I was a special favourite of his, and you
1393: can’t think what sweet things he used to say to me. I shall not resist
1394: the temptation to write to him one of these days _sans façon_, and tell
1395: him how he ought to dispose of the next vacant living in his gift.’
1396: 
1397: Whether Jet the spaniel, being a much more knowing dog than was
1398: suspected, wished to express his disapproval of the Countess’s last
1399: speech, as not accordant with his ideas of wisdom and veracity, I cannot
1400: say; but at this moment he jumped off her lap, and, turning his back upon
1401: her, placed one paw on the fender, and held the other up to warm, as if
1402: affecting to abstract himself from the current of conversation.
1403: 
1404: But now Mr. Bridmain brought out the chess-board, and Mr. Barton accepted
1405: his challenge to play a game, with immense satisfaction. The Rev. Amos
1406: was very fond of chess, as most people are who can continue through many
1407: years to create interesting vicissitudes in the game, by taking
1408: long-meditated moves with their knights, and subsequently discovering
1409: that they have thereby exposed their queen.
1410: 
1411: Chess is a silent game; and the Countess’s chat with Milly is in quite an
1412: under-tone--probably relating to women’s matters that it would be
1413: impertinent for us to listen to; so we will leave Camp Villa, and proceed
1414: to Milby Vicarage, where Mr. Farquhar has sat out two other guests with
1415: whom he has been dining at Mr. Ely’s, and is now rather wearying that
1416: reverend gentleman by his protracted small-talk.
1417: 
1418: Mr. Ely was a tall, dark-haired, distinguished-looking man of
1419: three-and-thirty. By the laity of Milby and its neighbourhood he was
1420: regarded as a man of quite remarkable powers and learning, who must make
1421: a considerable sensation in London pulpits and drawing-rooms on his
1422: occasional visit to the metropolis; and by his brother clergy he was
1423: regarded as a discreet and agreeable fellow. Mr. Ely never got into a
1424: warm discussion; he suggested what might be thought, but rarely said what
1425: he thought himself; he never let either men or women see that he was
1426: laughing at them, and he never gave any one an opportunity of laughing at
1427: _him_. In one thing only he was injudicious. He parted his dark wavy hair
1428: down the middle; and as his head was rather flat than otherwise, that
1429: style of coiffure was not advantageous to him.
1430: 
1431: Mr. Farquhar, though not a parishioner of Mr. Ely’s, was one of his
1432: warmest admirers, and thought he would make an unexceptionable
1433: son-in-law, in spite of his being of no particular ‘family’. Mr. Farquhar
1434: was susceptible on the point of ‘blood’--his own circulating fluid, which
1435: animated a short and somewhat flabby person, being, he considered, of
1436: very superior quality.
1437: 
1438: ‘By the by,’ he said, with a certain pomposity counteracted by a lisp,
1439: ‘what an ath Barton makth of himthelf, about that Bridmain and the
1440: Counteth, ath she callth herthelf. After you were gone the other evening,
1441: Mithith Farquhar wath telling him the general opinion about them in the
1442: neighbourhood, and he got quite red and angry. Bleth your thoul, he
1443: believth the whole thtory about her Polish huthband and hith wonderful
1444: ethcapeth; and ath for her--why, he thinkth her perfection, a woman of
1445: motht refined feelingth, and no end of thtuff.’
1446: 
1447: Mr. Ely smiled. ‘Some people would say our friend Barton was not the best
1448: judge of refinement. Perhaps the lady flatters him a little, and we men
1449: are susceptible. She goes to Shepperton Church every Sunday--drawn there,
1450: let us suppose, by Mr. Barton’s eloquence.’
1451: 
1452: ‘Pshaw,’ said Mr. Farquhar: ‘Now, to my mind, you have only to look at
1453: that woman to thee what she ith--throwing her eyth about when she comth
1454: into church, and drething in a way to attract attention. I should thay,
1455: she’th tired of her brother Bridmain, and looking out for another brother
1456: with a thtronger family likeneth. Mithith Farquhar ith very fond of
1457: Mithith Barton, and ith quite dithtrethed that she should athothiate with
1458: thuch a woman, tho she attacked him on the thubject purpothly. But I tell
1459: her it’th of no uthe, with a pig-headed fellow like him. Barton’th
1460: well-meaning enough, but _tho_ contheited. I’ve left off giving him my
1461: advithe.’
1462: 
1463: Mr. Ely smiled inwardly and said to himself, ‘What a punishment!’ But to
1464: Mr. Farquhar he said, ‘Barton might be more judicious, it must be
1465: confessed.’ He was getting tired, and did not want to develop the
1466: subject.
1467: 
1468: ‘Why, nobody vithit-th them but the Bartonth,’ continued Mr. Farquhar,
1469: ‘and why should thuch people come here, unleth they had particular
1470: reathonth for preferring a neighbourhood where they are not known? Pooh!
1471: it lookth bad on the very fathe of it. _You_ called on them, now; how did
1472: you find them?’
1473: 
1474: ‘O!--Mr. Bridmain strikes me as a common sort of man, who is making an
1475: effort to seem wise and well-bred. He comes down on one tremendously with
1476: political information, and seems knowing about the king of the French.
1477: The Countess is certainly a handsome woman, but she puts on the grand air
1478: a little too powerfully. Woodcock was immensely taken with her, and
1479: insisted on his wife’s calling on her and asking her to dinner; but I
1480: think Mrs. Woodcock turned restive after the first visit, and wouldn’t
1481: invite her again.’
1482: 
1483: ‘Ha, ha! Woodcock hath alwayth a thoft place in hith heart for a pretty
1484: fathe. It’th odd how he came to marry that plain woman, and no fortune
1485: either.’
1486: 
1487: ‘Mysteries of the tender passion,’ said Mr. Ely. ‘I am not initiated yet,
1488: you know.’
1489: 
1490: Here Mr. Farquhar’s carriage was announced, and as we have not found his
1491: conversation particularly brilliant under the stimulus of Mr. Ely’s
1492: exceptional presence, we will not accompany him home to the less exciting
1493: atmosphere of domestic life.
1494: 
1495: Mr. Ely threw himself with a sense of relief into his easiest chair, set
1496: his feet on the hobs, and in this attitude of bachelor enjoyment began to
1497: read Bishop Jebb’s Memoirs.
1498: 
1499: 
1500: 
1501: 
1502: Chapter 4
1503: 
1504: 
1505: I am by no means sure that if the good people of Milby had known the
1506: truth about the Countess Czerlaski, they would not have been considerably
1507: disappointed to find that it was very far from being as bad as they
1508: imagined. Nice distinctions are troublesome. It is so much easier to say
1509: that a thing is black, than to discriminate the particular shade of
1510: brown, blue, or green, to which it really belongs. It is so much easier
1511: to make up your mind that your neighbour is good for nothing, than to
1512: enter into all the circumstances that would oblige you to modify that
1513: opinion.
1514: 
1515: Besides, think of all the virtuous declamation, all the penetrating
1516: observation, which had been built up entirely on the fundamental position
1517: that the Countess was a very objectionable person indeed, and which would
1518: be utterly overturned and nullified by the destruction of that premiss.
1519: Mrs. Phipps, the banker’s wife, and Mrs. Landor, the attorney’s wife, had
1520: invested part of their reputation for acuteness in the supposition that
1521: Mr. Bridmain was not the Countess’s brother. Moreover, Miss Phipps was
1522: conscious that if the Countess was not a disreputable person, she, Miss
1523: Phipps, had no compensating superiority in virtue to set against the
1524: other lady’s manifest superiority in personal charms. Miss Phipps’s
1525: stumpy figure and unsuccessful attire, instead of looking down from a
1526: mount of virtue with an aureole round its head, would then be seen on the
1527: same level and in the same light as the Countess Czerlaski’s Diana-like
1528: form and well-chosen drapery. Miss Phipps, for her part, didn’t like
1529: dressing for effect--she had always avoided that style of appearance
1530: which was calculated to create a sensation.
1531: 
1532: Then what amusing innuendoes of the Milby gentlemen over their wine would
1533: have been entirely frustrated and reduced to nought, if you had told them
1534: that the Countess had really been guilty of no misdemeanours which
1535: demanded her exclusion from strictly respectable society; that her
1536: husband had been the veritable Count Czerlaski, who had had wonderful
1537: escapes, as she said, and who, as she did _not_ say, but as was said in
1538: certain circulars once folded by her fair hands, had subsequently given
1539: dancing lessons in the metropolis; that Mr. Bridmain was neither more nor
1540: less than her half-brother, who, by unimpeached integrity and industry,
1541: had won a partnership in a silk-manufactory, and thereby a moderate
1542: fortune, that enabled him to retire, as you see, to study politics, the
1543: weather, and the art of conversation at his leisure. Mr. Bridmain, in
1544: fact, quadragenarian bachelor as he was, felt extremely well pleased to
1545: receive his sister in her widowhood, and to shine in the reflected light
1546: of her beauty and title. Every man who is not a monster, a mathematician,
1547: or a mad philosopher, is the slave of some woman or other. Mr. Bridmain
1548: had put his neck under the yoke of his handsome sister, and though his
1549: soul was a very little one--of the smallest description indeed--he would
1550: not have ventured to call it his own. He might be slightly recalcitrant
1551: now and then, as is the habit of long-eared pachyderms, under the thong
1552: of the fair Countess’s tongue; but there seemed little probability that
1553: he would ever get his neck loose. Still, a bachelor’s heart is an
1554: outlying fortress that some fair enemy may any day take either by storm
1555: or stratagem; and there was always the possibility that Mr. Bridmain’s
1556: first nuptials might occur before the Countess was quite sure of her
1557: second. As it was, however, he submitted to all his sister’s caprices,
1558: never grumbled because her dress and her maid formed a considerable item
1559: beyond her own little income of sixty pounds per annum, and consented to
1560: lead with her a migratory life, as personages on the debatable ground
1561: between aristocracy and commonalty, instead of settling in some spot
1562: where his five hundred a-year might have won him the definite dignity of
1563: a parochial magnate.
1564: 
1565: The Countess had her views in choosing a quiet provincial place like
1566: Milby. After three years of widowhood, she had brought her feelings to
1567: contemplate giving a successor to her lamented Czerlaski, whose fine
1568: whiskers, fine air, and romantic fortunes had won her heart ten years
1569: ago, when, as pretty Caroline Bridmain, in the full bloom of
1570: five-and-twenty, she was governess to Lady Porter’s daughters, whom he
1571: initiated into the mysteries of the _pas de basque_, and the lancers’
1572: quadrilles. She had had seven years of sufficiently happy matrimony with
1573: Czerlaski, who had taken her to Paris and Germany, and introduced her
1574: there to many of his old friends with large titles and small fortunes. So
1575: that the fair Caroline had had considerable experience of life, and had
1576: gathered therefrom, not, indeed, any very ripe and comprehensive wisdom,
1577: but much external polish, and certain practical conclusions of a very
1578: decided kind. One of these conclusions was, that there were things more
1579: solid in life than fine whiskers and a title, and that, in accepting a
1580: second husband, she would regard these items as quite subordinate to a
1581: carriage and a settlement. Now, she had ascertained, by tentative
1582: residences, that the kind of bite she was angling for was difficult to be
1583: met with at watering-places, which were already preoccupied with
1584: abundance of angling beauties, and were chiefly stocked with men whose
1585: whiskers might be dyed, and whose incomes were still more problematic; so
1586: she had determined on trying a neighbourhood where people were extremely
1587: well acquainted with each other’s affairs, and where the women were
1588: mostly ill-dressed and ugly. Mr. Bridmain’s slow brain had adopted his
1589: sister’s views, and it seemed to him that a woman so handsome and
1590: distinguished as the Countess must certainly make a match that might lift
1591: himself into the region of county celebrities, and give him at least a
1592: sort of cousinship to the quarter-sessions.
1593: 
1594: All this, which was the simple truth, would have seemed extremely flat to
1595: the gossips of Milby, who had made up their minds to something much more
1596: exciting. There was nothing here so very detestable. It is true, the
1597: Countess was a little vain, a little ambitious, a little selfish, a
1598: little shallow and frivolous, a little given to white lies.--But who
1599: considers such slight blemishes, such moral pimples as these,
1600: disqualifications for entering into the most respectable society! Indeed,
1601: the severest ladies in Milby would have been perfectly aware that these
1602: characteristics would have created no wide distinction between the
1603: Countess Czerlaski and themselves; and since it was clear there _was_ a
1604: wide distinction--why, it must lie in the possession of some vices from
1605: which they were undeniably free.
1606: 
1607: Hence it came to pass that Milby respectability refused to recognize the
1608: Countess Czerlaski, in spite of her assiduous church-going, and the deep
1609: disgust she was known to have expressed at the extreme paucity of the
1610: congregations on Ash-Wednesdays. So she began to feel that she had
1611: miscalculated the advantages of a neighbourhood where people are well
1612: acquainted with each other’s private affairs. Under these circumstances,
1613: you will imagine how welcome was the perfect credence and admiration she
1614: met with from Mr. and Mrs. Barton. She had been especially irritated by
1615: Mr. Ely’s behaviour to her; she felt sure that he was not in the least
1616: struck with her beauty, that he quizzed her conversation, and that he
1617: spoke of her with a sneer. A woman always knows where she is utterly
1618: powerless, and shuns a coldly satirical eye as she would shun a Gorgon.
1619: And she was especially eager for clerical notice and friendship, not
1620: merely because that is quite the most respectable countenance to be
1621: obtained in society, but because she really cared about religious
1622: matters, and had an uneasy sense that she was not altogether safe in that
1623: quarter. She had serious intentions of becoming _quite_ pious--without
1624: any reserves--when she had once got her carriage and settlement. Let us
1625: do this one sly trick, says Ulysses to Neoptolemus, and we will be
1626: perfectly honest ever after--
1627: 
1628:              ἀλλ’ ἡδὺ γάρ τοι κτῆμα τῆς νίκης λαβεῖν,
1629:              τόλμα· δίκαιοι δ’ αὖθις ἐκφανούμεθα.
1630: 
1631: The Countess did not quote Sophocles, but she said to herself, ‘Only this
1632: little bit of pretence and vanity, and then I will be _quite_ good, and
1633: make myself quite safe for another world.’
1634: 
1635: And as she had by no means such fine taste and insight in theological
1636: teaching as in costume, the Rev. Amos Barton seemed to her a man not only
1637: of learning--_that_ is always understood with a clergyman--but of much
1638: power as a spiritual director. As for Milly, the Countess really loved
1639: her as well as the preoccupied state of her affections would allow. For
1640: you have already perceived that there was one being to whom the Countess
1641: was absorbingly devoted, and to whose desires she made everything else
1642: subservient--namely, Caroline Czerlaski, _nee_ Bridmain.
1643: 
1644: Thus there was really not much affectation in her sweet speeches and
1645: attentions to Mr. and Mrs. Barton. Still their friendship by no means
1646: adequately represented the object she had in view when she came to Milby,
1647: and it had been for some time clear to her that she must suggest a new
1648: change of residence to her brother.
1649: 
1650: The thing we look forward to often comes to pass, but never precisely in
1651: the way we have imagined to ourselves. The Countess did actually leave
1652: Camp Villa before many months were past, but under circumstances which
1653: had not at all entered into her contemplation.
1654: 
1655: 
1656: 
1657: 
1658: Chapter 5
1659: 
1660: 
1661: The Rev. Amos Barton, whose sad fortunes I have undertaken to relate,
1662: was, you perceive, in no respect an ideal or exceptional character; and
1663: perhaps I am doing a bold thing to bespeak your sympathy on behalf of a
1664: man who was so very far from remarkable,--a man whose virtues were not
1665: heroic, and who had no undetected crime within his breast; who had not
1666: the slightest mystery hanging about him, but was palpably and
1667: unmistakably commonplace; who was not even in love, but had had that
1668: complaint favourably many years ago. ‘An utterly uninteresting
1669: character!’ I think I hear a lady reader exclaim--Mrs. Farthingale, for
1670: example, who prefers the ideal in fiction; to whom tragedy means ermine
1671: tippets, adultery, and murder; and comedy, the adventures of some
1672: personage who is quite a ‘character’.
1673: 
1674: But, my dear madam, it is so very large a majority of your
1675: fellow-countrymen that are of this insignificant stamp. At least eighty
1676: out of a hundred of your adult male fellow-Britons returned in the last
1677: census are neither extraordinarily silly, nor extraordinarily wicked, nor
1678: extraordinarily wise; their eyes are neither deep and liquid with
1679: sentiment, nor sparkling with suppressed witticisms; they have probably
1680: had no hairbreadth escapes or thrilling adventures; their brains are
1681: certainly not pregnant with genius, and their passions have not
1682: manifested themselves at all after the fashion of a volcano. They are
1683: simply men of complexions more or less muddy, whose conversation is more
1684: or less bald and disjointed. Yet these commonplace people--many of
1685: them--bear a conscience, and have felt the sublime prompting to do the
1686: painful right; they have their unspoken sorrows, and their sacred joys;
1687: their hearts have perhaps gone out towards their first-born, and they
1688: have mourned over the irreclaimable dead. Nay, is there not a pathos in
1689: their very insignificance--in our comparison of their dim and narrow
1690: existence with the glorious possibilities of that human nature which they
1691: share?
1692: 
1693: Depend upon it, you would gain unspeakably if you would learn with me to
1694: see some of the poetry and the pathos, the tragedy and the comedy, lying
1695: in the experience of a human soul that looks out through dull grey eyes,
1696: and that speaks in a voice of quite ordinary tones. In that case, I
1697: should have no fear of your not caring to know what farther befell the
1698: Rev. Amos Barton, or of your thinking the homely details I have to tell
1699: at all beneath your attention. As it is, you can, if you please, decline
1700: to pursue my story farther; and you will easily find reading more to your
1701: taste, since I learn from the newspapers that many remarkable novels,
1702: full of striking situations, thrilling incidents, and eloquent writing,
1703: have appeared only within the last season.
1704: 
1705: Meanwhile, readers who have begun to feel an interest in the Rev. Amos
1706: Barton and his wife, will be glad to learn that Mr. Oldinport lent the
1707: twenty pounds. But twenty pounds are soon exhausted when twelve are due
1708: as back payment to the butcher, and when the possession of eight extra
1709: sovereigns in February weather is an irresistible temptation to order a
1710: new greatcoat. And though Mr. Bridmain so far departed from the necessary
1711: economy entailed on him by the Countess’s elegant toilette and expensive
1712: maid, as to choose a handsome black silk, stiff, as his experienced eye
1713: discerned, with the genuine strength of its own texture, and not with the
1714: factitious strength of gum, and present it to Mrs. Barton, in retrieval
1715: of the accident that had occurred at his table, yet, dear me--as every
1716: husband has heard--what is the present of a gown when you are deficiently
1717: furnished with the et-ceteras of apparel, and when, moreover, there are
1718: six children whose wear and tear of clothes is something incredible to
1719: the non-maternal mind?
1720: 
1721: Indeed, the equation of income and expenditure was offering new and
1722: constantly accumulating difficulties to Mr. and Mrs. Barton; for shortly
1723: after the birth of little Walter, Milly’s aunt, who had lived with her
1724: ever since her marriage, had withdrawn herself, her furniture, and her
1725: yearly income, to the household of another niece; prompted to that step,
1726: very probably, by a slight ‘tiff’ with the Rev. Amos, which occurred
1727: while Milly was up-stairs, and proved one too many for the elderly lady’s
1728: patience and magnanimity. Mr. Barton’s temper was a little warm, but, on
1729: the other hand, elderly maiden ladies are known to be susceptible; so we
1730: will not suppose that all the blame lay on his side--the less so, as he
1731: had every motive for humouring an inmate whose presence kept the wolf
1732: from the door. It was now nearly a year since Miss Jackson’s departure,
1733: and, to a fine ear, the howl of the wolf was audibly approaching.
1734: 
1735: It was a sad thing, too, that when the last snow had melted, when the
1736: purple and yellow crocuses were coming up in the garden, and the old
1737: church was already half pulled down, Milly had an illness which made her
1738: lips look pale, and rendered it absolutely necessary that she should not
1739: exert herself for some time. Mr. Brand, the Shepperton doctor so
1740: obnoxious to Mr. Pilgrim, ordered her to drink port-wine, and it was
1741: quite necessary to have a charwoman very often, to assist Nanny in all
1742: the extra work that fell upon her.
1743: 
1744: Mrs. Hackit, who hardly ever paid a visit to any one but her oldest and
1745: nearest neighbour, Mrs. Patten, now took the unusual step of calling at
1746: the vicarage one morning; and the tears came into her unsentimental eyes
1747: as she saw Milly seated pale and feeble in the parlour, unable to
1748: persevere in sewing the pinafore that lay on the table beside her. Little
1749: Dickey, a boisterous boy of five, with large pink cheeks and sturdy legs,
1750: was having his turn to sit with Mamma, and was squatting quiet as a mouse
1751: at her knee, holding her soft white hand between his little red
1752: black-nailed fists. He was a boy whom Mrs. Hackit, in a severe mood, had
1753: pronounced ‘stocky’ (a word that etymologically in all probability,
1754: conveys some allusion to an instrument of punishment for the refractory);
1755: but seeing him thus subdued into goodness, she smiled at him with her
1756: kindest smile, and stooping down, suggested a kiss--a favour which Dicky
1757: resolutely declined.
1758: 
1759: ‘Now _do_ you take nourishing things enough?’ was one of Mrs. Hackit’s
1760: first questions, and Milly endeavoured to make it appear that no woman
1761: was ever so much in danger of being over-fed and led into self-indulgent
1762: habits as herself. But Mrs. Hackit gathered one fact from her replies,
1763: namely, that Mr. Brand had ordered port-wine.
1764: 
1765: While this conversation was going forward, Dickey had been furtively
1766: stroking and kissing the soft white hand; so that at last, when a pause
1767: came, his mother said, smilingly, ‘Why are you kissing my hand, Dickey?’
1768: 
1769: ‘It id to yovely,’ answered Dickey, who, you observe, was decidedly
1770: backward in his pronunciation.
1771: 
1772: Mrs. Hackit remembered this little scene in after days, and thought with
1773: peculiar tenderness and pity of the ‘stocky boy’.
1774: 
1775: The next day there came a hamper with Mrs. Hackit’s respects; and on
1776: being opened it was found to contain half-a-dozen of port-wine and two
1777: couples of fowls. Mrs. Farquhar, too, was very kind; insisted on Mrs.
1778: Barton’s rejecting all arrowroot but hers, which was genuine Indian, and
1779: carried away Sophy and Fred to stay with her a fortnight. These and other
1780: good-natured attentions made the trouble of Milly’s illness more
1781: bearable; but they could not prevent it from swelling expenses, and Mr.
1782: Barton began to have serious thoughts of representing his case to a
1783: certain charity for the relief of needy curates.
1784: 
1785: Altogether, as matters stood in Shepperton, the parishioners were more
1786: likely to have a strong sense that the clergyman needed their material
1787: aid, than that they needed his spiritual aid,--not the best state of
1788: things in this age and country, where faith in men solely on the ground
1789: of their spiritual gifts has considerably diminished, and especially
1790: unfavourable to the influence of the Rev. Amos, whose spiritual gifts
1791: would not have had a very commanding power even in an age of faith.
1792: 
1793: But, you ask, did not the Countess Czerlaski pay any attention to her
1794: friends all this time? To be sure she did. She was indefatigable in
1795: visiting her ‘sweet Milly’, and sitting with her for hours together. It
1796: may seem remarkable to you that she neither thought of taking away any of
1797: the children, nor of providing for any of Milly’s probable wants; but
1798: ladies of rank and of luxurious habits, you know, cannot be expected to
1799: surmise the details of poverty. She put a great deal of eau-de-Cologne on
1800: Mrs. Barton’s pocket-handkerchief, rearranged her pillow and footstool,
1801: kissed her cheeks, wrapped her in a soft warm shawl from her own
1802: shoulders, and amused her with stories of the life she had seen abroad.
1803: When Mr. Barton joined them she talked of Tractarianism, of her
1804: determination not to re-enter the vortex of fashionable life, and of her
1805: anxiety to see him in a sphere large enough for his talents. Milly
1806: thought her sprightliness and affectionate warmth quite charming, and was
1807: very fond of her; while the Rev. Amos had a vague consciousness that he
1808: had risen into aristocratic life, and only associated with his
1809: middle-class parishioners in a pastoral and parenthetic manner.
1810: 
1811: However, as the days brightened, Milly’s cheeks and lips brightened too;
1812: and in a few weeks she was almost as active as ever, though watchful eyes
1813: might have seen that activity was not easy to her. Mrs. Hackit’s eyes
1814: were of that kind, and one day, when Mr. and Mrs. Barton had been dining
1815: with her for the first time since Milly’s illness, she observed to her
1816: husband--‘That poor thing’s dreadful weak an’ delicate; she won’t stan’
1817: havin’ many more children.’
1818: 
1819: Mr. Barton, meanwhile, had been indefatigable in his vocation. He had
1820: preached two extemporary sermons every Sunday at the workhouse, where a
1821: room had been fitted up for divine service, pending the alterations in
1822: the church; and had walked the same evening to a cottage at one or other
1823: extremity of his parish to deliver another sermon, still more
1824: extemporary, in an atmosphere impregnated with spring-flowers and
1825: perspiration. After all these labours you will easily conceive that he
1826: was considerably exhausted by half-past nine o’clock in the evening, and
1827: that a supper at a friendly parishioner’s, with a glass, or even two
1828: glasses, of brandy-and-water after it, was a welcome reinforcement. Mr.
1829: Barton was not at all an ascetic; he thought the benefits of fasting were
1830: entirely confined to the Old Testament dispensation; he was fond of
1831: relaxing himself with a little gossip; indeed, Miss Bond, and other
1832: ladies of enthusiastic views, sometimes regretted that Mr. Barton did not
1833: more uninterruptedly exhibit a superiority to the things of the flesh.
1834: Thin ladies, who take little exercise, and whose livers are not strong
1835: enough to bear stimulants, are so extremely critical about one’s personal
1836: habits! And, after all, the Rev. Amos never came near the borders of a
1837: vice. His very faults were middling--he was not _very_ ungrammatical. It
1838: was not in his nature to be superlative in anything; unless, indeed, he
1839: was superlatively middling, the quintessential extract of mediocrity. If
1840: there was any one point on which he showed an inclination to be
1841: excessive, it was confidence in his own shrewdness and ability in
1842: practical matters, so that he was very full of plans which were something
1843: like his moves in chess--admirably well calculated, supposing the state
1844: of the case were otherwise. For example, that notable plan of introducing
1845: anti-dissenting books into his Lending Library did not in the least
1846: appear to have bruised the head of Dissent, though it had certainly made
1847: Dissent strongly inclined to bite the Rev. Amos’s heel. Again, he vexed
1848: the souls of his churchwardens and influential parishioners by his
1849: fertile suggestiveness as to what it would be well for them to do in the
1850: matter of the church repairs, and other ecclesiastical secularities.
1851: 
1852: ‘I never saw the like to parsons,’ Mr. Hackit said one day in
1853: conversation with his brother churchwarden, Mr. Bond; ‘they’re al’ys for
1854: meddling with business, an they know no more about it than my black
1855: filly.’
1856: 
1857: ‘Ah,’ said Mr. Bond, ‘they’re too high learnt to have much common-sense.’
1858: 
1859: ‘Well,’ remarked Mr. Hackit, in a modest and dubious tone, as if throwing
1860: out a hypothesis which might be considered bold, ‘I should say that’s a
1861: bad sort of eddication as makes folks onreasonable.’
1862: 
1863: So that, you perceive, Mr. Barton’s popularity was in that precarious
1864: condition, in that toppling and contingent state, in which a very slight
1865: push from a malignant destiny would utterly upset it. That push was not
1866: long in being given, as you shall hear.
1867: 
1868: One fine May morning, when Amos was out on his parochial visits, and the
1869: sunlight was streaming through the bow-window of the sitting-room, where
1870: Milly was seated at her sewing, occasionally looking up to glance at the
1871: children playing in the garden, there came a loud rap at the door, which
1872: she at once recognized as the Countess’s, and that well-dressed lady
1873: presently entered the sitting-room, with her veil drawn over her face.
1874: Milly was not at all surprised or sorry to see her; but when the Countess
1875: threw up her veil, and showed that her eyes were red and swollen, she was
1876: both surprised and sorry.
1877: 
1878: ‘What can be the matter, dear Caroline?’
1879: 
1880: Caroline threw down Jet, who gave a little yelp; then she threw her arms
1881: round Milly’s neck, and began to sob; then she threw herself on the sofa,
1882: and begged for a glass of water; then she threw off her bonnet and shawl;
1883: and by the time Milly’s imagination had exhausted itself in conjuring up
1884: calamities, she said,--‘Dear, how shall I tell you? I am the most
1885: wretched woman. To be deceived by a brother to whom I have been so
1886: devoted--to see him degrading himself--giving himself utterly to the
1887: dogs!’
1888: 
1889: ‘What can it be?’ said Milly, who began to picture to herself the sober
1890: Mr. Bridmain taking to brandy and betting.
1891: 
1892: ‘He is going to be married--to marry my own maid, that deceitful Alice,
1893: to whom I have been the most indulgent mistress. Did you ever hear of
1894: anything so disgraceful? so mortifying? so disreputable?’
1895: 
1896: ‘And has he only just told you of it?’ said Milly, who, having really
1897: heard of worse conduct, even in her innocent life, avoided a direct
1898: answer.
1899: 
1900: ‘Told me of it! he had not even the grace to do that. I went into the
1901: dining-room suddenly and found him kissing her--disgusting at his time of
1902: life, is it not?--and when I reproved her for allowing such liberties,
1903: she turned round saucily, and said she was engaged to be married to my
1904: brother, and she saw no shame in allowing him to kiss her. Edmund is a
1905: miserable coward, you know, and looked frightened; but when she asked him
1906: to say whether it was not so, he tried to summon up courage and say yes.
1907: I left the room in disgust, and this morning I have been questioning
1908: Edmund, and find that he is bent on marrying this woman, and that he has
1909: been putting off telling me--because he was ashamed of himself, I
1910: suppose. I couldn’t possibly stay in the house after this, with my own
1911: maid turned mistress. And now, Milly, I am come to throw myself on your
1912: charity for a week or two. _Will_ you take me in?’
1913: 
1914: ‘That we will,’ said Milly, ‘if you will only put up with our poor rooms
1915: and way of living. It will be delightful to have you!’
1916: 
1917: ‘It will soothe me to be with you and Mr. Barton a little while. I feel
1918: quite unable to go among my other friends just at present. What those two
1919: wretched people will do I don’t know--leave the neighbourhood at once, I
1920: hope. I entreated my brother to do so, before he disgraced himself.’
1921: 
1922: When Amos came home, he joined his cordial welcome and sympathy to
1923: Milly’s. By-and-by the Countess’s formidable boxes, which she had
1924: carefully packed before her indignation drove her away from Camp Villa,
1925: arrived at the vicarage, and were deposited in the spare bedroom, and in
1926: two closets, not spare, which Milly emptied for their reception. A week
1927: afterwards, the excellent apartments at Camp Villa, comprising dining and
1928: drawing rooms, three bedrooms and a dressing-room, were again to let, and
1929: Mr. Bridmain’s sudden departure, together with the Countess Czerlaski’s
1930: installation as a visitor at Shepperton Vicarage, became a topic of
1931: general conversation in the neighbourhood. The keen-sighted virtue of
1932: Milby and Shepperton saw in all this a confirmation of its worst
1933: suspicions, and pitied the Rev. Amos Barton’s gullibility.
1934: 
1935: But when week after week, and month after month, slipped by without
1936: witnessing the Countess’s departure--when summer and harvest had fled,
1937: and still left her behind them occupying the spare bedroom and the
1938: closets, and also a large proportion of Mrs. Barton’s time and attention,
1939: new surmises of a very evil kind were added to the old rumours, and began
1940: to take the form of settled convictions in the minds even of Mr. Barton’s
1941: most friendly parishioners.
1942: 
1943: And now, here is an opportunity for an accomplished writer to
1944: apostrophize calumny, to quote Virgil, and to show that he is acquainted
1945: with the most ingenious things which have been said on that subject in
1946: polite literature.
1947: 
1948: But what is opportunity to the man who can’t use it? An undefecundated
1949: egg, which the waves of time wash away into nonentity. So, as my memory
1950: is ill-furnished, and my notebook still worse, I am unable to show myself
1951: either erudite or eloquent apropos of the calumny whereof the Rev. Amos
1952: Barton was the victim. I can only ask my reader,--did you ever upset your
1953: ink-bottle, and watch, in helpless agony, the rapid spread of Stygian
1954: blackness over your fair manuscript or fairer table-cover? With a like
1955: inky swiftness did gossip now blacken the reputation of the Rev. Amos
1956: Barton, causing the unfriendly to scorn and even the friendly to stand
1957: aloof, at a time when difficulties of another kind were fast thickening
1958: around him.
1959: 
1960: 
1961: 
1962: 
1963: Chapter 6
1964: 
1965: 
1966: One November morning, at least six months after the Countess Czerlaski
1967: had taken up her residence at the vicarage, Mrs. Hackit heard that her
1968: neighbour Mrs. Patten had an attack of her old complaint, vaguely called
1969: ‘the spasms’. Accordingly, about eleven o’clock, she put on her velvet
1970: bonnet and cloth cloak, with a long boa and muff large enough to stow a
1971: prize baby in; for Mrs. Hackit regulated her costume by the calendar, and
1972: brought out her furs on the first of November; whatever might be the
1973: temperature. She was not a woman weakly to accommodate herself to
1974: shilly-shally proceedings. If the season didn’t know what it ought to do,
1975: Mrs. Hackit did. In her best days, it was always sharp weather at
1976: ‘Gunpowder Plot’, and she didn’t like new fashions.
1977: 
1978: And this morning the weather was very rationally in accordance with her
1979: costume, for as she made her way through the fields to Cross Farm, the
1980: yellow leaves on the hedge-girt elms, which showed bright and golden
1981: against the long-hanging purple clouds, were being scattered across the
1982: grassy path by the coldest of November winds. ‘Ah,’ Mrs. Hackit thought
1983: to herself, ‘I daresay we shall have a sharp pinch this winter, and if we
1984: do, I shouldn’t wonder if it takes the old lady off. They say a green
1985: Yule makes a fat churchyard; but so does a white Yule too, for that
1986: matter. When the stool’s rotten enough, no matter who sits on it.’
1987: 
1988: However, on her arrival at Cross Farm, the prospect of Mrs. Patten’s
1989: decease was again thrown into the dim distance in her imagination, for
1990: Miss Janet Gibbs met her with the news that Mrs. Patten was much better,
1991: and led her, without any preliminary announcement, to the old lady’s
1992: bedroom. Janet had scarcely reached the end of her circumstantial
1993: narrative how the attack came on and what were her aunt’s sensations--a
1994: narrative to which Mrs. Patten, in her neatly-plaited nightcap, seemed to
1995: listen with a contemptuous resignation to her niece’s historical
1996: inaccuracy, contenting herself with occasionally confounding Janet by a
1997: shake of the head--when the clatter of a horse’s hoofs on the yard
1998: pavement announced the arrival of Mr. Pilgrim, whose large, top-booted
1999: person presently made its appearance up-stairs. He found Mrs. Patten going
2000: on so well that there was no need to look solemn. He might glide from
2001: condolence into gossip without offence, and the temptation of having Mrs.
2002: Hackit’s ear was irresistible.
2003: 
2004: ‘What a disgraceful business this is turning out of your parson’s,’ was
2005: the remark with which he made this agreeable transition, throwing himself
2006: back in the chair from which he had been leaning towards the patient.
2007: ‘Eh, dear me!’ said Mrs. Hackit, ‘disgraceful enough. I stuck to Mr.
2008: Barton as long as I could, for his wife’s sake; but I can’t countenance
2009: such goings-on. It’s hateful to see that woman coming with ’em to service
2010: of a Sunday, and if Mr. Hackit wasn’t churchwarden and I didn’t think it
2011: wrong to forsake one’s own parish, I should go to Knebley Church. There’s
2012: a many parish’ners as do.’
2013: 
2014: ‘I used to think Barton was only a fool,’ observed Mr. Pilgrim, in a tone
2015: which implied that he was conscious of having been weakly charitable. ‘I
2016: thought he was imposed upon and led away by those people when they first
2017: came. But that’s impossible now.’
2018: 
2019: ‘O, it’s as plain as the nose in your face,’ said Mrs. Hackit,
2020: unreflectingly, not perceiving the equivoque in her comparison--‘comin’
2021: to Milby, like a sparrow perchin’ on a bough, as I may say, with her
2022: brother, as she called him; and then all on a sudden the brother goes off
2023: with himself, and she throws herself on the Bartons. Though what could
2024: make her take up with a poor notomise of a parson, as hasn’t got enough
2025: to keep wife and children, there’s One above knows--_I_ don’t.’
2026: 
2027: ‘Mr. Barton may have attractions we don’t know of,’ said Mr. Pilgrim, who
2028: piqued himself on a talent for sarcasm. ‘The Countess has no maid now,
2029: and they say Mr. Barton is handy in assisting at her toilette--laces her
2030: boots, and so forth.’
2031: 
2032: ‘Tilette, be fiddled!’ said Mrs. Hackit, with indignant boldness of
2033: metaphor; ‘an’ there’s that poor thing a-sewing her fingers to the bone
2034: for them children--an’ another comin’ on. What she must have to go
2035: through! It goes to my heart to turn my back on her. But she’s i’ the
2036: wrong to let herself be put upon i’ that manner.’
2037: 
2038: ‘Ah! I was talking to Mrs. Farquhar about that the other day. She said,
2039: “I think Mrs. Barton a v-e-r-y w-e-a-k w-o-m-a-n”.’ (Mr. Pilgrim gave
2040: this quotation with slow emphasis, as if he thought Mrs. Farquhar had
2041: uttered a remarkable sentiment.) ‘They find it impossible to invite her
2042: to their house while she has that equivocal person staying with her.’
2043: 
2044: ‘Well!’ remarked Miss Gibbs, ‘if I was a wife, nothing should induce me
2045: to bear what Mrs. Barton does.’
2046: 
2047: ‘Yes, it’s fine talking,’ said Mrs. Patten, from her pillow; ‘old maids’
2048: husbands are al’ys well-managed. If you was a wife you’d be as foolish as
2049: your betters, belike.’
2050: 
2051: ‘All my wonder is,’ observed Mrs. Hackit, ‘how the Bartons make both ends
2052: meet. You may depend on it, _she’s_ got nothing to give ’em; for I
2053: understand as he’s been having money from some clergy charity. They said
2054: at fust as she stuffed Mr. Barton wi’ notions about her writing to the
2055: Chancellor an’ her fine friends, to give him a living. Howiver, I don’t
2056: know what’s true an’ what’s false. Mr. Barton keeps away from our house
2057: now, for I gave him a bit o’ my mind one day. Maybe he’s ashamed of
2058: himself. He seems to me to look dreadful thin an’ harassed of a Sunday.’
2059: 
2060: ‘O, he must be aware he’s getting into bad odour everywhere. The clergy
2061: are quite disgusted with his folly. They say Carpe would be glad to get
2062: Barton out of the curacy if he could; but he can’t do that without coming
2063: to Shepperton himself, as Barton’s a licensed curate; and he wouldn’t
2064: like that, I suppose.’
2065: 
2066: At this moment Mrs. Patten showed signs of uneasiness, which recalled Mr.
2067: Pilgrim to professional attentions; and Mrs. Hackit, observing that it
2068: was Thursday, and she must see after the butter, said good-bye, promising
2069: to look in again soon, and bring her knitting.
2070: 
2071: This Thursday, by the by, is the first in the month--the day on which the
2072: Clerical Meeting is held at Milby Vicarage; and as the Rev. Amos Barton
2073: has reasons for not attending, he will very likely be a subject of
2074: conversation amongst his clerical brethren. Suppose we go there, and hear
2075: whether Mr. Pilgrim has reported their opinion correctly.
2076: 
2077: There is not a numerous party to-day, for it is a season of sore throats
2078: and catarrhs; so that the exegetical and theological discussions, which
2079: are the preliminary of dining, have not been quite so spirited as usual;
2080: and although a question relative to the Epistle of Jude has not been
2081: quite cleared up, the striking of six by the church clock, and the
2082: simultaneous announcement of dinner, are sounds that no one feels to be
2083: importunate.
2084: 
2085: Pleasant (when one is not in the least bilious) to enter a comfortable
2086: dining-room, where the closely-drawn red curtains glow with the double
2087: light of fire and candle, where glass and silver are glittering on the
2088: pure damask, and a soup-tureen gives a hint of the fragrance that will
2089: presently rush out to inundate your hungry senses, and prepare them, by
2090: the delicate visitation of atoms, for the keen gusto of ampler contact!
2091: Especially if you have confidence in the dinner-giving capacity of your
2092: host--if you know that he is not a man who entertains grovelling views of
2093: eating and drinking as a mere satisfaction of hunger and thirst, and,
2094: dead to all the finer influences of the palate, expects his guest to be
2095: brilliant on ill-flavoured gravies and the cheapest Marsala. Mr. Ely was
2096: particularly worthy of such confidence, and his virtues as an Amphitryon
2097: had probably contributed quite as much as the central situation of Milby
2098: to the selection of his house as a clerical rendezvous. He looks
2099: particularly graceful at the head of his table, and, indeed, on all
2100: occasions where he acts as president or moderator: he is a man who seems
2101: to listen well, and is an excellent amalgam of dissimilar ingredients.
2102: 
2103: At the other end of the table, as ‘Vice’, sits Mr. Fellowes, rector and
2104: magistrate, a man of imposing appearance, with a mellifluous voice and
2105: the readiest of tongues. Mr. Fellowes once obtained a living by the
2106: persuasive charms of his conversation, and the fluency with which he
2107: interpreted the opinions of an obese and stammering baronet, so as to
2108: give that elderly gentleman a very pleasing perception of his own wisdom.
2109: Mr. Fellowes is a very successful man, and has the highest character
2110: everywhere except in his own parish, where, doubtless because his
2111: parishioners happen to be quarrelsome people, he is always at fierce feud
2112: with a farmer or two, a colliery proprietor, a grocer who was once
2113: churchwarden, and a tailor who formerly officiated as clerk.
2114: 
2115: At Mr. Ely’s right hand you see a very small man with a sallow and
2116: somewhat puffy face, whose hair is brushed straight up, evidently with
2117: the intention of giving him a height somewhat less disproportionate to
2118: his sense of his own importance than the measure of five feet three
2119: accorded him by an oversight of nature. This is Rev. Archibald Duke, a
2120: very dyspeptic and evangelical man, who takes the gloomiest view of
2121: mankind and their prospects, and thinks the immense sale of the ‘Pickwick
2122: Papers,’ recently completed, one of the strongest proofs of original sin.
2123: Unfortunately, though Mr. Duke was not burdened with a family, his yearly
2124: expenditure was apt considerably to exceed his income; and the unpleasant
2125: circumstances resulting from this, together with heavy meat-breakfasts,
2126: may probably have contributed to his desponding views of the world
2127: generally.
2128: 
2129: Next to him is seated Mr. Furness, a tall young man, with blond hair and
2130: whiskers, who was plucked at Cambridge entirely owing to his genius; at
2131: least I know that he soon afterwards published a volume of poems, which
2132: were considered remarkably beautiful by many young ladies of his
2133: acquaintance. Mr. Furness preached his own sermons, as any one of
2134: tolerable critical acumen might have certified by comparing them with his
2135: poems: in both, there was an exuberance of metaphor and simile entirely
2136: original, and not in the least borrowed from any resemblance in the
2137: things compared.
2138: 
2139: On Mr. Furness’s left you see Mr. Pugh, another young curate, of much
2140: less marked characteristics. He had not published any poems; he had not
2141: even been plucked; he had neat black whiskers and a pale complexion; read
2142: prayers and a sermon twice every Sunday, and might be seen any day
2143: sallying forth on his parochial duties in a white tie, a well-brushed
2144: hat, a perfect suit of black, and well-polished boots--an equipment which
2145: he probably supposed hieroglyphically to represent the spirit of
2146: Christianity to the parishioners of Whittlecombe.
2147: 
2148: Mr. Pugh’s _vis-a-vis_ is the Rev. Martin Cleves, a man about
2149: forty--middle-sized, broad-shouldered, with a negligently-tied cravat, large
2150: irregular features, and a large head, thickly covered with lanky brown
2151: hair. To a superficial glance, Mr. Cleves is the plainest and least
2152: clerical-looking of the party; yet, strange to say, _there_ is the true
2153: parish priest, the pastor beloved, consulted, relied on by his flock; a
2154: clergyman who is not associated with the undertaker, but thought of as
2155: the surest helper under a difficulty, as a monitor who is encouraging
2156: rather than severe. Mr. Cleves has the wonderful art of preaching sermons
2157: which the wheelwright and the blacksmith can understand; not because he
2158: talks condescending twaddle, but because he can call a spade a spade, and
2159: knows how to disencumber ideas of their wordy frippery. Look at him more
2160: attentively, and you will see that his face is a very interesting
2161: one--that there is a great deal of humour and feeling playing in his grey
2162: eyes, and about the corners of his roughly-cut mouth: a man, you observe,
2163: who has most likely sprung from the harder-working section of the middle
2164: class, and has hereditary sympathies with the checkered life of the
2165: people. He gets together the working men in his parish on a Monday
2166: evening, and gives them a sort of conversational lecture on useful
2167: practical matters, telling them stories, or reading some select passages
2168: from an agreeable book, and commenting on them; and if you were to ask
2169: the first labourer or artisan in Tripplegate what sort of man the parson
2170: was, he would say,--‘a uncommon knowin’, sensable, free-spoken gentleman;
2171: very kind an’ good-natur’d too’. Yet for all this, he is perhaps the best
2172: Grecian of the party, if we except Mr. Baird, the young man on his left.
2173: 
2174: Mr. Baird has since gained considerable celebrity as an original writer
2175: and metropolitan lecturer, but at that time he used to preach in a little
2176: church something like a barn, to a congregation consisting of three rich
2177: farmers and their servants, about fifteen labourers, and the due
2178: proportion of women and children. The rich farmers understood him to be
2179: ‘very high learnt;’ but if you had interrogated them for a more precise
2180: description, they would have said that he was ‘a thinnish-faced man, with
2181: a sort o’ cast in his eye, like’.
2182: 
2183: Seven, altogether: a delightful number for a dinner-party, supposing the
2184: units to be delightful, but everything depends on that. During dinner Mr.
2185: Fellowes took the lead in the conversation, which set strongly in the
2186: direction of mangold-wurzel and the rotation of crops; for Mr. Fellowes
2187: and Mr. Cleves cultivated their own glebes. Mr. Ely, too, had some
2188: agricultural notions, and even the Rev. Archibald Duke was made alive to
2189: that class of mundane subjects by the possession of some potato-ground.
2190: The two young curates talked a little aside during these discussions,
2191: which had imperfect interest for their unbeneficed minds; and the
2192: transcendental and near-sighted Mr. Baird seemed to listen somewhat
2193: abstractedly, knowing little more of potatoes and mangold-wurzel than
2194: that they were some form of the ‘Conditioned’.
2195: 
2196: ‘What a hobby farming is with Lord Watling!’ said Mr. Fellowes, when the
2197: cloth was being drawn. ‘I went over his farm at Tetterley with him last
2198: summer. It is really a model farm; first-rate dairy, grazing and wheat
2199: land, and such splendid farm-buildings! An expensive hobby, though. He
2200: sinks a good deal of money there, I fancy. He has a great whim for black
2201: cattle, and he sends that drunken old Scotch bailiff of his to Scotland
2202: every year, with hundreds in his pocket, to buy these beasts.’
2203: 
2204: ‘By the by,’ said Mr. Ely, ‘do you know who is the man to whom Lord
2205: Watling has given the Bramhill living?’
2206: 
2207: ‘A man named Sargent. I knew him at Oxford. His brother is a lawyer, and
2208: was very useful to Lord Watling in that ugly Brounsell affair. That’s why
2209: Sargent got the living.’
2210: 
2211: ‘Sargent,’ said Mr. Ely. ‘I know him. Isn’t he a showy, talkative fellow;
2212: has written travels in Mesopotamia, or something of that sort?’
2213: 
2214: ‘That’s the man.’
2215: 
2216: ‘He was at Witherington once, as Bagshawe’s curate. He got into rather
2217: bad odour there, through some scandal about a flirtation, I think.’
2218: 
2219: ‘Talking of scandal,’ returned Mr. Fellowes, ‘have you heard the last
2220: story about Barton? Nisbett was telling me the other day that he dines
2221: alone with the Countess at six, while Mrs. Barton is in the kitchen
2222: acting as cook.’
2223: 
2224: ‘Rather an apocryphal authority, Nisbett,’ said Mr. Ely.
2225: 
2226: ‘Ah,’ said Mr. Cleves, with good-natured humour twinkling in his eyes,
2227: ‘depend upon it, that is a corrupt version. The original text is, that
2228: they all dined together _with_ six--meaning six children--and that Mrs.
2229: Barton is an excellent cook.’
2230: 
2231: ‘I wish dining alone together may be the worst of that sad business,’
2232: said the Rev. Archibald Duke, in a tone implying that his wish was a
2233: strong figure of speech.
2234: 
2235: ‘Well,’ said Mr. Fellowes, filling his glass and looking jocose, ‘Barton
2236: is certainly either the greatest gull in existence, or he has some cunning
2237: secret,--some philtre or other to make himself charming in the eyes of a
2238: fair lady. It isn’t all of us that can make conquests when our ugliness
2239: is past its bloom.’
2240: 
2241: ‘The lady seemed to have made a conquest of him at the very outset,’ said
2242: Mr. Ely. ‘I was immensely amused one night at Granby’s when he was
2243: telling us her story about her husband’s adventures. He said, “When she
2244: told me the tale, I felt I don’t know how,--I felt it from the crown of
2245: my head to the sole of my feet.”’
2246: 
2247: Mr. Ely gave these words dramatically, imitating the Rev. Amos’s fervour
2248: and symbolic action, and every one laughed except Mr. Duke, whose
2249: after-dinner view of things was not apt to be jovial. He said,--‘I think
2250: some of us ought to remonstrate with Mr. Barton on the scandal he is
2251: causing. He is not only imperilling his own soul, but the souls of his
2252: flock.’
2253: 
2254: ‘Depend upon it,’ said Mr. Cleves, ‘there is some simple explanation of
2255: the whole affair, if we only happened to know it. Barton has always
2256: impressed me as a right-minded man, who has the knack of doing himself
2257: injustice by his manner.’
2258: 
2259: ‘Now I never liked Barton,’ said Mr. Fellowes. ‘He’s not a gentleman.
2260: Why, he used to be on terms of intimacy with that canting Prior, who died
2261: a little while ago;--a fellow who soaked himself with spirits, and talked
2262: of the Gospel through an inflamed nose.’
2263: 
2264: ‘The Countess has given him more refined tastes, I daresay,’ said Mr.
2265: Ely.
2266: 
2267: ‘Well,’ observed Mr. Cleves, ‘the poor fellow must have a hard pull to
2268: get along, with his small income and large family. Let us hope the
2269: Countess does something towards making the pot boil.’
2270: 
2271: ‘Not she,’ said Mr. Duke; ‘there are greater signs of poverty about them
2272: than ever.’
2273: 
2274: ‘Well, come,’ returned Mr. Cleves, who could be caustic sometimes, and
2275: who was not at all fond of his reverend brother, Mr. Duke, ‘that’s
2276: something in Barton’s favour at all events. He might be poor _without_
2277: showing signs of poverty.’
2278: 
2279: Mr. Duke turned rather yellow, which was his way of blushing, and Mr. Ely
2280: came to his relief by observing,--‘They’re making a very good piece of
2281: work of Shepperton Church. Dolby, the architect, who has it in hand, is a
2282: very clever fellow.’
2283: 
2284: ‘It’s he who has been doing Coppleton Church,’ said Mr. Furness. ‘They’ve
2285: got it in excellent order for the visitation.’
2286: 
2287: This mention of the visitation suggested the Bishop, and thus opened a
2288: wide duct, which entirely diverted the stream of animadversion from that
2289: small pipe--that capillary vessel, the Rev. Amos Barton.
2290: 
2291: The talk of the clergy about their Bishop belongs to the esoteric part of
2292: their profession; so we will at once quit the dining-room at Milby
2293: Vicarage, lest we should happen to overhear remarks unsuited to the lay
2294: understanding, and perhaps dangerous to our repose of mind.
2295: 
2296: 
2297: 
2298: 
2299: Chapter 7
2300: 
2301: 
2302: I dare say the long residence of the Countess Czerlaski at Shepperton
2303: Vicarage is very puzzling to you also, dear reader, as well as to Mr.
2304: Barton’s clerical brethren; the more so, as I hope you are not in the
2305: least inclined to put that very evil interpretation on it which evidently
2306: found acceptance with the sallow and dyspeptic Mr. Duke, and with the
2307: florid and highly peptic Mr. Fellowes. You have seen enough, I trust, of
2308: the Rev. Amos Barton, to be convinced that he was more apt to fall into a
2309: blunder than into a sin--more apt to be deceived than to incur a
2310: necessity for being deceitful: and if you have a keen eye for
2311: physiognomy, you will have detected that the Countess Czerlaski loved
2312: herself far too well to get entangled in an unprofitable vice.
2313: 
2314: How then, you will say, could this fine lady choose to quarter herself on
2315: the establishment of a poor curate, where the carpets were probably
2316: falling into holes, where the attendance was limited to a maid of all
2317: work, and where six children were running loose from eight o’clock in the
2318: morning till eight o’clock in the evening? Surely you must be
2319: misrepresenting the facts.
2320: 
2321: Heaven forbid! For not having a lofty imagination, as you perceive, and
2322: being unable to invent thrilling incidents for your amusement, my only
2323: merit must lie in the truth with which I represent to you the humble
2324: experience of an ordinary fellow-mortal. I wish to stir your sympathy
2325: with commonplace troubles--to win your tears for real sorrow: sorrow such
2326: as may live next door to you--such as walks neither in rags nor in
2327: velvet, but in very ordinary decent apparel.
2328: 
2329: Therefore, that you may dismiss your suspicions of my veracity, I will
2330: beg you to consider, that at the time the Countess Czerlaski left Camp
2331: Villa in dudgeon, she had only twenty pounds in her pocket, being about
2332: one-third of the income she possessed independently of her brother. You
2333: will then perceive that she was in the extremely inconvenient predicament
2334: of having quarrelled, not indeed with her bread and cheese, but certainly
2335: with her chicken and tart--a predicament all the more inconvenient to
2336: her, because the habit of idleness had quite unfitted her for earning
2337: those necessary superfluities, and because, with all her fascinations,
2338: she had not secured any enthusiastic friends whose houses were open to
2339: her, and who were dying to see her. Thus she had completely checkmated
2340: herself, unless she could resolve on one unpleasant move--namely, to
2341: humble herself to her brother, and recognize his wife. This seemed quite
2342: impossible to her as long as she entertained the hope that he would make
2343: the first advances; and in this flattering hope she remained month after
2344: month at Shepperton Vicarage, gracefully overlooking the deficiencies of
2345: accommodation, and feeling that she was really behaving charmingly. ‘Who
2346: indeed,’ she thought to herself, ‘could do otherwise, with a lovely,
2347: gentle creature like Milly? I shall really be sorry to leave the poor
2348: thing.’
2349: 
2350: So, though she lay in bed till ten, and came down to a separate breakfast
2351: at eleven, she kindly consented to dine as early as five, when a hot
2352: joint was prepared, which coldly furnished forth the children’s table the
2353: next day; she considerately prevented Milly from devoting herself too
2354: closely to the children, by insisting on reading, talking, and walking
2355: with her; and she even began to embroider a cap for the next baby, which
2356: must certainly be a girl, and be named Caroline.
2357: 
2358: After the first month or two of her residence at the Vicarage, the Rev.
2359: Amos Barton became aware--as, indeed, it was unavoidable that he
2360: should--of the strong disapprobation it drew upon him, and the change of
2361: feeling towards him which it was producing in his kindest parishioners.
2362: But, in the first place, he still believed in the Countess as a charming
2363: and influential woman, disposed to befriend him, and, in any case, he
2364: could hardly hint departure to a lady guest who had been kind to him and
2365: his, and who might any day spontaneously announce the termination of her
2366: visit; in the second place, he was conscious of his own innocence, and
2367: felt some contemptuous indignation towards people who were ready to
2368: imagine evil of him; and, lastly, he had, as I have already intimated, a
2369: strong will of his own, so that a certain obstinacy and defiance mingled
2370: itself with his other feelings on the subject.
2371: 
2372: The one unpleasant consequence which was not to be evaded or counteracted
2373: by any mere mental state, was the increasing drain on his slender purse
2374: for household expenses, to meet which the remittance he had received from
2375: the clerical charity threatened to be quite inadequate. Slander may be
2376: defeated by equanimity; but courageous thoughts will not pay your baker’s
2377: bill, and fortitude is nowhere considered legal tender for beef. Month
2378: after month the financial aspect of the Rev. Amos’s affairs became more
2379: and more serious to him, and month after month, too, wore away more and
2380: more of that armour of indignation and defiance with which he had at
2381: first defended himself from the harsh looks of faces that were once the
2382: friendliest.
2383: 
2384: But quite the heaviest pressure of the trouble fell on Milly--on gentle,
2385: uncomplaining Milly--whose delicate body was becoming daily less fit for
2386: all the many things that had to be done between rising up and lying down.
2387: At first, she thought the Countess’s visit would not last long, and she
2388: was quite glad to incur extra exertion for the sake of making her friend
2389: comfortable. I can hardly bear to think of all the rough work she did
2390: with those lovely hands--all by the sly, without letting her husband know
2391: anything about it, and husbands are not clairvoyant: how she salted
2392: bacon, ironed shirts and cravats, put patches on patches, and re-darned
2393: darns. Then there was the task of mending and eking out baby-linen in
2394: prospect, and the problem perpetually suggesting itself how she and Nanny
2395: should manage when there was another baby, as there would be before very
2396: many months were past.
2397: 
2398: When time glided on, and the Countess’s visit did not end, Milly was not
2399: blind to any phase of their position. She knew of the slander; she was
2400: aware of the keeping aloof of old friends; but these she felt almost
2401: entirely on her husband’s account. A loving woman’s world lies within the
2402: four walls of her own home; and it is only through her husband that she
2403: is in any electric communication with the world beyond. Mrs. Simpkins may
2404: have looked scornfully at her, but baby crows and holds out his little
2405: arms none the less blithely; Mrs. Tomkins may have left off calling on
2406: her, but her husband comes home none the less to receive her care and
2407: caresses; it has been wet and gloomy out of doors to-day, but she has
2408: looked well after the shirt buttons, has cut out baby’s pinafores, and
2409: half finished Willy’s blouse.
2410: 
2411: So it was with Milly. She was only vexed that her husband should be
2412: vexed--only wounded because he was misconceived. But the difficulty about
2413: ways and means she felt in quite a different manner. Her rectitude was
2414: alarmed lest they should have to make tradesmen wait for their money; her
2415: motherly love dreaded the diminution of comforts for the children; and
2416: the sense of her own failing health gave exaggerated force to these
2417: fears.
2418: 
2419: Milly could no longer shut her eyes to the fact, that the Countess was
2420: inconsiderate, if she did not allow herself to entertain severer
2421: thoughts; and she began to feel that it would soon be a duty to tell her
2422: frankly that they really could not afford to have her visit farther
2423: prolonged. But a process was going forward in two other minds, which
2424: ultimately saved Milly from having to perform this painful task.
2425: 
2426: In the first place, the Countess was getting weary of Shepperton--weary
2427: of waiting for her brother’s overtures which never came; so, one fine
2428: morning, she reflected that forgiveness was a Christian duty, that a
2429: sister should be placable, that Mr. Bridmain must feel the need of her
2430: advice, to which he had been accustomed for three years, and that very
2431: likely ‘that woman’ didn’t make the poor man happy. In this amiable frame
2432: of mind she wrote a very affectionate appeal, and addressed it to Mr.
2433: Bridmain, through his banker.
2434: 
2435: Another mind that was being wrought up to a climax was Nanny’s, the
2436: maid-of-all-work, who had a warm heart and a still warmer temper. Nanny
2437: adored her mistress: she had been heard to say, that she was ‘ready to
2438: kiss the ground as the missis trod on’; and Walter, she considered, was
2439: _her_ baby, of whom she was as jealous as a lover. But she had, from the
2440: first, very slight admiration for the Countess Czerlaski. That lady, from
2441: Nanny’s point of view, was a personage always ‘drawed out i’ fine
2442: clothes’, the chief result of whose existence was to cause additional
2443: bed-making, carrying of hot water, laying of table-cloths, and cooking of
2444: dinners. It was a perpetually heightening ‘aggravation’ to Nanny that she
2445: and her mistress had to ‘slave’ more than ever, because there was this
2446: fine lady in the house.
2447: 
2448: ‘An’ she pays nothin’ for’t neither,’ observed Nanny to Mr. Jacob Tomms,
2449: a young gentleman in the tailoring line, who occasionally--simply out of
2450: a taste for dialogue--looked into the vicarage kitchen of an evening. ‘I
2451: know the master’s shorter o’ money than iver, an’ it meks no end o’
2452: difference i’ th’ housekeepin’--her bein’ here, besides bein’ obliged to
2453: have a charwoman constant.’
2454: 
2455: ‘There’s fine stories i’ the village about her,’ said Mr. Tomms. ‘They
2456: say as Muster Barton’s great wi’ her, or else she’d niver stop here.’
2457: 
2458: ‘Then they say a passill o’ lies, an’ you ought to be ashamed to go an’
2459: tell ’em o’er again. Do _you_ think as the master, as has got a wife like
2460: the missis, ’ud go running arter a stuck-up piece o’ goods like that
2461: Countess, as isn’t fit to black the missis’s shoes? I’m none so fond o’
2462: the master, but I know better on him nor that.’
2463: 
2464: ‘Well, I didn’t b’lieve it,’ said Mr. Tomms, humbly.
2465: 
2466: ‘B’lieve it? you’d ha’ been a ninny if yer did. An’ she’s a nasty, stingy
2467: thing, that Countess. She’s niver giv me a sixpence nor an old rag
2468: neither, sin’ here’s she’s been. A-lyin’ a bed an a-comin’ down to
2469: breakfast when other folks wants their dinner!’
2470: 
2471: If such was the state of Nanny’s mind as early as the end of August, when
2472: this dialogue with Mr. Tomms occurred, you may imagine what it must have
2473: been by the beginning of November, and that at that time a very slight
2474: spark might any day cause the long-smouldering anger to flame forth in
2475: open indignation.
2476: 
2477: That spark happened to fall the very morning that Mrs. Hackit paid the
2478: visit to Mrs. Patten, recorded in the last chapter. Nanny’s dislike of
2479: the Countess extended to the innocent dog Jet, whom she ‘couldn’t a-bear
2480: to see made a fuss wi’ like a Christian. An’ the little ouzle must be
2481: washed, too, ivery Saturday, as if there wasn’t children enoo to wash,
2482: wi’out washin’ dogs.’
2483: 
2484: Now this particular morning it happened that Milly was quite too
2485: poorly to get up, and Mr. Barton observed to Nanny, on going out, that
2486: he would call and tell Mr. Brand to come. These circumstances were
2487: already enough to make Nanny anxious and susceptible. But the Countess,
2488: comfortably ignorant of them, came down as usual about eleven o’clock
2489: to her separate breakfast, which stood ready for her at that hour in
2490: the parlour; the kettle singing on the hob that she might make her own
2491: tea. There was a little jug of cream, taken according to custom from
2492: last night’s milk, and specially saved for the Countess’s breakfast.
2493: Jet always awaited his mistress at her bedroom door, and it was her
2494: habit to carry him down-stairs.
2495: 
2496: ‘Now, my little Jet,’ she said, putting him down gently on the
2497: hearth-rug, ‘you shall have a nice, nice breakfast.’
2498: 
2499: Jet indicated that he thought that observation extremely pertinent and
2500: well-timed, by immediately raising himself on his hind-legs, and the
2501: Countess emptied the cream-jug into the saucer. Now there was usually a
2502: small jug of milk standing on the tray by the side of the cream, and
2503: destined for Jet’s breakfast, but this morning Nanny, being ‘moithered’,
2504: had forgotten that part of the arrangements, so that when the Countess
2505: had made her tea, she perceived there was no second jug, and rang the
2506: bell. Nanny appeared, looking very red and heated--the fact was, she had
2507: been ‘doing up’ the kitchen fire, and that is a sort of work which by no
2508: means conduces to blandness of temper. ‘Nanny, you have forgotten Jet’s
2509: milk; will you bring me some more cream, please?’
2510: 
2511: This was just a little too much for Nanny’s forbearance. ‘Yes, I dare
2512: say. Here am I wi’ my hands full o’ the children an’ the dinner, and
2513: missis ill a-bed, and Mr. Brand a-comin’; and I must run o’er the village
2514: to get more cream, ’cause you’ve give it to that nasty little
2515: blackamoor.’
2516: 
2517: ‘Is Mrs. Barton ill?’
2518: 
2519: ‘Ill--yes--I should think she _is_ ill, an’ much you care. She’s likely to
2520: be ill, moithered as _she_ is from mornin’ to night, wi’ folks as had
2521: better be elsewhere.’
2522: 
2523: ‘What do you mean by behaving in this way?’
2524: 
2525: ‘Mean? Why I mean as the missis is a slavin’ her life out an’ a-sittin’
2526: up o’nights, for folks as are better able to wait of _her_, i’stid o’
2527: lyin’ a-bed an’ doin’ nothin’ all the blessed day, but mek work.’
2528: 
2529: ‘Leave the room and don’t be insolent.’
2530: 
2531: ‘Insolent! I’d better be insolent than like what some folks is,--a-livin’
2532: on other folks, an’ bringin’ a bad name on ’em into the bargain.’
2533: 
2534: Here Nanny flung out of the room, leaving the lady to digest this
2535: unexpected breakfast at her leisure.
2536: 
2537: The Countess was stunned for a few minutes, but when she began to recall
2538: Nanny’s words, there was no possibility of avoiding very unpleasant
2539: conclusions from them, or of failing to see her position at the Vicarage
2540: in an entirely new light. The interpretation too of Nanny’s allusion to a
2541: ‘bad name’ did not lie out of the reach of the Countess’s imagination,
2542: and she saw the necessity of quitting Shepperton without delay. Still,
2543: she would like to wait for her brother’s letter--no--she would ask Milly
2544: to forward it to her--still better, she would go at once to London,
2545: inquire her brother’s address at his banker’s, and go to see him without
2546: preliminary.
2547: 
2548: She went up to Milly’s room, and, after kisses and inquiries, said--‘I
2549: find, on consideration, dear Milly, from the letter I had yesterday, that
2550: I must bid you good-bye and go up to London at once. But you must not let
2551: me leave you ill, you naughty thing.’
2552: 
2553: ‘Oh no,’ said Milly, who felt as if a load had been taken off her back,
2554: ‘I shall be very well in an hour or two. Indeed, I’m much better now. You
2555: will want me to help you to pack. But you won’t go for two or three
2556: days?’
2557: 
2558: ‘Yes, I must go to-morrow. But I shall not let you help me to pack, so
2559: don’t entertain any unreasonable projects, but lie still. Mr. Brand is
2560: coming, Nanny says.’
2561: 
2562: The news was not an unpleasant surprise to Mr. Barton when he came home,
2563: though he was able to express more regret at the idea of parting than
2564: Milly could summon to her lips. He retained more of his original feeling
2565: for the Countess than Milly did, for women never betray themselves to men
2566: as they do to each other; and the Rev. Amos had not a keen instinct for
2567: character. But he felt that he was being relieved from a difficulty, and
2568: in the way that was easiest for him. Neither he nor Milly suspected that
2569: it was Nanny who had cut the knot for them, for the Countess took care to
2570: give no sign on that subject. As for Nanny, she was perfectly aware of
2571: the relation between cause and effect in the affair, and secretly
2572: chuckled over her outburst of ‘sauce’ as the best morning’s work she had
2573: ever done.
2574: 
2575: So, on Friday morning, a fly was seen standing at the Vicarage gate with
2576: the Countess’s boxes packed upon it; and presently that lady herself was
2577: seen getting into the vehicle. After a last shake of the hand to Mr.
2578: Barton, and last kisses to Milly and the children, the door was closed;
2579: and as the fly rolled off, the little party at the Vicarage gate caught a
2580: last glimpse of the handsome Countess leaning and waving kisses from the
2581: carriage window. Jet’s little black phiz was also seen, and doubtless he
2582: had his thoughts and feelings on the occasion, but he kept them strictly
2583: within his own bosom.
2584: 
2585: The schoolmistress opposite witnessed this departure, and lost no time in
2586: telling it to the schoolmaster, who again communicated the news to the
2587: landlord of ‘The Jolly Colliers’, at the close of the morning
2588: school-hours. Nanny poured the joyful tidings into the ear of Mr.
2589: Farquhar’s footman, who happened to call with a letter, and Mr. Brand
2590: carried them to all the patients he visited that morning, after calling
2591: on Mrs. Barton. So that, before Sunday, it was very generally known in
2592: Shepperton parish that the Countess Czerlaski had left the Vicarage.
2593: 
2594: The Countess had left, but alas, the bills she had contributed to swell
2595: still remained; so did the exiguity of the children’s clothing, which
2596: also was partly an indirect consequence of her presence; and so, too, did
2597: the coolness and alienation in the parishioners, which could not at once
2598: vanish before the fact of her departure. The Rev. Amos was not
2599: exculpated--the past was not expunged. But what was worse than all,
2600: Milly’s health gave frequent cause for alarm, and the prospect of baby’s
2601: birth was overshadowed by more than the usual fears. The birth came
2602: prematurely, about six weeks after the Countess’s departure, but Mr.
2603: Brand gave favourable reports to all inquirers on the following day,
2604: which was Saturday. On Sunday, after morning service, Mrs. Hackit called
2605: at the Vicarage to inquire how Mrs. Barton was, and was invited up-stairs
2606: to see her. Milly lay placid and lovely in her feebleness, and held out
2607: her hand to Mrs. Hackit with a beaming smile. It was very pleasant to her
2608: to see her old friend unreserved and cordial once more. The seven months’
2609: baby was very tiny and very red, but ‘handsome is that handsome does’--he
2610: was pronounced to be ‘doing well’, and Mrs. Hackit went home gladdened at
2611: heart to think that the perilous hour was over.
2612: 
2613: 
2614: 
2615: 
2616: Chapter 8
2617: 
2618: 
2619: The following Wednesday, when Mr. and Mrs. Hackit were seated comfortably
2620: by their bright hearth, enjoying the long afternoon afforded by an early
2621: dinner, Rachel, the housemaid, came in and said,--‘If you please ’m, the
2622: shepherd says, have you heard as Mrs. Barton’s wuss, and not expected to
2623: live?’
2624: 
2625: Mrs. Hackit turned pale, and hurried out to question the shepherd, who,
2626: she found, had heard the sad news at an alehouse in the village. Mr.
2627: Hackit followed her out and said, ‘Thee’dst better have the pony-chaise,
2628: and go directly.’
2629: 
2630: ‘Yes,’ said Mrs. Hackit, too much overcome to utter any exclamations.
2631: ‘Rachel, come an’ help me on wi’ my things.’
2632: 
2633: When her husband was wrapping her cloak round her feet in the
2634: pony-chaise, she said,--‘If I don’t come home to-night, I shall send back
2635: the pony-chaise, and you’ll know I’m wanted there.’
2636: 
2637: ‘Yes, yes.’
2638: 
2639: It was a bright frosty day, and by the time Mrs. Hackit arrived at the
2640: Vicarage, the sun was near its setting. There was a carriage and pair
2641: standing at the gate, which she recognized as Dr Madeley’s, the physician
2642: from Rotherby. She entered at the kitchen door that she might avoid
2643: knocking, and quietly question Nanny. No one was in the kitchen, but,
2644: passing on, she saw the sitting-room door open, and Nanny, with Walter in
2645: her arms, removing the knives and forks, which had been laid for dinner
2646: three hours ago.
2647: 
2648: ‘Master says he can’t eat no dinner,’ was Nanny’s first word. ‘He’s never
2649: tasted nothin’ sin’ yesterday mornin’, but a cup o’ tea.’
2650: 
2651: ‘When was your missis took worse?’
2652: 
2653: ‘O’ Monday night. They sent for Dr Madeley i’ the middle o’ the day
2654: yisterday, an’ he’s here again now.’
2655: 
2656: ‘Is the baby alive?’
2657: 
2658: ‘No, it died last night. The children’s all at Mrs. Bond’s. She come and
2659: took ’em away last night, but the master says they must be fetched soon.
2660: He’s up-stairs now, wi’ Dr Madeley and Mr. Brand.’
2661: 
2662: At this moment Mrs. Hackit heard the sound of a heavy, slow foot, in the
2663: passage; and presently Amos Barton entered, with dry despairing eyes,
2664: haggard and unshaven. He expected to find the sitting-room as he left it,
2665: with nothing to meet his eyes but Milly’s work-basket in the corner of
2666: the sofa, and the children’s toys overturned in the bow-window. But when
2667: he saw Mrs. Hackit come towards him with answering sorrow in her face,
2668: the pent-up fountain of tears was opened; he threw himself on the sofa,
2669: hid his face, and sobbed aloud.
2670: 
2671: ‘Bear up, Mr. Barton,’ Mrs. Hackit ventured to say at last; ‘bear up, for
2672: the sake o’ them dear children.’
2673: 
2674: ‘The children,’ said Amos, starting up. ‘They must be sent for. Some one
2675: must fetch them. Milly will want to ...’
2676: 
2677: He couldn’t finish the sentence, but Mrs. Hackit understood him, and
2678: said, ‘I’ll send the man with the pony-carriage for ’em.’
2679: 
2680: She went out to give the order, and encountered Dr Madeley and Mr. Brand,
2681: who were just going.
2682: 
2683: Mr. Brand said: ‘I am very glad to see you are here, Mrs. Hackit. No time
2684: must be lost in sending for the children. Mrs. Barton wants to see them.’
2685: 
2686: ‘Do you quite give her up then?’
2687: 
2688: ‘She can hardly live through the night. She begged us to tell her how
2689: long she had to live; and then asked for the children.’
2690: 
2691: The pony-carriage was sent; and Mrs. Hackit, returning to Mr. Barton,
2692: said she would like to go up-stairs now. He went up-stairs with her and
2693: opened the door. The chamber fronted the west; the sun was just setting,
2694: and the red light fell full upon the bed, where Milly lay with the hand
2695: of death visibly upon her. The feather-bed had been removed, and she lay
2696: low on a mattress, with her head slightly raised by pillows. Her long
2697: fair neck seemed to be struggling with a painful effort; her features
2698: were pallid and pinched, and her eyes were closed. There was no one in
2699: the room but the nurse, and the mistress of the free school, who had come
2700: to give her help from the beginning of the change.
2701: 
2702: Amos and Mrs. Hackit stood beside the bed, and Milly opened her eyes.
2703: 
2704: ‘My darling, Mrs. Hackit is come to see you.’
2705: 
2706: Milly smiled and looked at her with that strange, far-off look which
2707: belongs to ebbing life.
2708: 
2709: ‘Are the children coming?’ she said, painfully.
2710: 
2711: ‘Yes, they will be here directly.’
2712: 
2713: She closed her eyes again.
2714: 
2715: Presently the pony-carriage was heard; and Amos, motioning to Mrs. Hackit
2716: to follow him, left the room. On their way down-stairs, she suggested that
2717: the carriage should remain to take them away again afterwards, and Amos
2718: assented.
2719: 
2720: There they stood in the melancholy sitting-room--the five sweet children,
2721: from Patty to Chubby--all, with their mother’s eyes--all, except Patty,
2722: looking up with a vague fear at their father as he entered. Patty
2723: understood the great sorrow that was come upon them, and tried to check
2724: her sobs as she heard her papa’s footsteps.
2725: 
2726: ‘My children,’ said Amos, taking Chubby in his arms, ‘God is going to
2727: take away your dear mamma from us. She wants to see you to say good-bye.
2728: You must try to be very good and not cry.’
2729: 
2730: He could say no more, but turned round to see if Nanny was there with
2731: Walter, and then led the way up-stairs, leading Dickey with the other
2732: hand. Mrs. Hackit followed with Sophy and Patty, and then came Nanny with
2733: Walter and Fred.
2734: 
2735: It seemed as if Milly had heard the little footsteps on the stairs, for
2736: when Amos entered her eyes were wide open, eagerly looking towards the
2737: door. They all stood by the bedside--Amos nearest to her, holding Chubby
2738: and Dickey. But she motioned for Patty to come first, and clasping the
2739: poor pale child by the hand, said,--‘Patty, I’m going away from you. Love
2740: your papa. Comfort him; and take care of your little brothers and
2741: sisters. God will help you.’
2742: 
2743: Patty stood perfectly quiet, and said, ‘Yes, mamma.’
2744: 
2745: The mother motioned with her pallid lips for the dear child to lean
2746: towards her and kiss her; and then Patty’s great anguish overcame her,
2747: and she burst into sobs. Amos drew her towards him and pressed her head
2748: gently to him, while Milly beckoned Fred and Sophy, and said to them more
2749: faintly,--‘Patty will try to be your mamma when I am gone, my darlings.
2750: You will be good and not vex her.’
2751: 
2752: They leaned towards her, and she stroked their fair heads, and kissed
2753: their tear-stained cheeks. They cried because mamma was ill and papa
2754: looked so unhappy; but they thought, perhaps next week things would be as
2755: they used to be again.
2756: 
2757: The little ones were lifted on the bed to kiss her. Little Walter said,
2758: ‘Mamma, mamma’, and stretched out his fat arms and smiled; and Chubby
2759: seemed gravely wondering; but Dickey, who had been looking fixedly at
2760: her, with lip hanging down, ever since he came into the room, now seemed
2761: suddenly pierced with the idea that mamma was going away somewhere; his
2762: little heart swelled and he cried aloud.
2763: 
2764: Then Mrs. Hackit and Nanny took them all away. Patty at first begged to
2765: stay at home and not go to Mrs. Bond’s again; but when Nanny reminded her
2766: that she had better go to take care of the younger ones, she submitted at
2767: once, and they were all packed in the pony-carriage once more.
2768: 
2769: Milly kept her eyes shut for some time after the children were gone. Amos
2770: had sunk on his knees, and was holding her hand while he watched her
2771: face. By-and-by she opened her eyes, and, drawing him close to her,
2772: whispered slowly,--‘My dear--dear--husband--you have been--very--good to
2773: me. You--have--made me--very--happy.’
2774: 
2775: She spoke no more for many hours. They watched her breathing becoming
2776: more and more difficult, until evening deepened into night, and until
2777: midnight was past. About half-past twelve she seemed to be trying to
2778: speak, and they leaned to catch her words. ‘Music--music--didn’t you hear
2779: it?’
2780: 
2781: Amos knelt by the bed and held her hand in his. He did not believe in his
2782: sorrow. It was a bad dream. He did not know when she was gone. But Mr.
2783: Brand, whom Mrs. Hackit had sent for before twelve o’clock, thinking that
2784: Mr. Barton might probably need his help, now came up to him, and
2785: said,--‘She feels no more pain now. Come, my dear sir, come with me.’
2786: 
2787: ‘She isn’t _dead_?’ shrieked the poor desolate man, struggling to shake
2788: off Mr. Brand, who had taken him by the arm. But his weary weakened frame
2789: was not equal to resistance, and he was dragged out of the room.
2790: 
2791: 
2792: 
2793: 
2794: Chapter 9
2795: 
2796: 
2797: They laid her in the grave--the sweet mother with her baby in her
2798: arms--while the Christmas snow lay thick upon the graves. It was Mr.
2799: Cleves who buried her. On the first news of Mr. Barton’s calamity, he had
2800: ridden over from Tripplegate to beg that he might be made of some use,
2801: and his silent grasp of Amos’s hand had penetrated like the painful
2802: thrill of life-recovering warmth to the poor benumbed heart of the
2803: stricken man.
2804: 
2805: The snow lay thick upon the graves, and the day was cold and dreary; but
2806: there was many a sad eye watching that black procession as it passed from
2807: the vicarage to the church, and from the church to the open grave. There
2808: were men and women standing in that churchyard who had bandied vulgar
2809: jests about their pastor, and who had lightly charged him with sin; but
2810: now, when they saw him following the coffin, pale and haggard, he was
2811: consecrated anew by his great sorrow, and they looked at him with
2812: respectful pity.
2813: 
2814: All the children were there, for Amos had willed it so, thinking that
2815: some dim memory of that sacred moment might remain even with little
2816: Walter, and link itself with what he would hear of his sweet mother in
2817: after years. He himself led Patty and Dickey; then came Sophy and Fred;
2818: Mr. Brand had begged to carry Chubby, and Nanny followed with Walter.
2819: They made a circle round the grave while the coffin was being lowered.
2820: Patty alone of all the children felt that mamma was in that coffin, and
2821: that a new and sadder life had begun for papa and herself. She was pale
2822: and trembling, but she clasped his hand more firmly as the coffin went
2823: down, and gave no sob. Fred and Sophy, though they were only two and
2824: three years younger, and though they had seen mamma in her coffin, seemed
2825: to themselves to be looking at some strange show. They had not learned to
2826: decipher that terrible handwriting of human destiny, illness and death.
2827: Dickey had rebelled against his black clothes, until he was told that it
2828: would be naughty to mamma not to put them on, when he at once submitted;
2829: and now, though he had heard Nanny say that mamma was in heaven, he had a
2830: vague notion that she would come home again to-morrow, and say he had been
2831: a good boy and let him empty her work-box. He stood close to his father,
2832: with great rosy cheeks, and wide open blue eyes, looking first up at Mr.
2833: Cleves and then down at the coffin, and thinking he and Chubby would play
2834: at that when they got home.
2835: 
2836: The burial was over, and Amos turned with his children to re-enter the
2837: house--the house where, an hour ago, Milly’s dear body lay, where the
2838: windows were half darkened, and sorrow seemed to have a hallowed precinct
2839: for itself, shut out from the world. But now she was gone; the broad
2840: snow-reflected daylight was in all the rooms; the Vicarage again seemed
2841: part of the common working-day world, and Amos, for the first time, felt
2842: that he was alone--that day after day, month after month, year after
2843: year, would have to be lived through without Milly’s love. Spring would
2844: come, and she would not be there; summer, and she would not be there; and
2845: he would never have her again with him by the fireside in the long
2846: evenings. The seasons all seemed irksome to his thoughts; and how dreary
2847: the sunshiny days that would be sure to come! She was gone from him; and
2848: he could never show her his love any more, never make up for omissions in
2849: the past by filling future days with tenderness.
2850: 
2851: O the anguish of that thought that we can never atone to our dead for the
2852: stinted affection we gave them, for the light answers we returned to
2853: their plaints or their pleadings, for the little reverence we showed to
2854: that sacred human soul that lived so close to us, and was the divinest
2855: thing God had given us to know.
2856: 
2857: Amos Barton had been an affectionate husband, and while Milly was with
2858: him, he was never visited by the thought that perhaps his sympathy with
2859: her was not quick and watchful enough; but now he re-lived all their life
2860: together, with that terrible keenness of memory and imagination which
2861: bereavement gives, and he felt as if his very love needed a pardon for
2862: its poverty and selfishness.
2863: 
2864: No outward solace could counteract the bitterness of this inward woe. But
2865: outward solace came. Cold faces looked kind again, and parishioners
2866: turned over in their minds what they could best do to help their pastor.
2867: Mr. Oldinport wrote to express his sympathy, and enclosed another
2868: twenty-pound note, begging that he might be permitted to contribute in
2869: this way to the relief of Mr. Barton’s mind from pecuniary anxieties,
2870: under the pressure of a grief which all his parishioners must share; and
2871: offering his interest towards placing the two eldest girls in a school
2872: expressly founded for clergymen’s daughters. Mr. Cleves succeeded in
2873: collecting thirty pounds among his richer clerical brethren, and, adding
2874: ten pounds himself, sent the sum to Amos, with the kindest and most
2875: delicate words of Christian fellowship and manly friendship. Miss Jackson
2876: forgot old grievances, and came to stay some months with Milly’s
2877: children, bringing such material aid as she could spare from her small
2878: income. These were substantial helps, which relieved Amos from the
2879: pressure of his money difficulties; and the friendly attentions, the kind
2880: pressure of the hand, the cordial looks he met with everywhere in his
2881: parish, made him feel that the fatal frost which had settled on his
2882: pastoral duties, during the Countess’s residence at the Vicarage, was
2883: completely thawed, and that the hearts of his parishioners were once more
2884: open to him. No one breathed the Countess’s name now; for Milly’s memory
2885: hallowed her husband, as of old the place was hallowed on which an angel
2886: from God had alighted.
2887: 
2888: When the spring came, Mrs. Hackit begged that she might have Dickey to
2889: stay with her, and great was the enlargement of Dickey’s experience from
2890: that visit. Every morning he was allowed--being well wrapt up as to his
2891: chest by Mrs. Hackit’s own hands, but very bare and red as to his
2892: legs--to run loose in the cow and poultry yard, to persecute the
2893: turkey-cock by satirical imitations of his gobble-gobble, and to put
2894: difficult questions to the groom as to the reasons why horses had four
2895: legs, and other transcendental matters. Then Mr. Hackit would take Dickey
2896: up on horseback when he rode round his farm, and Mrs. Hackit had a large
2897: plumcake in cut, ready to meet incidental attacks of hunger. So that
2898: Dickey had considerably modified his views as to the desirability of Mrs.
2899: Hackit’s kisses.
2900: 
2901: The Misses Farquhar made particular pets of Fred and Sophy, to whom they
2902: undertook to give lessons twice a-week in writing and geography; and Mrs.
2903: Farquhar devised many treats for the little ones. Patty’s treat was to
2904: stay at home, or walk about with her papa; and when he sat by the fire in
2905: an evening, after the other children were gone to bed, she would bring a
2906: stool, and, placing it against his feet, would sit down upon it and lean
2907: her head against his knee. Then his hand would rest on that fair head,
2908: and he would feel that Milly’s love was not quite gone out of his life.
2909: 
2910: So the time wore on till it was May again, and the church was quite
2911: finished and reopened in all its new splendour, and Mr. Barton was
2912: devoting himself with more vigour than ever to his parochial duties. But
2913: one morning--it was a very bright morning, and evil tidings sometimes
2914: like to fly in the finest weather--there came a letter for Mr. Barton,
2915: addressed in the Vicar’s handwriting. Amos opened it with some
2916: anxiety--somehow or other he had a presentiment of evil. The letter
2917: contained the announcement that Mr. Carpe had resolved on coming to
2918: reside at Shepperton, and that, consequently, in six months from that
2919: time Mr. Barton’s duties as curate in that parish would be closed.
2920: 
2921: O, it was hard! Just when Shepperton had become the place where he most
2922: wished to stay--where he had friends who knew his sorrows--where he lived
2923: close to Milly’s grave. To part from that grave seemed like parting with
2924: Milly a second time; for Amos was one who clung to all the material links
2925: between his mind and the past. His imagination was not vivid, and
2926: required the stimulus of actual perception.
2927: 
2928: It roused some bitter feeling, too, to think that Mr. Carpe’s wish to
2929: reside at Shepperton was merely a pretext for removing Mr. Barton, in
2930: order that he might ultimately give the curacy of Shepperton to his own
2931: brother-in-law, who was known to be wanting a new position.
2932: 
2933: Still, it must be borne; and the painful business of seeking another
2934: curacy must be set about without loss of time. After the lapse of some
2935: months, Amos was obliged to renounce the hope of getting one at all near
2936: Shepperton, and he at length resigned himself to accepting one in a
2937: distant county. The parish was in a large manufacturing town, where his
2938: walks would lie among noisy streets and dingy alleys, and where the
2939: children would have no garden to play in, no pleasant farm-houses to
2940: visit.
2941: 
2942: It was another blow inflicted on the bruised man.
2943: 
2944: 
2945: 
2946: 
2947: Chapter 10
2948: 
2949: 
2950: At length the dreaded week was come, when Amos and his children must
2951: leave Shepperton. There was general regret among the parishioners at his
2952: departure: not that any one of them thought his spiritual gifts
2953: pre-eminent, or was conscious of great edification from his ministry. But
2954: his recent troubles had called out their better sympathies, and that is
2955: always a source of love. Amos failed to touch the spring of goodness by
2956: his sermons, but he touched it effectually by his sorrows; and there was
2957: now a real bond between him and his flock.
2958: 
2959: ‘My heart aches for them poor motherless children,’ said Mrs. Hackit to
2960: her husband, ‘a-going among strangers, and into a nasty town, where
2961: there’s no good victuals to be had, and you must pay dear to get bad
2962: uns.’
2963: 
2964: Mrs. Hackit had a vague notion of a town life as a combination of dirty
2965: backyards, measly pork, and dingy linen.
2966: 
2967: The same sort of sympathy was strong among the poorer class of
2968: parishioners. Old stiff-jointed Mr. Tozer, who was still able to earn a
2969: little by gardening ‘jobs’, stopped Mrs. Cramp, the charwoman, on her way
2970: home from the Vicarage, where she had been helping Nanny to pack up the
2971: day before the departure, and inquired very particularly into Mr.
2972: Barton’s prospects.
2973: 
2974: ‘Ah, poor mon,’ he was heard to say, ‘I’m sorry for un. He hedn’t much
2975: here, but he’ll be wuss off theer. Half a loaf’s better nor ne’er un.’
2976: 
2977: The sad good-byes had all been said before that last evening; and after
2978: all the packing was done and all the arrangements were made, Amos felt
2979: the oppression of that blank interval in which one has nothing left to
2980: think of but the dreary future--the separation from the loved and
2981: familiar, and the chilling entrance on the new and strange. In every
2982: parting there is an image of death.
2983: 
2984: Soon after ten o’clock, when he had sent Nanny to bed, that she might
2985: have a good night’s rest before the fatigues of the morrow, he stole
2986: softly out to pay a last visit to Milly’s grave. It was a moonless night,
2987: but the sky was thick with stars, and their light was enough to show that
2988: the grass had grown long on the grave, and that there was a tombstone
2989: telling in bright letters, on a dark ground, that beneath were deposited
2990: the remains of Amelia, the beloved wife of Amos Barton, who died in the
2991: thirty-fifth year of her age, leaving a husband and six children to
2992: lament her loss. The final words of the inscription were, ‘Thy will be
2993: done.’
2994: 
2995: The husband was now advancing towards the dear mound from which he was so
2996: soon to be parted, perhaps for ever. He stood a few minutes reading over
2997: and over again the words on the tombstone, as if to assure himself that
2998: all the happy and unhappy past was a reality. For love is frightened at
2999: the intervals of insensibility and callousness that encroach by little
3000: and little on the dominion of grief, and it makes efforts to recall the
3001: keenness of the first anguish.
3002: 
3003: Gradually, as his eye dwelt on the words, ‘Amelia, the beloved wife,’ the
3004: waves of feeling swelled within his soul, and he threw himself on the
3005: grave, clasping it with his arms, and kissing the cold turf.
3006: 
3007: ‘Milly, Milly, dost thou hear me? I didn’t love thee enough--I wasn’t
3008: tender enough to thee--but I think of it all now.’
3009: 
3010: The sobs came and choked his utterance, and the warm tears fell.
3011: 
3012: 
3013: 
3014: 
3015: CONCLUSION
3016: 
3017: 
3018: Only once again in his life has Amos Barton visited Milly’s grave. It was
3019: in the calm and softened light of an autumnal afternoon, and he was not
3020: alone. He held on his arm a young woman, with a sweet, grave face, which
3021: strongly recalled the expression of Mrs. Barton’s, but was less lovely in
3022: form and colour. She was about thirty, but there were some premature
3023: lines round her mouth and eyes, which told of early anxiety.
3024: 
3025: Amos himself was much changed. His thin circlet of hair was nearly white,
3026: and his walk was no longer firm and upright. But his glance was calm, and
3027: even cheerful, and his neat linen told of a woman’s care. Milly did not
3028: take all her love from the earth when she died. She had left some of it
3029: in Patty’s heart.
3030: 
3031: All the other children were now grown up, and had gone their several
3032: ways. Dickey, you will be glad to hear, had shown remarkable talents as
3033: an engineer. His cheeks are still ruddy, in spite of mixed mathematics,
3034: and his eyes are still large and blue; but in other respects his person
3035: would present no marks of identification for his friend Mrs. Hackit, if
3036: she were to see him; especially now that her eyes must be grown very dim,
3037: with the wear of more than twenty additional years. He is nearly six feet
3038: high, and has a proportionately broad chest; he wears spectacles, and
3039: rubs his large white hands through a mass of shaggy brown hair. But I am
3040: sure you have no doubt that Mr. Richard Barton is a thoroughly good
3041: fellow, as well as a man of talent, and you will be glad any day to shake
3042: hands with him, for his own sake as well as his mother’s.
3043: 
3044: Patty alone remains by her father’s side, and makes the evening sunshine
3045: of his life.

3050: MR. GILFIL’S LOVE STORY
3051: 
3052: 
3053: 
3054: 
3055: Chapter 1
3056: 
3057: 
3058: When old Mr. Gilfil died, thirty years ago, there was general sorrow in
3059: Shepperton; and if black cloth had not been hung round the pulpit and
3060: reading-desk, by order of his nephew and principal legatee, the
3061: parishioners would certainly have subscribed the necessary sum out of
3062: their own pockets, rather than allow such a tribute of respect to be
3063: wanting. All the farmers’ wives brought out their black bombasines; and
3064: Mrs. Jennings, at the Wharf, by appearing the first Sunday after Mr.
3065: Gilfil’s death in her salmon-coloured ribbons and green shawl, excited
3066: the severest remark. To be sure, Mrs. Jennings was a new-comer, and
3067: town-bred, so that she could hardly be expected to have very clear
3068: notions of what was proper; but, as Mrs. Higgins observed in an undertone
3069: to Mrs. Parrot when they were coming out of church, ‘Her husband, who’d
3070: been born i’ the parish, might ha’ told her better.’ An unreadiness to
3071: put on black on all available occasions, or too great an alacrity in
3072: putting it off, argued, in Mrs. Higgins’s opinion, a dangerous levity of
3073: character, and an unnatural insensibility to the essential fitness of
3074: things.
3075: 
3076: ‘Some folks can’t a-bear to put off their colours,’ she remarked; ‘but
3077: that was never the way i’ _my_ family. Why, Mrs. Parrot, from the time I
3078: was married, till Mr. Higgins died, nine years ago come Candlemas, I
3079: niver was out o’ black two year together!’
3080: 
3081: ‘Ah,’ said Mrs. Parrot, who was conscious of inferiority in this respect,
3082: ‘there isn’t many families as have had so many deaths as yours, Mrs.
3083: Higgins.’
3084: 
3085: Mrs. Higgins, who was an elderly widow, ‘well left’, reflected with
3086: complacency that Mrs. Parrot’s observation was no more than just, and
3087: that Mrs. Jennings very likely belonged to a family which had had no
3088: funerals to speak of.
3089: 
3090: Even dirty Dame Fripp, who was a very rare church-goer, had been to Mrs.
3091: Hackit to beg a bit of old crape, and with this sign of grief pinned on
3092: her little coal-scuttle bonnet, was seen dropping her curtsy opposite the
3093: reading-desk. This manifestation of respect towards Mr. Gilfil’s memory
3094: on the part of Dame Fripp had no theological bearing whatever. It was due
3095: to an event which had occurred some years back, and which, I am sorry to
3096: say, had left that grimy old lady as indifferent to the means of grace as
3097: ever. Dame Fripp kept leeches, and was understood to have such remarkable
3098: influence over those wilful animals in inducing them to bite under the
3099: most unpromising circumstances, that though her own leeches were usually
3100: rejected, from a suspicion that they had lost their appetite, she herself
3101: was constantly called in to apply the more lively individuals furnished
3102: from Mr. Pilgrim’s surgery, when, as was very often the case, one of that
3103: clever man’s paying patients was attacked with inflammation. Thus Dame
3104: Fripp, in addition to ‘property’ supposed to yield her no less than
3105: half-a-crown a-week, was in the receipt of professional fees, the gross
3106: amount of which was vaguely estimated by her neighbours as ‘pouns an’
3107: pouns’. Moreover, she drove a brisk trade in lollipop with epicurean
3108: urchins, who recklessly purchased that luxury at the rate of two hundred
3109: per cent. Nevertheless, with all these notorious sources of income, the
3110: shameless old woman constantly pleaded poverty, and begged for scraps at
3111: Mrs. Hackit’s, who, though she always said Mrs. Fripp was ‘as false as
3112: two folks’, and no better than a miser and a heathen, had yet a leaning
3113: towards her as an old neighbour.
3114: 
3115: ‘There’s that case-hardened old Judy a-coming after the tea-leaves
3116: again,’ Mrs. Hackit would say; ‘an’ I’m fool enough to give ’em her,
3117: though Sally wants ’em all the while to sweep the floors with!’
3118: 
3119: Such was Dame Fripp, whom Mr. Gilfil, riding leisurely in top-boots and
3120: spurs from doing duty at Knebley one warm Sunday afternoon, observed
3121: sitting in the dry ditch near her cottage, and by her side a large pig,
3122: who, with that ease and confidence belonging to perfect friendship, was
3123: lying with his head in her lap, and making no effort to play the
3124: agreeable beyond an occasional grunt.
3125: 
3126: ‘Why, Mrs. Fripp,’ said the Vicar, ‘I didn’t know you had such a fine
3127: pig. You’ll have some rare flitches at Christmas!’
3128: 
3129: ‘Eh, God forbid! My son gev him me two ’ear ago, an’ he’s been company to
3130: me iver sin’. I couldn’t find i’ my heart to part wi’m, if I niver knowed
3131: the taste o’ bacon-fat again.’
3132: 
3133: ‘Why, he’ll eat his head off, and yours too. How can you go on keeping a
3134: pig, and making nothing by him?’
3135: 
3136: ‘O, he picks a bit hisself wi’ rootin’, and I dooant mind doing wi’out to
3137: gi’ him summat. A bit o’ company’s meat an’ drink too, an’ he follers me
3138: about, and grunts when I spake to’m, just like a Christian.’
3139: 
3140: Mr. Gilfil laughed, and I am obliged to admit that he said good-bye to
3141: Dame Fripp without asking her why she had not been to church, or making
3142: the slightest effort for her spiritual edification. But the next day he
3143: ordered his man David to take her a great piece of bacon, with a message,
3144: saying, the parson wanted to make sure that Mrs. Fripp would know the
3145: taste of bacon-fat again. So, when Mr. Gilfil died, Dame Fripp manifested
3146: her gratitude and reverence in the simply dingy fashion I have mentioned.
3147: 
3148: You already suspect that the Vicar did not shine in the more spiritual
3149: functions of his office; and indeed, the utmost I can say for him in this
3150: respect is, that he performed those functions with undeviating attention
3151: to brevity and despatch. He had a large heap of short sermons, rather
3152: yellow and worn at the edges, from which he took two every Sunday,
3153: securing perfect impartiality in the selection by taking them as they
3154: came, without reference to topics; and having preached one of these
3155: sermons at Shepperton in the morning, he mounted his horse and rode
3156: hastily with the other in his pocket to Knebley, where he officiated in a
3157: wonderful little church, with a checkered pavement which had once rung to
3158: the iron tread of military monks, with coats of arms in clusters on the
3159: lofty roof, marble warriors and their wives without noses occupying a
3160: large proportion of the area, and the twelve apostles, with their heads
3161: very much on one side, holding didactic ribbons, painted in fresco on the
3162: walls. Here, in an absence of mind to which he was prone, Mr. Gilfil
3163: would sometimes forget to take off his spurs before putting on his
3164: surplice, and only become aware of the omission by feeling something
3165: mysteriously tugging at the skirts of that garment as he stepped into the
3166: reading-desk. But the Knebley farmers would as soon have thought of
3167: criticizing the moon as their pastor. He belonged to the course of
3168: nature, like markets and toll-gates and dirty bank-notes; and being a
3169: vicar, his claim on their veneration had never been counteracted by an
3170: exasperating claim on their pockets. Some of them, who did not indulge in
3171: the superfluity of a covered cart without springs, had dined half an hour
3172: earlier than usual--that is to say, at twelve o’clock--in order to have
3173: time for their long walk through miry lanes, and present themselves duly
3174: in their places at two o’clock, when Mr. Oldinport and Lady Felicia, to
3175: whom Knebley Church was a sort of family temple, made their way among the
3176: bows and curtsies of their dependants to a carved and canopied pew in the
3177: chancel, diffusing as they went a delicate odour of Indian roses on the
3178: unsusceptible nostrils of the congregation.
3179: 
3180: The farmers’ wives and children sat on the dark oaken benches, but the
3181: husbands usually chose the distinctive dignity of a stall under one of
3182: the twelve apostles, where, when the alternation of prayers and responses
3183: had given place to the agreeable monotony of the sermon, Paterfamilias
3184: might be seen or heard sinking into a pleasant doze, from which he
3185: infallibly woke up at the sound of the concluding doxology. And then they
3186: made their way back again through the miry lanes, perhaps almost as much
3187: the better for this simple weekly tribute to what they knew of good and
3188: right, as many a more wakeful and critical congregation of the present
3189: day.
3190: 
3191: Mr. Gilfil, too, used to make his way home in the later years of his
3192: life, for he had given up the habit of dining at Knebley Abbey on a
3193: Sunday, having, I am sorry to say, had a very bitter quarrel with Mr.
3194: Oldinport, the cousin and predecessor of the Mr. Oldinport who flourished
3195: in the Rev. Amos Barton’s time. That quarrel was a sad pity, for the two
3196: had had many a good day’s hunting together when they were younger, and in
3197: those friendly times not a few members of the hunt envied Mr. Oldinport
3198: the excellent terms he was on with his vicar; for, as Sir Jasper Sitwell
3199: observed, ‘next to a man’s wife, there’s nobody can be such an infernal
3200: plague to you as a parson, always under your nose on your own estate.’
3201: 
3202: I fancy the original difference which led to the rupture was very slight;
3203: but Mr. Gilfil was of an extremely caustic turn, his satire having a
3204: flavour of originality which was quite wanting in his sermons; and as Mr.
3205: Oldinport’s armour of conscious virtue presented some considerable and
3206: conspicuous gaps, the Vicar’s keen-edged retorts probably made a few
3207: incisions too deep to be forgiven. Such, at least, was the view of the
3208: case presented by Mr. Hackit, who knew as much of the matter as any third
3209: person. For, the very week after the quarrel, when presiding at the
3210: annual dinner of the Association for the Prosecution of Felons, held at
3211: the Oldinport Arms, he contributed an additional zest to the conviviality
3212: on that occasion by informing the company that ‘the parson had given the
3213: squire a lick with the rough side of his tongue.’ The detection of the
3214: person or persons who had driven off Mr. Parrot’s heifer, could hardly
3215: have been more welcome news to the Shepperton tenantry, with whom Mr.
3216: Oldinport was in the worst odour as a landlord, having kept up his rents
3217: in spite of falling prices, and not being in the least stung to emulation
3218: by paragraphs in the provincial newspapers, stating that the Honourable
3219: Augustus Purwell, or Viscount Blethers, had made a return of ten per cent
3220: on their last rent-day. The fact was, Mr. Oldinport had not the slightest
3221: intention of standing for Parliament, whereas he had the strongest
3222: intention of adding to his unentailed estate. Hence, to the Shepperton
3223: farmers it was as good as lemon with their grog to know that the Vicar
3224: had thrown out sarcasms against the Squire’s charities, as little better
3225: than those of the man who stole a goose, and gave away the giblets in
3226: alms. For Shepperton, you observe, was in a state of Attic culture
3227: compared with Knebley; it had turnpike roads and a public opinion,
3228: whereas, in the Bœotian Knebley, men’s minds and waggons alike moved in
3229: the deepest of ruts, and the landlord was only grumbled at as a necessary
3230: and unalterable evil, like the weather, the weevils, and the turnip-fly.
3231: 
3232: Thus in Shepperton this breach with Mr. Oldinport tended only to heighten
3233: that good understanding which the Vicar had always enjoyed with the rest
3234: of his parishioners, from the generation whose children he had christened
3235: a quarter of a century before, down to that hopeful generation
3236: represented by little Tommy Bond, who had recently quitted frocks and
3237: trousers for the severe simplicity of a tight suit of corduroys, relieved
3238: by numerous brass buttons. Tommy was a saucy boy, impervious to all
3239: impressions of reverence, and excessively addicted to humming-tops and
3240: marbles, with which recreative resources he was in the habit of
3241: immoderately distending the pockets of his corduroys. One day, spinning
3242: his top on the garden-walk, and seeing the Vicar advance directly towards
3243: it, at that exciting moment when it was beginning to ‘sleep’
3244: magnificently, he shouted out with all the force of his lungs--‘Stop!
3245: don’t knock my top down, now!’ From that day ‘little Corduroys’ had been
3246: an especial favourite with Mr. Gilfil, who delighted to provoke his ready
3247: scorn and wonder by putting questions which gave Tommy the meanest
3248: opinion of his intellect.
3249: 
3250: ‘Well, little Corduroys, have they milked the geese to-day?’
3251: 
3252: ‘Milked the geese! why, they don’t milk the geese, you silly!’
3253: 
3254: ‘No! dear heart! why, how do the goslings live, then?’
3255: 
3256: The nutriment of goslings rather transcending Tommy’s observations in
3257: natural history, he feigned to understand this question in an exclamatory
3258: rather than an interrogatory sense, and became absorbed in winding up his
3259: top.
3260: 
3261: ‘Ah, I see you don’t know how the goslings live! But did you notice how
3262: it rained sugar-plums yesterday?’ (Here Tommy became attentive.) ‘Why,
3263: they fell into my pocket as I rode along. You look in my pocket and see
3264: if they didn’t.’ Tommy, without waiting to discuss the alleged
3265: antecedent, lost no time in ascertaining the presence of the agreeable
3266: consequent, for he had a well-founded belief in the advantages of diving
3267: into the Vicar’s pocket. Mr. Gilfil called it his wonderful pocket,
3268: because, as he delighted to tell the ‘young shavers’ and ‘two-shoes’--so
3269: he called all little boys and girls--whenever he put pennies into it,
3270: they turned into sugar-plums or gingerbread, or some other nice thing.
3271: Indeed, little Bessie Parrot, a flaxen-headed ‘two-shoes’, very white and
3272: fat as to her neck, always had the admirable directness and sincerity to
3273: salute him with the question--‘What zoo dot in zoo pottet?’
3274: 
3275: You can imagine, then, that the christening dinners were none the less
3276: merry for the presence of the parson. The farmers relished his society
3277: particularly, for he could not only smoke his pipe, and season the
3278: details of parish affairs with abundance of caustic jokes and proverbs,
3279: but, as Mr. Bond often said, no man knew more than the Vicar about the
3280: breed of cows and horses. He had grazing-land of his own about five miles
3281: off, which a bailiff, ostensibly a tenant, farmed under his direction;
3282: and to ride backwards and forwards, and look after the buying and selling
3283: of stock, was the old gentleman’s chief relaxation, now his hunting days
3284: were over. To hear him discussing the respective merits of the Devonshire
3285: breed and the short-horns, or the last foolish decision of the
3286: magistrates about a pauper, a superficial observer might have seen little
3287: difference, beyond his superior shrewdness, between the Vicar and his
3288: bucolic parishioners; for it was his habit to approximate his accent and
3289: mode of speech to theirs, doubtless because he thought it a mere
3290: frustration of the purposes of language to talk of ‘shear-hogs’ and
3291: ‘ewes’ to men who habitually said ‘sharrags’ and ‘yowes’. Nevertheless
3292: the farmers themselves were perfectly aware of the distinction between
3293: them and the parson, and had not at all the less belief in him as a
3294: gentleman and a clergyman for his easy speech and familiar manners. Mrs.
3295: Parrot smoothed her apron and set her cap right with the utmost
3296: solicitude when she saw the Vicar coming, made him her deepest curtsy,
3297: and every Christmas had a fat turkey ready to send him with her ‘duty’.
3298: And in the most gossiping colloquies with Mr. Gilfil, you might have
3299: observed that both men and women ‘minded their words’, and never became
3300: indifferent to his approbation.
3301: 
3302: The same respect attended him in his strictly clerical functions. The
3303: benefits of baptism were supposed to be somehow bound up with Mr.
3304: Gilfil’s personality, so metaphysical a distinction as that between a man
3305: and his office being, as yet, quite foreign to the mind of a good
3306: Shepperton Churchman, savouring, he would have thought, of Dissent on the
3307: very face of it. Miss Selina Parrot put off her marriage a whole month
3308: when Mr. Gilfil had an attack of rheumatism, rather than be married in a
3309: makeshift manner by the Milby curate.
3310: 
3311: ‘We’ve had a very good sermon this morning’, was the frequent remark,
3312: after hearing one of the old yellow series, heard with all the more
3313: satisfaction because it had been heard for the twentieth time; for to
3314: minds on the Shepperton level it is repetition, not novelty, that
3315: produces the strongest effect; and phrases, like tunes, are a long time
3316: making themselves at home in the brain.
3317: 
3318: Mr. Gilfil’s sermons, as you may imagine, were not of a highly doctrinal,
3319: still less of a polemical, cast. They perhaps did not search the
3320: conscience very powerfully; for you remember that to Mrs. Patten, who had
3321: listened to them thirty years, the announcement that she was a sinner
3322: appeared an uncivil heresy; but, on the other hand, they made no
3323: unreasonable demand on the Shepperton intellect--amounting, indeed, to
3324: little more than an expansion of the concise thesis, that those who do
3325: wrong will find it the worse for them, and those who do well will find it
3326: the better for them; the nature of wrong-doing being exposed in special
3327: sermons against lying, backbiting, anger, slothfulness, and the like; and
3328: well-doing being interpreted as honesty, truthfulness, charity, industry,
3329: and other common virtues, lying quite on the surface of life, and having
3330: very little to do with deep spiritual doctrine. Mrs. Patten understood
3331: that if she turned out ill-crushed cheeses, a just retribution awaited
3332: her; though, I fear, she made no particular application of the sermon on
3333: backbiting. Mrs. Hackit expressed herself greatly edified by the sermon
3334: on honesty, the allusion to the unjust weight and deceitful balance
3335: having a peculiar lucidity for her, owing to a recent dispute with her
3336: grocer; but I am not aware that she ever appeared to be much struck by
3337: the sermon on anger.
3338: 
3339: As to any suspicion that Mr. Gilfil did not dispense the pure Gospel, or
3340: any strictures on his doctrine and mode of delivery, such thoughts never
3341: visited the minds of the Shepperton parishioners--of those very
3342: parishioners who, ten or fifteen years later, showed themselves extremely
3343: critical of Mr. Barton’s discourses and demeanour. But in the interim
3344: they had tasted that dangerous fruit of the tree of knowledge--innovation
3345: which is well known to open the eyes, even in an uncomfortable manner. At
3346: present, to find fault with the sermon was regarded as almost equivalent
3347: to finding fault with religion itself. One Sunday, Mr. Hackit’s nephew,
3348: Master Tom Stokes, a flippant town youth, greatly scandalized his
3349: excellent relatives by declaring that he could write as good a sermon as
3350: Mr. Gilfil’s; whereupon Mr. Hackit sought to reduce the presumptuous
3351: youth to utter confusion, by offering him a sovereign if he would fulfil
3352: his vaunt. The sermon was written, however; and though it was not
3353: admitted to be anywhere within reach of Mr. Gilfil’s, it was yet so
3354: astonishingly like a sermon, having a text, three divisions, and a
3355: concluding exhortation beginning ‘And now, my brethren’, that the
3356: sovereign, though denied formally, was bestowed informally, and the
3357: sermon was pronounced, when Master Stokes’s back was turned, to be ‘an
3358: uncommon cliver thing’.
3359: 
3360: The Rev. Mr. Pickard, indeed, of the Independent Meeting, had stated, in
3361: a sermon preached at Rotheby, for the reduction of a debt on New Zion,
3362: built, with an exuberance of faith and a deficiency of funds, by seceders
3363: from the original Zion, that he lived in a parish where the Vicar was
3364: very ‘dark’, and in the prayers he addressed to his own congregation, he
3365: was in the habit of comprehensively alluding to the parishioners outside
3366: the chapel walls, as those who, ‘Gallio-like, cared for none of these
3367: things’. But I need hardly say that no church-goer ever came within
3368: earshot of Mr. Pickard.
3369: 
3370: It was not to the Shepperton farmers only that Mr. Gilfil’s society was
3371: acceptable; he was a welcome guest at some of the best houses in that
3372: part of the country. Old Sir Jasper Sitwell would have been glad to see
3373: him every week; and if you had seen him conducting Lady Sitwell in to
3374: dinner, or had heard him talking to her with quaint yet graceful
3375: gallantry, you would have inferred that the earlier period of his life
3376: had been passed in more stately society than could be found in
3377: Shepperton, and that his slipshod chat and homely manners were but like
3378: weather-stains on a fine old block of marble, allowing you still to see
3379: here and there the fineness of the grain, and the delicacy of the
3380: original tint. But in his later years these visits became a little too
3381: troublesome to the old gentleman, and he was rarely to be found anywhere
3382: of an evening beyond the bounds of his own parish--most frequently,
3383: indeed, by the side of his own sitting-room fire, smoking his pipe, and
3384: maintaining the pleasing antithesis of dryness and moisture by an
3385: occasional sip of gin-and-water.
3386: 
3387: Here I am aware that I have run the risk of alienating all my refined
3388: lady-readers, and utterly annihilating any curiosity they may have felt
3389: to know the details of Mr. Gilfil’s love-story. ‘Gin-and-water! foh! you
3390: may as well ask us to interest ourselves in the romance of a
3391: tallow-chandler, who mingles the image of his beloved with short dips and
3392: moulds.’
3393: 
3394: But in the first place, dear ladies, allow me to plead that
3395: gin-and-water, like obesity, or baldness, or the gout, does not exclude a
3396: vast amount of antecedent romance, any more than the neatly-executed
3397: ‘fronts’ which you may some day wear, will exclude your present
3398: possession of less expensive braids. Alas, alas! we poor mortals are
3399: often little better than wood-ashes--there is small sign of the sap, and
3400: the leafy freshness, and the bursting buds that were once there; but
3401: wherever we see wood-ashes, we know that all that early fullness of life
3402: must have been. I, at least, hardly ever look at a bent old man, or a
3403: wizened old woman, but I see also, with my mind’s eye, that Past of which
3404: they are the shrunken remnant, and the unfinished romance of rosy cheeks
3405: and bright eyes seems sometimes of feeble interest and significance,
3406: compared with that drama of hope and love which has long ago reached its
3407: catastrophe, and left the poor soul, like a dim and dusty stage, with all
3408: its sweet garden-scenes and fair perspectives overturned and thrust out
3409: of sight.
3410: 
3411: In the second place, let me assure you that Mr. Gilfil’s potations of
3412: gin-and-water were quite moderate. His nose was not rubicund; on the
3413: contrary, his white hair hung around a pale and venerable face. He drank
3414: it chiefly, I believe, because it was cheap; and here I find myself
3415: alighting on another of the Vicar’s weaknesses, which, if I had cared to
3416: paint a flattering portrait rather than a faithful one, I might have
3417: chosen to suppress. It is undeniable that, as the years advanced, Mr.
3418: Gilfil became, as Mr. Hackit observed, more and more ‘close-fisted’,
3419: though the growing propensity showed itself rather in the parsimony of
3420: his personal habits, than in withholding help from the needy. He was
3421: saving--so he represented the matter to himself--for a nephew, the only
3422: son of a sister who had been the dearest object, all but one, in his
3423: life. ‘The lad,’ he thought, ‘will have a nice little fortune to begin
3424: life with, and will bring his pretty young wife some day to see the spot
3425: where his old uncle lies. It will perhaps be all the better for his
3426: hearth that mine was lonely.’
3427: 
3428: Mr. Gilfil was a bachelor, then?
3429: 
3430: That is the conclusion to which you would probably have come if you had
3431: entered his sitting-room, where the bare tables, the large old-fashioned
3432: horse-hair chairs, and the threadbare Turkey carpet perpetually fumigated
3433: with tobacco, seemed to tell a story of wifeless existence that was
3434: contradicted by no portrait, no piece of embroidery, no faded bit of
3435: pretty triviality, hinting of taper-fingers and small feminine ambitions.
3436: And it was here that Mr. Gilfil passed his evenings, seldom with other
3437: society than that of Ponto, his old brown setter, who, stretched out at
3438: full length on the rug with his nose between his fore-paws, would wrinkle
3439: his brows and lift up his eyelids every now and then, to exchange a
3440: glance of mutual understanding with his master. But there was a chamber
3441: in Shepperton Vicarage which told a different story from that bare and
3442: cheerless dining-room--a chamber never entered by any one besides Mr.
3443: Gilfil and old Martha the housekeeper, who, with David her husband as
3444: groom and gardener, formed the Vicar’s entire establishment. The blinds
3445: of this chamber were always down, except once a-quarter, when Martha
3446: entered that she might air and clean it. She always asked Mr. Gilfil for
3447: the key, which he kept locked up in his bureau, and returned it to him
3448: when she had finished her task.
3449: 
3450: It was a touching sight that the daylight streamed in upon, as Martha
3451: drew aside the blinds and thick curtains, and opened the Gothic casement
3452: of the oriel window! On the little dressing-table there was a dainty
3453: looking-glass in a carved and gilt frame; bits of wax-candle were still
3454: in the branched sockets at the sides, and on one of these branches hung a
3455: little black lace kerchief; a faded satin pin-cushion, with the pins
3456: rusted in it, a scent-bottle, and a large green fan, lay on the table;
3457: and on a dressing-box by the side of the glass was a work-basket, and an
3458: unfinished baby-cap, yellow with age, lying in it. Two gowns, of a
3459: fashion long forgotten, were hanging on nails against the door, and a
3460: pair of tiny red slippers, with a bit of tarnished silver embroidery on
3461: them, were standing at the foot of the bed. Two or three water-colour
3462: drawings, views of Naples, hung upon the walls; and over the mantelpiece,
3463: above some bits of rare old china, two miniatures in oval frames. One of
3464: these miniatures represented a young man about seven-and-twenty, with a
3465: sanguine complexion, full lips, and clear candid grey eyes. The other was
3466: the likeness of a girl probably not more than eighteen, with small
3467: features, thin cheeks, a pale southern-looking complexion, and large dark
3468: eyes. The gentleman wore powder; the lady had her dark hair gathered away
3469: from her face, and a little cap, with a cherry-coloured bow, set on the
3470: top of her head--a coquettish head-dress, but the eyes spoke of sadness
3471: rather than of coquetry.
3472: 
3473: Such were the things that Martha had dusted and let the air upon, four
3474: times a-year, ever since she was a blooming lass of twenty; and she was
3475: now, in this last decade of Mr. Gilfil’s life, unquestionably on the
3476: wrong side of fifty. Such was the locked-up chamber in Mr. Gilfil’s
3477: house: a sort of visible symbol of the secret chamber in his heart, where
3478: he had long turned the key on early hopes and early sorrows, shutting up
3479: for ever all the passion and the poetry of his life.
3480: 
3481: There were not many people in the parish, besides Martha, who had any
3482: very distinct remembrance of Mr. Gilfil’s wife, or indeed who knew
3483: anything of her, beyond the fact that there was a marble tablet, with a
3484: Latin inscription in memory of her, over the vicarage pew. The
3485: parishioners who were old enough to remember her arrival were not
3486: generally gifted with descriptive powers, and the utmost you could gather
3487: from them was, that Mrs. Gilfil looked like a ‘furriner, wi’ such eyes,
3488: you can’t think, an’ a voice as went through you when she sung at
3489: church.’ The one exception was Mrs. Patten, whose strong memory and taste
3490: for personal narrative made her a great source of oral tradition in
3491: Shepperton. Mr. Hackit, who had not come into the parish until ten years
3492: after Mrs. Gilfil’s death, would often put old questions to Mrs. Patten
3493: for the sake of getting the old answers, which pleased him in the same
3494: way as passages from a favourite book, or the scenes of a familiar play,
3495: please more accomplished people.
3496: 
3497: ‘Ah, you remember well the Sunday as Mrs. Gilfil first come to church,
3498: eh, Mrs. Patten?’
3499: 
3500: ‘To be sure I do. It was a fine bright Sunday as ever was seen, just at
3501: the beginnin’ o’ hay harvest. Mr. Tarbett preached that day, and Mr.
3502: Gilfil sat i’ the pew with his wife. I think I see him now, a-leading her
3503: up the aisle, an’ her head not reachin’ much above his elber: a little
3504: pale woman, with eyes as black as sloes, an’ yet lookin’ blank-like, as
3505: if she see’d nothing with ’em.’
3506: 
3507: ‘I warrant she had her weddin’ clothes on?’ said Mr. Hackit.
3508: 
3509: ‘Nothin’ partikler smart--on’y a white hat tied down under her chin, an’
3510: a white Indy muslin gown. But you don’t know what Mr. Gilfil was in those
3511: times. He was fine an’ altered before you come into the parish. He’d a
3512: fresh colour then, an’ a bright look wi’ his eyes, as did your heart good
3513: to see. He looked rare and happy that Sunday; but somehow, I’d a feelin’
3514: as it wouldn’t last long. I’ve no opinion o’ furriners, Mr. Hackit, for
3515: I’ve travelled i’ their country with my lady in my time, an’ seen enough
3516: o’ their victuals an’ their nasty ways.’
3517: 
3518: ‘Mrs. Gilfil come from It’ly, didn’t she?’
3519: 
3520: ‘I reckon she did, but I niver could rightly hear about that. Mr. Gilfil
3521: was niver to be spoke to about her, and nobody else hereabout knowed
3522: anythin’. Howiver, she must ha’ come over pretty young, for she spoke
3523: English as well as you an’ me. It’s them Italians as has such fine
3524: voices, an’ Mrs. Gilfil sung, you never heared the like. He brought her
3525: here to have tea with me one afternoon, and says he, in his jovial way,
3526: “Now, Mrs. Patten, I want Mrs. Gilfil to see the neatest house, and drink
3527: the best cup o’ tea, in all Shepperton; you must show her your dairy and
3528: your cheese-room, and then she shall sing you a song.” An’ so she did;
3529: an’ her voice seemed sometimes to fill the room; an’ then it went low an’
3530: soft, as if it was whisperin’ close to your heart like.’
3531: 
3532: ‘You never heared her again, I reckon?’
3533: 
3534: ‘No; she was sickly then, and she died in a few months after. She wasn’t
3535: in the parish much more nor half a year altogether. She didn’t seem
3536: lively that afternoon, an’ I could see she didn’t care about the dairy,
3537: nor the cheeses, on’y she pretended, to please him. As for him, I niver
3538: see’d a man so wrapt up in a woman. He looked at her as if he was
3539: worshippin’ her, an’ as if he wanted to lift her off the ground ivery
3540: minute, to save her the trouble o’ walkin’. Poor man, poor man! It had
3541: like to ha’ killed him when she died, though he niver gev way, but went
3542: on ridin’ about and preachin’. But he was wore to a shadder, an’ his eyes
3543: used to look as dead--you wouldn’t ha’ knowed ’em.’
3544: 
3545: ‘She brought him no fortune?’
3546: 
3547: ‘Not she. All Mr. Gilfil’s property come by his mother’s side. There was
3548: blood an’ money too, there. It’s a thousand pities as he married i’ that
3549: way--a fine man like him, as might ha’ had the pick o’ the county, an’
3550: had his grandchildren about him now. An’ him so fond o’ children, too.’
3551: 
3552: In this manner Mrs. Patten usually wound up her reminiscences of the
3553: Vicar’s wife, of whom, you perceive, she knew but little. It was clear
3554: that the communicative old lady had nothing to tell of Mrs. Gilfil’s
3555: history previous to her arrival in Shepperton, and that she was
3556: unacquainted with Mr. Gilfil’s love-story.
3557: 
3558: But I, dear reader, am quite as communicative as Mrs. Patten, and much
3559: better informed; so that, if you care to know more about the Vicar’s
3560: courtship and marriage, you need only carry your imagination back to the
3561: latter end of the last century, and your attention forward into the next
3562: chapter.
3563: 
3564: 
3565: 
3566: 
3567: Chapter 2
3568: 
3569: 
3570: It is the evening of the 21st of June 1788. The day has been bright and
3571: sultry, and the sun will still be more than an hour above the horizon,
3572: but his rays, broken by the leafy fretwork of the elms that border the
3573: park, no longer prevent two ladies from carrying out their cushions and
3574: embroidery, and seating themselves to work on the lawn in front of
3575: Cheverel Manor. The soft turf gives way even under the fairy tread of the
3576: younger lady, whose small stature and slim figure rest on the tiniest of
3577: full-grown feet. She trips along before the elder, carrying the cushions,
3578: which she places in the favourite spot, just on the slope by a clump of
3579: laurels, where they can see the sunbeams sparkling among the
3580: water-lilies, and can be themselves seen from the dining-room windows.
3581: She has deposited the cushions, and now turns round, so that you may have
3582: a full view of her as she stands waiting the slower advance of the elder
3583: lady. You are at once arrested by her large dark eyes, which, in their
3584: inexpressive unconscious beauty, resemble the eyes of a fawn, and it is
3585: only by an effort of attention that you notice the absence of bloom on
3586: her young cheek, and the southern yellowish tint of her small neck and
3587: face, rising above the little black lace kerchief which prevents the too
3588: immediate comparison of her skin with her white muslin gown. Her large
3589: eyes seem all the more striking because the dark hair is gathered away
3590: from her face, under a little cap set at the top of her head, with a
3591: cherry-coloured bow on one side.
3592: 
3593: The elder lady, who is advancing towards the cushions, is cast in a very
3594: different mould of womanhood. She is tall, and looks the taller because
3595: her powdered hair is turned backward over a toupee, and surmounted by
3596: lace and ribbons. She is nearly fifty, but her complexion is still fresh
3597: and beautiful, with the beauty of an auburn blond; her proud pouting
3598: lips, and her head thrown a little backward as she walks, give an
3599: expression of hauteur which is not contradicted by the cold grey eye. The
3600: tucked-in kerchief, rising full over the low tight bodice of her blue
3601: dress, sets off the majestic form of her bust, and she treads the lawn as
3602: if she were one of Sir Joshua Reynolds’ stately ladies, who had suddenly
3603: stepped from her frame to enjoy the evening cool.
3604: 
3605: ‘Put the cushions lower, Caterina, that we may not have so much sun upon
3606: us,’ she called out, in a tone of authority, when still at some distance.
3607: Caterina obeyed, and they sat down, making two bright patches of red and
3608: white and blue on the green background of the laurels and the lawn, which
3609: would look none the less pretty in a picture because one of the women’s
3610: hearts was rather cold and the other rather sad.
3611: 
3612: And a charming picture Cheverel Manor would have made that evening, if
3613: some English Watteau had been there to paint it: the castellated house of
3614: grey-tinted stone, with the flickering sunbeams sending dashes of golden
3615: light across the many-shaped panes in the mullioned windows, and a great
3616: beech leaning athwart one of the flanking towers, and breaking, with its
3617: dark flattened boughs, the too formal symmetry of the front; the broad
3618: gravel-walk winding on the right, by a row of tall pines, alongside the
3619: pool--on the left branching out among swelling grassy mounds, surmounted
3620: by clumps of trees, where the red trunk of the Scotch fir glows in the
3621: descending sunlight against the bright green of limes and acacias; the
3622: great pool, where a pair of swans are swimming lazily with one leg tucked
3623: under a wing, and where the open water-lilies lie calmly accepting the
3624: kisses of the fluttering light-sparkles; the lawn, with its smooth
3625: emerald greenness, sloping down to the rougher and browner herbage of the
3626: park, from which it is invisibly fenced by a little stream that winds
3627: away from the pool, and disappears under a wooden bridge in the distant
3628: pleasure-ground; and on this lawn our two ladies, whose part in the
3629: landscape the painter, standing at a favourable point of view in the
3630: park, would represent with a few little dabs of red and white and blue.
3631: 
3632: Seen from the great Gothic windows of the dining-room, they had much more
3633: definiteness of outline, and were distinctly visible to the three
3634: gentlemen sipping their claret there, as two fair women in whom all three
3635: had a personal interest. These gentlemen were a group worth considering
3636: attentively; but any one entering that dining-room for the first time,
3637: would perhaps have had his attention even more strongly arrested by the
3638: room itself, which was so bare of furniture that it impressed one with
3639: its architectural beauty like a cathedral. A piece of matting stretched
3640: from door to door, a bit of worn carpet under the dining-table, and a
3641: sideboard in a deep recess, did not detain the eye for a moment from the
3642: lofty groined ceiling, with its richly-carved pendants, all of creamy
3643: white, relieved here and there by touches of gold. On one side, this
3644: lofty ceiling was supported by pillars and arches, beyond which a lower
3645: ceiling, a miniature copy of the higher one, covered the square
3646: projection which, with its three large pointed windows, formed the
3647: central feature of the building. The room looked less like a place to
3648: dine in than a piece of space enclosed simply for the sake of beautiful
3649: outline; and the small dining-table, with the party round it, seemed an
3650: odd and insignificant accident, rather than anything connected with the
3651: original purpose of the apartment.
3652: 
3653: But, examined closely, that group was far from insignificant; for the
3654: eldest, who was reading in the newspaper the last portentous proceedings
3655: of the French parliaments, and turning with occasional comments to his
3656: young companions, was as fine a specimen of the old English gentleman as
3657: could well have been found in those venerable days of cocked-hats and
3658: pigtails. His dark eyes sparkled under projecting brows, made more
3659: prominent by bushy grizzled eyebrows; but any apprehension of severity
3660: excited by these penetrating eyes, and by a somewhat aquiline nose, was
3661: allayed by the good-natured lines about the mouth, which retained all its
3662: teeth and its vigour of expression in spite of sixty winters. The
3663: forehead sloped a little from the projecting brows, and its peaked
3664: outline was made conspicuous by the arrangement of the profusely-powdered
3665: hair, drawn backward and gathered into a pigtail. He sat in a small hard
3666: chair, which did not admit the slightest approach to a lounge, and which
3667: showed to advantage the flatness of his back and the breadth of his
3668: chest. In fact, Sir Christopher Cheverel was a splendid old gentleman, as
3669: any one may see who enters the saloon at Cheverel Manor, where his
3670: full-length portrait, taken when he was fifty, hangs side by side with
3671: that of his wife, the stately lady seated on the lawn.
3672: 
3673: Looking at Sir Christopher, you would at once have been inclined to hope
3674: that he had a full-grown son and heir; but perhaps you would have wished
3675: that it might not prove to be the young man on his right hand, in whom a
3676: certain resemblance to the Baronet, in the contour of the nose and brow,
3677: seemed to indicate a family relationship. If this young man had been less
3678: elegant in his person, he would have been remarked for the elegance of
3679: his dress. But the perfections of his slim well-proportioned figure were
3680: so striking that no one but a tailor could notice the perfections of his
3681: velvet coat; and his small white hands, with their blue veins and taper
3682: fingers, quite eclipsed the beauty of his lace ruffles. The face,
3683: however--it was difficult to say why--was certainly not pleasing. Nothing
3684: could be more delicate than the blond complexion--its bloom set off by
3685: the powdered hair--than the veined overhanging eyelids, which gave an
3686: indolent expression to the hazel eyes; nothing more finely cut than the
3687: transparent nostril and the short upper-lip. Perhaps the chin and lower
3688: jaw were too small for an irreproachable profile, but the defect was on
3689: the side of that delicacy and _finesse_ which was the distinctive
3690: characteristic of the whole person, and which was carried out in the
3691: clear brown arch of the eyebrows, and the marble smoothness of the
3692: sloping forehead. Impossible to say that this face was not eminently
3693: handsome; yet, for the majority both of men and women, it was destitute
3694: of charm. Women disliked eyes that seemed to be indolently accepting
3695: admiration instead of rendering it; and men, especially if they had a
3696: tendency to clumsiness in the nose and ankles, were inclined to think
3697: this Antinous in a pigtail a ‘confounded puppy’. I fancy that was
3698: frequently the inward interjection of the Rev. Maynard Gilfil, who was
3699: seated on the opposite side of the dining-table, though Mr. Gilfil’s legs
3700: and profile were not at all of a kind to make him peculiarly alive to the
3701: impertinence and frivolity of personal advantages. His healthy open face
3702: and robust limbs were after an excellent pattern for everyday wear, and,
3703: in the opinion of Mr. Bates, the north-country gardener, would have
3704: become regimentals ‘a fain saight’ better than the ‘peaky’ features and
3705: slight form of Captain Wybrow, notwithstanding that this young gentleman,
3706: as Sir Christopher’s nephew and destined heir, had the strongest
3707: hereditary claim on the gardener’s respect, and was undeniably
3708: ‘clean-limbed’. But alas! human longings are perversely obstinate; and to
3709: the man whose mouth is watering for a peach, it is of no use to offer the
3710: largest vegetable marrow. Mr. Gilfil was not sensitive to Mr. Bates’s
3711: opinion, whereas he was sensitive to the opinion of another person, who
3712: by no means shared Mr. Bates’s preference.
3713: 
3714: Who the other person was it would not have required a very keen observer
3715: to guess, from a certain eagerness in Mr. Gilfil’s glance as that little
3716: figure in white tripped along the lawn with the cushions. Captain Wybrow,
3717: too, was looking in the same direction, but his handsome face remained
3718: handsome--and nothing more.
3719: 
3720: ‘Ah,’ said Sir Christopher, looking up from his paper, ‘there’s my lady.
3721: Ring for coffee, Anthony; we’ll go and join her, and the little monkey
3722: Tina shall give us a song.’
3723: 
3724: The coffee presently appeared, brought not as usual by the footman, in
3725: scarlet and drab, but by the old butler, in threadbare but well-brushed
3726: black, who, as he was placing it on the table, said--‘If you please, Sir
3727: Christopher, there’s the widow Hartopp a-crying i’ the still room, and
3728: begs leave to see your honour.’
3729: 
3730: ‘I have given Markham full orders about the widow Hartopp,’ said Sir
3731: Christopher, in a sharp decided tone. ‘I have nothing to say to her.’
3732: 
3733: ‘Your honour,’ pleaded the butler, rubbing his hands, and putting on an
3734: additional coating of humility, ‘the poor woman’s dreadful overcome, and
3735: says she can’t sleep a wink this blessed night without seeing your
3736: honour, and she begs you to pardon the great freedom she’s took to come
3737: at this time. She cries fit to break her heart.’
3738: 
3739: ‘Ay, ay; water pays no tax. Well, show her into the library.’
3740: 
3741: Coffee despatched, the two young men walked out through the open window,
3742: and joined the ladies on the lawn, while Sir Christopher made his way to
3743: the library, solemnly followed by Rupert, his pet bloodhound, who, in his
3744: habitual place at the Baronet’s right hand, behaved with great urbanity
3745: during dinner; but when the cloth was drawn, invariably disappeared under
3746: the table, apparently regarding the claret-jug as a mere human weakness,
3747: which he winked at, but refused to sanction.
3748: 
3749: The library lay but three steps from the dining-room, on the other side
3750: of a cloistered and matted passage. The oriel window was overshadowed by
3751: the great beech, and this, with the flat heavily-carved ceiling and the
3752: dark hue of the old books that lined the walls, made the room look
3753: sombre, especially on entering it from the dining-room, with its aerial
3754: curves and cream-coloured fretwork touched with gold. As Sir Christopher
3755: opened the door, a jet of brighter light fell on a woman in a widow’s
3756: dress, who stood in the middle of the room, and made the deepest of
3757: curtsies as he entered. She was a buxom woman approaching forty, her eyes
3758: red with the tears which had evidently been absorbed by the handkerchief
3759: gathered into a damp ball in her right hand.
3760: 
3761: ‘Now, Mrs. Hartopp,’ said Sir Christopher, taking out his gold snuff-box
3762: and tapping the lid, ‘what have you to say to me? Markham has delivered
3763: you a notice to quit, I suppose?’
3764: 
3765: ‘O yis, your honour, an’ that’s the reason why I’ve come. I hope your
3766: honour ’ll think better on it, an’ not turn me an’ my poor children out
3767: o’ the farm, where my husband al’ys paid his rent as reglar as the day
3768: come.’
3769: 
3770: ‘Nonsense! I should like to know what good it will do you and your
3771: children to stay on a farm and lose every farthing your husband has left
3772: you, instead of selling your stock and going into some little place where
3773: you can keep your money together. It is very well known to every tenant
3774: of mine that I never allow widows to stay on their husbands’ farms.’
3775: 
3776: ‘O, Sir Christifer, if you _would_ consider--when I’ve sold the hay, an’
3777: corn, an’ all the live things, an’ paid the debts, an’ put the money out
3778: to use, I shall have hardly enough to keep our souls an’ bodies together.
3779: An’ how can I rear my boys and put ’em ’prentice? They must go for
3780: dey-labourers, an’ their father a man wi’ as good belongings as any on
3781: your honour’s estate, an’ niver threshed his wheat afore it was well i’
3782: the rick, nor sold the straw off his farm, nor nothin’. Ask all the
3783: farmers round if there was a stiddier, soberer man than my husband as
3784: attended Ripstone market. An’ he says, “Bessie,” says he--them was his
3785: last words--“you’ll mek a shift to manage the farm, if Sir Christifer
3786: ’ull let you stay on.”’
3787: 
3788: ‘Pooh, pooh!’ said Sir Christopher, Mrs. Hartopp’s sobs having
3789: interrupted her pleadings, ‘now listen to me, and try to understand a
3790: little common sense. You are about as able to manage the farm as your
3791: best milch cow. You’ll be obliged to have some managing man, who will
3792: either cheat you out of your money or wheedle you into marrying him.’
3793: 
3794: ‘O, your honour, I was never that sort o’ woman, an’ nobody has known it
3795: on me.’
3796: 
3797: ‘Very likely not, because you were never a widow before. A woman’s always
3798: silly enough, but she’s never quite as great a fool as she can be until
3799: she puts on a widow’s cap. Now, just ask yourself how much the better you
3800: will be for staying on your farm at the end of four years, when you’ve
3801: got through your money, and let your farm run down, and are in arrears
3802: for half your rent; or, perhaps, have got some great hulky fellow for a
3803: husband, who swears at you and kicks your children.’
3804: 
3805: ‘Indeed, Sir Christifer, I know a deal o’ farmin,’ an’ was brought up i’
3806: the thick on it, as you may say. An’ there was my husband’s great-aunt
3807: managed a farm for twenty year, an’ left legacies to all her nephys an’
3808: nieces, an’ even to my husband, as was then a babe unborn.’
3809: 
3810: ‘Psha! a woman six feet high, with a squint and sharp elbows, I
3811: daresay--a man in petticoats. Not a rosy-cheeked widow like you, Mrs.
3812: Hartopp.’
3813: 
3814: ‘Indeed, your honour, I never heard of her squintin’, an’ they said as
3815: she might ha’ been married o’er and o’er again, to people as had no call
3816: to hanker after her money.’
3817: 
3818: ‘Ay, ay, that’s what you all think. Every man that looks at you wants to
3819: marry you, and would like you the better the more children you have and
3820: the less money. But it is useless to talk and cry. I have good reasons
3821: for my plans, and never alter them. What you have to do is to take the
3822: best of your stock, and to look out for some little place to go to, when
3823: you leave The Hollows. Now, go back to Mrs. Bellamy’s room, and ask her
3824: to give you a dish of tea.’
3825: 
3826: Mrs. Hartopp, understanding from Sir Christopher’s tone that he was not
3827: to be shaken, curtsied low and left the library, while the Baronet,
3828: seating himself at his desk in the oriel window, wrote the following
3829: letter:
3830: 
3831: ‘MR. MARKHAM,--Take no steps about letting Crowsfoot Cottage, as I intend
3832: to put in the widow Hartopp when she leaves her farm; and if you will be
3833: here at eleven on Saturday morning, I will ride round with you, and
3834: settle about making some repairs, and see about adding a bit of land to
3835: the take, as she will want to keep a cow and some pigs.--Yours
3836: faithfully,
3837: 
3838: ‘CHRISTOPHER CHEVEREL.’
3839: 
3840: After ringing the bell and ordering this letter to be sent, Sir
3841: Christopher walked out to join the party on the lawn. But finding the
3842: cushions deserted, he walked on to the eastern front of the building,
3843: where, by the side of the grand entrance, was the large bow-window of the
3844: saloon, opening on to the gravel-sweep, and looking towards a long vista
3845: of undulating turf, bordered by tall trees, which, seeming to unite
3846: itself with the green of the meadows and a grassy road through a
3847: plantation, only terminated with the Gothic arch of a gateway in the far
3848: distance. The bow-window was open, and Sir Christopher, stepping in,
3849: found the group he sought, examining the progress of the unfinished
3850: ceiling. It was in the same style of florid pointed Gothic as the
3851: dining-room, but more elaborate in its tracery, which was like petrified
3852: lace-work picked out with delicate and varied colouring. About a fourth
3853: of its still remained uncoloured, and under this part were scaffolding,
3854: ladders, and tools; otherwise the spacious saloon was empty of furniture,
3855: and seemed to be a grand Gothic canopy for the group of five human
3856: figures standing in the centre.
3857: 
3858: ‘Francesco has been getting on a little better the last day or two,’ said
3859: Sir Christopher, as he joined the party: ‘he’s a sad lazy dog, and I
3860: fancy he has a knack of sleeping as he stands, with his brushes in his
3861: hands. But I must spur him on, or we may not have the scaffolding cleared
3862: away before the bride comes, if you show dexterous generalship in your
3863: wooing, eh, Anthony? and take your Magdeburg quickly.’
3864: 
3865: ‘Ah, sir, a siege is known to be one of the most tedious operations in
3866: war,’ said Captain Wybrow, with an easy smile.
3867: 
3868: ‘Not when there’s a traitor within the walls in the shape of a soft
3869: heart. And that there will be, if Beatrice has her mother’s tenderness as
3870: well as her mother’s beauty.’
3871: 
3872: ‘What do you think, Sir Christopher,’ said Lady Cheverel, who seemed to
3873: wince a little under her husband’s reminiscences, ‘of hanging Guercino’s
3874: “Sibyl” over that door when we put up the pictures? It is rather lost in
3875: my sitting-room.’
3876: 
3877: ‘Very good, my love,’ answered Sir Christopher, in a tone of
3878: punctiliously polite affection; ‘if you like to part with the ornament
3879: from your own room, it will show admirably here. Our portraits, by Sir
3880: Joshua, will hang opposite the window, and the “Transfiguration” at that
3881: end. You see, Anthony, I am leaving no good places on the walls for you
3882: and your wife. We shall turn you with your faces to the wall in the
3883: gallery, and you may take your revenge on us by-and-by.’
3884: 
3885: While this conversation was going on, Mr. Gilfil turned to Caterina and
3886: said,--‘I like the view from this window better than any other in the
3887: house.’
3888: 
3889: She made no answer, and he saw that her eyes were filling with tears; so
3890: he added, ‘Suppose we walk out a little; Sir Christopher and my lady seem
3891: to be occupied.’
3892: 
3893: Caterina complied silently, and they turned down one of the gravel walks
3894: that led, after many windings under tall trees and among grassy openings,
3895: to a large enclosed flower-garden. Their walk was perfectly silent, for
3896: Maynard Gilfil knew that Caterina’s thoughts were not with him, and she
3897: had been long used to make him endure the weight of those moods which she
3898: carefully hid from others. They reached the flower-garden, and turned
3899: mechanically in at the gate that opened, through a high thick hedge, on
3900: an expanse of brilliant colour, which, after the green shades they had
3901: passed through, startled the eye like flames. The effect was assisted by
3902: an undulation of the ground, which gradually descended from the
3903: entrance-gate, and then rose again towards the opposite end, crowned by
3904: an orangery. The flowers were glowing with their evening splendours;
3905: verbenas and heliotropes were sending up their finest incense. It seemed
3906: a gala where all was happiness and brilliancy, and misery could find no
3907: sympathy. This was the effect it had on Caterina. As she wound among the
3908: beds of gold and blue and pink, where the flowers seemed to be looking at
3909: her with wondering elf-like eyes, knowing nothing of sorrow, the feeling
3910: of isolation in her wretchedness overcame her, and the tears, which had
3911: been before trickling slowly down her pale cheeks, now gushed forth
3912: accompanied with sobs. And yet there was a loving human being close
3913: beside her, whose heart was aching for hers, who was possessed by the
3914: feeling that she was miserable, and that he was helpless to soothe her.
3915: But she was too much irritated by the idea that his wishes were different
3916: from hers, that he rather regretted the folly of her hopes than the
3917: probability of their disappointment, to take any comfort in his sympathy.
3918: Caterina, like the rest of us, turned away from sympathy which she
3919: suspected to be mingled with criticism, as the child turns away from the
3920: sweetmeat in which it suspects imperceptible medicine.
3921: 
3922: ‘Dear Caterina, I think I hear voices,’ said Mr. Gilfil; ‘they may be
3923: coming this way.’
3924: 
3925: She checked herself like one accustomed to conceal her emotions, and ran
3926: rapidly to the other end of the garden, where she seemed occupied in
3927: selecting a rose. Presently Lady Cheverel entered, leaning on the arm of
3928: Captain Wybrow, and followed by Sir Christopher. The party stopped to
3929: admire the tiers of geraniums near the gate; and in the mean time
3930: Caterina tripped back with a moss rose-bud in her hand, and, going up to
3931: Sir Christopher, said--‘There, Padroncello--there is a nice rose for your
3932: button-hole.’
3933: 
3934: ‘Ah, you black-eyed monkey,’ he said, fondly stroking her cheek; ‘so you
3935: have been running off with Maynard, either to torment or coax him an inch
3936: or two deeper into love. Come, come, I want you to sing us “_Ho perduto_”
3937: before we sit down to picquet. Anthony goes to-morrow, you know; you must
3938: warble him into the right sentimental lover’s mood, that he may acquit
3939: himself well at Bath.’ He put her little arm under his, and calling to
3940: Lady Cheverel, ‘Come, Henrietta!’ led the way towards the house.
3941: 
3942: The party entered the drawing-room, which, with its oriel window,
3943: corresponded to the library in the other wing, and had also a flat
3944: ceiling heavy with carving and blazonry; but the window being unshaded,
3945: and the walls hung with full-length portraits of knights and dames in
3946: scarlet, white, and gold, it had not the sombre effect of the library.
3947: Here hung the portrait of Sir Anthony Cheverel, who in the reign of
3948: Charles II. was the renovator of the family splendour, which had suffered
3949: some declension from the early brilliancy of that Chevreuil who came over
3950: with the Conqueror. A very imposing personage was this Sir Anthony,
3951: standing with one arm akimbo, and one fine leg and foot advanced,
3952: evidently with a view to the gratification of his contemporaries and
3953: posterity. You might have taken off his splendid peruke, and his scarlet
3954: cloak, which was thrown backward from his shoulders, without annihilating
3955: the dignity of his appearance. And he had known how to choose a wife,
3956: too, for his lady, hanging opposite to him, with her sunny brown hair
3957: drawn away in bands from her mild grave face, and falling in two large
3958: rich curls on her snowy gently-sloping neck, which shamed the harsher hue
3959: and outline of her white satin robe, was a fit mother of ‘large-acred’
3960: heirs.
3961: 
3962: In this room tea was served; and here, every evening, as regularly as the
3963: great clock in the courtyard with deliberate bass tones struck nine, Sir
3964: Christopher and Lady Cheverel sat down to picquet until half-past ten,
3965: when Mr. Gilfil read prayers to the assembled household in the chapel.
3966: 
3967: But now it was not near nine, and Caterina must sit down to the
3968: harpsichord and sing Sir Christopher’s favourite airs from Gluck’s
3969: ‘Orfeo’, an opera which, for the happiness of that generation, was then
3970: to be heard on the London stage. It happened this evening that the
3971: sentiment of these airs, ‘_Che faro senza Eurydice?_’ and ‘_Ho perduto il
3972: bel sembiante_’, in both of which the singer pours out his yearning after
3973: his lost love, came very close to Caterina’s own feeling. But her
3974: emotion, instead of being a hindrance to her singing, gave her additional
3975: power. Her singing was what she could do best; it was her one point of
3976: superiority, in which it was probable she would excel the highborn beauty
3977: whom Anthony was to woo; and her love, her jealousy, her pride, her
3978: rebellion against her destiny, made one stream of passion which welled
3979: forth in the deep rich tones of her voice. She had a rare contralto,
3980: which Lady Cheverel, who had high musical taste, had been careful to
3981: preserve her from straining.
3982: 
3983: ‘Excellent, Caterina,’ said Lady Cheverel, as there was a pause after the
3984: wonderful linked sweetness of ‘_Che faro_’. ‘I never heard you sing that
3985: so well. Once more!’
3986: 
3987: It was repeated; and then came, ‘_Ho perduto_’, which Sir Christopher
3988: encored, in spite of the clock, just striking nine. When the last note
3989: was dying out he said--‘There’s a clever black-eyed monkey. Now bring out
3990: the table for picquet.’
3991: 
3992: Caterina drew out the table and placed the cards; then, with her rapid
3993: fairy suddenness of motion, threw herself on her knees, and clasped Sir
3994: Christopher’s knee. He bent down, stroked her cheek and smiled.
3995: 
3996: ‘Caterina, that is foolish,’ said Lady Cheverel. ‘I wish you would leave
3997: off those stage-players’ antics.’
3998: 
3999: She jumped up, arranged the music on the harpsichord, and then, seeing
4000: the Baronet and his lady seated at picquet, quietly glided out of the
4001: room.
4002: 
4003: Captain Wybrow had been leaning near the harpsichord during the singing,
4004: and the chaplain had thrown himself on a sofa at the end of the room.
4005: They both now took up a book. Mr. Gilfil chose the last number of the
4006: ‘Gentleman’s Magazine’; Captain Wybrow, stretched on an ottoman near the
4007: door, opened ‘Faublas’; and there was perfect silence in the room which,
4008: ten minutes before, was vibrating to the passionate tones of Caterina.
4009: 
4010: She had made her way along the cloistered passages, now lighted here and
4011: there by a small oil-lamp, to the grand-staircase, which led directly to
4012: a gallery running along the whole eastern side of the building, where it
4013: was her habit to walk when she wished to be alone. The bright moonlight
4014: was streaming through the windows, throwing into strange light and shadow
4015: the heterogeneous objects that lined the long walls: Greek statues and
4016: busts of Roman emperors; low cabinets filled with curiosities, natural
4017: and antiquarian; tropical birds and huge horns of beasts; Hindoo gods and
4018: strange shells; swords and daggers, and bits of chain-armour; Roman lamps
4019: and tiny models of Greek temples; and, above all these, queer old family
4020: portraits--of little boys and girls, once the hope of the Cheverels, with
4021: close-shaven heads imprisoned in stiff ruffs--of faded, pink-faced
4022: ladies, with rudimentary features and highly-developed head-dresses--of
4023: gallant gentlemen, with high hips, high shoulders, and red pointed
4024: beards.
4025: 
4026: Here, on rainy days, Sir Christopher and his lady took their promenade,
4027: and here billiards were played; but, in the evening, it was forsaken by
4028: all except Caterina--and, sometimes, one other person.
4029: 
4030: She paced up and down in the moonlight, her pale face and thin
4031: white-robed form making her look like the ghost of some former Lady
4032: Cheverel come to revisit the glimpses of the moon.
4033: 
4034: By-and-by she paused opposite the broad window above the portico, and
4035: looked out on the long vista of turf and trees now stretching chill and
4036: saddened in the moonlight.
4037: 
4038: Suddenly a breath of warmth and roses seemed to float towards her, and an
4039: arm stole gently round her waist, while a soft hand took up her tiny
4040: fingers. Caterina felt an electric thrill, and was motionless for one
4041: long moment; then she pushed away the arm and hand, and, turning round,
4042: lifted up to the face that hung over her eyes full of tenderness and
4043: reproach. The fawn-like unconsciousness was gone, and in that one look
4044: were the ground tones of poor little Caterina’s nature--intense love and
4045: fierce jealousy.
4046: 
4047: ‘Why do you push me away, Tina?’ said Captain Wybrow in a half-whisper;
4048: ‘are you angry with me for what a hard fate puts upon me? Would you have
4049: me cross my uncle--who has done so much for us both--in his dearest wish?
4050: You know I have duties--we both have duties--before which feeling must be
4051: sacrificed.’
4052: 
4053: ‘Yes, yes,’ said Caterina, stamping her foot, and turning away her head;
4054: ‘don’t tell me what I know already.’
4055: 
4056: There was a voice speaking in Caterina’s mind to which she had never yet
4057: given vent. That voice said continually, ‘Why did he make me love
4058: him--why did he let me know he loved me, if he knew all the while that he
4059: couldn’t brave everything for my sake?’ Then love answered, ‘He was led
4060: on by the feeling of the moment, as you have been, Caterina; and now you
4061: ought to help him to do what is right.’ Then the voice rejoined, ‘It was
4062: a slight matter to him. He doesn’t much mind giving you up. He will soon
4063: love that beautiful woman, and forget a poor little pale thing like you.’
4064: 
4065: Thus love, anger, and jealousy were struggling in that young soul.
4066: 
4067: ‘Besides, Tina,’ continued Captain Wybrow in still gentler tones, ‘I
4068: shall not succeed. Miss Assher very likely prefers some one else; and you
4069: know I have the best will in the world to fail. I shall come back a
4070: hapless bachelor--perhaps to find you already married to the good-looking
4071: chaplain, who is over head and ears in love with you. Poor Sir
4072: Christopher has made up his mind that you’re to have Gilfil.’
4073: 
4074: ‘Why will you speak so? You speak from your own want of feeling. Go away
4075: from me.’
4076: 
4077: ‘Don’t let us part in anger, Tina. All this may pass away. It’s as likely
4078: as not that I may never marry any one at all. These palpitations may
4079: carry me off, and you may have the satisfaction of knowing that I shall
4080: never be anybody’s bridegroom. Who knows what may happen? I may be my
4081: own master before I get into the bonds of holy matrimony, and be able to
4082: choose my little singing-bird. Why should we distress ourselves before
4083: the time?’
4084: 
4085: ‘It is easy to talk so when you are not feeling,’ said Caterina, the
4086: tears flowing fast. ‘It is bad to bear now, whatever may come after. But
4087: you don’t care about my misery.’
4088: 
4089: ‘Don’t I, Tina?’ said Anthony in his tenderest tones, again stealing his
4090: arm round her waist, and drawing her towards him. Poor Tina was the slave
4091: of this voice and touch. Grief and resentment, retrospect and foreboding,
4092: vanished--all life before and after melted away in the bliss of that
4093: moment, as Anthony pressed his lips to hers.
4094: 
4095: Captain Wybrow thought, ‘Poor little Tina! it would make her very happy
4096: to have me. But she is a mad little thing.’
4097: 
4098: At that moment a loud bell startled Caterina from her trance of bliss. It
4099: was the summons to prayers in the chapel, and she hastened away, leaving
4100: Captain Wybrow to follow slowly.
4101: 
4102: It was a pretty sight, that family assembled to worship in the little
4103: chapel, where a couple of wax-candles threw a mild faint light on the
4104: figures kneeling there. In the desk was Mr. Gilfil, with his face a shade
4105: graver than usual. On his right hand, kneeling on their red velvet
4106: cushions, were the master and mistress of the household, in their elderly
4107: dignified beauty. On his left, the youthful grace of Anthony and
4108: Caterina, in all the striking contrast of their colouring--he, with his
4109: exquisite outline and rounded fairness, like an Olympian god; she, dark
4110: and tiny, like a gypsy changeling. Then there were the domestics kneeling
4111: on red-covered forms,--the women headed by Mrs. Bellamy, the natty little
4112: old housekeeper, in snowy cap and apron, and Mrs. Sharp, my lady’s maid,
4113: of somewhat vinegar aspect and flaunting attire; the men by Mr. Bellamy
4114: the butler, and Mr. Warren, Sir Christopher’s venerable valet.
4115: 
4116: A few collects from the Evening Service was what Mr. Gilfil habitually
4117: read, ending with the simple petition, ‘Lighten our darkness.’
4118: 
4119: And then they all rose, the servants turning to curtsy and bow as they
4120: went out. The family returned to the drawing-room, said good-night to
4121: each other, and dispersed--all to speedy slumber except two. Caterina
4122: only cried herself to sleep after the clock had struck twelve. Mr. Gilfil
4123: lay awake still longer, thinking that very likely Caterina was crying.
4124: 
4125: Captain Wybrow, having dismissed his valet at eleven, was soon in a soft
4126: slumber, his face looking like a fine cameo in high relief on the
4127: slightly indented pillow.
4128: 
4129: 
4130: 
4131: 
4132: Chapter 3
4133: 
4134: 
4135: The last chapter has given the discerning reader sufficient insight into
4136: the state of things at Cheverel Manor in the summer of 1788. In that
4137: summer, we know, the great nation of France was agitated by conflicting
4138: thoughts and passions, which were but the beginning of sorrows. And in
4139: our Caterina’s little breast, too, there were terrible struggles. The
4140: poor bird was beginning to flutter and vainly dash its soft breast
4141: against the hard iron bars of the inevitable, and we see too plainly the
4142: danger, if that anguish should go on heightening instead of being
4143: allayed, that the palpitating heart may be fatally bruised.
4144: 
4145: Meanwhile, if, as I hope, you feel some interest in Caterina and her
4146: friends at Cheverel Manor, you are perhaps asking, How came she to be
4147: there? How was it that this tiny, dark-eyed child of the south, whose
4148: face was immediately suggestive of olive-covered hills and taper-lit
4149: shrines, came to have her home in that stately English manor-house, by
4150: the side of the blonde matron, Lady Cheverel--almost as if a humming-bird
4151: were found perched on one of the elm-trees in the park, by the side of
4152: her ladyship’s handsomest pouter-pigeon? Speaking good English, too, and
4153: joining in Protestant prayers! Surely she must have been adopted and
4154: brought over to England at a very early age. She was.
4155: 
4156: During Sir Christopher’s last visit to Italy with his lady, fifteen years
4157: before, they resided for some time at Milan, where Sir Christopher, who
4158: was an enthusiast for Gothic architecture, and was then entertaining the
4159: project of metamorphosing his plain brick family mansion into the model
4160: of a Gothic manor-house, was bent on studying the details of that marble
4161: miracle, the Cathedral. Here Lady Cheverel, as at other Italian cities
4162: where she made any protracted stay, engaged a _maestro_ to give her
4163: lessons in singing, for she had then not only fine musical taste, but a
4164: fine soprano voice. Those were days when very rich people used manuscript
4165: music, and many a man who resembled Jean Jacques in nothing else,
4166: resembled him in getting a livelihood ‘à copier la musique à tant la
4167: page’. Lady Cheverel having need of this service, Maestro Albani told her
4168: he would send her a _poveraccio_ of his acquaintance, whose manuscript was
4169: the neatest and most correct he knew of. Unhappily, the _poveraccio_ was
4170: not always in his best wits, and was sometimes rather slow in
4171: consequence; but it would be a work of Christian charity worthy of the
4172: beautiful Signora to employ poor Sarti.
4173: 
4174: The next morning, Mrs. Sharp, then a blooming abigail of
4175: three-and-thirty, entered her lady’s private room and said, ‘If you
4176: please, my lady, there’s the frowsiest, shabbiest man you ever saw,
4177: outside, and he’s told Mr. Warren as the singing-master sent him to see
4178: your ladyship. But I think you’ll hardly like him to come in here. Belike
4179: he’s only a beggar.’
4180: 
4181: ‘O yes, show him in immediately.’
4182: 
4183: Mrs. Sharp retired, muttering something about ‘fleas and worse’. She had
4184: the smallest possible admiration for fair Ausonia and its natives, and
4185: even her profound deference for Sir Christopher and her lady could not
4186: prevent her from expressing her amazement at the infatuation of
4187: gentlefolks in choosing to sojourn among ‘Papises, in countries where
4188: there was no getting to air a bit o’ linen, and where the people smelt o’
4189: garlick fit to knock you down.’
4190: 
4191: However she presently reappeared, ushering in a small meagre man, sallow
4192: and dingy, with a restless wandering look in his dull eyes, and an
4193: excessive timidity about his deep reverences, which gave him the air of a
4194: man who had been long a solitary prisoner. Yet through all this squalor
4195: and wretchedness there were some traces discernible of comparative youth
4196: and former good looks. Lady Cheverel, though not very tender-hearted,
4197: still less sentimental, was essentially kind, and liked to dispense
4198: benefits like a goddess, who looks down benignly on the halt, the maimed,
4199: and the blind that approach her shrine. She was smitten with some
4200: compassion at the sight of poor Sarti, who struck her as the mere
4201: battered wreck of a vessel that might have once floated gaily enough on
4202: its outward voyage to the sound of pipes and tabors. She spoke gently as
4203: she pointed out to him the operatic selections she wished him to copy,
4204: and he seemed to sun himself in her auburn, radiant presence, so that
4205: when he made his exit with the music-books under his arm, his bow, though
4206: not less reverent, was less timid.
4207: 
4208: It was ten years at least since Sarti had seen anything so bright and
4209: stately and beautiful as Lady Cheverel. For the time was far off in which
4210: he had trod the stage in satin and feathers, the _primo tenore_ of one
4211: short season. He had completely lost his voice in the following winter,
4212: and had ever since been little better than a cracked fiddle, which is
4213: good for nothing but firewood. For, like many Italian singers, he was too
4214: ignorant to teach, and if it had not been for his one talent of
4215: penmanship, he and his young helpless wife might have starved. Then, just
4216: after their third child was born, fever came, swept away the sickly
4217: mother and the two eldest children, and attacked Sarti himself, who rose
4218: from his sick-bed with enfeebled brain and muscle, and a tiny baby on his
4219: hands, scarcely four months old. He lodged over a fruit-shop kept by a
4220: stout virago, loud of tongue and irate in temper, but who had had
4221: children born to her, and so had taken care of the tiny yellow,
4222: black-eyed _bambinetto_, and tended Sarti himself through his sickness.
4223: Here he continued to live, earning a meagre subsistence for himself and
4224: his little one by the work of copying music, put into his hands chiefly
4225: by Maestro Albani. He seemed to exist for nothing but the child: he
4226: tended it, he dandled it, he chatted to it, living with it alone in his
4227: one room above the fruit-shop, only asking his landlady to take care of
4228: the marmoset during his short absences in fetching and carrying home
4229: work. Customers frequenting that fruit-shop might often see the tiny
4230: Caterina seated on the floor with her legs in a heap of pease, which it
4231: was her delight to kick about; or perhaps deposited, like a kitten, in a
4232: large basket out of harm’s way.
4233: 
4234: Sometimes, however, Sarti left his little one with another kind of
4235: protectress. He was very regular in his devotions, which he paid thrice
4236: a-week in the great cathedral, carrying Caterina with him. Here, when the
4237: high morning sun was warming the myriad glittering pinnacles without, and
4238: struggling against the massive gloom within, the shadow of a man with a
4239: child on his arm might be seen flitting across the more stationary
4240: shadows of pillar and mullion, and making its way towards a little tinsel
4241: Madonna hanging in a retired spot near the choir. Amid all the
4242: sublimities of the mighty cathedral, poor Sarti had fixed on this tinsel
4243: Madonna as the symbol of divine mercy and protection,--just as a child,
4244: in the presence of a great landscape, sees none of the glories of wood
4245: and sky, but sets its heart on a floating feather or insect that happens
4246: to be on a level with its eye. Here, then, Sarti worshipped and prayed,
4247: setting Caterina on the floor by his side; and now and then, when the
4248: cathedral lay near some place where he had to call, and did not like to
4249: take her, he would leave her there in front of the tinsel Madonna, where
4250: she would sit, perfectly good, amusing herself with low crowing noises
4251: and see-sawings of her tiny body. And when Sarti came back, he always
4252: found that the Blessed Mother had taken good care of Caterina.
4253: 
4254: That was briefly the history of Sarti, who fulfilled so well the orders
4255: Lady Cheverel gave him, that she sent him away again with a stock of new
4256: work. But this time, week after week passed, and he neither reappeared
4257: nor sent home the music intrusted to him. Lady Cheverel began to be
4258: anxious, and was thinking of sending Warren to inquire at the address
4259: Sarti had given her, when one day, as she was equipped for driving out,
4260: the valet brought in a small piece of paper, which, he said, had been
4261: left for her ladyship by a man who was carrying fruit. The paper
4262: contained only three tremulous lines, in Italian:--‘Will the
4263: Eccelentissima, for the love of God, have pity on a dying man, and come
4264: to him?’
4265: 
4266: Lady Cheverel recognized the handwriting as Sarti’s in spite of its
4267: tremulousness, and, going down to her carriage, ordered the Milanese
4268: coachman to drive to Strada Quinquagesima, Numero 10. The coach stopped
4269: in a dirty narrow street opposite La Pazzini’s fruit-shop, and that large
4270: specimen of womanhood immediately presented herself at the door, to the
4271: extreme disgust of Mrs. Sharp, who remarked privately to Mr. Warren that
4272: La Pazzini was a ‘hijeous porpis’. The fruit-woman, however, was all
4273: smiles and deep curtsies to the Eccelentissima, who, not very well
4274: understanding her Milanese dialect, abbreviated the conversation by
4275: asking to be shown at once to Signor Sarti. La Pazzini preceded her up
4276: the dark narrow stairs, and opened a door through which she begged her
4277: ladyship to enter. Directly opposite the door lay Sarti, on a low
4278: miserable bed. His eyes were glazed, and no movement indicated that he
4279: was conscious of their entrance.
4280: 
4281: On the foot of the bed was seated a tiny child, apparently not three
4282: years old, her head covered by a linen cap, her feet clothed with leather
4283: boots, above which her little yellow legs showed thin and naked. A frock,
4284: made of what had once been a gay flowered silk, was her only other
4285: garment. Her large dark eyes shone from out her queer little face, like
4286: two precious stones in a grotesque image carved in old ivory. She held an
4287: empty medicine-bottle in her hand, and was amusing herself with putting
4288: the cork in and drawing it out again, to hear how it would pop.
4289: 
4290: La Pazzini went up to the bed and said, ‘Ecco la nobilissima donna;’ but
4291: directly after screamed out, ‘Holy mother! he is dead!’
4292: 
4293: It was so. The entreaty had not been sent in time for Sarti to carry out
4294: his project of asking the great English lady to take care of his
4295: Caterina. That was the thought which haunted his feeble brain as soon as
4296: he began to fear that his illness would end in death. She had wealth--she
4297: was kind--she would surely do something for the poor orphan. And so, at
4298: last, he sent that scrap of paper which won the fulfilment of his prayer,
4299: though he did not live to utter it. Lady Cheverel gave La Pazzini money
4300: that the last decencies might be paid to the dead man, and carried away
4301: Caterina, meaning to consult Sir Christopher as to what should be done
4302: with her. Even Mrs. Sharp had been so smitten with pity by the scene she
4303: had witnessed when she was summoned up-stairs to fetch Caterina, as to
4304: shed a small tear, though she was not at all subject to that weakness;
4305: indeed, she abstained from it on principle, because, as she often said,
4306: it was known to be the worst thing in the world for the eyes.
4307: 
4308: On the way back to her hotel, Lady Cheverel turned over various projects
4309: in her mind regarding Caterina, but at last one gained the preference
4310: over all the rest. Why should they not take the child to England, and
4311: bring her up there? They had been married twelve years, yet Cheverel
4312: Manor was cheered by no children’s voices, and the old house would be all
4313: the better for a little of that music. Besides, it would be a Christian
4314: work to train this little Papist into a good Protestant, and graft as
4315: much English fruit as possible on the Italian stem.
4316: 
4317: Sir Christopher listened to this plan with hearty acquiescence. He loved
4318: children, and took at once to the little black-eyed monkey--his name for
4319: Caterina all through her short life. But neither he nor Lady Cheverel had
4320: any idea of adopting her as their daughter, and giving her their own rank
4321: in life. They were much too English and aristocratic to think of anything
4322: so romantic. No! the child would be brought up at Cheverel Manor as a
4323: protegée, to be ultimately useful, perhaps, in sorting worsteds, keeping
4324: accounts, reading aloud, and otherwise supplying the place of spectacles
4325: when her ladyship’s eyes should wax dim.
4326: 
4327: So Mrs. Sharp had to procure new clothes, to replace the linen cap,
4328: flowered frock, and leathern boots; and now, strange to say, little
4329: Caterina, who had suffered many unconscious evils in her existence of
4330: thirty moons, first began to know conscious troubles. ‘Ignorance,’ says
4331: Ajax, ‘is a painless evil;’ so, I should think, is dirt, considering the
4332: merry faces that go along with it. At any rate, cleanliness is sometimes
4333: a painful good, as any one can vouch who has had his face washed the
4334: wrong way, by a pitiless hand with a gold ring on the third finger. If
4335: you, reader, have not known that initiatory anguish, it is idle to expect
4336: that you will form any approximate conception of what Caterina endured
4337: under Mrs. Sharp’s new dispensation of soap-and-water. Happily, this
4338: purgatory came presently to be associated in her tiny brain with a
4339: passage straightway to a seat of bliss--the sofa in Lady Cheverel’s
4340: sitting-room, where there were toys to be broken, a ride was to be had on
4341: Sir Christopher’s knee, and a spaniel of resigned temper was prepared to
4342: undergo small tortures without flinching.
4343: 
4344: 
4345: 
4346: 
4347: Chapter 4
4348: 
4349: 
4350: In three months from the time of Caterina’s adoption--namely, in the late
4351: autumn of 1773--the chimneys of Cheverel Manor were sending up unwonted
4352: smoke, and the servants were awaiting in excitement the return of their
4353: master and mistress after a two years’ absence. Great was the
4354: astonishment of Mrs. Bellamy, the housekeeper, when Mr. Warren lifted a
4355: little black-eyed child out of the carriage, and great was Mrs. Sharp’s
4356: sense of superior information and experience, as she detailed Caterina’s
4357: history, interspersed with copious comments, to the rest of the upper
4358: servants that evening, as they were taking a comfortable glass of grog
4359: together in the housekeeper’s room.
4360: 
4361: A pleasant room it was as any party need desire to muster in on a cold
4362: November evening. The fireplace alone was a picture: a wide and deep
4363: recess with a low brick altar in the middle, where great logs of dry wood
4364: sent myriad sparks up the dark chimney-throat; and over the front of this
4365: recess a large wooden entablature bearing this motto, finely carved in
4366: old English letters, ‘Fear God and honour the King’. And beyond the
4367: party, who formed a half-moon with their chairs and well-furnished table
4368: round this bright fireplace, what a space of chiaroscuro for the
4369: imagination to revel in! Stretching across the far end of the room, what
4370: an oak table, high enough surely for Homer’s gods, standing on four
4371: massive legs, bossed and bulging like sculptured urns! and, lining the
4372: distant wall, what vast cupboards, suggestive of inexhaustible apricot
4373: jam and promiscuous butler’s perquisites! A stray picture or two had
4374: found their way down there, and made agreeable patches of dark brown on
4375: the buff-coloured walls. High over the loud-resounding double door hung
4376: one which, from some indications of a face looming out of blackness,
4377: might, by a great synthetic effort, be pronounced a Magdalen.
4378: Considerably lower down hung the similitude of a hat and feathers, with
4379: portions of a ruff, stated by Mrs. Bellamy to represent Sir Francis
4380: Bacon, who invented gunpowder, and, in her opinion, ‘might ha’ been
4381: better emplyed.’
4382: 
4383: But this evening the mind is but slightly arrested by the great Verulam,
4384: and is in the humour to think a dead philosopher less interesting than a
4385: living gardener, who sits conspicuous in the half-circle round the
4386: fireplace. Mr. Bates is habitually a guest in the housekeeper’s room of
4387: an evening, preferring the social pleasures there--the feast of gossip
4388: and the flow of grog--to a bachelor’s chair in his charming thatched
4389: cottage on a little island, where every sound is remote, but the cawing
4390: of rooks and the screaming of wild geese, poetic sounds, doubtless, but,
4391: humanly speaking, not convivial.
4392: 
4393: Mr. Bates was by no means an average person, to be passed without special
4394: notice. He was a sturdy Yorkshireman, approaching forty, whose face
4395: Nature seemed to have coloured when she was in a hurry, and had no time
4396: to attend to _nuances_, for every inch of him visible above his neckcloth
4397: was of one impartial redness; so that when he was at some distance your
4398: imagination was at liberty to place his lips anywhere between his nose
4399: and chin. Seen closer, his lips were discerned to be of a peculiar cut,
4400: and I fancy this had something to do with the peculiarity of his dialect,
4401: which, as we shall see, was individual rather than provincial. Mr. Bates
4402: was further distinguished from the common herd by a perpetual blinking of
4403: the eyes; and this, together with the red-rose tint of his complexion,
4404: and a way he had of hanging his head forward, and rolling it from side to
4405: side as he walked, gave him the air of a Bacchus in a blue apron, who, in
4406: the present reduced circumstances of Olympus, had taken to the management
4407: of his own vines. Yet, as gluttons are often thin, so sober men are often
4408: rubicund; and Mr. Bates was sober, with that manly, British,
4409: churchman-like sobriety which can carry a few glasses of grog without any
4410: perceptible clarification of ideas.
4411: 
4412: ‘Dang my boottons!’ observed Mr. Bates, who, at the conclusion of Mrs.
4413: Sharp’s narrative, felt himself urged to his strongest interjection,
4414: ‘it’s what I shouldn’t ha’ looked for from Sir Cristhifer an’ my ledy, to
4415: bring a furrin child into the coonthry; an’ depend on’t, whether you an’
4416: me lives to see’t or noo, it’ll coom to soom harm. The first sitiation
4417: iver I held--it was a hold hancient habbey, wi’ the biggest orchard o’
4418: apples an’ pears you ever see--there was a French valet, an’ he stool
4419: silk stoockins, an’ shirts, an’ rings, an’ iverythin’ he could ley his
4420: hands on, an’ run awey at last wi’ th’ missis’s jewl-box. They’re all
4421: alaike, them furriners. It roons i’ th’ blood.’
4422: 
4423: ‘Well,’ said Mrs. Sharp, with the air of a person who held liberal views,
4424: but knew where to draw the line, ‘I’m not a-going to defend the
4425: furriners, for I’ve as good reason to know what they are as most folks,
4426: an’ nobody’ll ever hear me say but what they’re next door to heathens,
4427: and the hile they eat wi’ their victuals is enough to turn any
4428: Christian’s stomach. But for all that--an’ for all as the trouble in
4429: respect o’ washin’ and managin’ has fell upo’ me through the journey--I
4430: can’t say but what I think as my Lady an’ Sir Cristifer’s done a right
4431: thing by a hinnicent child as doesn’t know its right hand from its left,
4432: i’ bringing it where it’ll learn to speak summat better nor gibberish,
4433: and be brought up i’ the true religion. For as for them furrin churches
4434: as Sir Cristifer is so unaccountable mad after, wi’ pictures o’ men an’
4435: women a-showing themselves just for all the world as God made ’em. I
4436: think, for my part, as it’s welly a sin to go into ’em.’
4437: 
4438: ‘You’re likely to have more foreigners, however,’ said Mr. Warren, who
4439: liked to provoke the gardener, ‘for Sir Christopher has engaged some
4440: Italian workmen to help in the alterations in the house.’
4441: 
4442: ‘Olterations!’ exclaimed Mrs. Bellamy, in alarm. ‘What olterations!’
4443: 
4444: ‘Why,’ answered Mr. Warren, ‘Sir Christopher, as I understand, is going
4445: to make a new thing of the old Manor-house both inside and out. And he’s
4446: got portfolios full of plans and pictures coming. It is to be cased with
4447: stone, in the Gothic style--pretty near like the churches, you know, as
4448: far as I can make out; and the ceilings are to be beyond anything that’s
4449: been seen in the country. Sir Christopher’s been giving a deal of study
4450: to it.’
4451: 
4452: ‘Dear heart alive!’ said Mrs. Bellamy, ‘we shall be pisoned wi’ lime an’
4453: plaster, an’ hev the house full o’ workmen colloguing wi’ the maids, an’
4454: makin’ no end o’ mischief.’
4455: 
4456: ‘That ye may ley your life on, Mrs. Bellamy,’ said Mr. Bates. ‘Howiver,
4457: I’ll noot denay that the Goothic stayle’s prithy anoof, an’ it’s
4458: woonderful how near them stoon-carvers cuts oot the shapes o’ the pine
4459: apples, an’ shamrucks, an’ rooses. I dare sey Sir Cristhifer’ll meck a
4460: naice thing o’ the Manor, an’ there woon’t be many gentlemen’s houses i’
4461: the coonthry as’ll coom up to’t, wi’ sich a garden an’ pleasure-groons
4462: an’ wall-fruit as King George maight be prood on.’
4463: 
4464: ‘Well, I can’t think as the house can be better nor it is, Gothic or no
4465: Gothic,’ said Mrs. Bellamy; ‘an’ I’ve done the picklin’ and preservin’ in
4466: it fourteen year Michaelmas was a three weeks. But what does my lady say
4467: to’t?’
4468: 
4469: ‘My lady knows better than cross Sir Cristifer in what he’s set his mind
4470: on,’ said Mr. Bellamy, who objected to the critical tone of the
4471: conversation. ‘Sir Cristifer’ll hev his own way, _that_ you may tek your
4472: oath. An’ i’ the right on’t too. He’s a gentleman born, an’s got the
4473: money. But come, Mester Bates, fill your glass, an’ we’ll drink health
4474: an’ happiness to his honour an’ my lady, and then you shall give us a
4475: song. Sir Cristifer doesn’t come hum from Italy ivery night.’
4476: 
4477: This demonstrable position was accepted without hesitation as ground for
4478: a toast; but Mr. Bates, apparently thinking that his song was not an
4479: equally reasonable sequence, ignored the second part of Mr. Bellamy’s
4480: proposal. So Mrs. Sharp, who had been heard to say that she had no
4481: thoughts at all of marrying Mr. Bates, though he was ‘a sensable
4482: fresh-coloured man as many a woman ’ud snap at for a husband,’ enforced
4483: Mr. Bellamy’s appeal.
4484: 
4485: ‘Come, Mr. Bates, let us hear “Roy’s Wife.” I’d rether hear a good old
4486: song like that, nor all the fine Italian toodlin.’
4487: 
4488: Mr. Bates, urged thus flatteringly, stuck his thumbs into the armholes of
4489: his waistcoat, threw himself back in his chair with his head in that
4490: position in which he could look directly towards the zenith, and struck
4491: up a remarkably _staccato_ rendering of ‘Roy’s Wife of Aldivalloch’. This
4492: melody may certainly be taxed with excessive iteration, but that was
4493: precisely its highest recommendation to the present audience, who found
4494: it all the easier to swell the chorus. Nor did it at all diminish their
4495: pleasure that the only particular concerning ‘Roy’s Wife’, which Mr.
4496: Bates’s enunciation allowed them to gather, was that she ‘chated’
4497: him,--whether in the matter of garden stuff or of some other commodity,
4498: or why her name should, in consequence, be repeatedly reiterated with
4499: exultation, remaining an agreeable mystery.
4500: 
4501: Mr. Bates’s song formed the climax of the evening’s good-fellowship, and
4502: the party soon after dispersed--Mrs. Bellamy perhaps to dream of
4503: quicklime flying among her preserving-pans, or of love-sick housemaids
4504: reckless of unswept corners--and Mrs. Sharp to sink into pleasant visions
4505: of independent housekeeping in Mr. Bates’s cottage, with no bells to
4506: answer, and with fruit and vegetables _ad libitum_.
4507: 
4508: Caterina soon conquered all prejudices against her foreign blood; for
4509: what prejudices will hold out against helplessness and broken prattle?
4510: She became the pet of the household, thrusting Sir Christopher’s
4511: favourite bloodhound of that day, Mrs. Bellamy’s two canaries, and Mr.
4512: Bates’s largest Dorking hen, into a merely secondary position. The
4513: consequence was, that in the space of a summer’s day she went through a
4514: great cycle of experiences, commencing with the somewhat acidulated
4515: goodwill of Mrs. Sharp’s nursery discipline. Then came the grave luxury
4516: of her ladyship’s sitting-room, and, perhaps, the dignity of a ride on
4517: Sir Christopher’s knee, sometimes followed by a visit with him to the
4518: stables, where Caterina soon learned to hear without crying the baying of
4519: the chained bloodhounds, and say, with ostentatious bravery, clinging to
4520: Sir Christopher’s leg all the while, ‘Dey not hurt Tina.’ Then Mrs.
4521: Bellamy would perhaps be going out to gather the rose-leaves and
4522: lavender, and Tina was made proud and happy by being allowed to carry a
4523: handful in her pinafore; happier still, when they were spread out on
4524: sheets to dry, so that she could sit down like a frog among them, and
4525: have them poured over her in fragrant showers. Another frequent pleasure
4526: was to take a journey with Mr. Bates through the kitchen-gardens and the
4527: hothouses, where the rich bunches of green and purple grapes hung from
4528: the roof, far out of reach of the tiny yellow hand that could not help
4529: stretching itself out towards them; though the hand was sure at last to
4530: be satisfied with some delicate-flavoured fruit or sweet-scented flower.
4531: Indeed, in the long monotonous leisure of that great country-house, you
4532: may be sure there was always some one who had nothing better to do than
4533: to play with Tina. So that the little southern bird had its northern nest
4534: lined with tenderness, and caresses, and pretty things. A loving
4535: sensitive nature was too likely, under such nurture, to have its
4536: susceptibility heightened into unfitness for an encounter with any harder
4537: experience; all the more, because there were gleams of fierce resistance
4538: to any discipline that had a harsh or unloving aspect. For the only thing
4539: in which Caterina showed any precocity was a certain ingenuity in
4540: vindictiveness. When she was five years old she had revenged herself for
4541: an unpleasant prohibition by pouring the ink into Mrs. Sharp’s
4542: work-basket; and once, when Lady Cheverel took her doll from her, because
4543: she was affectionately licking the paint off its face, the little minx
4544: straightway climbed on a chair and threw down a flower-vase that stood on
4545: a bracket. This was almost the only instance in which her anger overcame
4546: her awe of Lady Cheverel, who had the ascendancy always belonging to
4547: kindness that never melts into caresses, and is severely but uniformly
4548: beneficent.
4549: 
4550: By-and-by the happy monotony of Cheverel Manor was broken in upon in the
4551: way Mr. Warren had announced. The roads through the park were cut up by
4552: waggons carrying loads of stone from a neighbouring quarry, the green
4553: courtyard became dusty with lime, and the peaceful house rang with the
4554: sound of tools. For the next ten years Sir Christopher was occupied with
4555: the architectural metamorphosis of his old family mansion; thus
4556: anticipating, through the prompting of his individual taste, that general
4557: reaction from the insipid imitation of the Palladian style, towards a
4558: restoration of the Gothic, which marked the close of the eighteenth
4559: century. This was the object he had set his heart on, with a singleness
4560: of determination which was regarded with not a little contempt by his
4561: fox-hunting neighbours, who wondered greatly that a man with some of the
4562: best blood in England in his veins, should be mean enough to economize in
4563: his cellar, and reduce his stud to two old coach-horses and a hack, for
4564: the sake of riding a hobby, and playing the architect. Their wives did
4565: not see so much to blame in the matter of the cellar and stables, but
4566: they were eloquent in pity for poor Lady Cheverel, who had to live in no
4567: more than three rooms at once, and who must be distracted with noises,
4568: and have her constitution undermined by unhealthy smells. It was as bad
4569: as having a husband with an asthma. Why did not Sir Christopher take a
4570: house for her at Bath, or, at least, if he must spend his time in
4571: overlooking workmen, somewhere in the neighbourhood of the Manor? This
4572: pity was quite gratuitous, as the most plentiful pity always is; for
4573: though Lady Cheverel did not share her husband’s architectural
4574: enthusiasm, she had too rigorous a view of a wife’s duties, and too
4575: profound a deference for Sir Christopher, to regard submission as a
4576: grievance. As for Sir Christopher, he was perfectly indifferent to
4577: criticism. ‘An obstinate, crotchety man,’ said his neighbours. But I, who
4578: have seen Cheverel Manor, as he bequeathed it to his heirs, rather
4579: attribute that unswerving architectural purpose of his, conceived and
4580: carried out through long years of systematic personal exertion, to
4581: something of the fervour of genius, as well as inflexibility of will; and
4582: in walking through those rooms, with their splendid ceilings and their
4583: meagre furniture, which tell how all the spare money had been absorbed
4584: before personal comfort was thought of, I have felt that there dwelt in
4585: this old English baronet some of that sublime spirit which distinguishes
4586: art from luxury, and worships beauty apart from self-indulgence.
4587: 
4588: While Cheverel Manor was growing from ugliness into beauty, Caterina too
4589: was growing from a little yellow bantling into a whiter maiden, with no
4590: positive beauty indeed, but with a certain light airy grace, which, with
4591: her large appealing dark eyes, and a voice that, in its low-toned
4592: tenderness, recalled the love-notes of the stock-dove, gave her a more
4593: than usual charm. Unlike the building, however, Caterina’s development
4594: was the result of no systematic or careful appliances. She grew up very
4595: much like the primroses, which the gardener is not sorry to see within
4596: his enclosure, but takes no pains to cultivate. Lady Cheverel taught her
4597: to read and write, and say her catechism; Mr. Warren, being a good
4598: accountant, gave her lessons in arithmetic, by her ladyship’s desire; and
4599: Mrs. Sharp initiated her in all the mysteries of the needle. But, for a
4600: long time, there was no thought of giving her any more elaborate
4601: education. It is very likely that to her dying day Caterina thought the
4602: earth stood still, and that the sun and stars moved round it; but so, for
4603: the matter of that, did Helen, and Dido, and Desdemona, and Juliet;
4604: whence I hope you will not think my Caterina less worthy to be a heroine
4605: on that account. The truth is, that, with one exception, her only talent
4606: lay in loving; and there, it is probable, the most astronomical of women
4607: could not have surpassed her. Orphan and protegée though she was, this
4608: supreme talent of hers found plenty of exercise at Cheverel Manor, and
4609: Caterina had more people to love than many a small lady and gentleman
4610: affluent in silver mugs and blood relations. I think the first place in
4611: her childish heart was given to Sir Christopher, for little girls are apt
4612: to attach themselves to the finest-looking gentleman at hand, especially
4613: as he seldom has anything to do with discipline. Next to the Baronet came
4614: Dorcas, the merry rosy-cheeked damsel who was Mrs. Sharp’s lieutenant in
4615: the nursery, and thus played the part of the raisins in a dose of senna.
4616: It was a black day for Caterina when Dorcas married the coachman, and
4617: went, with a great sense of elevation in the world, to preside over a
4618: ‘public’ in the noisy town of Sloppeter. A little china-box, bearing the
4619: motto ‘Though lost to sight, to memory dear’, which Dorcas sent her as a
4620: remembrance, was among Caterina’s treasures ten years after.
4621: 
4622: The one other exceptional talent, you already guess, was music. When the
4623: fact that Caterina had a remarkable ear for music, and a still more
4624: remarkable voice, attracted Lady Cheverel’s notice, the discovery was
4625: very welcome both to her and Sir Christopher. Her musical education
4626: became at once an object of interest. Lady Cheverel devoted much time to
4627: it; and the rapidity of Tina’s progress surpassing all hopes, an Italian
4628: singing-master was engaged, for several years, to spend some months
4629: together at Cheverel Manor. This unexpected gift made a great alteration
4630: in Caterina’s position. After those first years in which little girls are
4631: petted like puppies and kittens, there comes a time when it seems less
4632: obvious what they can be good for, especially when, like Caterina, they
4633: give no particular promise of cleverness or beauty; and it is not
4634: surprising that in that uninteresting period there was no particular plan
4635: formed as to her future position. She could always help Mrs. Sharp,
4636: supposing she were fit for nothing else, as she grew up; but now, this
4637: rare gift of song endeared her to Lady Cheverel, who loved music above
4638: all things, and it associated her at once with the pleasures of the
4639: drawing-room. Insensibly she came to be regarded as one of the family,
4640: and the servants began to understand that Miss Sarti was to be a lady
4641: after all.
4642: 
4643: ‘And the raight on’t too,’ said Mr. Bates, ‘for she hasn’t the cut of a
4644: gell as must work for her bread; she’s as nesh an’ dilicate as a
4645: paich-blossom--welly laike a linnet, wi’ on’y joost body anoof to hold
4646: her voice.’
4647: 
4648: But long before Tina had reached this stage of her history, a new era had
4649: begun for her, in the arrival of a younger companion than any she had
4650: hitherto known. When she was no more than seven, a ward of Sir
4651: Christopher’s--a lad of fifteen, Maynard Gilfil by name--began to spend
4652: his vacations at Cheverel Manor, and found there no playfellow so much to
4653: his mind as Caterina. Maynard was an affectionate lad, who retained a
4654: propensity to white rabbits, pet squirrels, and guinea-pigs, perhaps a
4655: little beyond the age at which young gentlemen usually look down on such
4656: pleasures as puerile. He was also much given to fishing, and to
4657: carpentry, considered as a fine art, without any base view to utility.
4658: And in all these pleasures it was his delight to have Caterina as his
4659: companion, to call her little pet names, answer her wondering questions,
4660: and have her toddling after him as you may have seen a Blenheim spaniel
4661: trotting after a large setter. Whenever Maynard went back to school,
4662: there was a little scene of parting.
4663: 
4664: ‘You won’t forget me, Tina, before I come back again? I shall leave you
4665: all the whip-cord we’ve made; and don’t you let Guinea die. Come, give me
4666: a kiss, and promise not to forget me.’
4667: 
4668: As the years wore on, and Maynard passed from school to college, and from
4669: a slim lad to a stalwart young man, their companionship in the vacations
4670: necessarily took a different form, but it retained a brotherly and
4671: sisterly familiarity. With Maynard the boyish affection had insensibly
4672: grown into ardent love. Among all the many kinds of first love, that
4673: which begins in childish companionship is the strongest and most
4674: enduring: when passion comes to unite its force to long affection, love
4675: is at its spring-tide. And Maynard Gilfil’s love was of a kind to make
4676: him prefer being tormented by Caterina to any pleasure, apart from her,
4677: which the most benevolent magician could have devised for him. It is the
4678: way with those tall large-limbed men, from Samson downwards. As for Tina,
4679: the little minx was perfectly well aware that Maynard was her slave; he
4680: was the one person in the world whom she did as she pleased with; and I
4681: need not tell you that this was a symptom of her being perfectly
4682: heart-whole so far as he was concerned: for a passionate woman’s love is
4683: always overshadowed by fear.
4684: 
4685: Maynard Gilfil did not deceive himself in his interpretation of
4686: Caterina’s feelings, but he nursed the hope that some time or other she
4687: would at least care enough for him to accept his love. So he waited
4688: patiently for the day when he might venture to say, ‘Caterina, I love
4689: you!’ You see, he would have been content with very little, being one of
4690: those men who pass through life without making the least clamour about
4691: themselves; thinking neither the cut of his coat, nor the flavour of his
4692: soup, nor the precise depth of a servant’s bow, at all momentous. He
4693: thought--foolishly enough, as lovers _will_ think--that it was a good
4694: augury for him when he came to be domesticated at Cheverel Manor in the
4695: quality of chaplain there, and curate of a neighbouring parish; judging
4696: falsely, from his own case, that habit and affection were the likeliest
4697: avenues to love. Sir Christopher satisfied several feelings in installing
4698: Maynard as chaplain in his house. He liked the old-fashioned dignity of
4699: that domestic appendage; he liked his ward’s companionship; and, as
4700: Maynard had some private fortune, he might take life easily in that
4701: agreeable home, keeping his hunter, and observing a mild regimen of
4702: clerical duty, until the Cumbermoor living should fall in, when he might
4703: be settled for life in the neighbourhood of the manor. ‘With Caterina for
4704: a wife, too,’ Sir Christopher soon began to think; for though the good
4705: Baronet was not at all quick to suspect what was unpleasant and opposed
4706: to his views of fitness, he was quick to see what would dovetail with his
4707: own plans; and he had first guessed, and then ascertained, by direct
4708: inquiry, the state of Maynard’s feelings. He at once leaped to the
4709: conclusion that Caterina was of the same mind, or at least would be, when
4710: she was old enough. But these were too early days for anything definite
4711: to be said or done.
4712: 
4713: Meanwhile, new circumstances were arising, which, though they made no
4714: change in Sir Christopher’s plans and prospects, converted Mr. Gilfil’s
4715: hopes into anxieties, and made it clear to him not only that Caterina’s
4716: heart was never likely to be his, but that it was given entirely to
4717: another.
4718: 
4719: Once or twice in Caterina’s childhood, there had been another boy-visitor
4720: at the manor, younger than Maynard Gilfil--a beautiful boy with brown
4721: curls and splendid clothes, on whom Caterina had looked with shy
4722: admiration. This was Anthony Wybrow, the son of Sir Christopher’s
4723: youngest sister, and chosen heir of Cheverel Manor. The Baronet had
4724: sacrificed a large sum, and even straitened the resources by which he was
4725: to carry out his architectural schemes, for the sake of removing the
4726: entail from his estate, and making this boy his heir--moved to the step,
4727: I am sorry to say, by an implacable quarrel with his elder sister; for a
4728: power of forgiveness was not among Sir Christopher’s virtues. At length,
4729: on the death of Anthony’s mother, when he was no longer a curly-headed
4730: boy, but a tall young man, with a captain’s commission, Cheverel Manor
4731: became _his_ home too, whenever he was absent from his regiment. Caterina
4732: was then a little woman, between sixteen and seventeen, and I need not
4733: spend many words in explaining what you perceive to be the most natural
4734: thing in the world.
4735: 
4736: There was little company kept at the Manor, and Captain Wybrow would have
4737: been much duller if Caterina had not been there. It was pleasant to pay
4738: her attentions--to speak to her in gentle tones, to see her little
4739: flutter of pleasure, the blush that just lit up her pale cheek, and the
4740: momentary timid glance of her dark eyes, when he praised her singing,
4741: leaning at her side over the piano. Pleasant, too, to cut out that
4742: chaplain with his large calves! What idle man can withstand
4743: the temptation of a woman to fascinate, and another man to
4744: eclipse?--especially when it is quite clear to himself that he means no
4745: mischief, and shall leave everything to come right again by-and-by? At
4746: the end of eighteen months, however, during which Captain Wybrow had
4747: spent much of his time at the Manor, he found that matters had reached a
4748: point which he had not at all contemplated. Gentle tones had led to
4749: tender words, and tender words had called forth a response of looks which
4750: made it impossible not to carry on the _crescendo_ of love-making. To
4751: find one’s self adored by a little, graceful, dark-eyed, sweet-singing
4752: woman, whom no one need despise, is an agreeable sensation, comparable to
4753: smoking the finest Latakia, and also imposes some return of tenderness as
4754: a duty.
4755: 
4756: Perhaps you think that Captain Wybrow, who knew that it would be
4757: ridiculous to dream of his marrying Caterina, must have been a reckless
4758: libertine to win her affections in this manner! Not at all. He was a
4759: young man of calm passions, who was rarely led into any conduct of which
4760: he could not give a plausible account to himself; and the tiny fragile
4761: Caterina was a woman who touched the imagination and the affections
4762: rather than the senses. He really felt very kindly towards her, and would
4763: very likely have loved her--if he had been able to love any one. But
4764: nature had not endowed him with that capability. She had given him an
4765: admirable figure, the whitest of hands, the most delicate of nostrils,
4766: and a large amount of serene self-satisfaction; but, as if to save such a
4767: delicate piece of work from any risk of being shattered, she had guarded
4768: him from the liability to a strong emotion. There was no list of youthful
4769: misdemeanours on record against him, and Sir Christopher and Lady
4770: Cheverel thought him the best of nephews, the most satisfactory of heirs,
4771: full of grateful deference to themselves, and, above all things, guided
4772: by a sense of duty. Captain Wybrow always did the thing easiest and most
4773: agreeable to him from a sense of duty: he dressed expensively, because it
4774: was a duty he owed to his position; from a sense of duty he adapted
4775: himself to Sir Christopher’s inflexible will, which it would have been
4776: troublesome as well as useless to resist; and, being of a delicate
4777: constitution, he took care of his health from a sense of duty. His health
4778: was the only point on which he gave anxiety to his friends; and it was
4779: owing to this that Sir Christopher wished to see his nephew early
4780: married, the more so as a match after the Baronet’s own heart appeared
4781: immediately attainable. Anthony had seen and admired Miss Assher, the
4782: only child of a lady who had been Sir Christopher’s earliest love, but
4783: who, as things will happen in this world, had married another baronet
4784: instead of him. Miss Assher’s father was now dead, and she was in
4785: possession of a pretty estate. If, as was probable, she should prove
4786: susceptible to the merits of Anthony’s person and character, nothing
4787: could make Sir Christopher so happy as to see a marriage which might be
4788: expected to secure the inheritance of Cheverel Manor from getting into
4789: the wrong hands. Anthony had already been kindly received by Lady Assher
4790: as the nephew of her early friend; why should he not go to Bath, where
4791: she and her daughter were then residing, follow up the acquaintance, and
4792: win a handsome, well-born, and sufficiently wealthy bride?
4793: 
4794: Sir Christopher’s wishes were communicated to his nephew, who at once
4795: intimated his willingness to comply with them--from a sense of duty.
4796: Caterina was tenderly informed by her lover of the sacrifice demanded
4797: from them both; and three days afterwards occurred the parting scene you
4798: have witnessed in the gallery, on the eve of Captain Wybrow’s departure
4799: for Bath.

4802: 
4803: 
4804: Chapter 5
4805: 
4806: 
4807: The inexorable ticking of the clock is like the throb of pain to
4808: sensations made keen by a sickening fear. And so it is with the great
4809: clockwork of nature. Daisies and buttercups give way to the brown waving
4810: grasses, tinged with the warm red sorrel; the waving grasses are swept
4811: away, and the meadows lie like emeralds set in the bushy hedgerows; the
4812: tawny-tipped corn begins to bow with the weight of the full ear; the
4813: reapers are bending amongst it, and it soon stands in sheaves, then
4814: presently, the patches of yellow stubble lie side by side with streaks of
4815: dark-red earth, which the plough is turning up in preparation for the
4816: new-thrashed seed. And this passage from beauty to beauty, which to the
4817: happy is like the flow of a melody, measures for many a human heart the
4818: approach of foreseen anguish--seems hurrying on the moment when the
4819: shadow of dread will be followed up by the reality of despair.
4820: 
4821: How cruelly hasty that summer of 1788 seemed to Caterina! Surely the
4822: roses vanished earlier, and the berries on the mountain-ash were more
4823: impatient to redden, and bring on the autumn, when she would be face to
4824: face with her misery, and witness Anthony giving all his gentle tones,
4825: tender words, and soft looks to another.
4826: 
4827: Before the end of July, Captain Wybrow had written word that Lady Assher
4828: and her daughter were about to fly from the heat and gaiety of Bath to
4829: the shady quiet of their place at Farleigh, and that he was invited to
4830: join the party there. His letters implied that he was on an excellent
4831: footing with both the ladies, and gave no hint of a rival; so that Sir
4832: Christopher was more than usually bright and cheerful after reading them.
4833: At length, towards the close of August, came the announcement that
4834: Captain Wybrow was an accepted lover, and after much complimentary and
4835: congratulatory correspondence between the two families, it was understood
4836: that in September Lady Assher and her daughter would pay a visit to
4837: Cheverel Manor, when Beatrice would make the acquaintance of her future
4838: relatives, and all needful arrangements could be discussed. Captain
4839: Wybrow would remain at Farleigh till then, and accompany the ladies on
4840: their journey.
4841: 
4842: In the interval, every one at Cheverel Manor had something to do by way
4843: of preparing for the visitors. Sir Christopher was occupied in
4844: consultations with his steward and lawyer, and in giving orders to every
4845: one else, especially in spurring on Francesco to finish the saloon. Mr.
4846: Gilfil had the responsibility of procuring a lady’s horse, Miss Assher
4847: being a great rider. Lady Cheverel had unwonted calls to make and
4848: invitations to deliver. Mr. Bates’s turf, and gravel, and flower-beds
4849: were always at such a point of neatness and finish that nothing
4850: extraordinary could be done in the garden, except a little extraordinary
4851: scolding of the under-gardener, and this addition Mr. Bates did not
4852: neglect.
4853: 
4854: Happily for Caterina, she too had her task, to fill up the long dreary
4855: daytime: it was to finish a chair-cushion which would complete the set of
4856: embroidered covers for the drawing-room, Lady Cheverel’s year-long work,
4857: and the only noteworthy bit of furniture in the Manor. Over this
4858: embroidery she sat with cold lips and a palpitating heart, thankful that
4859: this miserable sensation throughout the daytime seemed to counteract the
4860: tendency to tears which returned with night and solitude. She was most
4861: frightened when Sir Christopher approached her. The Baronet’s eye was
4862: brighter and his step more elastic than ever, and it seemed to him that
4863: only the most leaden or churlish souls could be otherwise than brisk and
4864: exulting in a world where everything went so well. Dear old gentleman! he
4865: had gone through life a little flushed with the power of his will, and
4866: now his latest plan was succeeding, and Cheverel Manor would be inherited
4867: by a grand-nephew, whom he might even yet live to see a fine young fellow
4868: with at least the down on his chin. Why not? one is still young at sixty.
4869: 
4870: Sir Christopher had always something playful to say to Caterina.
4871: 
4872: ‘Now, little monkey, you must be in your best voice: you’re the minstrel
4873: of the Manor, you know, and be sure you have a pretty gown and a new
4874: ribbon. You must not be dressed in russet, though you are a
4875: singing-bird.’ Or perhaps, ‘It is your turn to be courted next, Tina. But
4876: don’t you learn any naughty proud airs. I must have Maynard let off
4877: easily.’
4878: 
4879: Caterina’s affection for the old Baronet helped her to summon up a smile
4880: as he stroked her cheek and looked at her kindly, but that was the moment
4881: at which she felt it most difficult not to burst out crying. Lady
4882: Cheverel’s conversation and presence were less trying; for her ladyship
4883: felt no more than calm satisfaction in this family event; and besides,
4884: she was further sobered by a little jealousy at Sir Christopher’s
4885: anticipation of pleasure in seeing Lady Assher, enshrined in his memory
4886: as a mild-eyed beauty of sixteen, with whom he had exchanged locks before
4887: he went on his first travels. Lady Cheverel would have died rather than
4888: confess it, but she couldn’t help hoping that he would be disappointed in
4889: Lady Assher, and rather ashamed of having called her so charming.
4890: 
4891: Mr. Gilfil watched Caterina through these days with mixed feelings. Her
4892: suffering went to his heart; but, even for her sake, he was glad that a
4893: love which could never come to good should be no longer fed by false
4894: hopes; and how could he help saying to himself, ‘Perhaps, after a while,
4895: Caterina will be tired of fretting about that cold-hearted puppy, and
4896: then . . .’
4897: 
4898: At length the much-expected day arrived, and the brightest of September
4899: suns was lighting up the yellowing lime-trees, as about five o’clock Lady
4900: Assher’s carriage drove under the portico. Caterina, seated at work in
4901: her own room, heard the rolling of the wheels, followed presently by the
4902: opening and shutting of doors, and the sound of voices in the corridors.
4903: Remembering that the dinner-hour was six, and that Lady Cheverel had
4904: desired her to be in the drawing-room early, she started up to dress, and
4905: was delighted to find herself feeling suddenly brave and strong.
4906: Curiosity to see Miss Assher--the thought that Anthony was in the
4907: house--the wish not to look unattractive, were feelings that brought
4908: some colour to her lips, and made it easy to attend to her toilette.
4909: They would ask her to sing this evening, and she would sing well. Miss
4910: Assher should not think her utterly insignificant. So she put on her
4911: grey silk gown and her cherry coloured ribbon with as much care as if
4912: she had been herself the betrothed; not forgetting the pair of round
4913: pearl earrings which Sir Christopher had told Lady Cheverel to give her,
4914: because Tina’s little ears were so pretty.
4915: 
4916: Quick as she had been, she found Sir Christopher and Lady Cheverel in the
4917: drawing-room chatting with Mr. Gilfil, and telling him how handsome Miss
4918: Assher was, but how entirely unlike her mother--apparently resembling her
4919: father only.
4920: 
4921: ‘Aha!’ said Sir Christopher, as he turned to look at Caterina, ‘what do
4922: you think of this, Maynard? Did you ever see Tina look so pretty before?
4923: Why, that little grey gown has been made out of a bit of my
4924: lady’s, hasn’t it? It doesn’t take anything much larger than a
4925: pocket-handkerchief to dress the little monkey.’
4926: 
4927: Lady Cheverel, too, serenely radiant in the assurance a single glance had
4928: given her of Lady Assher’s inferiority, smiled approval, and Caterina was
4929: in one of those moods of self possession and indifference which come as
4930: the ebb-tide between the struggles of passion. She retired to the piano,
4931: and busied herself with arranging her music, not at all insensible to the
4932: pleasure of being looked at with admiration the while, and thinking that,
4933: the next time the door opened, Captain Wybrow would enter, and she would
4934: speak to him quite cheerfully. But when she heard him come in, and the
4935: scent of roses floated towards her, her heart gave one great leap. She
4936: knew nothing till he was pressing her hand, and saying, in the old easy
4937: way, ‘Well, Caterina, how do you do? You look quite blooming.’
4938: 
4939: She felt her cheeks reddening with anger that he could speak and look
4940: with such perfect nonchalance. Ah! he was too deeply in love with some
4941: one else to remember anything he had felt for _her_. But the next moment
4942: she was conscious of her folly;--‘as if he could show any feeling then!’
4943: This conflict of emotions stretched into a long interval the few moments
4944: that elapsed before the door opened again, and her own attention, as well
4945: as that of all the rest, was absorbed by the entrance of the two ladies.
4946: 
4947: The daughter was the more striking, from the contrast she presented to
4948: her mother, a round-shouldered, middle-sized woman, who had once had the
4949: transient pink-and-white beauty of a blonde, with ill-defined features
4950: and early embonpoint. Miss Assher was tall, and gracefully though
4951: substantially formed, carrying herself with an air of mingled
4952: graciousness and self-confidence; her dark-brown hair, untouched by
4953: powder, hanging in bushy curls round her face, and falling in long thick
4954: ringlets nearly to her waist. The brilliant carmine tint of her
4955: well-rounded cheeks, and the finely-cut outline of her straight nose,
4956: produced an impression of splendid beauty, in spite of commonplace brown
4957: eyes, a narrow forehead, and thin lips. She was in mourning, and the dead
4958: black of her crape dress, relieved here and there by jet ornaments, gave
4959: the fullest effect to her complexion, and to the rounded whiteness of her
4960: arms, bare from the elbow. The first _coup d’œil_ was dazzling, and as she
4961: stood looking down with a gracious smile on Caterina, whom Lady Cheverel
4962: was presenting to her, the poor little thing seemed to herself to feel,
4963: for the first time, all the folly of her former dream.
4964: 
4965: ‘We are enchanted with your place, Sir Christopher,’ said Lady Assher,
4966: with a feeble kind of pompousness, which she seemed to be copying from
4967: some one else: ‘I’m sure your nephew must have thought Farleigh
4968: wretchedly out of order. Poor Sir John was so very careless about keeping
4969: up the house and grounds. I often talked to him about it, but he said,
4970: “Pooh pooh! as long as my friends find a good dinner and a good bottle of
4971: wine, they won’t care about my ceilings being rather smoky.” He was so
4972: very hospitable, was Sir John.’
4973: 
4974: ‘I think the view of the house from the park, just after we passed the
4975: bridge, particularly fine,’ said Miss Assher, interposing rather eagerly,
4976: as if she feared her mother might be making infelicitous speeches, ‘and
4977: the pleasure of the first glimpse was all the greater because Anthony
4978: would describe nothing to us beforehand. He would not spoil our first
4979: impressions by raising false ideas. I long to go over the house, Sir
4980: Christopher, and learn the history of all your architectural designs,
4981: which Anthony says have cost you so much time and study.’
4982: 
4983: ‘Take care how you set an old man talking about the past, my dear,’ said
4984: the Baronet; ‘I hope we shall find something pleasanter for you to do
4985: than turning over my old plans and pictures. Our friend Mr. Gilfil here
4986: has found a beautiful mare for you and you can scour the country to your
4987: heart’s content. Anthony has sent us word what a horsewoman you are.’
4988: 
4989: Miss Assher turned to Mr. Gilfil with her most beaming smile, and
4990: expressed her thanks with the elaborate graciousness of a person who
4991: means to be thought charming, and is sure of success.
4992: 
4993: ‘Pray do not thank me,’ said Mr. Gilfil, ‘till you have tried the mare.
4994: She has been ridden by Lady Sara Linter for the last two years; but one
4995: lady’s taste may not be like another’s in horses, any more than in other
4996: matters.’
4997: 
4998: While this conversation was passing, Captain Wybrow was leaning against
4999: the mantelpiece, contenting himself with responding from under his
5000: indolent eyelids to the glances Miss Assher was constantly directing
5001: towards him as she spoke. ‘She is very much in love with him,’ thought
5002: Caterina. But she was relieved that Anthony remained passive in his
5003: attentions. She thought, too, that he was looking paler and more languid
5004: than usual. ‘If he didn’t love her very much--if he sometimes thought of
5005: the past with regret, I think I could bear it all, and be glad to see Sir
5006: Christopher made happy.’
5007: 
5008: During dinner there was a little incident which confirmed these thoughts.
5009: When the sweets were on the table, there was a mould of jelly just
5010: opposite Captain Wybrow, and being inclined to take some himself, he
5011: first invited Miss Assher, who coloured, and said, in rather a sharper
5012: key than usual, ‘Have you not learned by this time that I never take
5013: jelly?’
5014: 
5015: ‘Don’t you?’ said Captain Wybrow, whose perceptions were not acute enough
5016: for him to notice the difference of a semitone. ‘I should have thought
5017: you were fond of it. There was always some on the table at Farleigh, I
5018: think.’
5019: 
5020: ‘You don’t seem to take much interest in my likes and dislikes.’
5021: 
5022: ‘I’m too much possessed by the happy thought that you like me,’ was the
5023: _ex officio_ reply, in silvery tones.
5024: 
5025: This little episode was unnoticed by every one but Caterina. Sir
5026: Christopher was listening with polite attention to Lady Assher’s history
5027: of her last man-cook, who was first-rate at gravies, and for that reason
5028: pleased Sir John--he was so particular about his gravies, was Sir John:
5029: and so they kept the man six years in spite of his bad pastry. Lady
5030: Cheverel and Mr. Gilfil were smiling at Rupert the bloodhound, who had
5031: pushed his great head under his master’s arm, and was taking a survey of
5032: the dishes, after snuffing at the contents of the Baronet’s plate.
5033: 
5034: When the ladies were in the drawing-room again, Lady Assher was soon deep
5035: in a statement to Lady Cheverel of her views about burying people in
5036: woollen.
5037: 
5038: ‘To be sure, you must have a woollen dress, because it’s the law, you
5039: know; but that need hinder no one from putting linen underneath. I always
5040: used to say, “If Sir John died to-morrow, I would bury him in his shirt;”
5041: and I did. And let me advise you to do so by Sir Christopher. You never
5042: saw Sir John, Lady Cheverel. He was a large tall man, with a nose just
5043: like Beatrice, and so very particular about his shirts.’
5044: 
5045: Miss Assher, meanwhile, had seated herself by Caterina, and, with that
5046: smiling affability which seems to say, ‘I am really not at all proud,
5047: though you might expect it of me,’ said,--‘Anthony tells me you sing so
5048: very beautifully. I hope we shall hear you this evening.’
5049: 
5050: ‘O yes,’ said Caterina, quietly, without smiling; ‘I always sing when I
5051: am wanted to sing.’
5052: 
5053: ‘I envy you such a charming talent. Do you know, I have no ear; I cannot
5054: hum the smallest tune, and I delight in music so. Is it not unfortunate?
5055: But I shall have quite a treat while I am here; Captain Wybrow says you
5056: will give us some music every day.’
5057: 
5058: ‘I should have thought you wouldn’t care about music if you had no ear,’
5059: said Caterina, becoming epigrammatic by force of grave simplicity.
5060: 
5061: ‘O, I assure you, I doat on it; and Anthony is so fond of it; it would be
5062: so delightful if I could play and sing to him; though he says he likes me
5063: best not to sing, because it doesn’t belong to his idea of me. What style
5064: of music do you like best?’
5065: 
5066: ‘I don’t know. I like all beautiful music.’
5067: 
5068: ‘And are you as fond of riding as of music?’
5069: 
5070: ‘No; I never ride. I think I should be very frightened.’
5071: 
5072: ‘O no! indeed you would not, after a little practice. I have never been
5073: in the least timid. I think Anthony is more afraid for me than I am for
5074: myself; and since I have been riding with him, I have been obliged to be
5075: more careful, because he is so nervous about me.’
5076: 
5077: Caterina made no reply; but she said to herself, ‘I wish she would go
5078: away and not talk to me. She only wants me to admire her good-nature, and
5079: to talk about Anthony.’
5080: 
5081: Miss Assher was thinking at the same time, ‘This Miss Sarti seems a
5082: stupid little thing. Those musical people often are. But she is prettier
5083: than I expected; Anthony said she was not pretty.’
5084: 
5085: Happily at this moment Lady Assher called her daughter’s attention to the
5086: embroidered cushions, and Miss Assher, walking to the opposite sofa, was
5087: soon in conversation with Lady Cheverel about tapestry and embroidery in
5088: general, while her mother, feeling herself superseded there, came and
5089: placed herself beside Caterina.
5090: 
5091: ‘I hear you are the most beautiful singer,’ was of course the opening
5092: remark. ‘All Italians sing so beautifully. I travelled in Italy with Sir
5093: John when we were first married, and we went to Venice, where they go
5094: about in gondolas, you know. You don’t wear powder, I see. No more will
5095: Beatrice; though many people think her curls would look all the better
5096: for powder. She has so much hair, hasn’t she? Our last maid dressed it
5097: much better than this; but, do you know, she wore Beatrice’s stockings
5098: before they went to the wash, and we couldn’t keep her after that, could
5099: we?’
5100: 
5101: Caterina, accepting the question as a mere bit of rhetorical effect,
5102: thought it superfluous to reply, till Lady Assher repeated, ‘Could we,
5103: now?’ as if Tina’s sanction were essential to her repose of mind. After a
5104: faint ‘No’, she went on.
5105: 
5106: ‘Maids are so very troublesome, and Beatrice is so particular, you can’t
5107: imagine. I often say to her, “My dear, you can’t have perfection.” That
5108: very gown she has on--to be sure, it fits her beautifully now--but it has
5109: been unmade and made up again twice. But she is like poor Sir John--he
5110: was so very particular about his own things, was Sir John. Is Lady
5111: Cheverel particular?’
5112: 
5113: ‘Rather. But Mrs. Sharp has been her maid twenty years.’
5114: 
5115: ‘I wish there was any chance of our keeping Griffin twenty years. But I
5116: am afraid we shall have to part with her because her health is so
5117: delicate; and she is so obstinate, she will not take bitters as I want
5118: her. _You_ look delicate, now. Let me recommend you to take camomile tea
5119: in a morning, fasting. Beatrice is so strong and healthy, she never takes
5120: any medicine; but if I had had twenty girls, and they had been delicate,
5121: I should have given them all camomile tea. It strengthens the
5122: constitution beyond anything. Now, will you promise me to take camomile
5123: tea?’
5124: 
5125: ‘Thank you: I’m not at all ill,’ said Caterina. ‘I’ve always been pale
5126: and thin.’
5127: 
5128: Lady Assher was sure camomile tea would make all the difference in the
5129: world--Caterina must see if it wouldn’t--and then went dribbling on like
5130: a leaky shower-bath, until the early entrance of the gentlemen created a
5131: diversion, and she fastened on Sir Christopher, who probably began to
5132: think that, for poetical purposes, it would be better not to meet one’s
5133: first love again, after a lapse of forty years.
5134: 
5135: Captain Wybrow, of course, joined his aunt and Miss Assher, and Mr.
5136: Gilfil tried to relieve Caterina from the awkwardness of sitting aloof
5137: and dumb, by telling her how a friend of his had broken his arm and
5138: staked his horse that morning, not at all appearing to heed that she
5139: hardly listened, and was looking towards the other side of the room. One
5140: of the tortures of jealousy is, that it can never turn its eyes away from
5141: the thing that pains it.
5142: 
5143: By-and-by every one felt the need of a relief from chit-chat--Sir
5144: Christopher perhaps the most of all--and it was he who made the
5145: acceptable proposition--
5146: 
5147: ‘Come, Tina, are we to have no music to-night before we sit down to
5148: cards? Your ladyship plays at cards, I think?’ he added, recollecting
5149: himself, and turning to Lady Assher.
5150: 
5151: ‘O yes! Poor dear Sir John would have a whist-table every night.’
5152: 
5153: Caterina sat down to the harpsichord at once, and had no sooner begun to
5154: sing than she perceived with delight that Captain Wybrow was gliding
5155: towards the harpsichord, and soon standing in the old place. This
5156: consciousness gave fresh strength to her voice; and when she noticed that
5157: Miss Assher presently followed him with that air of ostentatious
5158: admiration which belongs to the absence of real enjoyment, her closing
5159: _bravura_ was none the worse for being animated by a little triumphant
5160: contempt.
5161: 
5162: ‘Why, you are in better voice than ever, Caterina,’ said Captain Wybrow,
5163: when she had ended. ‘This is rather different from Miss Hibbert’s small
5164: piping that we used to be glad of at Farleigh, is it not, Beatrice?’
5165: 
5166: ‘Indeed it is. You are a most enviable creature, Miss Sarti--Caterina--may
5167: I not call you Caterina? for I have heard Anthony speak of you so often, I
5168: seem to know you quite well. You will let me call you Caterina?’
5169: 
5170: ‘O yes, every one calls me Caterina, only when they call me Tina.’
5171: 
5172: ‘Come, come, more singing, more singing, little monkey,’ Sir Christopher
5173: called out from the other side of the room. ‘We have not had half enough
5174: yet.’
5175: 
5176: Caterina was ready enough to obey, for while she was singing she was
5177: queen of the room, and Miss Assher was reduced to grimacing admiration.
5178: Alas! you see what jealousy was doing in this poor young soul. Caterina,
5179: who had passed her life as a little unobtrusive singing-bird, nestling so
5180: fondly under the wings that were outstretched for her, her heart beating
5181: only to the peaceful rhythm of love, or fluttering with some easily
5182: stifled fear, had begun to know the fierce palpitations of triumph and
5183: hatred.
5184: 
5185: When the singing was over, Sir Christopher and Lady Cheverel sat down to
5186: whist with Lady Assher and Mr. Gilfil, and Caterina placed herself at the
5187: Baronet’s elbow, as if to watch the game, that she might not appear to
5188: thrust herself on the pair of lovers. At first she was glowing with her
5189: little triumph, and felt the strength of pride; but her eye _would_ steal
5190: to the opposite side of the fireplace, where Captain Wybrow had seated
5191: himself close to Miss Assher, and was leaning with his arm over the back
5192: of the chair, in the most lover-like position. Caterina began to feel a
5193: choking sensation. She could see, almost without looking, that he was
5194: taking up her arm to examine her bracelet; their heads were bending close
5195: together, her curls touching his cheek--now he was putting his lips to
5196: her hand. Caterina felt her cheeks burn--she could sit no longer. She got
5197: up, pretended to be gliding about in search of something, and at length
5198: slipped out of the room.
5199: 
5200: Outside, she took a candle, and, hurrying along the passages and up the
5201: stairs to her own room, locked the door.
5202: 
5203: ‘O, I cannot bear it, I cannot bear it!’ the poor thing burst out aloud,
5204: clasping her little fingers, and pressing them back against her forehead,
5205: as if she wanted to break them.
5206: 
5207: Then she walked hurriedly up and down the room.
5208: 
5209: ‘And this must go on for days and days, and I must see it.’
5210: 
5211: She looked about nervously for something to clutch. There was a muslin
5212: kerchief lying on the table; she took it up and tore it into shreds as
5213: she walked up and down, and then pressed it into hard balls in her hand.
5214: 
5215: ‘And Anthony,’ she thought, ‘he can do this without caring for what I
5216: feel. O, he can forget everything: how he used to say he loved me--how he
5217: used to take my hand in his as we walked--how he used to stand near me in
5218: the evenings for the sake of looking into my eyes.’
5219: 
5220: ‘Oh, it is cruel, it is cruel!’ she burst out again aloud, as all those
5221: love-moments in the past returned upon her. Then the tears gushed forth,
5222: she threw herself on her knees by the bed, and sobbed bitterly.
5223: 
5224: She did not know how long she had been there, till she was startled by
5225: the prayer-bell; when, thinking Lady Cheverel might perhaps send some one
5226: to inquire after her, she rose, and began hastily to undress, that there
5227: might be no possibility of her going down again. She had hardly
5228: unfastened her hair, and thrown a loose gown about her, before there was
5229: a knock at the door, and Mrs. Sharp’s voice said--‘Miss Tina, my lady
5230: wants to know if you’re ill.’
5231: 
5232: Caterina opened the door and said, ‘Thank you, dear Mrs. Sharp; I have a
5233: bad headache; please tell my lady I felt it come on after singing.’
5234: 
5235: ‘Then, goodness me! why aren’t you in bed, istid o’ standing shivering
5236: there, fit to catch your death? Come, let me fasten up your hair and tuck
5237: you up warm.’
5238: 
5239: ‘O no, thank you; I shall really be in bed very soon. Good-night, dear
5240: Sharpy; don’t scold; I will be good, and get into bed.’
5241: 
5242: Caterina kissed her old friend coaxingly, but Mrs. Sharp was not to be
5243: ‘come over’ in that way, and insisted on seeing her former charge in bed,
5244: taking away the candle which the poor child had wanted to keep as a
5245: companion. But it was impossible to lie there long with that beating
5246: heart; and the little white figure was soon out of bed again, seeking
5247: relief in the very sense of chill and uncomfort. It was light enough for
5248: her to see about her room, for the moon, nearly at full, was riding high
5249: in the heavens among scattered hurrying clouds. Caterina drew aside the
5250: window-curtain; and, sitting with her forehead pressed against the cold
5251: pane, looked out on the wide stretch of park and lawn.
5252: 
5253: How dreary the moonlight is! robbed of all its tenderness and repose by
5254: the hard driving wind. The trees are harassed by that tossing motion,
5255: when they would like to be at rest; the shivering grass makes her quake
5256: with sympathetic cold; and the willows by the pool, bent low and white
5257: under that invisible harshness, seem agitated and helpless like herself.
5258: But she loves the scene the better for its sadness: there is some pity in
5259: it. It is not like that hard unfeeling happiness of lovers, flaunting in
5260: the eyes of misery.
5261: 
5262: She set her teeth tight against the window-frame, and the tears fell
5263: thick and fast. She was so thankful she could cry, for the mad passion
5264: she had felt when her eyes were dry frightened her. If that dreadful
5265: feeling were to come on when Lady Cheverel was present, she should never
5266: be able to contain herself.
5267: 
5268: Then there was Sir Christopher--so good to her--so happy about Anthony’s
5269: marriage; and all the while she had these wicked feelings.
5270: 
5271: ‘O, I cannot help it, I cannot help it!’ she said in a loud whisper
5272: between her sobs. ‘O God, have pity upon me!’
5273: 
5274: In this way Tina wore out the long hours of the windy moonlight, till at
5275: last, with weary aching limbs, she lay down in bed again, and slept from
5276: mere exhaustion.
5277: 
5278: While this poor little heart was being bruised with a weight too heavy
5279: for it, Nature was holding on her calm inexorable way, in unmoved and
5280: terrible beauty. The stars were rushing in their eternal courses; the
5281: tides swelled to the level of the last expectant weed; the sun was making
5282: brilliant day to busy nations on the other side of the swift earth. The
5283: stream of human thought and deed was hurrying and broadening onward. The
5284: astronomer was at his telescope; the great ships were labouring over the
5285: waves; the toiling eagerness of commerce, the fierce spirit of
5286: revolution, were only ebbing in brief rest; and sleepless statesmen were
5287: dreading the possible crisis of the morrow. What were our little Tina and
5288: her trouble in this mighty torrent, rushing from one awful unknown to
5289: another? Lighter than the smallest centre of quivering life in the
5290: waterdrop, hidden and uncared for as the pulse of anguish in the breast
5291: of the tiniest bird that has fluttered down to its nest with the
5292: long-sought food, and has found the nest torn and empty.
5293: 
5294: 
5295: 
5296: 
5297: Chapter 6
5298: 
5299: 
5300: The next morning, when Caterina was waked from her heavy sleep by Martha
5301: bringing in the warm water, the sun was shining, the wind had abated, and
5302: those hours of suffering in the night seemed unreal and dreamlike, in
5303: spite of weary limbs and aching eyes. She got up and began to dress with
5304: a strange feeling of insensibility, as if nothing could make her cry
5305: again; and she even felt a sort of longing to be down-stairs in the midst
5306: of company, that she might get rid of this benumbed condition by contact.
5307: 
5308: There are few of us that are not rather ashamed of our sins and follies
5309: as we look out on the blessed morning sunlight, which comes to us like a
5310: bright-winged angel beckoning us to quit the old path of vanity that
5311: stretches its dreary length behind us; and Tina, little as she knew about
5312: doctrines and theories, seemed to herself to have been both foolish and
5313: wicked yesterday. Today she would try to be good; and when she knelt down
5314: to say her short prayer--the very form she had learned by heart when she
5315: was ten years old--she added, ‘O God, help me to bear it!’
5316: 
5317: That day the prayer seemed to be answered, for after some remarks on her
5318: pale looks at breakfast, Caterina passed the morning quietly, Miss Assher
5319: and Captain Wybrow being out on a riding excursion. In the evening there
5320: was a dinner-party, and after Caterina had sung a little, Lady Cheverel
5321: remembering that she was ailing, sent her to bed, where she soon sank
5322: into a deep sleep. Body and mind must renew their force to suffer as well
5323: as to enjoy.
5324: 
5325: On the morrow, however, it was rainy, and every one must stay in-doors;
5326: so it was resolved that the guests should be taken over the house by Sir
5327: Christopher, to hear the story of the architectural alterations, the
5328: family portraits, and the family relics. All the party, except Mr.
5329: Gilfil, were in the drawing-room when the proposition was made; and when
5330: Miss Assher rose to go, she looked towards Captain Wybrow, expecting to
5331: see him rise too; but he kept his seat near the fire, turning his eyes
5332: towards the newspaper which he had been holding unread in his hand.
5333: 
5334: ‘Are you not coming, Anthony?’ said Lady Cheverel, noticing Miss Assher’s
5335: look of expectation.
5336: 
5337: ‘I think not, if you’ll excuse me,’ he answered, rising and opening the
5338: door; ‘I feel a little chilled this morning, and I am afraid of the cold
5339: rooms and draughts.’
5340: 
5341: Miss Assher reddened, but said nothing, and passed on, Lady Cheverel
5342: accompanying her.
5343: 
5344: Caterina was seated at work in the oriel window. It was the first time
5345: she and Anthony had been alone together, and she had thought before that
5346: he wished to avoid her. But now, surely, he wanted to speak to her--he
5347: wanted to say something kind. Presently he rose from his seat near the
5348: fire, and placed himself on the ottoman opposite to her.
5349: 
5350: ‘Well, Tina, and how have you been all this long time?’ Both the tone and
5351: the words were an offence to her; the tone was so different from the old
5352: one, the words were so cold and unmeaning. She answered, with a little
5353: bitterness,--‘I think you needn’t ask. It doesn’t make much difference to
5354: you.’
5355: 
5356: ‘Is that the kindest thing you have to say to me after my long absence?’
5357: 
5358: ‘I don’t know why you should expect me to say kind things.’
5359: 
5360: Captain Wybrow was silent. He wished very much to avoid allusions to the
5361: past or comments on the present. And yet he wished to be well with
5362: Caterina. He would have liked to caress her, make her presents, and have
5363: her think him very kind to her. But these women are plaguy perverse!
5364: There’s no bringing them to look rationally at anything. At last he said,
5365: ‘I hoped you would think all the better of me, Tina, for doing as I have
5366: done, instead of bearing malice towards me. I hoped you would see that it
5367: is the best thing for every one--the best for your happiness too.’
5368: 
5369: ‘O pray don’t make love to Miss Assher for the sake of my happiness,’
5370: answered Tina.
5371: 
5372: At this moment the door opened, and Miss Assher entered, to fetch her
5373: reticule, which lay on the harpsichord. She gave a keen glance at
5374: Caterina, whose face was flushed, and saying to Captain Wybrow with a
5375: slight sneer, ‘Since you are so chill I wonder you like to sit in the
5376: window,’ left the room again immediately.
5377: 
5378: The lover did not appear much discomposed, but sat quiet a little longer,
5379: and then, seating himself on the music-stool, drew it near to Caterina,
5380: and, taking her hand, said, ‘Come, Tina, look kindly at me, and let us be
5381: friends. I shall always be your friend.’
5382: 
5383: ‘Thank you,’ said Caterina, drawing away her hand. ‘You are very
5384: generous. But pray move away. Miss Assher may come in again.’
5385: 
5386: ‘Miss Assher be hanged!’ said Anthony, feeling the fascination of old
5387: habit returning on him in his proximity to Caterina. He put his arm round
5388: her waist, and leaned his cheek down to hers. The lips couldn’t help
5389: meeting after that; but the next moment, with heart swelling and tears
5390: rising, Caterina burst away from him, and rushed out of the room.
5391: 
5392: 
5393: 
5394: 
5395: Chapter 7
5396: 
5397: 
5398: Caterina tore herself from Anthony with the desperate effort of one who
5399: has just self-recollection enough left to be conscious that the fumes of
5400: charcoal will master his senses unless he bursts a way for himself to the
5401: fresh air; but when she reached her own room, she was still too
5402: intoxicated with that momentary revival of old emotions, too much
5403: agitated by the sudden return of tenderness in her lover, to know whether
5404: pain or pleasure predominated. It was as if a miracle had happened in her
5405: little world of feeling, and made the future all vague--a dim morning
5406: haze of possibilities, instead of the sombre wintry daylight and clear
5407: rigid outline of painful certainty.
5408: 
5409: She felt the need of rapid movement. She must walk out in spite of the
5410: rain. Happily, there was a thin place in the curtain of clouds which
5411: seemed to promise that now, about noon, the day had a mind to clear up.
5412: Caterina thought to herself, ‘I will walk to the Mosslands, and carry Mr.
5413: Bates the comforter I have made for him, and then Lady Cheverel will not
5414: wonder so much at my going out.’ At the hall door she found Rupert, the
5415: old bloodhound, stationed on the mat, with the determination that the
5416: first person who was sensible enough to take a walk that morning should
5417: have the honour of his approbation and society. As he thrust his great
5418: black and tawny head under her hand, and wagged his tail with vigorous
5419: eloquence, and reached the climax of his welcome by jumping up to lick
5420: her face, which was at a convenient licking height for him, Caterina felt
5421: quite grateful to the old dog for his friendliness. Animals are such
5422: agreeable friends--they ask no questions, they pass no criticisms.
5423: 
5424: The ‘Mosslands’ was a remote part of the grounds, encircled by the little
5425: stream issuing from the pool; and certainly, for a wet day, Caterina
5426: could hardly have chosen a less suitable walk, for though the rain was
5427: abating, and presently ceased altogether, there was still a smart shower
5428: falling from the trees which arched over the greater part of her way. But
5429: she found just the desired relief from her feverish excitement in
5430: labouring along the wet paths with an umbrella that made her arm ache.
5431: This amount of exertion was to her tiny body what a day’s hunting often
5432: was to Mr. Gilfil, who at times had _his_ fits of jealousy and sadness to
5433: get rid of, and wisely had recourse to nature’s innocent opium--fatigue.
5434: 
5435: When Caterina reached the pretty arched wooden bridge which formed the
5436: only entrance to the Mosslands for any but webbed feet, the sun had
5437: mastered the clouds, and was shining through the boughs of the tall elms
5438: that made a deep nest for the gardener’s cottage--turning the raindrops
5439: into diamonds, and inviting the nasturtium flowers creeping over the
5440: porch and low-thatched roof to lift up their flame-coloured heads once
5441: more. The rooks were cawing with many-voiced monotony, apparently--by a
5442: remarkable approximation to human intelligence--finding great
5443: conversational resources in the change of weather. The mossy turf,
5444: studded with the broad blades of marsh-loving plants, told that Mr.
5445: Bates’s nest was rather damp in the best of weather; but he was of
5446: opinion that a little external moisture would hurt no man who was not
5447: perversely neglectful of that obvious and providential antidote,
5448: rum-and-water.
5449: 
5450: Caterina loved this nest. Every object in it, every sound that haunted
5451: it, had been familiar to her from the days when she had been carried
5452: thither on Mr. Bates’s arm, making little cawing noises to imitate the
5453: rooks, clapping her hands at the green frogs leaping in the moist grass,
5454: and fixing grave eyes on the gardener’s fowls cluck-clucking under their
5455: pens. And now the spot looked prettier to her than ever; it was so out of
5456: the way of Miss Assher, with her brilliant beauty, and personal claims,
5457: and small civil remarks. She thought Mr. Bates would not be come into his
5458: dinner yet, so she would sit down and wait for him.
5459: 
5460: But she was mistaken. Mr. Bates was seated in his arm-chair, with his
5461: pocket-handkerchief thrown over his face, as the most eligible mode of
5462: passing away those superfluous hours between meals when the weather
5463: drives a man in-doors. Roused by the furious barking of his chained
5464: bulldog, he descried his little favourite approaching, and forthwith
5465: presented himself at the doorway, looking disproportionately tall
5466: compared with the height of his cottage. The bulldog, meanwhile, unbent
5467: from the severity of his official demeanour, and commenced a friendly
5468: interchange of ideas with Rupert.
5469: 
5470: Mr. Bates’s hair was now grey, but his frame was none the less stalwart,
5471: and his face looked all the redder, making an artistic contrast with the
5472: deep blue of his cotton neckerchief, and of his linen apron twisted into
5473: a girdle round his waist.
5474: 
5475: ‘Why, dang my boottons, Miss Tiny,’ he exclaimed, ‘hoo coom ye to coom
5476: oot dabblin’ your faet laike a little Muscovy duck, sich a day as this?
5477: Not but what ai’m delaighted to sae ye. Here Hesther,’ he called to his
5478: old humpbacked housekeeper, ‘tek the young ledy’s oombrella an’ spread
5479: it oot to dray. Coom, coom in, Miss Tiny, an’ set ye doon by the faire
5480: an’ dray yer faet, an’ hev summat warm to kape ye from ketchin’ coold.’
5481: 
5482: Mr. Bates led the way, stooping under the doorplaces, into his small
5483: sitting-room, and, shaking the patchwork cushion in his arm-chair, moved
5484: it to within a good roasting distance of the blazing fire.
5485: 
5486: ‘Thank you, uncle Bates’ (Caterina kept up her childish epithets for her
5487: friends, and this was one of them); ‘not quite so close to the fire, for
5488: I am warm with walking.’
5489: 
5490: ‘Eh, but yer shoes are faine an’ wet, an’ ye must put up yer faet on the
5491: fender. Rare big faet, baint ’em?--aboot the saize of a good big spoon. I
5492: woonder ye can mek a shift to stan’ on ’em. Now, what’ll ye hev to warm
5493: yer insaide?--a drop o’ hot elder wain, now?’
5494: 
5495: ‘No, not anything to drink, thank you; it isn’t very long since
5496: breakfast,’ said Caterina, drawing out the comforter from her deep
5497: pocket. Pockets were capacious in those days. ‘Look here, uncle Bates,
5498: here is what I came to bring you. I made it on purpose for you. You must
5499: wear it this winter, and give your red one to old Brooks.’
5500: 
5501: ‘Eh, Miss Tiny, this _is_ a beauty. An’ ye made it all wi’ yer little
5502: fingers for an old feller laike mae! I tek it very kaind on ye, an’ I
5503: belave ye I’ll wear it, and be prood on’t too. These sthraipes, blue an’
5504: whaite, now, they mek it uncommon pritty.’
5505: 
5506: ‘Yes, that will suit your complexion, you know, better than the old
5507: scarlet one. I know Mrs. Sharp will be more in love with you than ever
5508: when she sees you in the new one.’
5509: 
5510: ‘My complexion, ye little roogue! ye’re a laughin’ at me. But talkin’ o’
5511: complexions, what a beautiful colour the bride as is to be has on her
5512: cheeks! Dang my boottons! she looks faine and handsome o’ hossback--sits
5513: as upraight as a dart, wi’ a figure like a statty! Misthress Sharp has
5514: promised to put me behaind one o’ the doors when the ladies are comin’
5515: doon to dinner, so as I may sae the young un i’ full dress, wi’ all her
5516: curls an’ that. Misthress Sharp says she’s almost beautifuller nor my
5517: ledy was when she was yoong; an’ I think ye’ll noot faind man i’ the
5518: counthry as’ll coom up to that.’
5519: 
5520: ‘Yes, Miss Assher is very handsome,’ said Caterina, rather faintly,
5521: feeling the sense of her own insignificance returning at this picture of
5522: the impression Miss Assher made on others.
5523: 
5524: ‘Well, an’ I hope she’s good too, an’ll mek a good naice to Sir
5525: Cristhifer an’ my ledy. Misthress Griffin, the maid, says as she’s rether
5526: tatchy and find-fautin’ aboot her cloothes, laike. But she’s yoong--she’s
5527: yoong; that’ll wear off when she’s got a hoosband, an’ children, an’
5528: summat else to think on. Sir Cristhifer’s fain an’ delaighted, I can see.
5529: He says to me th’ other mornin’, says he, “Well, Bates, what do you think
5530: of your young misthress as is to be?” An’ I says, “Whay, yer honour, I
5531: think she’s as fain a lass as iver I set eyes on; an’ I wish the Captain
5532: luck in a fain family, an’ your honour laife an’ health to see’t.” Mr.
5533: Warren says as the masther’s all for forrardin’ the weddin’, an’ it’ll
5534: very laike be afore the autumn’s oot.’
5535: 
5536: As Mr. Bates ran on, Caterina felt something like a painful contraction
5537: at her heart. ‘Yes,’ she said, rising, ‘I dare say it will. Sir
5538: Christopher is very anxious for it. But I must go, uncle Bates; Lady
5539: Cheverel will be wanting me, and it is your dinner-time.’
5540: 
5541: ‘Nay, my dinner doon’t sinnify a bit; but I moosn’t kaep ye if my ledy
5542: wants ye. Though I hevn’t thanked ye half anoof for the comfiter--the
5543: wrapraskil, as they call’t. My feckins, it’s a beauty. But ye look very
5544: whaite and sadly, Miss Tiny; I doubt ye’re poorly; an’ this walking i’
5545: th’ wet isn’t good for ye.’
5546: 
5547: ‘O yes, it is indeed,’ said Caterina, hastening out, and taking up her
5548: umbrella from the kitchen floor. ‘I must really go now; so good-bye.’
5549: 
5550: She tripped off, calling Rupert, while the good gardener, his hands
5551: thrust deep in his pockets, stood looking after her and shaking his head
5552: with rather a melancholy air.
5553: 
5554: ‘She gets moor nesh and dillicat than iver,’ he said, half to himself and
5555: half to Hester. ‘I shouldn’t woonder if she fades away laike them
5556: cyclamens as I transplanted. She puts me i’ maind on ’em somehow, hangin’
5557: on their little thin stalks, so whaite an’ tinder.’
5558: 
5559: The poor little thing made her way back, no longer hungering for the cold
5560: moist air as a counteractive of inward excitement, but with a chill at
5561: her heart which made the outward chill only depressing. The golden
5562: sunlight beamed through the dripping boughs like a Shechinah, or visible
5563: divine presence, and the birds were chirping and trilling their new
5564: autumnal songs so sweetly, it seemed as if their throats, as well as the
5565: air, were all the clearer for the rain; but Caterina moved through all
5566: this joy and beauty like a poor wounded leveret painfully dragging its
5567: little body through the sweet clover-tufts--for it, sweet in vain. Mr.
5568: Bates’s words about Sir Christopher’s joy, Miss Assher’s beauty, and the
5569: nearness of the wedding, had come upon her like the pressure of a cold
5570: hand, rousing her from confused dozing to a perception of hard, familiar
5571: realities. It is so with emotional natures whose thoughts are no more
5572: than the fleeting shadows cast by feeling: to them words are facts, and
5573: even when known to be false, have a mastery over their smiles and tears.
5574: Caterina entered her own room again, with no other change from her former
5575: state of despondency and wretchedness than an additional sense of injury
5576: from Anthony. His behaviour towards her in the morning was a new wrong.
5577: To snatch a caress when she justly claimed an expression of penitence, of
5578: regret, of sympathy, was to make more light of her than ever.
5579: 
5580: 
5581: 
5582: 
5583: Chapter 8
5584: 
5585: 
5586: That evening Miss Assher seemed to carry herself with unusual
5587: haughtiness, and was coldly observant of Caterina. There was unmistakably
5588: thunder in the air. Captain Wybrow appeared to take the matter very
5589: easily, and was inclined to brave it out by paying more than ordinary
5590: attention to Caterina. Mr. Gilfil had induced her to play a game at
5591: draughts with him, Lady Assher being seated at picquet with Sir
5592: Christopher, and Miss Assher in determined conversation with Lady
5593: Cheverel. Anthony, thus left as an odd unit, sauntered up to Caterina’s
5594: chair, and leaned behind her, watching the game. Tina, with all the
5595: remembrances of the morning thick upon her, felt her cheeks becoming more
5596: and more crimson, and at last said impatiently, ‘I wish you would go
5597: away.’
5598: 
5599: This happened directly under the view of Miss Assher, who saw Caterina’s
5600: reddening cheeks, saw that she said something impatiently, and that
5601: Captain Wybrow moved away in consequence. There was another person, too,
5602: who had noticed this incident with strong interest, and who was moreover
5603: aware that Miss Assher not only saw, but keenly observed what was
5604: passing. That other person was Mr. Gilfil, and he drew some painful
5605: conclusions which heightened his anxiety for Caterina.
5606: 
5607: The next morning, in spite of the fine weather, Miss Assher declined
5608: riding, and Lady Cheverel, perceiving that there was something wrong
5609: between the lovers, took care that they should be left together in the
5610: drawing-room. Miss Assher, seated on the sofa near the fire, was busy
5611: with some fancy-work, in which she seemed bent on making great progress
5612: this morning. Captain Wybrow sat opposite with a newspaper in his hand,
5613: from which he obligingly read extracts with an elaborately easy air,
5614: wilfully unconscious of the contemptuous silence with which she pursued
5615: her filigree work. At length he put down the paper, which he could no
5616: longer pretend not to have exhausted, and Miss Assher then said,--‘You
5617: seem to be on very intimate terms with Miss Sarti.’
5618: 
5619: ‘With Tina? oh yes; she has always been the pet of the house, you know.
5620: We have been quite brother and sister together.’
5621: 
5622: ‘Sisters don’t generally colour so very deeply when their brothers
5623: approach them.’
5624: 
5625: ‘Does she colour? I never noticed it. But she’s a timid little thing.’
5626: 
5627: ‘It would be much better if you would not be so hypocritical, Captain
5628: Wybrow. I am confident there has been some flirtation between you. Miss
5629: Sarti, in her position, would never speak to you with the petulance she
5630: did last night, if you had not given her some kind of claim on you.’
5631: 
5632: ‘My dear Beatrice, now do be reasonable; do ask yourself what earthly
5633: probability there is that I should think of flirting with poor little
5634: Tina. _Is_ there anything about her to attract that sort of attention?
5635: She is more child than woman. One thinks of her as a little girl to be
5636: petted and played with.’
5637: 
5638: ‘Pray, what were you playing at with her yesterday morning, when I came
5639: in unexpectedly, and her cheeks were flushed, and her hands trembling?’
5640: 
5641: ‘Yesterday morning?--O, I remember. You know I always tease her about
5642: Gilfil, who is over head and ears in love with her; and she is angry at
5643: that,--perhaps, because she likes him. They were old playfellows years
5644: before I came here, and Sir Christopher has set his heart on their
5645: marrying.’
5646: 
5647: ‘Captain Wybrow, you are very false. It had nothing to do with Mr. Gilfil
5648: that she coloured last night when you leaned over her chair. You might
5649: just as well be candid. If your own mind is not made up, pray do no
5650: violence to yourself. I am quite ready to give way to Miss Sarti’s
5651: superior attractions. Understand that, so far as I am concerned, you are
5652: perfectly at liberty. I decline any share in the affection of a man who
5653: forfeits my respect by duplicity.’
5654: 
5655: In saying this Miss Assher rose, and was sweeping haughtily out of the
5656: room, when Captain Wybrow placed himself before her, and took her hand.
5657: ‘Dear, dear Beatrice, be patient; do not judge me so rashly. Sit down
5658: again, sweet,’ he added in a pleading voice, pressing both her hands
5659: between his, and leading her back to the sofa, where he sat down beside
5660: her. Miss Assher was not unwilling to be led back or to listen, but she
5661: retained her cold and haughty expression.
5662: 
5663: ‘Can you not trust me, Beatrice? Can you not believe me, although there
5664: may be things I am unable to explain?’
5665: 
5666: ‘Why should there be anything you are unable to explain? An honourable
5667: man will not be placed in circumstances which he cannot explain to the
5668: woman he seeks to make his wife. He will not ask her to _believe_ that he
5669: acts properly; he will let her _know_ that he does so. Let me go, sir.’
5670: 
5671: She attempted to rise, but he passed his hand round her waist and
5672: detained her.
5673: 
5674: ‘Now, Beatrice dear,’ he said imploringly, ‘can you not understand that
5675: there are things a man doesn’t like to talk about--secrets that he must
5676: keep for the sake of others, and not for his own sake? Everything that
5677: relates to myself you may ask me, but do not ask me to tell other
5678: people’s secrets. Don’t you understand me?’
5679: 
5680: ‘O yes,’ said Miss Assher scornfully, ‘I understand. Whenever you make
5681: love to a woman--that is her secret, which you are bound to keep for her.
5682: But it is folly to be talking in this way, Captain Wybrow. It is very
5683: plain that there is some relation more than friendship between you and
5684: Miss Sarti. Since you cannot explain that relation, there is no more to
5685: be said between us.’
5686: 
5687: ‘Confound it, Beatrice! you’ll drive me mad. Can a fellow help a girl’s
5688: falling in love with him? Such things are always happening, but men don’t
5689: talk of them. These fancies will spring up without the slightest
5690: foundation, especially when a woman sees few people; they die out again
5691: when there is no encouragement. If you could like me, you ought not to be
5692: surprised that other people can; you ought to think the better of them
5693: for it.’
5694: 
5695: ‘You mean to say, then, that Miss Sarti is in love with you, without your
5696: ever having made love to her.’
5697: 
5698: ‘Do not press me to say such things, dearest. It is enough that you know
5699: I love you--that I am devoted to you. You naughty queen, you, you know
5700: there is no chance for any one else where you are. You are only
5701: tormenting me, to prove your power over me. But don’t be too cruel; for
5702: you know they say I have another heart-disease besides love, and these
5703: scenes bring on terrible palpitations.’
5704: 
5705: ‘But I must have an answer to this one question,’ said Miss Assher, a
5706: little softened: ‘Has there been, or is there, any love on your side
5707: towards Miss Sarti? I have nothing to do with her feelings, but I have a
5708: right to know yours.’
5709: 
5710: ‘I like Tina very much; who would not like such a little simple thing?
5711: You would not wish me not to like her? But love--that is a very different
5712: affair. One has a brotherly affection for such a woman as Tina; but it is
5713: another sort of woman that one loves.’
5714: 
5715: These last words were made doubly significant by a look of tenderness,
5716: and a kiss imprinted on the hand Captain Wybrow held in his. Miss Assher
5717: was conquered. It was so far from probable that Anthony should love that
5718: pale insignificant little thing--so highly probable that he should adore
5719: the beautiful Miss Assher. On the whole, it was rather gratifying that
5720: other women should be languishing for her handsome lover; he really was
5721: an exquisite creature. Poor Miss Sarti! Well, she would get over it.
5722: 
5723: Captain Wybrow saw his advantage. ‘Come, sweet love,’ he continued, ‘let
5724: us talk no more about unpleasant things. You will keep Tina’s secret, and
5725: be very kind to her--won’t you?--for my sake. But you will ride out now?
5726: See what a glorious day it is for riding. Let me order the horses. I’m
5727: terribly in want of the air. Come, give me one forgiving kiss, and say
5728: you will go.’
5729: 
5730: Miss Assher complied with the double request, and then went to equip
5731: herself for the ride, while her lover walked to the stables.
5732: 
5733: 
5734: 
5735: 
5736: Chapter 9
5737: 
5738: 
5739: Meanwhile Mr. Gilfil, who had a heavy weight on his mind, had watched for
5740: the moment when, the two elder ladies having driven out, Caterina would
5741: probably be alone in Lady Cheverel’s sitting-room. He went up and knocked
5742: at the door.
5743: 
5744: ‘Come in,’ said the sweet mellow voice, always thrilling to him as the
5745: sound of rippling water to the thirsty.
5746: 
5747: He entered and found Caterina standing in some confusion as if she had
5748: been startled from a reverie. She felt relieved when she saw it was
5749: Maynard, but, the next moment, felt a little pettish that he should have
5750: come to interrupt and frighten her.
5751: 
5752: ‘Oh, it is you, Maynard! Do you want Lady Cheverel?’
5753: 
5754: ‘No, Caterina,’ he answered gravely; ‘I want you. I have something very
5755: particular to say to you. Will you let me sit down with you for half an
5756: hour?’
5757: 
5758: ‘Yes, dear old preacher,’ said Caterina, sitting down with an air of
5759: weariness; ‘what is it?’
5760: 
5761: Mr. Gilfil placed himself opposite to her, and said, ‘I hope you will not
5762: be hurt, Caterina, by what I am going to say to you. I do not speak from
5763: any other feelings than real affection and anxiety for you. I put
5764: everything else out of the question. You know you are more to me than all
5765: the world; but I will not thrust before you a feeling which you are
5766: unable to return. I speak to you as a brother--the old Maynard that used
5767: to scold you for getting your fishing-line tangled ten years ago. You
5768: will not believe that I have any mean, selfish motive in mentioning
5769: things that are painful to you?’
5770: 
5771: ‘No; I know you are very good,’ said Caterina, abstractedly.
5772: 
5773: ‘From what I saw yesterday evening,’ Mr. Gilfil went on, hesitating and
5774: colouring slightly, ‘I am led to fear--pray forgive me if I am wrong,
5775: Caterina--that you--that Captain Wybrow is base enough still to trifle
5776: with your feelings, that he still allows himself to behave to you as no
5777: man ought who is the declared lover of another woman.’
5778: 
5779: ‘What do you mean, Maynard?’ said Caterina, with anger flashing from her
5780: eyes. ‘Do you mean that I let him make love to me? What right have you to
5781: think that of me? What do you mean that you saw yesterday evening?’
5782: 
5783: ‘Do not be angry, Caterina. I don’t suspect you of doing wrong. I only
5784: suspect that heartless puppy of behaving so as to keep awake feelings in
5785: you that not only destroy your own peace of mind, but may lead to very
5786: bad consequences with regard to others. I want to warn you that Miss
5787: Assher has her eyes open on what passes between you and Captain Wybrow,
5788: and I feel sure she is getting jealous of you. Pray be very careful,
5789: Caterina, and try to behave with politeness and indifference to him. You
5790: must see by this time that he is not worth the feeling you have given
5791: him. He’s more disturbed at his pulse beating one too many in a minute,
5792: than at all the misery he has caused you by his foolish trifling.’
5793: 
5794: ‘You ought not to speak so of him, Maynard,’ said Caterina, passionately.
5795: ‘He is not what you think. He _did_ care for me; he _did_ love me; only
5796: he wanted to do what his uncle wished.’
5797: 
5798: ‘O to be sure! I know it is only from the most virtuous motives that he
5799: does what is convenient to himself.’
5800: 
5801: Mr. Gilfil paused. He felt that he was getting irritated, and defeating
5802: his own object. Presently he continued in a calm and affectionate tone.
5803: 
5804: ‘I will say no more about what I think of him, Caterina. But whether he
5805: loved you or not, his position now with Miss Assher is such that any love
5806: you may cherish for him can bring nothing but misery. God knows, I don’t
5807: expect you to leave off loving him at a moment’s notice. Time and
5808: absence, and trying to do what is right, are the only cures. If it were
5809: not that Sir Christopher and Lady Cheverel would be displeased and
5810: puzzled at your wishing to leave home just now, I would beg you to pay a
5811: visit to my sister. She and her husband are good creatures, and would
5812: make their house a home to you. But I could not urge the thing just now
5813: without giving a special reason; and what is most of all to be dreaded is
5814: the raising of any suspicion in Sir Christopher’s mind of what has
5815: happened in the past, or of your present feelings. You think so too,
5816: don’t you, Tina?’
5817: 
5818: Mr. Gilfil paused again, but Caterina said nothing. She was looking away
5819: from him, out of the window, and hereyes were filling with tears. He rose,
5820: and, advancing a little towards her, held out his hand and said,--‘Forgive
5821: me, Caterina, for intruding on your feelings in this way. I was so afraid
5822: you might not be aware how Miss Assher watched you. Remember, I entreat
5823: you, that the peace of the whole family depends on your power of governing
5824: yourself. Only say you forgive me before I go.’
5825: 
5826: ‘Dear, good Maynard,’ she said, stretching out her little hand, and
5827: taking two of his large fingers in her grasp, while her tears flowed
5828: fast; ‘I am very cross to you. But my heart is breaking. I don’t know
5829: what I do. Good-bye.’
5830: 
5831: He stooped down, kissed the little hand, and then left the room.
5832: 
5833: ‘The cursed scoundrel!’ he muttered between his teeth, as he closed the
5834: door behind him. ‘If it were not for Sir Christopher, I should like to
5835: pound him into paste to poison puppies like himself.’
5836: 
5837: 
5838: 
5839: 
5840: Chapter 10
5841: 
5842: 
5843: That evening Captain Wybrow, returning from a long ride with Miss Assher,
5844: went up to his dressing-room, and seated himself with an air of
5845: considerable lassitude before his mirror. The reflection there presented
5846: of his exquisite self was certainly paler and more worn than usual, and
5847: might excuse the anxiety with which he first felt his pulse, and then
5848: laid his hand on his heart.
5849: 
5850: ‘It’s a devil of a position this for a man to be in,’ was the train of
5851: his thought, as he kept his eyes fixed on the glass, while he leaned back
5852: in his chair, and crossed his hands behind his head; ‘between two jealous
5853: women, and both of them as ready to take fire as tinder. And in my state
5854: of health, too! I should be glad enough to run away from the whole
5855: affair, and go off to some lotos-eating place or other where there are no
5856: women, or only women who are too sleepy to be jealous. Here am I, doing
5857: nothing to please myself, trying to do the best thing for everybody else,
5858: and all the comfort I get is to have fire shot at me from women’s eyes,
5859: and venom spirted at me from women’s tongues. If Beatrice takes another
5860: jealous fit into her head--and it’s likely enough, Tina is so
5861: unmanageable--I don’t know what storm she may raise. And any hitch in
5862: this marriage, especially of that sort, might be a fatal business for the
5863: old gentleman. I wouldn’t have such a blow fall upon him for a great
5864: deal. Besides, a man must be married some time in his life, and I could
5865: hardly do better than marry Beatrice. She’s an uncommonly fine woman, and
5866: I’m really very fond of her; and as I shall let her have her own way, her
5867: temper won’t signify much. I wish the wedding was over and done with, for
5868: this fuss doesn’t suit me at all. I haven’t been half so well lately.
5869: That scene about Tina this morning quite upset me. Poor little Tina! What
5870: a little simpleton it was, to set her heart on me in that way! But she
5871: ought to see how impossible it is that things should be different. If she
5872: would but understand how kindly I feel towards her, and make up her mind
5873: to look on me as a friend;--but that is what one never can get a woman to
5874: do. Beatrice is very good-natured; I’m sure she would be kind to the
5875: little thing. It would be a great comfort if Tina would take to Gilfil,
5876: if it were only in anger against me. He’d make her a capital husband, and
5877: I should like to see the little grass-hopper happy. If I had been in a
5878: different position, I would certainly have married her myself: hut that
5879: was out of the question with my responsibilities to Sir Christopher. I
5880: think a little persuasion from my uncle would bring her to accept Gilfil;
5881: I know she would never be able to oppose my uncle’s wishes. And if they
5882: were once married, she’s such a loving little thing, she would soon be
5883: billing and cooing with him as if she had never known me. It would
5884: certainly be the best thing for her happiness if that marriage were
5885: hastened. Heigho! Those are lucky fellows that have no women falling in
5886: love with them. It’s a confounded responsibility.’
5887: 
5888: At this point in his meditations he turned his head a little, so as to
5889: get a three-quarter view of his face. Clearly it was the ‘_dono infelice
5890: della bellezza_’ that laid these onerous duties upon him--an idea which
5891: naturally suggested that he should ring for his valet.
5892: 
5893: For the next few days, however, there was such a cessation of threatening
5894: symptoms as to allay the anxiety both of Captain Wybrow and Mr. Gilfil.
5895: All earthly things have their lull: even on nights when the most
5896: unappeasable wind is raging, there will be a moment of stillness before
5897: it crashes among the boughs again, and storms against the windows, and
5898: howls like a thousand lost demons through the keyholes.
5899: 
5900: Miss Assher appeared to be in the highest good-humour; Captain Wybrow was
5901: more assiduous than usual, and was very circumspect in his behaviour to
5902: Caterina, on whom Miss Assher bestowed unwonted attentions. The weather
5903: was brilliant; there were riding excursions in the mornings and
5904: dinner-parties in the evenings. Consultations in the library between Sir
5905: Christopher and Lady Assher seemed to be leading to a satisfactory
5906: result; and it was understood that this visit at Cheverel Manor would
5907: terminate in another fortnight, when the preparations for the wedding
5908: would be carried forward with all despatch at Farleigh. The Baronet
5909: seemed every day more radiant. Accustomed to view people who entered into
5910: his plans by the pleasant light which his own strong will and bright
5911: hopefulness were always casting on the future, he saw nothing hut
5912: personal charms and promising domestic qualities in Miss Assher, whose
5913: quickness of eye and taste in externals formed a real ground of sympathy
5914: between her and Sir Christopher. Lady Cheverel’s enthusiasm never rose
5915: above the temperate mark of calm satisfaction, and, having quite her
5916: share of the critical acumen which characterizes the mutual estimates of
5917: the fair sex, she had a more moderate opinion of Miss Assher’s qualities.
5918: She suspected that the fair Beatrice had a sharp and imperious temper;
5919: and being herself, on principle and by habitual self-command, the most
5920: deferential of wives, she noticed with disapproval Miss Assher’s
5921: occasional air of authority towards Captain Wybrow. A proud woman who has
5922: learned to submit, carries all her pride to the reinforcement of her
5923: submission, and looks down with severe superiority on all feminine
5924: assumption as ‘unbecoming’. Lady Cheverel, however, confined her
5925: criticisms to the privacy of her own thoughts, and, with a reticence
5926: which I fear may seem incredible, did not use them as a means of
5927: disturbing her husband’s complacency.
5928: 
5929: And Caterina? How did she pass these sunny autumn days, in which the
5930: skies seemed to be smiling on the family gladness? To her the change in
5931: Miss Assher’s manner was unaccountable. Those compassionate attentions,
5932: those smiling condescensions, were torture to Caterina, who was
5933: constantly tempted to repulse them with anger. She thought, ‘Perhaps
5934: Anthony has told her to be kind to poor Tina.’ This was an insult. He
5935: ought to have known that the mere presence of Miss Assher was painful to
5936: her, that Miss Assher’s smiles scorched her, that Miss Assher’s kind
5937: words were like poison stings inflaming her to madness. And he--Anthony--he
5938: was evidently repenting of the tenderness he had been betrayed into
5939: that morning in the drawing-room. He was cold and distant and civil to
5940: her, to ward off Beatrice’s suspicions, and Beatrice could be so gracious
5941: now, because she was sure of Anthony’s entire devotion. Well! and so it
5942: ought to be--and she ought not to wish it otherwise. And yet--oh, he
5943: _was_ cruel to her. She could never have behaved so to him. To make her
5944: love him so--to speak such tender words--to give her such caresses, and
5945: then to behave as if such things had never been. He had given her the
5946: poison that seemed so sweet while she was drinking it, and now it was in
5947: her blood, and she was helpless.
5948: 
5949: With this tempest pent up in her bosom, the poor child went up to her
5950: room every night, and there it all burst forth. There, with loud whispers
5951: and sobs, restlessly pacing up and down, lying on the hard floor,
5952: courting cold and weariness, she told to the pitiful listening night the
5953: anguish which she could pour into no mortal ear. But always sleep came at
5954: last, and always in the morning the reactive calm that enabled her to
5955: live through the day.
5956: 
5957: It is amazing how long a young frame will go on battling with this sort
5958: of secret wretchedness, and yet show no traces of the conflict for any
5959: but sympathetic eyes. The very delicacy of Caterina’s usual appearance,
5960: her natural paleness and habitually quiet mouse-like ways, made any
5961: symptoms of fatigue and suffering less noticeable. And her singing--the
5962: one thing in which she ceased to be passive, and became prominent--lost
5963: none of its energy. She herself sometimes wondered how it was that,
5964: whether she felt sad or angry, crushed with the sense of Anthony’s
5965: indifference, or burning with impatience under Miss Assher’s attentions,
5966: it was always a relief to her to sing. Those full deep notes she sent
5967: forth seemed to be lifting the pain from her heart--seemed to be carrying
5968: away the madness from her brain.
5969: 
5970: Thus Lady Cheverel noticed no change in Caterina, and it was only Mr.
5971: Gilfil who discerned with anxiety the feverish spot that sometimes rose
5972: on her cheek, the deepening violet tint under her eyes, and the strange
5973: absent glance, the unhealthy glitter of the beautiful eyes themselves.
5974: But those agitated nights were producing a more fatal effect than was
5975: represented by these slight outward changes.
5976: 
5977: 
5978: 
5979: 
5980: Chapter 11
5981: 
5982: 
5983: The following Sunday, the morning being rainy, it was determined that the
5984: family should not go to Cumbermoor Church as usual, but that Mr. Gilfil,
5985: who had only an afternoon service at his curacy, should conduct the
5986: morning service in the chapel.
5987: 
5988: Just before the appointed hour of eleven, Caterina came down into the
5989: drawing-room, looking so unusually ill as to call forth an anxious
5990: inquiry from Lady Cheverel, who, on learning that she had a severe
5991: headache, insisted that she should not attend service, and at once packed
5992: her up comfortably on a sofa near the fire, putting a volume of
5993: Tillotson’s Sermons into her hands--as appropriate reading, if Caterina
5994: should feel equal to that means of edification.
5995: 
5996: Excellent medicine for the mind are the good Archbishop’s sermons, but a
5997: medicine, unhappily, not suited to Tina’s case. She sat with the book
5998: open on her knees, her dark eyes fixed vacantly on the portrait of that
5999: handsome Lady Cheverel, wife of the notable Sir Anthony. She gazed at the
6000: picture without thinking of it, and the fair blonde dame seemed to look
6001: down on her with that benignant unconcern, that mild wonder, with which
6002: happy self-possessed women are apt to look down on their agitated and
6003: weaker sisters.
6004: 
6005: Caterina was thinking of the near future--of the wedding that was so soon
6006: to come--of all she would have to live through in the next months.
6007: 
6008: ‘I wish I could be very ill, and die before then,’ she thought. ‘When
6009: people get very ill, they don’t mind about things. Poor Patty Richards
6010: looked so happy when she was in a decline. She didn’t seem to care any
6011: more about her lover that she was engaged to be married to, and she liked
6012: the smell of the flowers so, that I used to take her. O, if I could but
6013: like anything--if I could but think about anything else! If these
6014: dreadful feelings would go away, I wouldn’t mind about not being happy. I
6015: wouldn’t want anything--and I could do what would please Sir Christopher
6016: and Lady Cheverel. But when that rage and anger comes into me, I don’t
6017: know what to do. I don’t feel the ground under me; I only feel my head
6018: and heart beating, and it seems as if I must do something dreadful. O! I
6019: wonder if any one ever felt like me before. I must be very wicked. But
6020: God will have pity on me; He knows all I have to bear.’
6021: 
6022: In this way the time wore on till Tina heard the sound of voices along
6023: the passage, and became conscious that the volume of Tillotson had
6024: slipped on the floor. She had only just picked it up, and seen with alarm
6025: that the pages were bent, when Lady Assher, Beatrice, and Captain Wybrow
6026: entered, all with that brisk and cheerful air which a sermon is often
6027: observed to produce when it is quite finished.
6028: 
6029: Lady Assher at once came and seated herself by Caterina. Her ladyship had
6030: been considerably refreshed by a doze, and was in great force for
6031: monologue.
6032: 
6033: ‘Well, my dear Miss Sarti, and how do you feel now?--a little better, I
6034: see. I thought you would be, sitting quietly here. These headaches, now,
6035: are all from weakness. You must not over-exert yourself, and you must
6036: take bitters. I used to have just the same sort of headaches when I was
6037: your age, and old Dr Samson used to say to my mother, “Madam, what your
6038: daughter suffers from is weakness.” He was such a curious old man, was Dr
6039: Samson. But I wish you could have heard the sermon this morning. Such an
6040: excellent sermon! It was about the ten virgins: five of them were
6041: foolish, and five were clever, you know; and Mr. Gilfil explained all
6042: that. What a very pleasant young man he is! so very quiet and agreeable,
6043: and such a good hand at whist. I wish we had him at Farleigh. Sir John
6044: would have liked him beyond anything; he is so good-tempered at cards,
6045: and he was such a man for cards, was Sir John. And our rector is a very
6046: irritable man; he can’t bear to lose his money at cards. I don’t think a
6047: clergyman ought to mind about losing his money; do you?--do you now?’
6048: 
6049: ‘O pray, Lady Assher,’ interposed Beatrice, in her usual tone of
6050: superiority, ‘do not weary poor Caterina with such uninteresting
6051: questions. Your head seems very bad still, dear,’ she continued, in a
6052: condoling tone, to Caterina; ‘do take my vinaigrette, and keep it in your
6053: pocket. It will perhaps refresh you now and then.’
6054: 
6055: ‘No, thank you,’ answered Caterina; ‘I will not take it away from you.’
6056: 
6057: ‘Indeed, dear, I never use it; you must take it,’ Miss Assher persisted,
6058: holding it close to Tina’s hand. Tina coloured deeply, pushed the
6059: vinaigrette away with some impatience, and said, ‘Thank you, I never use
6060: those things. I don’t like vinaigrettes.’
6061: 
6062: Miss Assher returned the vinaigrette to her pocket in surprise and
6063: haughty silence, and Captain Wybrow, who had looked on in some alarm,
6064: said hastily, ‘See! it is quite bright out of doors now. There is time
6065: for a walk before luncheon. Come, Beatrice, put on your hat and cloak,
6066: and let us have half an hour’s walk on the gravel.’
6067: 
6068: ‘Yes, do, my dear,’ said Lady Assher, ‘and I will go and see if Sir
6069: Christopher is having his walk in the gallery.’
6070: 
6071: As soon as the door had closed behind the two ladies, Captain Wybrow,
6072: standing with his back to the fire, turned towards Caterina, and said in
6073: a tone of earnest remonstrance, ‘My dear Caterina. Let me beg of you to
6074: exercise more control over your feelings; you are really rude to Miss
6075: Assher, and I can see that she is quite hurt. Consider how strange your
6076: behaviour must appear to her. She will wonder what can be the cause of
6077: it. Come, dear Tina,’ he added, approaching her, and attempting to take
6078: her hand; ‘for your own sake let me entreat you to receive her attentions
6079: politely. She really feels very kindly towards you, and I should be so
6080: happy to see you friends.’
6081: 
6082: Caterina was already in such a state of diseased susceptibility that the
6083: most innocent words from Captain Wybrow would have been irritating to
6084: her, as the whirr of the most delicate wing will afflict a nervous
6085: patient. But this tone of benevolent remonstrance was intolerable. He had
6086: inflicted a great and unrepented injury on her, and now he assumed an air
6087: of benevolence towards her. This was a new outrage. His profession of
6088: goodwill was insolence.
6089: 
6090: Caterina snatched away her hand and said indignantly, ‘Leave me to
6091: myself, Captain Wybrow! I do not disturb you.’
6092: 
6093: ‘Caterina, why will you be so violent--so unjust to me? It is for you
6094: that I feel anxious. Miss Assher has already noticed how strange your
6095: behaviour is both to her and me, and it puts me into a very difficult
6096: position. What can I say to her?’
6097: 
6098: ‘Say?’ Caterina burst forth with intense bitterness, rising, and moving
6099: towards the door; ‘say that I am a poor silly girl, and have fallen in
6100: love with you, and am jealous of her; but that you have never had any
6101: feeling but pity for me--you have never behaved with anything more than
6102: friendliness to me. Tell her that, and she will think all the better of
6103: you.’
6104: 
6105: Tina uttered this as the bitterest sarcasm her ideas would furnish her
6106: with, not having the faintest suspicion that the sarcasm derived any of
6107: its bitterness from truth. Underneath all her sense of wrong, which was
6108: rather instinctive than reflective--underneath all the madness of
6109: her jealousy, and her ungovernable impulses of resentment and
6110: vindictiveness--underneath all this scorching passion there were still
6111: left some hidden crystal dews of trust, of self-reproof, of belief that
6112: Anthony was trying to do the right. Love had not all gone to feed the
6113: fires of hatred. Tina still trusted that Anthony felt more for her than
6114: he seemed to feel; she was still far from suspecting him of a wrong
6115: which a woman resents even more than inconstancy. And she threw out this
6116: taunt simply as the most intense expression she could find for the anger
6117: of the moment.
6118: 
6119: As she stood nearly in the middle of the room, her little body trembling
6120: under the shock of passions too strong for it, her very lips pale, and
6121: her eyes gleaming, the door opened, and Miss Assher appeared, tall,
6122: blooming, and splendid, in her walking costume. As she entered, her face
6123: wore the smile appropriate to the exits and entrances of a young lady who
6124: feels that her presence is an interesting fact; but the next moment she
6125: looked at Caterina with grave surprise, and then threw a glance of angry
6126: suspicion at Captain Wybrow, who wore an air of weariness and vexation.
6127: 
6128: ‘Perhaps you are too much engaged to walk out, Captain Wybrow? I will go
6129: alone.’
6130: 
6131: ‘No, no, I am coming,’ he answered, hurrying towards her, and leading her
6132: out of the room; leaving poor Caterina to feel all the reaction of shame
6133: and self-reproach after her outburst of passion.
6134: 
6135: 
6136: 
6137: 
6138: Chapter 12
6139: 
6140: 
6141: ‘Pray, what is likely to be the next scene in the drama between you and
6142: Miss Sarti?’ said Miss Assher to Captain Wybrow as soon as they were out
6143: on the gravel. ‘It would be agreeable to have some idea of what is
6144: coming.’
6145: 
6146: Captain Wybrow was silent. He felt out of humour, wearied, annoyed. There
6147: come moments when one almost determines never again to oppose anything
6148: but dead silence to an angry woman. ‘Now then, confound it,’ he said to
6149: himself, ‘I’m going to be battered on the other flank.’ He looked
6150: resolutely at the horizon, with something more like a frown on his face
6151: than Beatrice had ever seen there.
6152: 
6153: After a pause of two or three minutes, she continued in a still haughtier
6154: tone, ‘I suppose you are aware, Captain Wybrow, that I expect an
6155: explanation of what I have just seen.’
6156: 
6157: ‘I have no explanation, my dear Beatrice,’ he answered at last, making a
6158: strong effort over himself, ‘except what I have already given you. I
6159: hoped you would never recur to the subject.’
6160: 
6161: ‘Your explanation, however, is very far from satisfactory. I can only say
6162: that the airs Miss Sarti thinks herself entitled to put on towards you,
6163: are quite incompatible with your position as regards me. And her
6164: behaviour to me is most insulting. I shall certainly not stay in the
6165: house under such circumstances, and mamma must state the reasons to Sir
6166: Christopher.’
6167: 
6168: ‘Beatrice,’ said Captain Wybrow, his irritation giving way to alarm, ‘I
6169: beseech you to be patient, and exercise your good feelings in this
6170: affair. It is very painful, I know, but I am sure you would be grieved to
6171: injure poor Caterina--to bring down my uncle’s anger upon her. Consider
6172: what a poor little dependent thing she is.’
6173: 
6174: ‘It is very adroit of you to make these evasions, but do not suppose that
6175: they deceive me. Miss Sarti would never dare to behave to you as she
6176: does, if you had not flirted with her, or made love to her. I suppose she
6177: considers your engagement to me a breach of faith to her. I am much
6178: obliged to you, certainly, for making me Miss Sarti’s rival. You have
6179: told me a falsehood, Captain Wybrow.’
6180: 
6181: ‘Beatrice, I solemnly declare to you that Caterina is nothing more to me
6182: than a girl I naturally feel kindly to--as a favourite of my uncle’s, and
6183: a nice little thing enough. I should be glad to see her married to Gilfil
6184: to-morrow; that’s a good proof that I’m not in love with her, I should
6185: think. As to the past, I may have shown her little attentions, which she
6186: has exaggerated and misinterpreted. What man is not liable to that sort
6187: of thing?’
6188: 
6189: ‘But what can she found her behaviour on? What had she been saying to you
6190: this morning to make her tremble and turn pale in that way?’
6191: 
6192: ‘O, I don’t know. I just said something about her behaving peevishly.
6193: With that Italian blood of hers, there’s no knowing how she may take what
6194: one says. She’s a fierce little thing, though she seems so quiet
6195: generally.’
6196: 
6197: ‘But she ought to be made to know how unbecoming and indelicate her
6198: conduct is. For my part, I wonder Lady Cheverel has not noticed her short
6199: answers and the airs she puts on.’
6200: 
6201: ‘Let me beg of you, Beatrice, not to hint anything of the kind to Lady
6202: Cheverel. You must have observed how strict my aunt is. It never enters
6203: her head that a girl can be in love with a man who has not made her an
6204: offer.’
6205: 
6206: ‘Well, I shall let Miss Sarti know myself that I have observed her
6207: conduct. It will be only a charity to her.’
6208: 
6209: ‘Nay, dear, that will be doing nothing but harm. Caterina’s temper is
6210: peculiar. The best thing you can do will be to leave her to herself as
6211: much as possible. It will all wear off. I’ve no doubt she’ll be married
6212: to Gilfil before long. Girls’ fancies are easily diverted from one object
6213: to another. By jove, what a rate my heart is galloping at! These
6214: confounded palpitations get worse instead of better.’
6215: 
6216: Thus ended the conversation, so far as it concerned Caterina, not without
6217: leaving a distinct resolution in Captain Wybrow’s mind--a resolution
6218: carried into effect the next day, when he was in the library with Sir
6219: Christopher for the purpose of discussing some arrangements about the
6220: approaching marriage.
6221: 
6222: ‘By the by,’ he said carelessly, when the business came to a pause, and
6223: he was sauntering round the room with his hands in his coat-pockets,
6224: surveying the backs of the books that lined the walls, ‘when is the
6225: wedding between Gilfil and Caterina to come off, sir? I’ve a
6226: fellow-feeling for a poor devil so many fathoms deep in love as Maynard.
6227: Why shouldn’t their marriage happen as soon as ours? I suppose he has
6228: come to an understanding with Tina?’
6229: 
6230: ‘Why,’ said Sir Christopher, ‘I did think of letting the thing be until
6231: old Crichley died; he can’t hold out very long, poor fellow; and then
6232: Maynard might have entered into matrimony and the rectory both at once.
6233: But, after all, that really is no good reason for waiting. There is no
6234: need for them to leave the Manor when they are married. The little monkey
6235: is quite old enough. It would be pretty to see her a matron, with a baby
6236: about the size of a kitten in her arms.’
6237: 
6238: ‘I think that system of waiting is always bad. And if I can further any
6239: settlement you would like to make on Caterina, I shall be delighted to
6240: carry out your wishes.’
6241: 
6242: ‘My dear boy, that’s very good of you; but Maynard will have enough; and
6243: from what I know of him--and I know him well--I think he would rather
6244: provide for Caterina himself. However, now you have put this matter into
6245: my head, I begin to blame myself for not having thought of it before.
6246: I’ve been so wrapt up in Beatrice and you, you rascal, that I had really
6247: forgotten poor Maynard. And he’s older than you--it’s high time he was
6248: settled in life as a family man.’
6249: 
6250: Sir Christopher paused, took snuff in a meditative manner, and presently
6251: said, more to himself than to Anthony, who was humming a tune at the far
6252: end of the room, ‘Yes, yes. It will be a capital plan to finish off all
6253: our family business at once.’
6254: 
6255: Riding out with Miss Assher the same morning, Captain Wybrow mentioned to
6256: her incidentally, that Sir Christopher was anxious to bring about the
6257: wedding between Gilfil and Caterina as soon as possible, and that he, for
6258: his part, should do all he could to further the affair. It would be the
6259: best thing in the world for Tina, in whose welfare he was really
6260: interested.
6261: 
6262: With Sir Christopher there was never any long interval between purpose
6263: and execution. He made up his mind promptly, and he acted promptly. On
6264: rising from luncheon, he said to Mr. Gilfil, ‘Come with me into the
6265: library, Maynard. I want to have a word with you.’
6266: 
6267: ‘Maynard, my boy,’ he began, as soon as they were seated, tapping his
6268: snuff-box, and looking radiant at the idea of the unexpected pleasure he
6269: was about to give, ‘why shouldn’t we have two happy couples instead of
6270: one, before the autumn is over, eh?’
6271: 
6272: ‘Eh?’ he repeated, after a moment’s pause, lengthening out the
6273: monosyllable, taking a slow pinch, and looking up at Maynard with a sly
6274: smile.
6275: 
6276: ‘I’m not quite sure that I understand you, sir,’ answered Mr. Gilfil, who
6277: felt annoyed at the consciousness that he was turning pale.
6278: 
6279: ‘Not understand me, you rogue? You know very well whose happiness lies
6280: nearest to my heart after Anthony’s. You know you let me into your
6281: secrets long ago, so there’s no confession to make. Tina’s quite old
6282: enough to be a grave little wife now; and though the Rectory’s not ready
6283: for you, that’s no matter. My lady and I shall feel all the more
6284: comfortable for having you with us. We should miss our little
6285: singing-bird if we lost her all at once.’
6286: 
6287: Mr. Gilfil felt himself in a painfully difficult position. He dreaded
6288: that Sir Christopher should surmise or discover the true state of
6289: Caterina’s feelings, and yet he was obliged to make those feelings the
6290: ground of his reply.
6291: 
6292: ‘My dear sir,’ he at last said with some effort, ‘you will not suppose
6293: that I am not alive to your goodness--that I am not grateful for your
6294: fatherly interest in my happiness; but I fear that Caterina’s feelings
6295: towards me are not such as to warrant the hope that she would accept a
6296: proposal of marriage from me.’
6297: 
6298: ‘Have you ever asked her?’
6299: 
6300: ‘No, sir. But we often know these things too well without asking.’
6301: 
6302: ‘Pooh, pooh! the little monkey _must_ love you. Why, you were her first
6303: playfellow; and I remember she used to cry if you cut your finger.
6304: Besides, she has always silently admitted that you were her lover. You
6305: know I have always spoken of you to her in that light. I took it for
6306: granted you had settled the business between yourselves; so did Anthony.
6307: Anthony thinks she’s in love with you, and he has young eyes, which are
6308: apt enough to see clearly in these matters. He was talking to me about it
6309: this morning, and pleased me very much by the friendly interest he showed
6310: in you and Tina.’
6311: 
6312: The blood--more than was wanted--rushed back to Mr. Gilfil’s face; he set
6313: his teeth and clenched his hands in the effort to repress a burst of
6314: indignation. Sir Christopher noticed the flush, but thought it indicated
6315: the fluctuation of hope and fear about Caterina. He went on:--‘You’re too
6316: modest by half, Maynard. A fellow who can take a five-barred gate as you
6317: can, ought not to be so faint-hearted. If you can’t speak to her
6318: yourself, leave me to talk to her.’
6319: 
6320: ‘Sir Christopher,’ said poor Maynard earnestly, ‘I shall really feel it
6321: the greatest kindness you can possibly show me not to mention this
6322: subject to Caterina at present. I think such a proposal, made
6323: prematurely, might only alienate her from me.’
6324: 
6325: Sir Christopher was getting a little displeased at this contradiction.
6326: His tone became a little sharper as he said, ‘Have you any grounds to
6327: state for this opinion, beyond your general notion that Tina is not
6328: enough in love with you?’
6329: 
6330: ‘I can state none beyond my own very strong impression that she does not
6331: love me well enough to marry me.’
6332: 
6333: ‘Then I think that ground is worth nothing at all. I am tolerably correct
6334: in my judgement of people; and if I am not very much deceived in Tina,
6335: she looks forward to nothing else but to your being her husband. Leave me
6336: to manage the matter as I think best. You may rely on me that I shall do
6337: no harm to your cause, Maynard.’
6338: 
6339: Mr. Gilfil, afraid to say more, yet wretched in the prospect of what
6340: might result from Sir Christopher’s determination, quitted the library in
6341: a state of mingled indignation against Captain Wybrow, and distress for
6342: himself and Caterina. What would she think of him? She might suppose that
6343: _he_ had instigated or sanctioned Sir Christopher’s proceeding. He should
6344: perhaps not have an opportunity of speaking to her on the subject in
6345: time; he would write her a note, and carry it up to her room after the
6346: dressing-bell had rung. No; that would agitate her, and unfit her for
6347: appearing at dinner, and passing the evening calmly. He would defer it
6348: till bed-time. After prayers, he contrived to lead her back to the
6349: drawing-room, and to put a letter in her hand. She carried it up to her
6350: own room, wondering, and there read--
6351: 
6352: ‘DEAR CATERINA,--Do not suspect for a moment that anything Sir Christopher
6353: may say to you about our marriage has been prompted by me. I have done
6354: all I dare do to dissuade him from urging the subject, and have only been
6355: prevented from speaking more strongly by the dread of provoking questions
6356: which I could not answer without causing you fresh misery. I write this,
6357: both to prepare you for anything Sir Christopher may say, and to assure
6358: you--but I hope you already believe it--that your feelings are sacred to
6359: me. I would rather part with the dearest hope of my life than be the
6360: means of adding to your trouble.
6361: 
6362: ‘It is Captain Wybrow who has prompted Sir Christopher to take up the
6363: subject at this moment. I tell you this, to save you from hearing it
6364: suddenly when you are with Sir Christopher. You see now what sort of
6365: stuff that dastard’s heart is made of. Trust in me always, dearest
6366: Caterina, as--whatever may come--your faithful friend and brother,
6367: 
6368: ‘MAYNARD GILFIL.’
6369: 
6370: Caterina was at first too terribly stung by the words about Captain
6371: Wybrow to think of the difficulty which threatened her--to think either
6372: of what Sir Christopher would say to her, or of what she could say in
6373: reply. Bitter sense of injury, fierce resentment, left no room for fear.
6374: With the poisoned garment upon him, the victim writhes under the
6375: torture--he has no thought of the coming death.
6376: 
6377: Anthony could do this!--Of this there could be no explanation but the
6378: coolest contempt for her feelings, the basest sacrifice of all the
6379: consideration and tenderness he owed her to the ease of his position with
6380: Miss Assher. No. It was worse than that: it was deliberate, gratuitous
6381: cruelty. He wanted to show her how he despised her; he wanted to make her
6382: feel her folly in having ever believed that he loved her.
6383: 
6384: The last crystal drops of trust and tenderness, she thought, were dried
6385: up; all was parched, fiery hatred. Now she need no longer check her
6386: resentment by the fear of doing him an injustice: he _had_ trifled with
6387: her, as Maynard had said; he _had_ been reckless of her; and now he was
6388: base and cruel. She had cause enough for her bitterness and anger; they
6389: were not so wicked as they had seemed to her.
6390: 
6391: As these thoughts were hurrying after each other like so many sharp
6392: throbs of fevered pain, she shed no tear. She paced restlessly to and
6393: fro, as her habit was--her hands clenched, her eyes gleaming fiercely and
6394: wandering uneasily, as if in search of something on which she might throw
6395: herself like a tigress.
6396: 
6397: ‘If I could speak to him,’ she whispered, ‘and tell him I hate him, I
6398: despise him, I loathe him!’
6399: 
6400: Suddenly, as if a new thought had struck her, she drew a key from her
6401: pocket, and, unlocking an inlaid desk where she stored up her keepsakes,
6402: took from it a small miniature. It was in a very slight gold frame, with
6403: a ring to it, as if intended to be worn on a chain; and under the glass
6404: at the back were two locks of hair, one dark and the other auburn,
6405: arranged in a fantastic knot. It was Anthony’s secret present to her a
6406: year ago--a copy he had had made specially for her. For the last month she
6407: had not taken it from its hiding-place: there was no need to heighten the
6408: vividness of the past. But now she clutched it fiercely, and dashed it
6409: across the room against the bare hearth-stone.
6410: 
6411: Will she crush it under her feet, and grind it under her high-heeled
6412: shoe, till every trace of those false cruel features is gone? Ah, no! She
6413: rushed across the room; but when she saw the little treasure she had
6414: cherished so fondly, so often smothered with kisses, so often laid under
6415: her pillow, and remembered with the first return of consciousness in the
6416: morning--when she saw this one visible relic of the too happy past lying
6417: with the glass shivered, the hair fallen out, the thin ivory cracked,
6418: there was a revulsion of the overstrained feeling: relenting came, and
6419: she burst into tears.
6420: 
6421: Look at her stooping down to gather up her treasure, searching for the
6422: hair and replacing it, and then mournfully examining the crack that
6423: disfigures the once-loved image. Alas! there is no glass now to guard
6424: either the hair or the portrait; but see how carefully she wraps delicate
6425: paper round it, and locks it up again in its old place. Poor child! God
6426: send the relenting may always come before the worst irrevocable deed!
6427: 
6428: This action had quieted her, and she sat down to read Maynard’s letter
6429: again. She read it two or three times without seeming to take in the
6430: sense; her apprehension was dulled by the passion of the last hour, and
6431: she found it difficult to call up the ideas suggested by the words. At
6432: last she began to have a distinct conception of the impending interview
6433: with Sir Christopher. The idea of displeasing the Baronet, of whom every
6434: one at the Manor stood in awe, frightened her so much that she thought it
6435: would be impossible to resist his wish. He believed that she loved
6436: Maynard; he had always spoken as if he were quite sure of it. How could
6437: she tell him he was deceived--and what if he were to ask her whether she
6438: loved anybody else? To have Sir Christopher looking angrily at her, was
6439: more than she could bear, even in imagination. He had always been so good
6440: to her! Then she began to think of the pain she might give him, and the
6441: more selfish distress of fear gave way to the distress of affection.
6442: Unselfish tears began to flow, and sorrowful gratitude to Sir Christopher
6443: helped to awaken her sensibility to Mr. Gilfil’s tenderness and
6444: generosity.
6445: 
6446: ‘Dear, good Maynard!--what a poor return I make him! If I could but have
6447: loved him instead--but I can never love or care for anything again. My
6448: heart is broken.’
6449: 
6450: 
6451: 
6452: 
6453: Chapter 13
6454: 
6455: 
6456: The next morning the dreaded moment came. Caterina, stupified by the
6457: suffering of the previous night, with that dull mental aching which
6458: follows on acute anguish, was in Lady Cheverel’s sitting-room, copying
6459: out some charity lists, when her ladyship came in, and said,--‘Tina, Sir
6460: Christopher wants you; go down into the library.’
6461: 
6462: She went down trembling. As soon as she entered, Sir Christopher, who was
6463: seated near his writing-table, said, ‘Now, little monkey, come and sit
6464: down by me; I have something to tell you.’
6465: 
6466: Caterina took a footstool, and seated herself on it at the Baronet’s
6467: feet. It was her habit to sit on these low stools, and in this way she
6468: could hide her face better. She put her little arm round his leg, and
6469: leaned her cheek against his knee.
6470: 
6471: ‘Why, you seem out of spirits this morning, Tina. What’s the matter, eh?’
6472: 
6473: ‘Nothing, Padroncello; only my head is bad.’
6474: 
6475: ‘Poor monkey! Well, now, wouldn’t it do the head good if I were to
6476: promise you a good husband, and smart little wedding-gowns, and by-and-by
6477: a house of your own, where you would be a little mistress, and
6478: Padroncello would come and see you sometimes?’
6479: 
6480: ‘O no, no! I shouldn’t like ever to be married. Let me always stay with
6481: you!’
6482: 
6483: ‘Pooh, pooh, little simpleton. I shall get old and tiresome, and there
6484: will be Anthony’s children putting your nose out of joint. You will want
6485: some one to love you best of all, and you must have children of your own
6486: to love. I can’t have you withering away into an old maid. I hate old
6487: maids: they make me dismal to look at them. I never see Sharp without
6488: shuddering. My little black-eyed monkey was never meant for anything so
6489: ugly. And there’s Maynard Gilfil the best man in the county, worth his
6490: weight in gold, heavy as he is; he loves you better than his eyes. And
6491: you love him too, you silly monkey, whatever you may say about not being
6492: married.’
6493: 
6494: ‘No, no, dear Padroncello, do not say so; I could not marry him.’
6495: 
6496: ‘Why not, you foolish child? You don’t know your own mind. Why, it is
6497: plain to everybody that you love him. My lady has all along said she was
6498: sure you loved him--she has seen what little princess airs you put on to
6499: him; and Anthony too, he thinks you are in love with Gilfil. Come, what
6500: has made you take it into your head that you wouldn’t like to marry him?’
6501: 
6502: Caterina was now sobbing too deeply to make any answer. Sir Christopher
6503: patted her on the back and said, ‘Come, come; why, Tina, you are not well
6504: this morning. Go and rest, little one. You will see things in quite
6505: another light when you are well. Think over what I have said, and
6506: remember there is nothing, after Anthony’s marriage, that I have set my
6507: heart on so much as seeing you and Maynard settled for life. I must have
6508: no whims and follies--no nonsense.’ This was said with a slight severity;
6509: but he presently added, in a soothing tone, ‘There, there, stop crying,
6510: and be a good little monkey. Go and lie down and get to sleep.’
6511: 
6512: Caterina slipped from the stool on to her knees, took the old Baronet’s
6513: hand, covered it with tears and kisses, and then ran out of the room.
6514: 
6515: Before the evening, Captain Wybrow had heard from his uncle the result of
6516: the interview with Caterina. He thought, ‘If I could have a long quiet
6517: talk with her, I could perhaps persuade her to look more reasonably at
6518: things. But there’s no speaking to her in the house without being
6519: interrupted, and I can hardly see her anywhere else without Beatrice’s
6520: finding it out.’ At last he determined to make it a matter of confidence
6521: with Miss Assher--to tell her that he wished to talk to Caterina quietly
6522: for the sake of bringing her to a calmer state of mind, and persuade her
6523: to listen to Gilfil’s affection. He was very much pleased with this
6524: judicious and candid plan, and in the course of the evening he had
6525: arranged with himself the time and place of meeting, and had communicated
6526: his purpose to Miss Assher, who gave her entire approval. Anthony, she
6527: thought, would do well to speak plainly and seriously to Miss Sarti. He
6528: was really very patient and kind to her, considering how she behaved.
6529: 
6530: Tina had kept her room all that day, and had been carefully tended as an
6531: invalid, Sir Christopher having told her ladyship how matters stood. This
6532: tendance was so irksome to Caterina, she felt so uneasy under attentions
6533: and kindness that were based on a misconception, that she exerted herself
6534: to appear at breakfast the next morning, and declared herself well,
6535: though head and heart were throbbing. To be confined in her own room was
6536: intolerable; it was wretched enough to be looked at and spoken to, but it
6537: was more wretched to be left alone. She was frightened at her own
6538: sensations: she was frightened at the imperious vividness with which
6539: pictures of the past and future thrust themselves on her imagination. And
6540: there was another feeling, too, which made her want to be down-stairs and
6541: moving about. Perhaps she might have an opportunity of speaking to
6542: Captain Wybrow alone--of speaking those words of hatred and scorn that
6543: burned on her tongue. That opportunity offered itself in a very
6544: unexpected manner.
6545: 
6546: Lady Cheverel having sent Caterina out of the drawing-room to fetch some
6547: patterns of embroidery from her sitting-room, Captain Wybrow presently
6548: walked out after her, and met her as she was returning down-stairs.
6549: 
6550: ‘Caterina,’ he said, laying his hand on her arm as she was hurrying on
6551: without looking at him, ‘will you meet me in the Rookery at twelve
6552: o’clock? I must speak to you, and we shall be in privacy there. I cannot
6553: speak to you in the house.’
6554: 
6555: To his surprise, there was a flash of pleasure across her face; she
6556: answered shortly and decidedly, ‘Yes’, then snatched her arm away from
6557: him, and passed down-stairs.
6558: 
6559: Miss Assher was this morning busy winding silks, being bent on emulating
6560: Lady Cheverel’s embroidery, and Lady Assher chose the passive amusement
6561: of holding the skeins. Lady Cheverel had now all her working apparatus
6562: about her, and Caterina, thinking she was not wanted, went away and sat
6563: down to the harpsichord in the sitting-room. It seemed as if playing
6564: massive chords--bringing out volumes of sound, would be the easiest way
6565: of passing the long feverish moments before twelve o’clock. Handel’s
6566: Messiah stood open on the desk, at the chorus ‘All we like sheep’, and
6567: Caterina threw herself at once into the impetuous intricacies of that
6568: magnificent fugue. In her happiest moments she could never have played it
6569: so well: for now all the passion that made her misery was hurled by a
6570: convulsive effort into her music, just as pain gives new force to the
6571: clutch of the sinking wrestler, and as terror gives farsounding intensity
6572: to the shriek of the feeble.
6573: 
6574: But at half-past eleven she was interrupted by Lady Cheverel, who said,
6575: ‘Tina, go down, will you, and hold Miss Assher’s silks for her. Lady
6576: Assher and I have decided on having our drive before luncheon.’
6577: 
6578: Caterina went down, wondering how she should escape from the drawing-room
6579: in time to be in the Rookery at twelve. Nothing should prevent her from
6580: going; nothing should rob her of this one precious moment--perhaps the
6581: last--when she could speak out the thoughts that were in her. After that,
6582: she would be passive; she would bear anything.
6583: 
6584: But she had scarcely sat down with a skein of yellow silk on her hands,
6585: when Miss Assher said, graciously,--‘I know you have an engagement with
6586: Captain Wybrow this morning. You must not let me detain you beyond the
6587: time.’
6588: 
6589: ‘So he has been talking to her about me,’ thought Caterina. Her hands
6590: began to tremble as she held the skein.
6591: 
6592: Miss Assher continued in the same gracious tone: ‘It is tedious work
6593: holding these skeins. I am sure I am very much obliged to you.’
6594: 
6595: ‘No, you are not obliged to me,’ said Caterina, completely mastered by
6596: her irritation; ‘I have only done it because Lady Cheverel told me.’
6597: 
6598: The moment was come when Miss Assher could no longer suppress her long
6599: latent desire to ‘let Miss Sarti know the impropriety of her conduct.’
6600: With the malicious anger that assumes the tone of compassion, she
6601: said,--‘Miss Sarti, I am really sorry for you, that you are not able to
6602: control yourself better. This giving way to unwarrantable feelings is
6603: lowering you--it is indeed.’
6604: 
6605: ‘What unwarrantable feelings?’ said Caterina, letting her hands fall, and
6606: fixing her great dark eyes steadily on Miss Assher.
6607: 
6608: ‘It is quite unnecessary for me to say more. You must be conscious
6609: what I mean. Only summon a sense of duty to your aid. You are paining
6610: Captain Wybrow extremely by your want of self-control.’
6611: 
6612: ‘Did he tell you I pained him?’
6613: 
6614: ‘Yes, indeed, he did. He is very much hurt that you should behave to me
6615: as if you had a sort of enmity towards me. He would like you to make a
6616: friend of me. I assure you we both feel very kindly towards you, and are
6617: sorry you should cherish such feelings.’
6618: 
6619: ‘He is very good,’ said Caterina, bitterly. ‘What feelings did he say I
6620: cherished?’
6621: 
6622: This bitter tone increased Miss Assher’s irritation. There was still a
6623: lurking suspicion in her mind, though she would not admit it to herself,
6624: that Captain Wybrow had told her a falsehood about his conduct and
6625: feelings towards Caterina. It was this suspicion, more even than the
6626: anger of the moment, which urged her to say something that would test the
6627: truth of his statement. That she would be humiliating Caterina at the
6628: same time, was only an additional temptation.
6629: 
6630: ‘These are things I do not like to talk of, Miss Sarti. I cannot even
6631: understand how a woman can indulge a passion for a man who has never
6632: given her the least ground for it, as Captain Wybrow assures me is the
6633: case.’
6634: 
6635: ‘He told you that, did he?’ said Caterina, in clear low tones, her lips
6636: turning white as she rose from her chair.
6637: 
6638: ‘Yes, indeed, he did. He was bound to tell it me after your strange
6639: behaviour.’
6640: 
6641: Caterina said nothing, but turned round suddenly and left the room.
6642: 
6643: See how she rushes noiselessly, like a pale meteor, along the passages
6644: and up the gallery stairs! Those gleaming eyes, those bloodless lips,
6645: that swift silent tread, make her look like the incarnation of a fierce
6646: purpose, rather than a woman. The mid-day sun is shining on the armour in
6647: the gallery, making mimic suns on bossed sword-hilts and the angles of
6648: polished breast-plates. Yes, there are sharp weapons in the gallery.
6649: There is a dagger in that cabinet; she knows it well. And as a dragon-fly
6650: wheels in its flight to alight for an instant on a leaf, she darts to the
6651: cabinet, takes out the dagger, and thrusts it into her pocket. In three
6652: minutes more she is out, in hat and cloak, on the gravel-walk, hurrying
6653: along towards the thick shades of the distant Rookery. She threads the
6654: windings of the plantations, not feeling the golden leaves that rain upon
6655: her, not feeling the earth beneath her feet. Her hand is in her pocket,
6656: clenching the handle of the dagger, which she holds half out of its
6657: sheath.
6658: 
6659: She has reached the Rookery, and is under the gloom of the interlacing
6660: boughs. Her heart throbs as if it would burst her bosom--as if every next
6661: leap must be its last. Wait, wait, O heart!--till she has done this one
6662: deed. He will be there--he will be before her in a moment. He will come
6663: towards her with that false smile, thinking she does not know his
6664: baseness--she will plunge that dagger into his heart.
6665: 
6666: Poor child! poor child! she who used to cry to have the fish put back
6667: into the water--who never willingly killed the smallest living
6668: thing--dreams now, in the madness of her passion, that she can kill the
6669: man whose very voice unnerves her.
6670: 
6671: But what is that lying among the dank leaves on the path three yards
6672: before her?
6673: 
6674: Good God! it is he--lying motionless--his hat fallen off. He is ill,
6675: then--he has fainted. Her hand lets go the dagger, and she rushes towards
6676: him. His eyes are fixed; he does not see her. She sinks down on her
6677: knees, takes the dear head in her arms, and kisses the cold forehead.
6678: 
6679: ‘Anthony, Anthony! speak to me--it is Tina--speak to me! O God, he is
6680: dead!’
6681: 
6682:

6684: 
6685: Chapter 14
6686: 
6687: 
6688: ‘Yes, Maynard,’ said Sir Christopher, chatting with Mr. Gilfil in the
6689: library, ‘it really is a remarkable thing that I never in my life laid a
6690: plan, and failed to carry it out. I lay my plans well, and I never swerve
6691: from them--that’s it. A strong will is the only magic. And next to
6692: striking out one’s plans, the pleasantest thing in the world is to see
6693: them well accomplished. This year, now, will be the happiest of my life,
6694: all but the year ’53, when I came into possession of the Manor, and
6695: married Henrietta. The last touch is given to the old house; Anthony’s
6696: marriage--the thing I had nearest my heart--is settled to my entire
6697: satisfaction; and by-and-by you will be buying a little wedding-ring for
6698: Tina’s finger. Don’t shake your head in that forlorn way;--when I make
6699: prophecies they generally come to pass. But there’s a quarter after
6700: twelve striking. I must be riding to the High Ash to meet Markham about
6701: felling some timber. My old oaks will have to groan for this wedding,
6702: but’--
6703: 
6704: The door burst open, and Caterina, ghastly and panting, her eyes
6705: distended with terror, rushed in, threw her arms round Sir Christopher’s
6706: neck, and gasping out--‘Anthony ... the Rookery ... dead ... in the
6707: Rookery’, fell fainting on the floor.
6708: 
6709: In a moment Sir Christopher was out of the room, and Mr. Gilfil was
6710: bending to raise Caterina in his arms. As he lifted her from the ground
6711: he felt something hard and heavy in her pocket. What could it be? The
6712: weight of it would be enough to hurt her as she lay. He carried her to
6713: the sofa, put his hand in her pocket, and drew forth the dagger.
6714: 
6715: Maynard shuddered. Did she mean to kill herself, then, or ... or ... a
6716: horrible suspicion forced itself upon him. ‘Dead--in the Rookery.’ He
6717: hated himself for the thought that prompted him to draw the dagger from
6718: its sheath. No! there was no trace of blood, and he was ready to kiss the
6719: good steel for its innocence. He thrust the weapon into his own pocket;
6720: he would restore it as soon as possible to its well-known place in the
6721: gallery. Yet, why had Caterina taken this dagger? What was it that had
6722: happened in the Rookery? Was it only a delirious vision of hers?
6723: 
6724: He was afraid to ring--afraid to summon any one to Caterina’s assistance.
6725: What might she not say when she awoke from this fainting fit? She might
6726: be raving. He could not leave her, and yet he felt as if he were guilty
6727: for not following Sir Christopher to see what was the truth. It took but
6728: a moment to think and feel all this, but that moment seemed such a long
6729: agony to him that he began to reproach himself for letting it pass
6730: without seeking some means of reviving Caterina. Happily the decanter of
6731: water on Sir Christopher’s table was untouched. He would at least try the
6732: effect of throwing that water over her. She might revive without his
6733: needing to call any one else. Meanwhile Sir Christopher was hurrying at
6734: his utmost speed towards the Rookery; his face, so lately bright and
6735: confident, now agitated by a vague dread. The deep alarmed bark of
6736: Rupert, who ran by his side, had struck the ear of Mr. Bates, then on his
6737: way homeward, as something unwonted, and, hastening in the direction of
6738: the sound, he met the Baronet just as he was approaching the entrance of
6739: the Rookery. Sir Christopher’s look was enough. Mr. Bates said nothing,
6740: but hurried along by his side, while Rupert dashed forward among the dead
6741: leaves with his nose to the ground. They had scarcely lost sight of him a
6742: minute when a change in the tone of his bark told them that he had found
6743: something, and in another instant he was leaping back over one of the
6744: large planted mounds. They turned aside to ascend the mound, Rupert
6745: leading them; the tumultuous cawing of the rooks, the very rustling of
6746: the leaves, as their feet plunged among them, falling like an evil omen
6747: on the Baronet’s ear.
6748: 
6749: They had reached the summit of the mound, and had begun to descend. Sir
6750: Christopher saw something purple down on the path below among the yellow
6751: leaves. Rupert was already beside it, but Sir Christopher could not move
6752: faster. A tremor had taken hold of the firm limbs. Rupert came back and
6753: licked the trembling hand, as if to say ‘Courage!’ and then was down
6754: again snuffing the body. Yes, it was a body ... Anthony’s body. There was
6755: the white hand with its diamond-ring clutching the dark leaves. His eyes
6756: were half open, but did not heed the gleam of sunlight that darted itself
6757: directly on them from between the boughs.
6758: 
6759: Still he might only have fainted; it might only be a fit. Sir Christopher
6760: knelt down, unfastened the cravat, unfastened the waistcoat, and laid his
6761: hand on the heart. It might be syncope; it might not--it could not be
6762: death. No! that thought must be kept far off.
6763: 
6764: ‘Go, Bates, get help; we’ll carry him to your cottage. Send some one to
6765: the house to tell Mr. Gilfil and Warren. Bid them send off for Doctor
6766: Hart, and break it to my lady and Miss Assher that Anthony is ill.’
6767: 
6768: Mr. Bates hastened away, and the Baronet was left alone kneeling beside
6769: the body. The young and supple limbs, the rounded cheeks, the delicate
6770: ripe lips, the smooth white hands, were lying cold and rigid; and the
6771: aged face was bending over them in silent anguish; the aged deep-veined
6772: hands were seeking with tremulous inquiring touches for some symptom that
6773: life was not irrevocably gone.
6774: 
6775: Rupert was there too, waiting and watching; licking first the dead and
6776: then the living hands; then running off on Mr. Bates’s track as if he
6777: would follow and hasten his return, but in a moment turning back again,
6778: unable to quit the scene of his master’s sorrow.
6779: 
6780: 
6781: 
6782: 
6783: Chapter 15
6784: 
6785: 
6786: It is a wonderful moment, the first time we stand by one who has fainted,
6787: and witness the fresh birth of consciousness spreading itself over the
6788: blank features, like the rising sunlight on the alpine summits that lay
6789: ghastly and dead under the leaden twilight. A slight shudder, and the
6790: frost-bound eyes recover their liquid light; for an instant they show the
6791: inward semi-consciousness of an infant’s; then, with a little start, they
6792: open wider and begin to look; the present is visible, but only as a
6793: strange writing, and the interpreter Memory is not yet there.
6794: 
6795: Mr. Gilfil felt a trembling joy as this change passed over Caterina’s
6796: face. He bent over her, rubbing her chill hands, and looking at her with
6797: tender pity as her dark eyes opened on him wonderingly. He thought there
6798: might be some wine in the dining-room close by. He left the room, and
6799: Caterina’s eyes turned towards the window--towards Sir Christopher’s
6800: chair. There was the link at which the chain of consciousness had
6801: snapped, and the events of the morning were beginning to recur dimly like
6802: a half-remembered dream, when Maynard returned with some wine. He raised
6803: her, and she drank it; but still she was silent, seeming lost in the
6804: attempt to recover the past, when the door opened, and Mr. Warren
6805: appeared with looks that announced terrible tidings. Mr. Gilfil, dreading
6806: lest he should tell them in Caterina’s presence, hurried towards him with
6807: his finger on his lips, and drew him away into the dining-room on the
6808: opposite side of the passage.
6809: 
6810: Caterina, revived by the stimulant, was now recovering the full
6811: consciousness of the scene in the Rookery. Anthony was lying there dead;
6812: she had left him to tell Sir Christopher; she must go and see what they
6813: were doing with him; perhaps he was not really dead--only in a trance;
6814: people did fall into trances sometimes. While Mr. Gilfil was telling
6815: Warren how it would be best to break the news to Lady Cheverel and Miss
6816: Assher, anxious himself to return to Caterina, the poor child had made
6817: her way feebly to the great entrance-door, which stood open. Her strength
6818: increased as she moved and breathed the fresh air, and with every
6819: increase of strength came increased vividness of emotion, increased
6820: yearning to be where her thought was--in the Rookery with Anthony. She
6821: walked more and more swiftly, and at last, gathering the artificial
6822: strength of passionate excitement, began to run.
6823: 
6824: But now she heard the tread of heavy steps, and under the yellow shade
6825: near the wooden bridge she saw men slowly carrying something. Soon she
6826: was face to face with them. Anthony was no longer in the Rookery: they
6827: were carrying him stretched on a door, and there behind him was Sir
6828: Christopher, with the firmly-set mouth, the deathly paleness, and the
6829: concentrated expression of suffering in the eye, which mark the
6830: suppressed grief of the strong man. The sight of this face, on which
6831: Caterina had never before beheld the signs of anguish, caused a rush of
6832: new feeling which for the moment submerged all the rest. She went gently
6833: up to him, put her little hand in his, and walked in silence by his side.
6834: Sir Christopher could not tell her to leave him, and so she went on with
6835: that sad procession to Mr. Bates’s cottage in the Mosslands, and sat
6836: there in silence, waiting and watching to know if Anthony were really
6837: dead. She had not yet missed the dagger from her pocket; she had not yet
6838: even thought of it. At the sight of Anthony lying dead, her nature had
6839: rebounded from its new bias of resentment and hatred to the old sweet
6840: habit of love. The earliest and the longest has still the mastery over
6841: us; and the only past that linked itself with those glazed unconscious
6842: eyes, was the past when they beamed on her with tenderness. She forgot
6843: the interval of wrong and jealousy and hatred--all his cruelty, and all
6844: her thoughts of revenge--as the exile forgets the stormy passage that lay
6845: between home and happiness and the dreary land in which he finds himself
6846: desolate.
6847: 
6848: 
6849: 
6850: 
6851: Chapter 16
6852: 
6853: 
6854: Before night all hope was gone. Dr Hart had said it was death; Anthony’s
6855: body had been carried to the house, and every one there knew the calamity
6856: that had fallen on them.
6857: 
6858: Caterina had been questioned by Dr Hart, and had answered briefly that
6859: she found Anthony lying in the Rookery. That she should have been walking
6860: there just at that time was not a coincidence to raise conjectures in any
6861: one besides Mr. Gilfil. Except in answering this question, she had not
6862: broken her silence. She sat mute in a corner of the gardener’s kitchen
6863: shaking her head when Maynard entreated her to return with him, and
6864: apparently unable to think of anything but the possibility that Anthony
6865: might revive, until she saw them carrying away the body to the house.
6866: Then she followed by Sir Christopher’s side again, so quietly, that even
6867: Dr Hart did not object to her presence.
6868: 
6869: It was decided to lay the body in the library until after the coroner’s
6870: inquest to-morrow; and when Caterina saw the door finally closed, she
6871: turned up the gallery stairs on her way to her own room, the place where
6872: she felt at home with her sorrows. It was the first time she had been in
6873: the gallery since that terrible moment in the morning, and now the spot
6874: and the objects around began to reawaken her half-stunned memory. The
6875: armour was no longer glittering in the sunlight, but there it hung dead
6876: and sombre above the cabinet from which she had taken the dagger. Yes!
6877: now it all came back to her--all the wretchedness and all the sin. But
6878: where was the dagger now? She felt in her pocket; it was not there. Could
6879: it have been her fancy--all that about the dagger? She looked in the
6880: cabinet; it was not there. Alas! no; it could not have been her fancy,
6881: and she _was_ guilty of that wickedness. But where could the dagger be
6882: now? Could it have fallen out of her pocket? She heard steps ascending
6883: the stairs, and hurried on to her room, where, kneeling by the bed, and
6884: burying her face to shut out the hateful light, she tried to recall every
6885: feeling and incident of the morning.
6886: 
6887: It all came back; everything Anthony had done, and everything she had
6888: felt for the last month--for many months--ever since that June evening
6889: when he had last spoken to her in the gallery. She looked back on her
6890: storms of passion, her jealousy and hatred of Miss Assher, her thoughts
6891: of revenge on Anthony. O how wicked she had been! It was she who had been
6892: sinning; it was she who had driven him to do and say those things that
6893: had made her so angry. And if he had wronged her, what had she been on
6894: the verge of doing to him? She was too wicked ever to be pardoned. She
6895: would like to confess how wicked she had been, that they might punish
6896: her; she would like to humble herself to the dust before every
6897: one--before Miss Assher even. Sir Christopher would send her away--would
6898: never see her again, if he knew all; and she would be happier to be
6899: punished and frowned on, than to be treated tenderly while she had that
6900: guilty secret in her breast. But then, if Sir Christopher were to know
6901: all, it would add to his sorrow, and make him more wretched than ever.
6902: No! she could not confess it--she should have to tell about Anthony. But
6903: she could not stay at the Manor; she must go away; she could not bear Sir
6904: Christopher’s eye, could not bear the sight of all these things that
6905: reminded her of Anthony and of her sin. Perhaps she should die soon: she
6906: felt very feeble; there could not be much life in her. She would go away
6907: and live humbly, and pray to God to pardon her, and let her die.
6908: 
6909: The poor child never thought of suicide. No sooner was the storm of anger
6910: passed than the tenderness and timidity of her nature returned, and she
6911: could do nothing but love and mourn. Her inexperience prevented her from
6912: imagining the consequences of her disappearance from the Manor; she
6913: foresaw none of the terrible details of alarm and distress and search
6914: that must ensue. ‘They will think I am dead,’ she said to herself, ‘and
6915: by-and-by they will forget me, and Maynard will get happy again, and love
6916: some one else.’
6917: 
6918: She was roused from her absorption by a knock at the door. Mrs. Bellamy
6919: was there. She had come by Mr. Gilfil’s request to see how Miss Sarti
6920: was, and to bring her some food and wine.
6921: 
6922: ‘You look sadly, my dear,’ said the old housekeeper, ‘an’ you’re all of a
6923: quake wi’ cold. Get you to bed, now do. Martha shall come an’ warm it,
6924: an’ light your fire. See now, here’s some nice arrowroot, wi’ a drop o’
6925: wine in it. Take that, an’ it’ll warm you. I must go down again, for I
6926: can’t awhile to stay. There’s so many things to see to; an’ Miss Assher’s
6927: in hysterics constant, an’ her maid’s ill i’ bed--a poor creachy
6928: thing--an’ Mrs. Sharp’s wanted every minute. But I’ll send Martha up, an’
6929: do you get ready to go to bed, there’s a dear child, an’ take care o’
6930: yourself.’
6931: 
6932: ‘Thank you, dear mammy,’ said Tina, kissing the little old woman’s
6933: wrinkled cheek; ‘I shall eat the arrowroot, and don’t trouble about me
6934: any more to-night. I shall do very well when Martha has lighted my fire.
6935: Tell Mr. Gilfil I’m better. I shall go to bed by-and-by, so don’t you
6936: come up again, because you may only disturb me.’
6937: 
6938: ‘Well, well, take care o’ yourself, there’s a good child, an’ God send
6939: you may sleep.’
6940: 
6941: Caterina took the arrowroot quite eagerly, while Martha was lighting her
6942: fire. She wanted to get strength for her journey, and she kept the plate
6943: of biscuits by her that she might put some in her pocket. Her whole mind
6944: was now bent on going away from the Manor, and she was thinking of all
6945: the ways and means her little life’s experience could suggest.
6946: 
6947: It was dusk now; she must wait till early dawn, for she was too timid to
6948: go away in the dark, but she must make her escape before any one was up
6949: in the house. There would be people watching Anthony in the library, but
6950: she could make her way out of a small door leading into the garden,
6951: against the drawing-room on the other side of the house.
6952: 
6953: She laid her cloak, bonnet, and veil ready; then she lighted a candle,
6954: opened her desk, and took out the broken portrait wrapped in paper. She
6955: folded it again in two little notes of Anthony’s, written in pencil, and
6956: placed it in her bosom. There was the little china box, too--Dorcas’s
6957: present, the pearl earrings, and a silk purse, with fifteen
6958: seven-shilling pieces in it, the presents Sir Christopher had made her on
6959: her birthday, ever since she had been at the Manor. Should she take the
6960: earrings and the seven-shilling pieces? She could not bear to part with
6961: them; it seemed as if they had some of Sir Christopher’s love in them.
6962: She would like them to be buried with her. She fastened the little round
6963: earrings in her ears, and put the purse with Dorcas’s box in her pocket.
6964: She had another purse there, and she took it out to count her money, for
6965: she would never spend her seven-shilling pieces. She had a guinea and
6966: eight shillings; that would be plenty.
6967: 
6968: So now she sat down to wait for the morning, afraid to lay herself on the
6969: bed lest she should sleep too long. If she could but see Anthony once
6970: more and kiss his cold forehead! But that could not be. She did not
6971: deserve it. She must go away from him, away from Sir Christopher, and
6972: Lady Cheverel, and Maynard, and everybody who had been kind to her, and
6973: thought her good while she was so wicked.
6974: 
6975: 
6976: 
6977: 
6978: Chapter 17
6979: 
6980: 
6981: Some of Mrs. Sharp’s earliest thoughts, the next morning, were given to
6982: Caterina, whom she had not been able to visit the evening before, and
6983: whom, from a nearly equal mixture of affection and self-importance, she
6984: did not at all like resigning to Mrs. Bellamy’s care. At half-past eight
6985: o’clock she went up to Tina’s room, bent on benevolent dictation as to
6986: doses and diet and lying in bed. But on opening the door she found the
6987: bed smooth and empty. Evidently it had not been slept in. What could this
6988: mean? Had she sat up all night, and was she gone out to walk? The poor
6989: thing’s head might be touched by what had happened yesterday; it was such
6990: a shock--finding Captain Wybrow in that way; she was perhaps gone out of
6991: her mind. Mrs. Sharp looked anxiously in the place where Tina kept her
6992: hat and cloak; they were not there, so that she had had at least the
6993: presence of mind to put them on. Still the good woman felt greatly
6994: alarmed, and hastened away to tell Mr. Gilfil, who, she knew, was in his
6995: study.
6996: 
6997: ‘Mr. Gilfil,’ she said, as soon as she had closed the door behind her,
6998: ‘my mind misgives me dreadful about Miss Sarti.’
6999: 
7000: ‘What is it?’ said poor Maynard, with a horrible fear that Caterina had
7001: betrayed something about the dagger.
7002: 
7003: ‘She’s not in her room, an’ her bed’s not been slept in this night, an’
7004: her hat an’ cloak’s gone.’
7005: 
7006: For a minute or two Mr. Gilfil was unable to speak. He felt sure the
7007: worst had come: Caterina had destroyed herself. The strong man suddenly
7008: looked so ill and helpless that Mrs. Sharp began to be frightened at the
7009: effect of her abruptness.
7010: 
7011: ‘O, sir, I’m grieved to my heart to shock you so; but I didn’t know who
7012: else to go to.’
7013: 
7014: ‘No, no, you were quite right.’
7015: 
7016: He gathered some strength from his very despair. It was all over, and he
7017: had nothing now to do but to suffer and to help the suffering. He went on
7018: in a firmer voice--‘Be sure not to breathe a word about it to any one. We
7019: must not alarm Lady Cheverel and Sir Christopher. Miss Sarti may be only
7020: walking in the garden. She was terribly excited by what she saw
7021: yesterday, and perhaps was unable to lie down from restlessness. Just go
7022: quietly through the empty rooms, and see whether she is in the house. I
7023: will go and look for her in the grounds.’
7024: 
7025: He went down, and, to avoid giving any alarm in the house, walked at once
7026: towards the Mosslands in search of Mr. Bates, whom he met returning from
7027: his breakfast. To the gardener he confided his fear about Caterina,
7028: assigning as a reason for this fear the probability that the shock she
7029: had undergone yesterday had unhinged her mind, and begging him to send
7030: men in search of her through the gardens and park, and inquire if she had
7031: been seen at the lodges; and if she were not found or heard of in this
7032: way, to lose no time in dragging the waters round the Manor.
7033: 
7034: ‘God forbid it should be so, Bates, but we shall be the easier for having
7035: searched everywhere.’
7036: 
7037: ‘Troost to mae, troost to mae, Mr. Gilfil. Eh! but I’d ha’ worked for
7038: day-wage all the rest o’ my life, rether than anythin’ should ha’
7039: happened to her.’
7040: 
7041: The good gardener, in deep distress, strode away to the stables that he
7042: might send the grooms on horseback through the park.
7043: 
7044: Mr. Gilfil’s next thought was to search the Rookery: she might be
7045: haunting the scene of Captain Wybrow’s death. He went hastily over every
7046: mound, looked round every large tree, and followed every winding of the
7047: walks. In reality he had little hope of finding her there; but the bare
7048: possibility fenced off for a time the fatal conviction that Caterina’s
7049: body would be found in the water. When the Rookery had been searched in
7050: vain, he walked fast to the border of the little stream that bounded one
7051: side of the grounds. The stream was almost everywhere hidden among trees,
7052: and there was one place where it was broader and deeper than
7053: elsewhere--she would be more likely to come to that spot than to the
7054: pool. He hurried along with strained eyes, his imagination continually
7055: creating what he dreaded to see.
7056: 
7057: There is something white behind that overhanging bough. His knees tremble
7058: under him. He seems to see part of her dress caught on a branch, and her
7059: dear dead face upturned. O God, give strength to thy creature, on whom
7060: thou hast laid this great agony! He is nearly up to the bough, and the
7061: white object is moving. It is a waterfowl, that spreads its wings and
7062: flies away screaming. He hardly knows whether it is a relief or a
7063: disappointment that she is not there. The conviction that she is dead
7064: presses its cold weight upon him none the less heavily.
7065: 
7066: As he reached the great pool in front of the Manor, he saw Mr. Bates,
7067: with a group of men already there, preparing for the dreadful search
7068: which could only displace his vague despair by a definite horror; for the
7069: gardener, in his restless anxiety, had been unable to defer this until
7070: other means of search had proved vain. The pool was not now laughing with
7071: sparkles among the water-lilies. It looked black and cruel under the
7072: sombre sky, as if its cold depths held relentlessly all the murdered hope
7073: and joy of Maynard Gilfil’s life.
7074: 
7075: Thoughts of the sad consequences for others as well as himself were
7076: crowding on his mind. The blinds and shutters were all closed in front of
7077: the Manor, and it was not likely that Sir Christopher would be aware of
7078: anything that was passing outside; but Mr. Gilfil felt that Caterina’s
7079: disappearance could not long be concealed from him. The coroner’s inquest
7080: would be held shortly; she would be inquired for, and then it would be
7081: inevitable that the Baronet should know all.
7082: 
7083: 
7084: 
7085: 
7086: Chapter 18
7087: 
7088: 
7089: At twelve o’clock, when all search and inquiry had been in vain, and the
7090: coroner was expected every moment, Mr. Gilfil could no longer defer the
7091: hard duty of revealing this fresh calamity to Sir Christopher, who must
7092: otherwise have it discovered to him abruptly.
7093: 
7094: The Baronet was seated in his dressing-room, where the dark
7095: window-curtains were drawn so as to admit only a sombre light. It was the
7096: first time Mr. Gilfil had had an interview with him this morning, and he
7097: was struck to see how a single day and night of grief had aged the fine
7098: old man. The lines in his brow and about his mouth were deepened; his
7099: complexion looked dull and withered; there was a swollen ridge under his
7100: eyes; and the eyes themselves, which used to cast so keen a glance on the
7101: present, had the vacant expression which tells that vision is no longer a
7102: sense, but a memory.
7103: 
7104: He held out his hand to Maynard, who pressed it, and sat down beside him
7105: in silence. Sir Christopher’s heart began to swell at this unspoken
7106: sympathy; the tears would rise, would roll in great drops down his
7107: cheeks. The first tears he had shed since boyhood were for Anthony.
7108: 
7109: Maynard felt as if his tongue were glued to the roof of his mouth. He
7110: could not speak first: he must wait until Sir Christopher said something
7111: which might lead on to the cruel words that must be spoken.
7112: 
7113: At last the Baronet mastered himself enough to say, ‘I’m very weak,
7114: Maynard--God help me! I didn’t think anything would unman me in this way;
7115: but I’d built everything on that lad. Perhaps I’ve been wrong in not
7116: forgiving my sister. She lost one of _her_ sons a little while ago. I’ve
7117: been too proud and obstinate.’
7118: 
7119: ‘We can hardly learn humility and tenderness enough except by suffering,’
7120: said Maynard; ‘and God sees we are in need of suffering, for it is
7121: falling more and more heavily on us. We have a new trouble this morning.’
7122: 
7123: ‘Tina?’ said Sir Christopher, looking up anxiously--‘is Tina ill?’
7124: 
7125: ‘I am in dreadful uncertainty about her. She was very much agitated
7126: yesterday--and with her delicate health--I am afraid to think what turn
7127: the agitation may have taken.’
7128: 
7129: ‘Is she delirious, poor dear little one?’
7130: 
7131: ‘God only knows how she is. We are unable to find her. When Mrs. Sharp
7132: went up to her room this morning, it was empty. She had not been in bed.
7133: Her hat and cloak were gone. I have had search made for her
7134: everywhere--in the house and garden, in the park, and--in the water. No
7135: one has seen her since Martha went up to light her fire at seven o’clock
7136: in the evening.’
7137: 
7138: While Mr. Gilfil was speaking, Sir Christopher’s eyes, which were eagerly
7139: turned on him, recovered some of their old keenness, and some sudden
7140: painful emotion, as at a new thought, flitted rapidly across his already
7141: agitated face, like the shadow of a dark cloud over the waves. When the
7142: pause came, he laid his hand on Mr. Gilfil’s arm, and said in a lower
7143: voice,--‘Maynard, did that poor thing love Anthony?’
7144: 
7145: ‘She did.’
7146: 
7147: Maynard hesitated after these words, struggling between his reluctance to
7148: inflict a yet deeper wound on Sir Christopher, and his determination that
7149: no injustice should be done to Caterina. Sir Christopher’s eyes were
7150: still fixed on him in solemn inquiry, and his own sunk towards the
7151: ground, while he tried to find the words that would tell the truth least
7152: cruelly.
7153: 
7154: ‘You must not have any wrong thoughts about Tina,’ he said at length. ‘I
7155: must tell you now, for her sake, what nothing but this should ever have
7156: caused to pass my lips. Captain Wybrow won her affections by attentions
7157: which, in his position, he was bound not to show her. Before his marriage
7158: was talked of, he had behaved to her like a lover.’
7159: 
7160: Sir Christopher relaxed his hold of Maynard’s arm, and looked away from
7161: him. He was silent for some minutes, evidently attempting to master
7162: himself, so as to be able to speak calmly.
7163: 
7164: ‘I must see Henrietta immediately,’ he said at last, with something of
7165: his old sharp decision; ‘she must know all; but we must keep it from
7166: every one else as far as possible. My dear boy,’ he continued in a kinder
7167: tone, ‘the heaviest burthen has fallen on you. But we may find her yet;
7168: we must not despair: there has not been time enough for us to be certain.
7169: Poor dear little one! God help me! I thought I saw everything, and was
7170: stone-blind all the while.’
7171: 
7172: 
7173: 
7174: 
7175: Chapter 19
7176: 
7177: 
7178: The sad slow week was gone by at last. At the coroner’s inquest a verdict
7179: of sudden death had been pronounced. Dr Hart, acquainted with Captain
7180: Wybrow’s previous state of health, had given his opinion that death had
7181: been imminent from long-established disease of the heart, though it had
7182: probably been accelerated by some unusual emotion. Miss Assher was the
7183: only person who positively knew the motive that had led Captain Wybrow to
7184: the Rookery; but she had not mentioned Caterina’s name, and all painful
7185: details or inquiries were studiously kept from her. Mr. Gilfil and Sir
7186: Christopher, however, knew enough to conjecture that the fatal agitation
7187: was due to an appointed meeting with Caterina.
7188: 
7189: All search and inquiry after her had been fruitless, and were the more
7190: likely to be so because they were carried on under the prepossession that
7191: she had committed suicide. No one noticed the absence of the trifles she
7192: had taken from her desk; no one knew of the likeness, or that she had
7193: hoarded her seven-shilling pieces, and it was not remarkable that she
7194: should have happened to be wearing the pearl earrings. She had left the
7195: house, they thought, taking nothing with her; it seemed impossible she
7196: could have gone far; and she must have been in a state of mental
7197: excitement, that made it too probable she had only gone to seek relief in
7198: death. The same places within three or four miles of the Manor were
7199: searched again and again--every pond, every ditch in the neighbourhood
7200: was examined.
7201: 
7202: Sometimes Maynard thought that death might have come on unsought, from
7203: cold and exhaustion; and not a day passed but he wandered through the
7204: neighbouring woods, turning up the heaps of dead leaves, as if it were
7205: possible her dear body could be hidden there. Then another horrible
7206: thought recurred, and before each night came he had been again through
7207: all the uninhabited rooms of the house, to satisfy himself once more that
7208: she was not hidden behind some cabinet, or door, or curtain--that he
7209: should not find her there with madness in her eyes, looking and looking,
7210: and yet not seeing him.
7211: 
7212: But at last those five long days and nights were at an end, the funeral
7213: was over, and the carriages were returning through the park. When they
7214: had set out, a heavy rain was falling; but now the clouds were breaking
7215: up, and a gleam of sunshine was sparkling among the dripping boughs under
7216: which they were passing. This gleam fell upon a man on horseback who was
7217: jogging slowly along, and whom Mr. Gilfil recognized, in spite of
7218: diminished rotundity, as Daniel Knott, the coachman who had married the
7219: rosy-cheeked Dorcas ten years before.
7220: 
7221: Every new incident suggested the same thought to Mr. Gilfil; and his eye
7222: no sooner fell on Knott than he said to himself, ‘Can he be come to tell
7223: us anything about Caterina?’ Then he remembered that Caterina had been
7224: very fond of Dorcas, and that she always had some present ready to send
7225: her when Knott paid an occasional visit to the Manor. Could Tina have
7226: gone to Dorcas? But his heart sank again as he thought, very likely Knott
7227: had only come because he had heard of Captain Wybrow’s death, and wanted
7228: to know how his old master had borne the blow.
7229: 
7230: As soon as the carriage reached the house, he went up to his study and
7231: walked about nervously, longing, but afraid, to go down and speak to
7232: Knott, lest his faint hope should be dissipated. Any one looking at that
7233: face, usually so full of calm goodwill, would have seen that the last
7234: week’s suffering had left deep traces. By day he had been riding or
7235: wandering incessantly, either searching for Caterina himself, or
7236: directing inquiries to be made by others. By night he had not known
7237: sleep--only intermittent dozing, in which he seemed to be finding
7238: Caterina dead, and woke up with a start from this unreal agony to the
7239: real anguish of believing that he should see her no more. The clear grey
7240: eyes looked sunken and restless, the full careless lips had a strange
7241: tension about them, and the brow, formerly so smooth and open, was
7242: contracted as if with pain. He had not lost the object of a few months’
7243: passion; he had lost the being who was bound up with his power of loving,
7244: as the brook we played by or the flowers we gathered in childhood are
7245: bound up with our sense of beauty. Love meant nothing for him but to love
7246: Caterina. For years, the thought of her had been present in everything,
7247: like the air and the light; and now she was gone, it seemed as if all
7248: pleasure had lost its vehicle: the sky, the earth, the daily ride, the
7249: daily talk might be there, but the loveliness and the joy that were in
7250: them had gone for ever.
7251: 
7252: Presently, as he still paced backwards and forwards, he heard steps along
7253: the corridor, and there was a knock at his door. His voice trembled as he
7254: said ‘Come in’, and the rush of renewed hope was hardly distinguishable
7255: from pain when he saw Warren enter with Daniel Knott behind him.
7256: 
7257: ‘Knott is come, sir, with news of Miss Sarti. I thought it best to bring
7258: him to you first.’
7259: 
7260: Mr. Gilfil could not help going up to the old coachman and wringing his
7261: hand; but he was unable to speak, and only motioned to him to take a
7262: chair, while Warren left the room. He hung upon Daniel’s moon-face, and
7263: listened to his small piping voice, with the same solemn yearning
7264: expectation with which he would have given ear to the most awful
7265: messenger from the land of shades.
7266: 
7267: ‘It war Dorkis, sir, would hev me come; but we knowed nothin’ o’ what’s
7268: happened at the Manor. She’s frightened out on her wits about Miss Sarti,
7269: an’ she would hev me saddle Blackbird this mornin’, an’ leave the
7270: ploughin’, to come an’ let Sir Christifer an’ my lady know. P’raps you’ve
7271: heared, sir, we don’t keep the Cross Keys at Sloppeter now; a uncle o’
7272: mine died three ’ear ago, an’ left me a leggicy. He was bailiff to Squire
7273: Ramble, as hed them there big farms on his hans; an’ so we took a little
7274: farm o’ forty acres or thereabouts, becos Dorkis didn’t like the public
7275: when she got moithered wi’ children. As pritty a place as iver you see,
7276: sir, wi’ water at the back convenent for the cattle.’
7277: 
7278: ‘For God’s sake,’ said Maynard, ‘tell me what it is about Miss Sarti.
7279: Don’t stay to tell me anything else now.’
7280: 
7281: ‘Well, sir,’ said Knott, rather frightened by the parson’s vehemence,
7282: ‘she come t’ our house i’ the carrier’s cart o’ Wednesday, when it was
7283: welly nine o’clock at night; and Dorkis run out, for she heared the cart
7284: stop, an’ Miss Sarti throwed her arms roun’ Dorkis’s neck an’ says, “Tek
7285: me in, Dorkis, tek me in,” an’ went off into a swoond, like. An’ Dorkis
7286: calls out to me,--“Dannel,” she calls--an’ I run out and carried the
7287: young miss in, an’ she come roun’ arter a bit, an’ opened her eyes, and
7288: Dorkis got her to drink a spoonful o’ rum-an’-water--we’ve got some
7289: capital rum as we brought from the Cross Keys, and Dorkis won’t let
7290: nobody drink it. She says she keeps it for sickness; but for my part, I
7291: think it’s a pity to drink good rum when your mouth’s out o’ taste; you
7292: may just as well hev doctor’s stuff. However, Dorkis got her to bed, an’
7293: there she’s lay iver sin’, stoopid like, an’ niver speaks, an’ on’y teks
7294: little bits an’ sups when Dorkis coaxes her. An’ we begun to be
7295: frightened, and couldn’t think what had made her come away from the
7296: Manor, and Dorkis was afeared there was summat wrong. So this mornin’ she
7297: could hold no longer, an’ would hev no nay but I must come an’ see; an’
7298: so I’ve rode twenty mile upo’ Blackbird, as thinks all the while he’s
7299: a-ploughin’, an’ turns sharp roun’, every thirty yards, as if he was at
7300: the end of a furrow. I’ve hed a sore time wi’ him, I can tell you, sir.’
7301: 
7302: ‘God bless you, Knott, for coming!’ said Mr. Gilfil, wringing the old
7303: coachman’s hand again. ‘Now go down and have something and rest yourself.
7304: You will stay here to-night, and by-and-by I shall come to you to learn
7305: the nearest way to your house. I shall get ready to ride there
7306: immediately, when I have spoken to Sir Christopher.’
7307: 
7308: In an hour from that time Mr. Gilfil was galloping on a stout mare
7309: towards the little muddy village of Callam, five miles beyond Sloppeter.
7310: Once more he saw some gladness in the afternoon sunlight; once more it
7311: was a pleasure to see the hedgerow trees flying past him, and to be
7312: conscious of a ‘good seat’ while his black Kitty bounded beneath him, and
7313: the air whistled to the rhythm of her pace. Caterina was not dead; he had
7314: found her; his love and tenderness and long-suffering seemed so strong,
7315: they must recall her to life and happiness.
7316: 
7317: After that week of despair, the rebound was so violent that it carried
7318: his hopes at once as far as the utmost mark they had ever reached.
7319: Caterina would come to love him at last; she would be his. They had been
7320: carried through all that dark and weary way that she might know the depth
7321: of his love. How he would cherish her--his little bird with the timid
7322: bright eye, and the sweet throat that trembled with love and music! She
7323: would nestle against him, and the poor little breast which had been so
7324: ruffled and bruised should be safe for evermore. In the love of a brave
7325: and faithful man there is always a strain of maternal tenderness; he
7326: gives out again those beams of protecting fondness which were shed on him
7327: as he lay on his mother’s knee. It was twilight as he entered the village
7328: of Callam, and, asking a homeward-bound labourer the way to Daniel
7329: Knott’s, learned that it was by the church, which showed its stumpy
7330: ivy-clad spire on a slight elevation of ground; a useful addition to the
7331: means of identifying that desirable homestead afforded by Daniel’s
7332: description--‘the prittiest place iver you see’--though a small cow-yard
7333: full of excellent manure, and leading right up to the door, without any
7334: frivolous interruption from garden or railing, might perhaps have been
7335: enough to make that description unmistakably specific.
7336: 
7337: Mr. Gilfil had no sooner reached the gate leading into the cow-yard, than
7338: he was descried by a flaxen-haired lad of nine, prematurely invested with
7339: the _toga virilis_, or smock-frock, who ran forward to let in the unusual
7340: visitor. In a moment Dorcas was at the door, the roses on her cheeks
7341: apparently all the redder for the three pair of cheeks which formed a
7342: group round her, and for the very fat baby who stared in her arms, and
7343: sucked a long crust with calm relish.
7344: 
7345: ‘Is it Mr. Gilfil, sir?’ said Dorcas, curtsying low as he made his way
7346: through the damp straw, after tying up his horse.
7347: 
7348: ‘Yes, Dorcas; I’m grown out of your knowledge. How is Miss Sarti?’
7349: 
7350: ‘Just for all the world the same, sir, as I suppose Dannel’s told you;
7351: for I reckon you’ve come from the Manor, though you’re come uncommon
7352: quick, to be sure.’
7353: 
7354: ‘Yes, he got to the Manor about one o’clock, and I set off as soon as I
7355: could. She’s not worse, is she?’
7356: 
7357: ‘No change, sir, for better or wuss. Will you please to walk in, sir? She
7358: lies there takin’ no notice o’ nothin’, no more nor a baby as is on’y a
7359: week old, an’ looks at me as blank as if she didn’t know me. O what can
7360: it be, Mr. Gilfil? How come she to leave the Manor? How’s his honour an’
7361: my lady?’
7362: 
7363: ‘In great trouble, Dorcas. Captain Wybrow, Sir Christopher’s nephew, you
7364: know, has died suddenly. Miss Sarti found him lying dead, and I think the
7365: shock has affected her mind.’
7366: 
7367: ‘Eh, dear! that fine young gentlemen as was to be th’ heir, as Dannel
7368: told me about. I remember seein’ him when he was a little un, a-visitin’
7369: at the Manor. Well-a-day, what a grief to his honour and my lady. But
7370: that poor Miss Tina--an’ she found him a-lyin’ dead? O dear, O dear!’
7371: 
7372: Dorcas had led the way into the best kitchen, as charming a room as best
7373: kitchens used to be in farmhouses which had no parlours--the fire
7374: reflected in a bright row of pewter plates and dishes; the sand-scoured
7375: deal tables so clean you longed to stroke them; the salt-coffer in one
7376: chimney-corner, and a three-cornered chair in the other, the walls behind
7377: handsomely tapestried with flitches of bacon, and the ceiling ornamented
7378: with pendent hams.
7379: 
7380: ‘Sit ye down, sir--do,’ said Dorcas, moving the three-cornered chair,
7381: ‘an’ let me get you somethin’ after your long journey. Here, Becky, come
7382: an’ tek the baby.’
7383: 
7384: Becky, a red-armed damsel, emerged from the adjoining back-kitchen, and
7385: possessed herself of baby, whose feelings or fat made him conveniently
7386: apathetic under the transference.
7387: 
7388: ‘What’ll you please to tek, sir, as I can give you? I’ll get you a rasher
7389: o’ bacon i’ no time, an’ I’ve got some tea, or belike you’d tek a glass
7390: o’ rum-an’-water. I know we’ve got nothin’ as you’re used t’ eat and
7391: drink; but such as I hev, sir, I shall be proud to give you.’
7392: 
7393: ‘Thank you, Dorcas; I can’t eat or drink anything. I’m not hungry or
7394: tired. Let us talk about Tina. Has she spoken at all?’
7395: 
7396: ‘Niver since the fust words. “Dear Dorkis,” says she, “tek me in;” an’
7397: then went off into a faint, an’ not a word has she spoken since. I get
7398: her t’ eat little bits an’ sups o’ things, but she teks no notice o’
7399: nothin’. I’ve took up Bessie wi’ me now an’ then’--here Dorcas lifted to
7400: her lap a curly-headed little girl of three, who was twisting a corner of
7401: her mother’s apron, and opening round eyes at the gentleman--‘folks’ll
7402: tek notice o’ children sometimes when they won’t o’ nothin’ else. An’ we
7403: gathered the autumn crocuses out o’ th’ orchard, and Bessie carried ’em
7404: up in her hand, an’ put ’em on the bed. I knowed how fond Miss Tina was
7405: o’ flowers an’ them things, when she was a little un. But she looked at
7406: Bessie an’ the flowers just the same as if she didn’t see ’em. It cuts me
7407: to th’ heart to look at them eyes o’ hers; I think they’re bigger nor
7408: iver, an’ they look like my poor baby’s as died, when it got so thin--O
7409: dear, its little hands you could see thro’ ’em. But I’ve great hopes if
7410: she was to see you, sir, as come from the Manor, it might bring back her
7411: mind, like.’
7412: 
7413: Maynard had that hope too, but he felt cold mists of fear gathering round
7414: him after the few bright warm hours of joyful confidence which had passed
7415: since he first heard that Caterina was alive. The thought _would_ urge
7416: itself upon him that her mind and body might never recover the strain
7417: that had been put upon them--that her delicate thread of life had already
7418: nearly spun itself out.
7419: 
7420: ‘Go now, Dorcas, and see how she is, but don’t say anything about my
7421: being here. Perhaps it would be better for me to wait till daylight
7422: before I see her, and yet it would be very hard to pass another night in
7423: this way.’
7424: 
7425: Dorcas set down little Bessie, and went away. The three other children,
7426: including young Daniel in his smock-frock, were standing opposite to Mr.
7427: Gilfil, watching him still more shyly now they were without their
7428: mother’s countenance. He drew little Bessie towards him, and set her on
7429: his knee. She shook her yellow curls out of her eyes, and looked up at
7430: him as she said,--‘Zoo tome to tee ze yady? Zoo mek her peak? What zoo do
7431: to her? Tiss her?’
7432: 
7433: ‘Do you like to be kissed, Bessie?’
7434: 
7435: ‘Det,’ said Bessie, immediately ducking down her head very low, in
7436: resistance to the expected rejoinder.
7437: 
7438: ‘We’ve got two pups,’ said young Daniel, emboldened by observing the
7439: gentleman’s amenities towards Bessie. ‘Shall I show ’em yer? One’s got
7440: white spots.’
7441: 
7442: ‘Yes, let me see them.’
7443: 
7444: Daniel ran out, and presently reappeared with two blind puppies, eagerly
7445: followed by the mother, affectionate though mongrel, and an exciting
7446: scene was beginning when Dorcas returned and said,--‘There’s niver any
7447: difference in her hardly. I think you needn’t wait, sir. She lies very
7448: still, as she al’ys does. I’ve put two candle i’ the room, so as she may
7449: see you well. You’ll please t’ excuse the room, sir, an’ the cap as she
7450: has on; it’s one o’ mine.’
7451: 
7452: Mr. Gilfil nodded silently, and rose to follow her up-stairs. They turned
7453: in at the first door, their footsteps making little noise on the plaster
7454: floor. The red-checkered linen curtains were drawn at the head of the
7455: bed, and Dorcas had placed the candles on this side of the room, so that
7456: the light might not fall oppressively on Caterina’s eyes. When she had
7457: opened the door, Dorcas whispered, ‘I’d better leave you, sir, I think?’
7458: 
7459: Mr. Gilfil motioned assent, and advanced beyond the curtain. Caterina lay
7460: with her eyes turned the other way, and seemed unconscious that any one
7461: had entered. Her eyes, as Dorcas had said, looked larger than ever,
7462: perhaps because her face was thinner and paler, and her hair quite
7463: gathered away under one of Dorcas’s thick caps. The small hands, too,
7464: that lay listlessly on the outside of the bed-clothes were thinner than
7465: ever. She looked younger than she really was, and any one seeing the tiny
7466: face and hands for the first time might have thought they belonged to a
7467: little girl of twelve, who was being taken away from coming instead of
7468: past sorrow.
7469: 
7470: When Mr. Gilfil advanced and stood opposite to her, the light fell full
7471: upon his face. A slight startled expression came over Caterina’s eyes;
7472: she looked at him earnestly for a few moments, then lifted up her hand as
7473: if to beckon him to stoop down towards her, and whispered ‘Maynard!’
7474: 
7475: He seated himself on the bed, and stooped down towards her. She whispered
7476: again--‘Maynard, did you see the dagger?’
7477: 
7478: He followed his first impulse in answering her, and it was a wise one.
7479: 
7480: ‘Yes,’ he whispered, ‘I found it in your pocket, and put it back again in
7481: the cabinet.’
7482: 
7483: He took her hand in his and held it gently, awaiting what she would say
7484: next. His heart swelled so with thankfulness that she had recognized him,
7485: he could hardly repress a sob. Gradually her eyes became softer and less
7486: intense in their gaze. The tears were slowly gathering, and presently
7487: some large hot drops rolled down her cheek. Then the flood-gates were
7488: opened, and the heart-easing stream gushed forth; deep sobs came; and for
7489: nearly an hour she lay without speaking, while the heavy icy pressure
7490: that withheld her misery from utterance was thus melting away. How
7491: precious these tears were to Maynard, who day after day had been
7492: shuddering at the continually recurring image of Tina with the dry
7493: scorching stare of insanity!
7494: 
7495: By degrees the sobs subsided, she began to breathe calmly, and lay quiet
7496: with her eyes shut. Patiently Maynard sat, not heeding the flight of the
7497: hours, not heeding the old clock that ticked loudly on the landing. But
7498: when it was nearly ten, Dorcas, impatiently anxious to know the result of
7499: Mr. Gilfil’s appearance, could not help stepping in on tip-toe. Without
7500: moving, he whispered in her ear to supply him with candles, see that the
7501: cow-boy had shaken down his mare, and go to bed--he would watch with
7502: Caterina--a great change had come over her.
7503: 
7504: Before long, Tina’s lips began to move. ‘Maynard,’ she whispered again.
7505: He leaned towards her, and she went on.
7506: 
7507: ‘You know how wicked I am, then? You know what I meant to do with the
7508: dagger?’
7509: 
7510: ‘Did you mean to kill yourself, Tina?’
7511: 
7512: She shook her head slowly, and then was silent for a long while. At last,
7513: looking at him with solemn eyes, she whispered, ‘To kill _him_.’
7514: 
7515: ‘Tina, my loved one, you would never have done it. God saw your whole
7516: heart; He knows you would never harm a living thing. He watches over His
7517: children, and will not let them do things they would pray with their
7518: whole hearts not to do. It was the angry thought of a moment, and He
7519: forgives you.’
7520: 
7521: She sank into silence again till it was nearly midnight. The weary
7522: enfeebled spirit seemed to be making its slow way with difficulty through
7523: the windings of thought; and when she began to whisper again, it was in
7524: reply to Maynard’s words.
7525: 
7526: ‘But I had had such wicked feelings for a long while. I was so angry, and
7527: I hated Miss Assher so, and I didn’t care what came to anybody, because I
7528: was so miserable myself. I was full of bad passions. No one else was ever
7529: so wicked.’
7530: 
7531: ‘Yes, Tina, many are just as wicked. I often have very wicked feelings,
7532: and am tempted to do wrong things; but then my body is stronger than
7533: yours, and I can hide my feelings and resist them better. They do not
7534: master me so. You have seen the little birds when they are very young and
7535: just begin to fly, how all their feathers are ruffled when they are
7536: frightened or angry; they have no power over themselves left, and might
7537: fall into a pit from mere fright. You were like one of those little
7538: birds. Your sorrow and suffering had taken such hold of you, you hardly
7539: knew what you did.’
7540: 
7541: He would not speak long. Lest he should tire her, and oppress her with
7542: too many thoughts. Long pauses seemed needful for her before she could
7543: concentrate her feelings in short words.
7544: 
7545: ‘But when I meant to do it,’ was the next thing she whispered, ‘it was as
7546: bad as if I had done it.’
7547: 
7548: ‘No, my Tina,’ answered Maynard slowly, waiting a little between each
7549: sentence; ‘we mean to do wicked things that we never could do, just as we
7550: mean to do good or clever things that we never could do. Our thoughts are
7551: often worse than we are, just as they are often better than we are. And
7552: God sees us as we are altogether, not in separate feelings or actions, as
7553: our fellow-men see us. We are always doing each other injustice, and
7554: thinking better or worse of each other than we deserve, because we only
7555: hear and see separate words and actions. We don’t see each other’s whole
7556: nature. But God sees that you could not have committed that crime.’
7557: 
7558: Caterina shook her head slowly, and was silent. After a while,--‘I don’t
7559: know,’ she said; ‘I seemed to see him coming towards me, just as he would
7560: really have looked, and I meant--I meant to do it.’
7561: 
7562: ‘But when you saw him--tell me how it was, Tina?’
7563: 
7564: ‘I saw him lying on the ground and thought he was ill. I don’t know how
7565: it was then; I forgot everything. I knelt down and spoke to him, and--and
7566: he took no notice of me, and his eyes were fixed, and I began to think he
7567: was dead.’
7568: 
7569: ‘And you have never felt angry since?’
7570: 
7571: ‘O no, no; it is I who have been more wicked than any one; it is I who
7572: have been wrong all through.’
7573: 
7574: ‘No, Tina; the fault has not all been yours; _he_ was wrong; he gave you
7575: provocation. And wrong makes wrong. When people use us ill, we can hardly
7576: help having ill feeling towards them. But that second wrong is more
7577: excusable. I am more sinful than you, Tina; I have often had very bad
7578: feelings towards Captain Wybrow; and if he had provoked me as he did you,
7579: I should perhaps have done something more wicked.’
7580: 
7581: ‘O, it was not so wrong in him; he didn’t know how he hurt me. How was it
7582: likely he could love me as I loved him? And how could he marry a poor
7583: little thing like me?’
7584: 
7585: Maynard made no reply to this, and there was again silence, till Tina
7586: said, ‘Then I was so deceitful; they didn’t know how wicked I was.
7587: Padroncello didn’t know; his good little monkey he used to call me; and
7588: if he had known, O how naughty he would have thought me!’
7589: 
7590: ‘My Tina, we have all our secret sins; and if we knew ourselves, we
7591: should not judge each other harshly. Sir Christopher himself has felt,
7592: since this trouble came upon him, that he has been too severe and
7593: obstinate.’
7594: 
7595: In this way--in these broken confessions and answering words of
7596: comfort--the hours wore on, from the deep black night to the chill early
7597: twilight, and from early twilight to the first yellow streak of morning
7598: parting the purple cloud. Mr. Gilfil felt as if in the long hours of that
7599: night the bond that united his love for ever and alone to Caterina had
7600: acquired fresh strength and sanctity. It is so with the human relations
7601: that rest on the deep emotional sympathy of affection: every new day and
7602: night of joy or sorrow is a new ground, a new consecration, for the love
7603: that is nourished by memories as well as hopes--the love to which
7604: perpetual repetition is not a weariness but a want, and to which a
7605: separated joy is the beginning of pain.
7606: 
7607: The cocks began to crow; the gate swung; there was a tramp of footsteps
7608: in the yard, and Mr. Gilfil heard Dorcas stirring. These sounds seemed to
7609: affect Caterina, for she looked anxiously at him and said, ‘Maynard, are
7610: you going away?’
7611: 
7612: ‘No, I shall stay here at Callam until you are better, and then you will
7613: go away too.’
7614: 
7615: ‘Never to the Manor again, O no! I shall live poorly, and get my own
7616: bread.’
7617: 
7618: ‘Well, dearest, you shall do what you would like best. But I wish you
7619: could go to sleep now. Try to rest quietly, and by-and-by you will
7620: perhaps sit up a little. God has kept you in life in spite of all this
7621: sorrow; it will be sinful not to try and make the best of His gift. Dear
7622: Tina, you will try;--and little Bessie brought you some crocuses once,
7623: you didn’t notice the poor little thing; but you _will_ notice her when
7624: she comes again, will you not?’
7625: 
7626: ‘I will try,’ whispered Tina humbly, and then closed her eyes.
7627: 
7628: By the time the sun was above the horizon, scattering the clouds, and
7629: shining with pleasant morning warmth through the little leaded window,
7630: Caterina was asleep. Maynard gently loosed the tiny hand, cheered Dorcas
7631: with the good news, and made his way to the village inn, with a thankful
7632: heart that Tina had been so far herself again. Evidently the sight of him
7633: had blended naturally with the memories in which her mind was absorbed,
7634: and she had been led on to an unburthening of herself that might be the
7635: beginning of a complete restoration. But her body was so enfeebled--her
7636: soul so bruised--that the utmost tenderness and care would be necessary.
7637: The next thing to be done was to send tidings to Sir Christopher and Lady
7638: Cheverel; then to write and summon his sister, under whose care he had
7639: determined to place Caterina. The Manor, even if she had been wishing to
7640: return thither, would, he knew, be the most undesirable home for her at
7641: present: every scene, every object there, was associated with still
7642: unallayed anguish. If she were domesticated for a time with his mild
7643: gentle sister, who had a peaceful home and a prattling little boy, Tina
7644: might attach herself anew to life, and recover, partly at least, the
7645: shock that had been given to her constitution. When he had written his
7646: letters and taken a hasty breakfast, he was soon in his saddle again, on
7647: his way to Sloppeter, where he would post them, and seek out a medical
7648: man, to whom he might confide the moral causes of Caterina’s enfeebled
7649: condition.
7650: 
7651: 
7652: 
7653: 
7654: Chapter 20
7655: 
7656: 
7657: In less than a week from that time, Caterina was persuaded to travel in a
7658: comfortable carriage, under the care of Mr. Gilfil and his sister, Mrs.
7659: Heron, whose soft blue eyes and mild manners were very soothing to the
7660: poor bruised child--the more so as they had an air of sisterly equality
7661: which was quite new to her. Under Lady Cheverel’s uncaressing
7662: authoritative goodwill, Tina had always retained a certain constraint and
7663: awe; and there was a sweetness before unknown in having a young and
7664: gentle woman, like an elder sister, bending over her caressingly, and
7665: speaking in low loving tones.
7666: 
7667: Maynard was almost angry with himself for feeling happy while Tina’s mind
7668: and body were still trembling on the verge of irrecoverable decline; but
7669: the new delight of acting as her guardian angel, of being with her every
7670: hour of the day, of devising everything for her comfort, of watching for
7671: a ray of returning interest in her eyes, was too absorbing to leave room
7672: for alarm or regret.
7673: 
7674: On the third day the carriage drove up to the door of Foxholm Parsonage,
7675: where the Rev. Arthur Heron presented himself on the door-step, eager to
7676: greet his returning Lucy, and holding by the hand a broad-chested
7677: tawny-haired boy of five, who was smacking a miniature hunting-whip with
7678: great vigour.
7679: 
7680: Nowhere was there a lawn more smooth-shaven, walks better swept, or a
7681: porch more prettily festooned with creepers, than at Foxholm Parsonage,
7682: standing snugly sheltered by beeches and chestnuts half-way down the
7683: pretty green hill which was surmounted by the church, and overlooking a
7684: village that straggled at its ease among pastures and meadows, surrounded
7685: by wild hedgerows and broad shadowing trees, as yet unthreatened by
7686: improved methods of farming.
7687: 
7688: Brightly the fire shone in the great parlour, and brightly in the little
7689: pink bedroom, which was to be Caterina’s, because it looked away from the
7690: churchyard, and on to a farm homestead, with its little cluster of
7691: beehive ricks, and placid groups of cows, and cheerful matin sounds of
7692: healthy labour. Mrs. Heron, with the instinct of a delicate, impressible
7693: woman, had written to her husband to have this room prepared for
7694: Caterina. Contented speckled hens, industriously scratching for the
7695: rarely-found corn, may sometimes do more for a sick heart than a grove of
7696: nightingales; there is something irresistibly calming in the
7697: unsentimental cheeriness of top-knotted pullets, unpetted sheep-dogs, and
7698: patient cart-horses enjoying a drink of muddy water.
7699: 
7700: In such a home as this parsonage, a nest of comfort, without any of the
7701: stateliness that would carry a suggestion of Cheverel Manor, Mr. Gilfil
7702: was not unreasonable in hoping that Caterina might gradually shake off
7703: the haunting vision of the past, and recover from the languor and
7704: feebleness which were the physical sign of that vision’s blighting
7705: presence. The next thing to be done was to arrange an exchange of duties
7706: with Mr. Heron’s curate, that Maynard might be constantly near Caterina,
7707: and watch over her progress. She seemed to like him to be with her, to
7708: look uneasily for his return; and though she seldom spoke to him, she was
7709: most contented when he sat by her, and held her tiny hand in his large
7710: protecting grasp. But Oswald, _alias_ Ozzy, the broad-chested boy, was
7711: perhaps her most beneficial companion. With something of his uncle’s
7712: person, he had inherited also his uncle’s early taste for a domestic
7713: menagerie, and was very imperative in demanding Tina’s sympathy in the
7714: welfare of his guinea-pigs, squirrels, and dormice. With him she seemed
7715: now and then to have gleams of her childhood coming athwart the leaden
7716: clouds, and many hours of winter went by the more easily for being spent
7717: in Ozzy’s nursery.
7718: 
7719: Mrs. Heron was not musical, and had no instrument; but one of Mr.
7720: Gilfil’s cares was to procure a harpsichord, and have it placed in the
7721: drawing-room, always open, in the hope that some day the spirit of music
7722: would be reawakened in Caterina, and she would be attracted towards the
7723: instrument. But the winter was almost gone by, and he had waited in vain.
7724: The utmost improvement in Tina had not gone beyond passiveness and
7725: acquiescence--a quiet grateful smile, compliance with Oswald’s whims, and
7726: an increasing consciousness of what was being said and done around her.
7727: Sometimes she would take up a bit of woman’s work, but she seemed too
7728: languid to persevere in it; her fingers soon dropped, and she relapsed
7729: into motionless reverie.
7730: 
7731: At last--it was one of those bright days in the end of February, when the
7732: sun is shining with a promise of approaching spring. Maynard had been
7733: walking with her and Oswald round the garden to look at the snowdrops,
7734: and she was resting on the sofa after the walk. Ozzy, roaming about the
7735: room in quest of a forbidden pleasure, came to the harpsichord, and
7736: struck the handle of his whip on a deep bass note.
7737: 
7738: The vibration rushed through Caterina like an electric shock: it seemed
7739: as if at that instant a new soul were entering into her, and filling her
7740: with a deeper, more significant life. She looked round, rose from the
7741: sofa, and walked to the harpsichord. In a moment her fingers were
7742: wandering with their old sweet method among the keys, and her soul was
7743: floating in its true familiar element of delicious sound, as the
7744: water-plant that lies withered and shrunken on the ground expands into
7745: freedom and beauty when once more bathed in its native flood.
7746: 
7747: Maynard thanked God. An active power was re-awakened, and must make a new
7748: epoch in Caterina’s recovery.
7749: 
7750: Presently there were low liquid notes blending themselves with the harder
7751: tones of the instrument, and gradually the pure voice swelled into
7752: predominance. Little Ozzy stood in the middle of the room, with his mouth
7753: open and his legs very wide apart, struck with something like awe at this
7754: new power in ‘Tin-Tin,’ as he called her, whom he had been accustomed to
7755: think of as a playfellow not at all clever, and very much in need of his
7756: instruction on many subjects. A genie soaring with broad wings out of his
7757: milkjug would not have been more astonishing.
7758: 
7759: Caterina was singing the very air from the _Orfeo_ which we heard her
7760: singing so many months ago at the beginning of her sorrows. It was ‘_Ho
7761: perduto_’, Sir Christopher’s favourite, and its notes seemed to carry on
7762: their wings all the tenderest memories of her life, when Cheverel Manor
7763: was still an untroubled home. The long happy days of childhood and
7764: girlhood recovered all their rightful predominance over the short
7765: interval of sin and sorrow.
7766: 
7767: She paused, and burst into tears--the first tears she had shed since she
7768: had been at Foxholm. Maynard could not help hurrying towards her, putting
7769: his arm round her, and leaning down to kiss her hair. She nestled to him,
7770: and put up her little mouth to be kissed.
7771: 
7772: The delicate-tendrilled plant must have something to cling to. The soul
7773: that was born anew to music was born anew to love.
7774: 
7775: 
7776: 
7777: 
7778: Chapter 21
7779: 
7780: 
7781: On the 30th of May 1790, a very pretty sight was seen by the villagers
7782: assembled near the door of Foxholm Church. The sun was bright upon the
7783: dewy grass, the air was alive with the murmur of bees and the trilling of
7784: birds, the bushy blossoming chestnuts and the foamy flowering hedgerows
7785: seemed to be crowding round to learn why the church-bells were ringing so
7786: merrily, as Maynard Gilfil, his face bright with happiness, walked out of
7787: the old Gothic doorway with Tina on his arm. The little face was still
7788: pale, and there was a subdued melancholy in it, as of one who sups with
7789: friends for the last time, and has his ear open for the signal that will
7790: call him away. But the tiny hand rested with the pressure of contented
7791: affection on Maynard’s arm, and the dark eyes met his downward glance
7792: with timid answering love.
7793: 
7794: There was no train of bridesmaids; only pretty Mrs. Heron leaning on the
7795: arm of a dark-haired young man hitherto unknown in Foxholm, and holding
7796: by the other hand little Ozzy, who exulted less in his new velvet cap and
7797: tunic, than in the notion that he was bridesman to Tin-Tin.
7798: 
7799: Last of all came a couple whom the villagers eyed yet more eagerly than
7800: the bride and bridegroom: a fine old gentleman, who looked round with
7801: keen glances that cowed the conscious scapegraces among them, and a
7802: stately lady in blue-and-white silk robes, who must surely be like Queen
7803: Charlotte.
7804: 
7805: ‘Well, that theer’s whut I coal a pictur,’ said old ‘Mester’ Ford, a true
7806: Staffordshire patriarch, who leaned on a stick and held his head very
7807: much on one side, with the air of a man who had little hope of the
7808: present generation, but would at all events give it the benefit of his
7809: criticism. ‘Th’ yoong men noo-a-deys, the’re poor squashy things--the’
7810: looke well anoof, but the’ woon’t wear, the’ woon’t wear. Theer’s ne’er
7811: un’ll carry his ’ears like that Sir Cris’fer Chuvrell.’
7812: 
7813: ‘Ull bet ye two pots,’ said another of the seniors, ‘as that yoongster
7814: a-walkin’ wi’ th’ parson’s wife ’ll be Sir Cris’fer’s son--he fevours
7815: him.’
7816: 
7817: ‘Nay, yae’ll bet that wi’ as big a fule as yersen; hae’s noo son at all.
7818: As I oonderstan’, hae’s the nevey as is’ t’ heir th’ esteate. The
7819: coochman as puts oop at th’ White Hoss tellt me as theer war another
7820: nevey, a deal finer chap t’ looke at nor this un, as died in a fit, all
7821: on a soodden, an’ soo this here yoong un’s got upo’ th’ perch istid.’
7822: 
7823: At the church gate Mr. Bates was standing in a new suit, ready to speak
7824: words of good omen as the bride and bridegroom approached. He had come
7825: all the way from Cheverel Manor on purpose to see Miss Tina happy once
7826: more, and would have been in a state of unmixed joy but for the
7827: inferiority of the wedding nosegays to what he could have furnished from
7828: the garden at the Manor.
7829: 
7830: ‘God A’maighty bless ye both, an’ send ye long laife an’ happiness,’ were
7831: the good gardener’s rather tremulous words.
7832: 
7833: ‘Thank you, uncle Bates; always remember Tina,’ said the sweet low voice,
7834: which fell on Mr. Bates’s ear for the last time.
7835: 
7836: The wedding journey was to be a circuitous route to Shepperton, where Mr.
7837: Gilfil had been for several months inducted as vicar. This small living
7838: had been given him through the interest of an old friend who had some
7839: claim on the gratitude of the Oldinport family; and it was a satisfaction
7840: both to Maynard and Sir Christopher that a home to which he might take
7841: Caterina had thus readily presented itself at a distance from Cheverel
7842: Manor. For it had never yet been thought safe that she should revisit the
7843: scene of her sufferings, her health continuing too delicate to encourage
7844: the slightest risk of painful excitement. In a year or two, perhaps, by
7845: the time old Mr. Crichley, the rector of Cumbermoor, should have left a
7846: world of gout, and when Caterina would very likely be a happy mother,
7847: Maynard might safely take up his abode at Cumbermoor, and Tina would feel
7848: nothing but content at seeing a new ‘little black-eyed monkey’ running up
7849: and down the gallery and gardens of the Manor. A mother dreads no
7850: memories--those shadows have all melted away in the dawn of baby’s smile.
7851: 
7852: In these hopes, and in the enjoyment of Tina’s nestling affection, Mr.
7853: Gilfil tasted a few months of perfect happiness. She had come to lean
7854: entirely on his love, and to find life sweet for his sake. Her continual
7855: languor and want of active interest was a natural consequence of bodily
7856: feebleness, and the prospect of her becoming a mother was a new ground
7857: for hoping the best. But the delicate plant had been too deeply bruised,
7858: and in the struggle to put forth a blossom it died.
7859: 
7860: Tina died, and Maynard Gilfil’s love went with her into deep silence for
7861: evermore.
7862: 
7863: 
7864: 
7865: 
7866: EPILOGUE
7867: 
7868: 
7869: This was Mr. Gilfil’s love-story, which lay far back from the time when
7870: he sat, worn and grey, by his lonely fireside in Shepperton Vicarage.
7871: Rich brown locks, passionate love, and deep early sorrow, strangely
7872: different as they seem from the scanty white hairs, the apathetic
7873: content, and the unexpectant quiescence of old age, are but part of the
7874: same life’s journey; as the bright Italian plains, with the sweet _Addio_
7875: of their beckoning maidens, are part of the same day’s travel that brings
7876: us to the other side of the mountain, between the sombre rocky walls and
7877: among the guttural voices of the Valais.
7878: 
7879: To those who were familiar only with the grey-haired Vicar, jogging
7880: leisurely along on his old chestnut cob, it would perhaps have been hard
7881: to believe that he had ever been the Maynard Gilfil who, with a heart
7882: full of passion and tenderness, had urged his black Kitty to her swiftest
7883: gallop on the way to Callam, or that the old gentleman of caustic tongue,
7884: and bucolic tastes, and sparing habits, had known all the deep secrets of
7885: devoted love, had struggled through its days and nights of anguish, and
7886: trembled under its unspeakable joys.
7887: 
7888: And indeed the Mr. Gilfil of those late Shepperton days had more of the
7889: knots and ruggedness of poor human nature than there lay any clear hint
7890: of in the open-eyed loving Maynard. But it is with men as with trees: if
7891: you lop off their finest branches, into which they were pouring their
7892: young life-juice, the wounds will be healed over with some rough boss,
7893: some odd excrescence; and what might have been a grand tree expanding
7894: into liberal shade, is but a whimsical misshapen trunk. Many an
7895: irritating fault, many an unlovely oddity, has come of a hard sorrow,
7896: which has crushed and maimed the nature just when it was expanding into
7897: plenteous beauty; and the trivial erring life which we visit with our
7898: harsh blame, may be but as the unsteady motion of a man whose best limb
7899: is withered.
7900: 
7901: And so the dear old Vicar, though he had something of the knotted
7902: whimsical character of the poor lopped oak, had yet been sketched out by
7903: nature as a noble tree. The heart of him was sound, the grain was of the
7904: finest; and in the grey-haired man who filled his pocket with sugar-plums
7905: for the little children, whose most biting words were directed against
7906: the evil doing of the rich man, and who, with all his social pipes and
7907: slipshod talk, never sank below the highest level of his parishioners’
7908: respect, there was the main trunk of the same brave, faithful, tender
7909: nature that had poured out the finest, freshest forces of its
7910: life-current in a first and only love--the love of Tina.
7911:

7915: JANET’S REPENTANCE
7916: 
7917: 
7918: 
7919: 
7920: Chapter 1
7921: 
7922: 
7923: ‘No!’ said lawyer Dempster, in a loud, rasping, oratorical tone,
7924: struggling against chronic huskiness, ‘as long as my Maker grants me
7925: power of voice and power of intellect, I will take every legal means to
7926: resist the introduction of demoralizing, methodistical doctrine into this
7927: parish; I will not supinely suffer an insult to be inflicted on our
7928: venerable pastor, who has given us sound instruction for half a century.’
7929: 
7930: It was very warm everywhere that evening, but especially in the bar of
7931: the Red Lion at Milby, where Mr. Dempster was seated mixing his third
7932: glass of brandy-and-water. He was a tall and rather massive man, and the
7933: front half of his large surface was so well dredged with snuff, that the
7934: cat, having inadvertently come near him, had been seized with a severe
7935: fit of sneezing--an accident which, being cruelly misunderstood, had
7936: caused her to be driven contumeliously from the bar. Mr. Dempster
7937: habitually held his chin tucked in, and his head hanging forward, weighed
7938: down, perhaps, by a preponderant occiput and a bulging forehead, between
7939: which his closely-clipped coronal surface lay like a flat and new-mown
7940: table-land. The only other observable features were puffy cheeks and a
7941: protruding yet lipless mouth. Of his nose I can only say that it was
7942: snuffy; and as Mr. Dempster was never caught in the act of looking at
7943: anything in particular, it would have been difficult to swear to the
7944: colour of his eyes.
7945: 
7946: ‘Well! I’ll not stick at giving myself trouble to put down such
7947: hypocritical cant,’ said Mr. Tomlinson, the rich miller. ‘I know well
7948: enough what your Sunday evening lectures are good for--for wenches to
7949: meet their sweethearts, and brew mischief. There’s work enough with the
7950: servant-maids as it is--such as I never heard the like of in my mother’s
7951: time, and it’s all along o’ your schooling and newfangled plans. Give me
7952: a servant as can nayther read nor write, I say, and doesn’t know the year
7953: o’ the Lord as she was born in. I should like to know what good those
7954: Sunday schools have done, now. Why, the boys used to go a birds-nesting
7955: of a Sunday morning; and a capital thing too--ask any farmer; and very
7956: pretty it was to see the strings o’ heggs hanging up in poor people’s
7957: houses. You’ll not see ’em nowhere now.’
7958: 
7959: ‘Pooh!’ said Mr. Luke Byles, who piqued himself on his reading, and was
7960: in the habit of asking casual acquaintances if they knew anything of
7961: Hobbes; ‘it is right enough that the lower orders should be instructed.
7962: But this sectarianism within the Church ought to be put down. In point of
7963: fact, these Evangelicals are not Churchmen at all; they’re no better than
7964: Presbyterians.’
7965: 
7966: ‘Presbyterians? what are they?’ inquired Mr. Tomlinson, who often said
7967: his father had given him ‘no eddication, and he didn’t care who knowed
7968: it; he could buy up most o’ th’ eddicated men he’d ever come across.’
7969: 
7970: ‘The Presbyterians,’ said Mr. Dempster, in rather a louder tone than
7971: before, holding that every appeal for information must naturally be
7972: addressed to him, ‘are a sect founded in the reign of Charles I., by a
7973: man named John Presbyter, who hatched all the brood of Dissenting vermin
7974: that crawl about in dirty alleys, and circumvent the lord of the manor in
7975: order to get a few yards of ground for their pigeon-house conventicles.’
7976: 
7977: ‘No, no, Dempster,’ said Mr. Luke Byles, ‘you’re out there.
7978: Presbyterianism is derived from the word presbyter, meaning an elder.’
7979: 
7980: ‘Don’t contradict _me_, sir!’ stormed Dempster. ‘I say the word
7981: presbyterian is derived from John Presbyter, a miserable fanatic who wore
7982: a suit of leather, and went about from town to village, and from village
7983: to hamlet, inoculating the vulgar with the asinine virus of dissent.’
7984: 
7985: ‘Come, Byles, that seems a deal more likely,’ said Mr. Tomlinson, in a
7986: conciliatory tone, apparently of opinion that history was a process of
7987: ingenious guessing.
7988: 
7989: ‘It’s not a question of likelihood; it’s a known fact. I could fetch you
7990: my Encyclopædia, and show it you this moment.’
7991: 
7992: ‘I don’t care a straw, sir, either for you or your Encyclopædia,’ said
7993: Mr. Dempster; ‘a farrago of false information, of which you picked up an
7994: imperfect copy in a cargo of waste paper. Will you tell _me_, sir, that I
7995: don’t know the origin of Presbyterianism? I, sir, a man known through the
7996: county, intrusted with the affairs of half a score parishes; while you,
7997: sir, are ignored by the very fleas that infest the miserable alley in
7998: which you were bred.’
7999: 
8000: A loud and general laugh, with ‘You’d better let him alone Byles’;
8001: ‘You’ll not get the better of Dempster in a hurry’, drowned the retort of
8002: the too well-informed Mr. Byles, who, white with rage, rose and walked
8003: out of the bar.
8004: 
8005: ‘A meddlesome, upstart, Jacobinical fellow, gentlemen’, continued Mr.
8006: Dempster. ‘I was determined to be rid of him. What does he mean by
8007: thrusting himself into our company? A man with about as much principle as
8008: he has property, which, to my knowledge, is considerably less than none.
8009: An insolvent atheist, gentlemen. A deistical prater, fit to sit in the
8010: chimney-corner of a pot-house, and make blasphemous comments on the one
8011: greasy newspaper fingered by beer-swilling tinkers. I will not suffer in
8012: my company a man who speaks lightly of religion. The signature of a
8013: fellow like Byles would be a blot on our protest.’
8014: 
8015: ‘And how do you get on with your signatures?’ said Mr. Pilgrim, the
8016: doctor, who had presented his large top-booted person within the bar
8017: while Mr. Dempster was speaking. Mr. Pilgrim had just returned from one
8018: of his long day’s rounds among the farm-houses, in the course of which he
8019: had sat down to two hearty meals that might have been mistaken for
8020: dinners if he had not declared them to be ‘snaps’; and as each snap had
8021: been followed by a few glasses of ‘mixture’; containing a less liberal
8022: proportion of water than the articles he himself labelled with that
8023: broadly generic name, he was in that condition which his groom indicated
8024: with poetic ambiguity by saying that ‘master had been in the sunshine’.
8025: Under these circumstances, after a hard day, in which he had really had
8026: no regular meal, it seemed a natural relaxation to step into the bar of
8027: the Red Lion, where, as it was Saturday evening, he should be sure to
8028: find Dempster, and hear the latest news about the protest against the
8029: evening lecture.
8030: 
8031: ‘Have you hooked Ben Landor yet?’ he continued, as he took two chairs,
8032: one for his body, and the other for his right leg.
8033: 
8034: ‘No,’ said Mr. Budd, the churchwarden, shaking his head; ‘Ben Landor has
8035: a way of keeping himself neutral in everything, and he doesn’t like to
8036: oppose his father. Old Landor is a regular Tryanite. But we haven’t got
8037: your name yet, Pilgrim.’
8038: 
8039: ‘Tut tut, Budd,’ said Mr. Dempster, sarcastically, ‘you don’t expect
8040: Pilgrim to sign? He’s got a dozen Tryanite livers under his treatment.
8041: Nothing like cant and methodism for producing a superfluity of bile.’
8042: 
8043: ‘O, I thought, as Pratt had declared himself a Tryanite, we should be
8044: sure to get Pilgrim on our side.’
8045: 
8046: Mr. Pilgrim was not a man to sit quiet under a sarcasm, nature having
8047: endowed him with a considerable share of self-defensive wit. In his most
8048: sober moments he had an impediment in his speech, and as copious
8049: gin-and-water stimulated not the speech but the impediment, he had time
8050: to make his retort sufficiently bitter.
8051: 
8052: ‘Why, to tell you the truth, Budd,’ he spluttered, ‘there’s a report all
8053: over the town that Deb Traunter swears you shall take her with you as one
8054: of the delegates, and they say there’s to be a fine crowd at your door
8055: the morning you start, to see the row. Knowing your tenderness for that
8056: member of the fair sex, I thought you might find it impossible to deny
8057: her. I hang back a little from signing on that account, as Prendergast
8058: might not take the protest well if Deb Traunter went with you.’
8059: 
8060: Mr. Budd was a small, sleek-headed bachelor of five-and-forty, whose
8061: scandalous life had long furnished his more moral neighbours with an
8062: after-dinner joke. He had no other striking characteristic, except that
8063: he was a currier of choleric temperament, so that you might wonder why he
8064: had been chosen as clergyman’s churchwarden, if I did not tell you that
8065: he had recently been elected through Mr. Dempster’s exertions, in order
8066: that his zeal against the threatened evening lecture might be backed by
8067: the dignity of office.
8068: 
8069: ‘Come, come, Pilgrim,’ said Mr. Tomlinson, covering Mr. Budd’s retreat,
8070: ‘you know you like to wear the crier’s coat, green o’ one side and red
8071: o’ the other. You’ve been to hear Tryan preach at Paddiford Common--you
8072: know you have.’
8073: 
8074: ‘To be sure I have; and a capital sermon too. It’s a pity you were not
8075: there. It was addressed to those “void of understanding.”’
8076: 
8077: ‘No, no, you’ll never catch me there,’ returned Mr. Tomlinson, not in the
8078: least stung: ‘he preaches without book, they say, just like a Dissenter.
8079: It must be a rambling sort of a concern.’
8080: 
8081: ‘That’s not the worst,’ said Mr. Dempster; ‘he preaches against good
8082: works; says good works are not necessary to salvation--a sectarian,
8083: antinomian, anabaptist doctrine. Tell a man he is not to be saved by his
8084: works, and you open the flood-gates of all immorality. You see it in all
8085: these canting innovators; they’re all bad ones by the sly; smooth-faced,
8086: drawling, hypocritical fellows, who pretend ginger isn’t hot in their
8087: mouths, and cry down all innocent pleasures; their hearts are all the
8088: blacker for their sanctimonious outsides. Haven’t we been warned against
8089: those who make clean the outside of the cup and the platter? There’s this
8090: Tryan, now, he goes about praying with old women, and singing with
8091: charity children; but what has he really got his eye on all the while? A
8092: domineering ambitious Jesuit, gentlemen; all he wants is to get his foot
8093: far enough into the parish to step into Crewe’s shoes when the old
8094: gentleman dies. Depend upon it, whenever you see a man pretending to be
8095: better than his neighbours, that man has either some cunning end to
8096: serve, or his heart is rotten with spiritual pride.’
8097: 
8098: As if to guarantee himself against this awful sin, Mr. Dempster seized
8099: his glass of brandy-and-water, and tossed off the contents with even
8100: greater rapidity than usual.
8101: 
8102: ‘Have you fixed on your third delegate yet?’ said Mr. Pilgrim, whose
8103: taste was for detail rather than for dissertation.
8104: 
8105: ‘That’s the man,’ answered Dempster, pointing to Mr. Tomlinson. ‘We start
8106: for Elmstoke Rectory on Tuesday morning; so, if you mean to give us your
8107: signature, you must make up your mind pretty quickly, Pilgrim.’
8108: 
8109: Mr. Pilgrim did not in the least mean it, so he only said, ‘I shouldn’t
8110: wonder if Tryan turns out too many for you, after all. He’s got a
8111: well-oiled tongue of his own, and has perhaps talked over Prendergast
8112: into a determination to stand by him.’
8113: 
8114: ‘Ve-ry little fear of that,’ said Dempster, in a confident tone.
8115: ‘I’ll soon bring him round. Tryan has got his match. I’ve plenty of rods
8116: in pickle for Tryan.’
8117: 
8118: At this moment Boots entered the bar, and put a letter into the lawyer’s
8119: hands, saying, ‘There’s Trower’s man just come into the yard wi’ a gig,
8120: sir, an’ he’s brought this here letter.’
8121: 
8122: Mr. Dempster read the letter and said, ‘Tell him to turn the gig--I’ll
8123: be with him in a minute. Here, run to Gruby’s and get this snuff-box
8124: filled--quick!’
8125: 
8126: ‘Trower’s worse, I suppose; eh, Dempster? Wants you to alter his will,
8127: eh?’ said Mr. Pilgrim.
8128: 
8129: ‘Business--business--business--I don’t know exactly what,’ answered the
8130: cautious Dempster, rising deliberately from his chair, thrusting on his
8131: low-crowned hat, and walking with a slow but not unsteady step out of the
8132: bar.
8133: 
8134: ‘I never see Dempster’s equal; if I did I’ll be shot,’ said Mr.
8135: Tomlinson, looking after the lawyer admiringly. ‘Why, he’s drunk the best
8136: part of a bottle o’ brandy since here we’ve been sitting, and I’ll bet a
8137: guinea, when he’s got to Trower’s his head’ll be as clear as mine. He
8138: knows more about law when he’s drunk than all the rest on ’em when
8139: they’re sober.’
8140: 
8141: ‘Ay, and other things too, besides law,’ said Mr. Budd. ‘Did you notice
8142: how he took up Byles about the Presbyterians? Bless your heart, he knows
8143: everything, Dempster does. He studied very hard when he was a young man.’
8144: 
8145: 
8146: 
8147: 
8148: Chapter 2
8149: 
8150: 
8151: The conversation just recorded is not, I am aware, remarkably refined or
8152: witty; but if it had been, it could hardly have taken place in Milby when
8153: Mr. Dempster flourished there, and old Mr. Crewe, the curate, was yet
8154: alive.
8155: 
8156: More than a quarter of a century has slipped by since then, and in the
8157: interval Milby has advanced at as rapid a pace as other market-towns in
8158: her Majesty’s dominions. By this time it has a handsome railway station,
8159: where the drowsy London traveller may look out by the brilliant gas-light
8160: and see perfectly sober papas and husbands alighting with their
8161: leatherbags after transacting their day’s business at the county town.
8162: There is a resident rector, who appeals to the consciences of his hearers
8163: with all the immense advantages of a divine who keeps his own carriage;
8164: the church is enlarged by at least five hundred sittings; and the grammar
8165: school, conducted on reformed principles, has its upper forms crowded
8166: with the genteel youth of Milby. The gentlemen there fall into no other
8167: excess at dinner-parties than the perfectly well-bred and virtuous excess
8168: of stupidity; and though the ladies are still said sometimes to take too
8169: much upon themselves, they are never known to take too much in any other
8170: way. The conversation is sometimes quite literary, for there is a
8171: flourishing book-club, and many of the younger ladies have carried their
8172: studies so far as to have forgotten a little German. In short, Milby is
8173: now a refined, moral, and enlightened town; no more resembling the Milby
8174: of former days than the huge, long-skirted, drab greatcoat that
8175: embarrassed the ankles of our grandfathers resembled the light paletot in
8176: which we tread jauntily through the muddiest streets, or than the
8177: bottle-nosed Britons, rejoicing over a tankard, in the old sign of the
8178: Two Travellers at Milby, resembled the severe-looking gentleman in straps
8179: and high collars whom a modern artist has represented as sipping the
8180: imaginary port of that well-known commercial house.
8181: 
8182: But pray, reader, dismiss from your mind all the refined and fashionable
8183: ideas associated with this advanced state of things, and transport your
8184: imagination to a time when Milby had no gas-lights; when the mail drove
8185: up dusty or bespattered to the door of the Red Lion; when old Mr. Crewe,
8186: the curate, in a brown Brutus wig, delivered inaudible sermons on a
8187: Sunday, and on a week-day imparted the education of a gentleman--that is
8188: to say, an arduous inacquaintance with Latin through the medium of the
8189: Eton Grammar--to three pupils in the upper grammar-school.
8190: 
8191: If you had passed through Milby on the coach at that time, you would have
8192: had no idea what important people lived there, and how very high a sense
8193: of rank was prevalent among them. It was a dingy-looking town, with a
8194: strong smell of tanning up one street and a great shaking of hand-looms
8195: up another; and even in that focus of aristocracy, Friar’s Gate, the
8196: houses would not have seemed very imposing to the hasty and superficial
8197: glance of a passenger. You might still less have suspected that the
8198: figure in light fustian and large grey whiskers, leaning against the
8199: grocer’s door-post in High Street, was no less a person than Mr. Lowme,
8200: one of the most aristocratic men in Milby, said to have been ‘brought up
8201: a gentleman’, and to have had the gay habits accordant with that station,
8202: keeping his harriers and other expensive animals. He was now quite an
8203: elderly Lothario, reduced to the most economical sins; the prominent form
8204: of his gaiety being this of lounging at Mr. Gruby’s door, embarrassing
8205: the servant-maids who came for grocery, and talking scandal with the rare
8206: passers-by. Still, it was generally understood that Mr. Lowme belonged to
8207: the highest circle of Milby society; his sons and daughters held up their
8208: heads very high indeed; and in spite of his condescending way of chatting
8209: and drinking with inferior people, he would himself have scorned any
8210: closer identification with them. It must be admitted that he was of some
8211: service to the town in this station at Mr. Gruby’s door, for he and Mr.
8212: Landor’s Newfoundland dog, who stretched himself and gaped on the
8213: opposite causeway, took something from the lifeless air that belonged to
8214: the High Street on every day except Saturday.
8215: 
8216: Certainly, in spite of three assemblies and a charity ball in the winter,
8217: the occasional advent of a ventriloquist, or a company of itinerant
8218: players, some of whom were very highly thought of in London, and the
8219: annual three-days’ fair in June, Milby might be considered dull by people
8220: of a hypochondriacal temperament; and perhaps this was one reason why
8221: many of the middle-aged inhabitants, male and female, often found it
8222: impossible to keep up their spirits without a very abundant supply of
8223: stimulants. It is true there were several substantial men who had a
8224: reputation for exceptional sobriety, so that Milby habits were really not
8225: as bad as possible; and no one is warranted in saying that old Mr.
8226: Crewe’s flock could not have been worse without any clergyman at all.
8227: 
8228: The well-dressed parishioners generally were very regular church-goers,
8229: and to the younger ladies and gentlemen I am inclined to think that the
8230: Sunday morning service was the most exciting event of the week; for few
8231: places could present a more brilliant show of out-door toilettes than
8232: might be seen issuing from Milby church at one o’clock. There were the
8233: four tall Miss Pittmans, old lawyer Pittman’s daughters, with cannon
8234: curls surmounted by large hats, and long, drooping ostrich feathers of
8235: parrot green. There was Miss Phipps, with a crimson bonnet, very much
8236: tilted up behind, and a cockade of stiff feathers on the summit. There
8237: was Miss Landor, the belle of Milby, clad regally in purple and ermine,
8238: with a plume of feathers neither drooping nor erect, but maintaining a
8239: discreet medium. There were the three Miss Tomlinsons, who imitated Miss
8240: Landor, and also wore ermine and feathers; but their beauty was
8241: considered of a coarse order, and their square forms were quite unsuited
8242: to the round tippet which fell with such remarkable grace on Miss
8243: Landor’s sloping shoulders. Looking at this plumed procession of ladies,
8244: you would have formed rather a high idea of Milby wealth; yet there was
8245: only one close carriage in the place, and that was old Mr. Landor’s, the
8246: banker, who, I think, never drove more than one horse. These
8247: sumptuously-attired ladies flashed past the vulgar eye in one-horse
8248: chaises, by no means of a superior build.
8249: 
8250: The young gentlemen, too, were not without their little Sunday displays
8251: of costume, of a limited masculine kind. Mr. Eustace Landor, being nearly
8252: of age, had recently acquired a diamond ring, together with the habit of
8253: rubbing his hand through his hair. He was tall and dark, and thus had an
8254: advantage which Mr. Alfred Phipps, who, like his sister, was blond and
8255: stumpy, found it difficult to overtake, even by the severest attention to
8256: shirt-studs, and the particular shade of brown that was best relieved by
8257: gilt buttons.
8258: 
8259: The respect for the Sabbath, manifested in this attention to costume, was
8260: unhappily counterbalanced by considerable levity of behaviour during the
8261: prayers and sermon; for the young ladies and gentlemen of Milby were of a
8262: very satirical turn, Miss Landor especially being considered remarkably
8263: clever, and a terrible quiz; and the large congregation necessarily
8264: containing many persons inferior in dress and demeanour to the
8265: distinguished aristocratic minority, divine service offered irresistible
8266: temptations to joking, through the medium of telegraphic communications
8267: from the galleries to the aisles and back again. I remember blushing very
8268: much, and thinking Miss Landor was laughing at me, because I was
8269: appearing in coat-tails for the first time, when I saw her look down
8270: slyly towards where I sat, and then turn with a titter to handsome Mr.
8271: Bob Lowme, who had such beautiful whiskers meeting under his chin. But
8272: perhaps she was not thinking of me, after all; for our pew was near the
8273: pulpit, and there was almost always something funny about old Mr. Crewe.
8274: His brown wig was hardly ever put on quite right, and he had a way of
8275: raising his voice for three or four words, and lowering it again to a
8276: mumble, so that we could scarcely make out a word he said; though, as my
8277: mother observed, that was of no consequence in the prayers, since every
8278: one had a prayer-book; and as for the sermon, she continued with some
8279: causticity, we all of us heard more of it than we could remember when we
8280: got home.
8281: 
8282: This youthful generation was not particularly literary. The young ladies
8283: who frizzed their hair, and gathered it all into large barricades in
8284: front of their heads, leaving their occipital region exposed without
8285: ornament, as if that, being a back view, was of no consequence, dreamed
8286: as little that their daughters would read a selection of German poetry,
8287: and be able to express an admiration for Schiller, as that they would
8288: turn all their hair the other way--that instead of threatening us with
8289: barricades in front, they would be most killing in retreat,
8290: 
8291:      ‘And, like the Parthian, wound us as they fly.’
8292: 
8293: Those charming well-frizzed ladies spoke French indeed with considerable
8294: facility, unshackled by any timid regard to idiom, and were in the habit
8295: of conducting conversations in that language in the presence of their
8296: less instructed elders; for according to the standard of those backward
8297: days, their education had been very lavish, such young ladies as Miss
8298: Landor, Miss Phipps, and the Miss Pittmans, having been ‘finished’ at
8299: distant and expensive schools.
8300: 
8301: Old lawyer Pittman had once been a very important person indeed, having
8302: in his earlier days managed the affairs of several gentlemen in those
8303: parts, who had subsequently been obliged to sell everything and leave the
8304: country, in which crisis Mr. Pittman accommodatingly stepped in as a
8305: purchaser of their estates, taking on himself the risk and trouble of a
8306: more leisurely sale; which, however, happened to turn out very much to
8307: his advantage. Such opportunities occur quite unexpectedly in the way of
8308: business. But I think Mr. Pittman must have been unlucky in his later
8309: speculations, for now, in his old age, he had not the reputation of being
8310: very rich; and though he rode slowly to his office in Milby every morning
8311: on an old white hackney, he had to resign the chief profits, as well as
8312: the active business of the firm, to his younger partner, Dempster. No one
8313: in Milby considered old Pittman a virtuous man, and the elder townspeople
8314: were not at all backward in narrating the least advantageous portions of
8315: his biography in a very round unvarnished manner. Yet I could never
8316: observe that they trusted him any the less, or liked him any the worse.
8317: Indeed, Pittman and Dempster were the popular lawyers of Milby and its
8318: neighbourhood, and Mr. Benjamin Landor, whom no one had anything
8319: particular to say against, had a very meagre business in comparison.
8320: Hardly a landholder, hardly a farmer, hardly a parish within ten miles of
8321: Milby, whose affairs were not under the legal guardianship of Pittman and
8322: Dempster; and I think the clients were proud of their lawyers’
8323: unscrupulousness, as the patrons of the fancy’s are proud of their
8324: champion’s ‘condition’. It was not, to be sure, the thing for ordinary
8325: life, but it was the thing to be bet on in a lawyer. Dempster’s talent in
8326: ‘bringing through’ a client was a very common topic of conversation with
8327: the farmers, over an incidental glass of grog at the Red Lion. ‘He’s a
8328: long-headed feller, Dempster; why, it shows yer what a headpiece Dempster
8329: has, as he can drink a bottle o’ brandy at a sittin’, an’ yit see further
8330: through a stone wall when he’s done, than other folks ’ll see through a
8331: glass winder.’ Even Mr. Jerome, chief member of the congregation at Salem
8332: Chapel, an elderly man of very strict life, was one of Dempster’s
8333: clients, and had quite an exceptional indulgence for his attorney’s
8334: foibles, perhaps attributing them to the inevitable incompatibility of
8335: law and gospel.
8336: 
8337: The standard of morality at Milby, you perceive, was not inconveniently
8338: high in those good old times, and an ingenuous vice or two was what every
8339: man expected of his neighbour. Old Mr. Crewe, the curate, for example,
8340: was allowed to enjoy his avarice in comfort, without fear of sarcastic
8341: parish demagogues; and his flock liked him all the better for having
8342: scraped together a large fortune out of his school and curacy, and the
8343: proceeds of the three thousand pounds he had with his little deaf wife.
8344: It was clear he must be a learned man, for he had once had a large
8345: private school in connection with the grammar school, and had even
8346: numbered a young nobleman or two among his pupils. The fact that he read
8347: nothing at all now, and that his mind seemed absorbed in the commonest
8348: matters, was doubtless due to his having exhausted the resources of
8349: erudition earlier in life. It is true he was not spoken of in terms of
8350: high respect, and old Crewe’s stingy housekeeping was a frequent subject
8351: of jesting; but this was a good old-fashioned characteristic in a parson
8352: who had been part of Milby life for half a century: it was like the dents
8353: and disfigurements in an old family tankard, which no one would like to
8354: part with for a smart new piece of plate fresh from Birmingham. The
8355: parishioners saw no reason at all why it should be desirable to venerate
8356: the parson or any one else; they were much more comfortable to look down
8357: a little on their fellow-creatures.
8358: 
8359: Even the Dissent in Milby was then of a lax and indifferent kind. The
8360: doctrine of adult baptism, struggling under a heavy load of debt, had let
8361: off half its chapel area as a ribbon-shop; and Methodism was only to be
8362: detected, as you detect curious larvae, by diligent search in dirty
8363: corners. The Independents were the only Dissenters of whose existence
8364: Milby gentility was at all conscious, and it had a vague idea that the
8365: salient points of their creed were prayer without book, red brick, and
8366: hypocrisy. The Independent chapel, known as Salem, stood red and
8367: conspicuous in a broad street; more than one pew-holder kept a
8368: brass-bound gig; and Mr. Jerome, a retired corn-factor, and the most
8369: eminent member of the congregation, was one of the richest men in the
8370: parish. But in spite of this apparent prosperity, together with the usual
8371: amount of extemporaneous preaching mitigated by furtive notes, Salem
8372: belied its name, and was not always the abode of peace. For some reason
8373: or other, it was unfortunate in the choice of its ministers. The Rev. Mr.
8374: Horner, elected with brilliant hopes, was discovered to be given to
8375: tippling and quarrelling with his wife; the Rev. Mr. Rose’s doctrine was
8376: a little too ‘high’, verging on antinomianism; the Rev. Mr. Stickney’s
8377: gift as a preacher was found to be less striking on a more extended
8378: acquaintance; and the Rev. Mr. Smith, a distinguished minister much
8379: sought after in the iron districts, with a talent for poetry, became
8380: objectionable from an inclination to exchange verses with the young
8381: ladies of his congregation. It was reasonably argued that such verses as
8382: Mr. Smith’s must take a long time for their composition, and the habit
8383: alluded to might intrench seriously on his pastoral duties. These
8384: reverend gentlemen, one and all, gave it as their opinion that the Salem
8385: church members were among the least enlightened of the Lord’s people, and
8386: that Milby was a low place, where they would have found it a severe lot
8387: to have their lines fall for any long period; though to see the smart and
8388: crowded congregation assembled on occasion of the annual charity sermon,
8389: any one might have supposed that the minister of Salem had rather a
8390: brilliant position in the ranks of Dissent. Several Church families used
8391: to attend on that occasion, for Milby, in those uninstructed days, had
8392: not yet heard that the schismatic ministers of Salem were obviously
8393: typified by Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; and many Church people there were
8394: of opinion that Dissent might be a weakness, but, after all, had no great
8395: harm in it. These lax Episcopalians were, I believe, chiefly
8396: tradespeople, who held that, inasmuch as Congregationalism consumed
8397: candles, it ought to be supported, and accordingly made a point of
8398: presenting themselves at Salem for the afternoon charity sermon, with the
8399: expectation of being asked to hold a plate. Mr. Pilgrim, too, was always
8400: there with his half-sovereign; for as there was no Dissenting doctor in
8401: Milby, Mr. Pilgrim looked with great tolerance on all shades of religious
8402: opinion that did not include a belief in cures by miracle.
8403: 
8404: On this point he had the concurrence of Mr. Pratt, the only other medical
8405: man of the same standing in Milby. Otherwise, it was remarkable how
8406: strongly these two clever men were contrasted. Pratt was middle-sized,
8407: insinuating, and silvery-voiced; Pilgrim was tall, heavy, rough-mannered,
8408: and spluttering. Both were considered to have great powers of
8409: conversation, but Pratt’s anecdotes were of the fine old crusted quality
8410: to be procured only of Joe Miller; Pilgrim’s had the full fruity flavour
8411: of the most recent scandal. Pratt elegantly referred all diseases to
8412: debility, and, with a proper contempt for symptomatic treatment, went to
8413: the root of the matter with port wine and bark; Pilgrim was persuaded
8414: that the evil principle in the human system was plethora, and he made war
8415: against it with cupping, blistering, and cathartics. They had both been
8416: long established in Milby, and as each had a sufficient practice, there
8417: was no very malignant rivalry between them; on the contrary, they had
8418: that sort of friendly contempt for each other which is always conducive
8419: to a good understanding between professional men; and when any new
8420: surgeon attempted, in an ill-advised hour, to settle himself in the town,
8421: it was strikingly demonstrated how slight and trivial are theoretic
8422: differences compared with the broad basis of common human feeling. There
8423: was the most perfect unanimity between Pratt and Pilgrim in the
8424: determination to drive away the obnoxious and too probably unqualified
8425: intruder as soon as possible. Whether the first wonderful cure he
8426: effected was on a patient of Pratt’s or of Pilgrim’s, one was as ready as
8427: the other to pull the interloper by the nose, and both alike directed
8428: their remarkable powers of conversation towards making the town too hot
8429: for him. But by their respective patients these two distinguished men
8430: were pitted against each other with great virulence. Mrs. Lowme could not
8431: conceal her amazement that Mrs. Phipps should trust her life in the hands
8432: of Pratt, who let her feed herself up to that degree, it was really
8433: shocking to hear how short her breath was; and Mrs. Phipps had no
8434: patience with Mrs. Lowme, living, as she did, on tea and broth, and
8435: looking as yellow as any crow-flower, and yet letting Pilgrim bleed and
8436: blister her and give her lowering medicine till her clothes hung on her
8437: like a scarecrow’s. On the whole, perhaps, Mr. Pilgrim’s reputation was
8438: at the higher pitch, and when any lady under Mr. Pratt’s care was doing
8439: ill, she was half disposed to think that a little more ‘active treatment’
8440: might suit her better. But without very definite provocation no one would
8441: take so serious a step as to part with the family doctor, for in those
8442: remote days there were few varieties of human hatred more formidable than
8443: the medical. The doctor’s estimate, even of a confiding patient, was apt
8444: to rise and fall with the entries in the day-book; and I have known Mr.
8445: Pilgrim discover the most unexpected virtues in a patient seized with a
8446: promising illness. At such times you might have been glad to perceive
8447: that there were some of Mr. Pilgrim’s fellow-creatures of whom he
8448: entertained a high opinion, and that he was liable to the amiable
8449: weakness of a too admiring estimate. A good inflammation fired his
8450: enthusiasm, and a lingering dropsy dissolved him into charity. Doubtless
8451: this _crescendo_ of benevolence was partly due to feelings not at all
8452: represented by the entries in the day-book; for in Mr. Pilgrim’s heart,
8453: too, there was a latent store of tenderness and pity which flowed forth
8454: at the sight of suffering. Gradually, however, as his patients became
8455: convalescent, his view of their characters became more dispassionate;
8456: when they could relish mutton-chops, he began to admit that they had
8457: foibles, and by the time they had swallowed their last dose of tonic, he
8458: was alive to their most inexcusable faults. After this, the thermometer
8459: of his regard rested at the moderate point of friendly backbiting, which
8460: sufficed to make him agreeable in his morning visits to the amiable and
8461: worthy persons who were yet far from convalescent.
8462: 
8463: Pratt’s patients were profoundly uninteresting to Pilgrim: their very
8464: diseases were despicable, and he would hardly have thought their bodies
8465: worth dissecting. But of all Pratt’s patients, Mr. Jerome was the one on
8466: whom Mr. Pilgrim heaped the most unmitigated contempt. In spite of the
8467: surgeon’s wise tolerance, Dissent became odious to him in the person of
8468: Mr. Jerome. Perhaps it was because that old gentleman, being rich, and
8469: having very large yearly bills for medical attendance on himself and his
8470: wife, nevertheless employed Pratt--neglected all the advantages of
8471: ‘active treatment’, and paid away his money without getting his system
8472: lowered. On any other ground it is hard to explain a feeling of hostility
8473: to Mr. Jerome, who was an excellent old gentleman, expressing a great
8474: deal of goodwill towards his neighbours, not only in imperfect English,
8475: but in loans of money to the ostensibly rich, and in sacks of potatoes to
8476: the obviously poor.
8477: 
8478: Assuredly Milby had that salt of goodness which keeps the world together,
8479: in greater abundance than was visible on the surface: innocent babes were
8480: born there, sweetening their parents’ hearts with simple joys; men and
8481: women withering in disappointed worldliness, or bloated with sensual
8482: ease, had better moments in which they pressed the hand of suffering with
8483: sympathy, and were moved to deeds of neighbourly kindness. In church and
8484: in chapel there were honest-hearted worshippers who strove to keep a
8485: conscience void of offence; and even up the dimmest alleys you might have
8486: found here and there a Wesleyan to whom Methodism was the vehicle of
8487: peace on earth and goodwill to men. To a superficial glance, Milby was
8488: nothing but dreary prose: a dingy town, surrounded by flat fields, lopped
8489: elms, and sprawling manufacturing villages, which crept on and on with
8490: their weaving-shops, till they threatened to graft themselves on the
8491: town. But the sweet spring came to Milby notwithstanding: the elm-tops
8492: were red with buds; the churchyard was starred with daisies; the lark
8493: showered his love-music on the flat fields; the rainbows hung over the
8494: dingy town, clothing the very roofs and chimneys in a strange
8495: transfiguring beauty. And so it was with the human life there, which at
8496: first seemed a dismal mixture of griping worldliness, vanity, ostrich
8497: feathers, and the fumes of brandy: looking closer, you found some purity,
8498: gentleness, and unselfishness, as you may have observed a scented
8499: geranium giving forth its wholesome odours amidst blasphemy and gin in a
8500: noisy pot-house. Little deaf Mrs. Crewe would often carry half her own
8501: spare dinner to the sick and hungry; Miss Phipps, with her cockade of red
8502: feathers, had a filial heart, and lighted her father’s pipe with a
8503: pleasant smile; and there were grey-haired men in drab gaiters, not at
8504: all noticeable as you passed them in the street, whose integrity had been
8505: the basis of their rich neighbour’s wealth.
8506: 
8507: Such as the place was, the people there were entirely contented with it.
8508: They fancied life must be but a dull affair for that large portion of
8509: mankind who were necessarily shut out from an acquaintance with Milby
8510: families, and that it must be an advantage to London and Liverpool that
8511: Milby gentlemen occasionally visited those places on business. But the
8512: inhabitants became more intensely conscious of the value they set upon
8513: all their advantages, when innovation made its appearance in the person
8514: of the Rev. Mr. Tryan, the new curate, at the chapel-of-ease on Paddiford
8515: Common. It was soon notorious in Milby that Mr. Tryan held peculiar
8516: opinions; that he preached extempore; that he was founding a religious
8517: lending library in his remote corner of the parish; that he expounded the
8518: Scriptures in cottages; and that his preaching was attracting the
8519: Dissenters, and filling the very aisles of his church. The rumour sprang
8520: up that Evangelicalism had invaded Milby parish--a murrain or blight all
8521: the more terrible, because its nature was but dimly conjectured. Perhaps
8522: Milby was one of the last spots to be reached by the wave of a new
8523: movement and it was only now, when the tide was just on the turn, that
8524: the limpets there got a sprinkling. Mr. Tryan was the first Evangelical
8525: clergyman who had risen above the Milby horizon: hitherto that obnoxious
8526: adjective had been unknown to the townspeople of any gentility; and there
8527: were even many Dissenters who considered ‘evangelical’ simply a sort of
8528: baptismal name to the magazine which circulated among the congregation of
8529: Salem Chapel. But now, at length, the disease had been imported, when the
8530: parishioners were expecting it as little as the innocent Red Indians
8531: expected smallpox. As long as Mr. Tryan’s hearers were confined to
8532: Paddiford Common--which, by the by, was hardly recognizable as a common
8533: at all, but was a dismal district where you heard the rattle of the
8534: handloom, and breathed the smoke of coal-pits--the ‘canting parson’ could
8535: be treated as a joke. Not so when a number of single ladies in the town
8536: appeared to be infected, and even one or two men of substantial property,
8537: with old Mr. Landor, the banker, at their head, seemed to be ‘giving in’
8538: to the new movement--when Mr. Tryan was known to be well received in
8539: several good houses, where he was in the habit of finishing the evening
8540: with exhortation and prayer. Evangelicalism was no longer a nuisance
8541: existing merely in by-corners, which any well-clad person could avoid; it
8542: was invading the very drawing-rooms, mingling itself with the comfortable
8543: fumes of port-wine and brandy, threatening to deaden with its murky
8544: breath all the splendour of the ostrich feathers, and to stifle Milby
8545: ingenuousness, not pretending to be better than its neighbours, with a
8546: cloud of cant and lugubrious hypocrisy. The alarm reached its climax when
8547: it was reported that Mr. Tryan was endeavouring to obtain authority from
8548: Mr. Prendergast, the non-resident rector, to establish a Sunday evening
8549: lecture in the parish church, on the ground that old Mr. Crewe did not
8550: preach the Gospel.
8551: 
8552: It now first appeared how surprisingly high a value Milby in general set
8553: on the ministrations of Mr. Crewe; how convinced it was that Mr. Crewe
8554: was the model of a parish priest, and his sermons the soundest and most
8555: edifying that had ever remained unheard by a church-going population. All
8556: allusions to his brown wig were suppressed, and by a rhetorical figure
8557: his name was associated with venerable grey hairs; the attempted
8558: intrusion of Mr. Tryan was an insult to a man deep in years and learning;
8559: moreover, it was an insolent effort to thrust himself forward in a parish
8560: where he was clearly distasteful to the superior portion of its
8561: inhabitants. The town was divided into two zealous parties, the Tryanites
8562: and anti-Tryanites; and by the exertions of the eloquent Dempster, the
8563: anti-Tryanite virulence was soon developed into an organized opposition.
8564: A protest against the meditated evening lecture was framed by that
8565: orthodox attorney, and, after being numerously signed, was to be carried
8566: to Mr. Prendergast by three delegates representing the intellect,
8567: morality, and wealth of Milby. The intellect, you perceive, was to be
8568: personified in Mr. Dempster, the morality in Mr. Budd, and the wealth in
8569: Mr. Tomlinson; and the distinguished triad was to set out on its great
8570: mission, as we have seen, on the third day from that warm Saturday
8571: evening when the conversation recorded in the previous chapter took place
8572: in the bar of the Red Lion.
8573: 
8574: 
8575: 
8576: 
8577: Chapter 3
8578: 
8579: 
8580: It was quite as warm on the following Thursday evening, when Mr. Dempster
8581: and his colleagues were to return from their mission to Elmstoke Rectory;
8582: but it was much pleasanter in Mrs. Linnet’s parlour than in the bar of
8583: the Red Lion. Through the open window came the scent of mignonette and
8584: honeysuckle; the grass-plot in front of the house was shaded by a little
8585: plantation of Gueldres roses, syringas, and laburnums; the noise of looms
8586: and carts and unmelodious voices reached the ear simply as an agreeable
8587: murmur, for Mrs. Linnet’s house was situated quite on the outskirts of
8588: Paddiford Common; and the only sound likely to disturb the serenity of
8589: the feminine party assembled there, was the occasional buzz of intrusive
8590: wasps, apparently mistaking each lady’s head for a sugar-basin. No
8591: sugar-basin was visible in Mrs. Linnet’s parlour, for the time of tea was
8592: not yet, and the round table was littered with books which the ladies
8593: were covering with black canvass as a reinforcement of the new Paddiford
8594: Lending Library. Miss Linnet, whose manuscript was the neatest type of
8595: zigzag, was seated at a small table apart, writing on green paper
8596: tickets, which were to be pasted on the covers. Miss Linnet had other
8597: accomplishments besides that of a neat manuscript, and an index to some
8598: of them might be found in the ornaments of the room. She had always
8599: combined a love of serious and poetical reading with her skill in
8600: fancy-work, and the neatly-bound copies of Dryden’s ‘Virgil,’ Hannah
8601: More’s ‘Sacred Dramas,’ Falconer’s ‘Shipwreck,’ Mason ‘On
8602: Self-Knowledge,’ ‘Rasselas,’ and Burke ‘On the Sublime and Beautiful,’
8603: which were the chief ornaments of the bookcase, were all inscribed with
8604: her name, and had been bought with her pocket-money when she was in her
8605: teens. It must have been at least fifteen years since the latest of those
8606: purchases, but Miss Linnet’s skill in fancy-work appeared to have gone
8607: through more numerous phases than her literary taste; for the japanned
8608: boxes, the alum and sealing-wax baskets, the fan-dolls, the ‘transferred’
8609: landscapes on the fire-screens, and the recent bouquets of wax-flowers,
8610: showed a disparity in freshness which made them referable to widely
8611: different periods. Wax-flowers presuppose delicate fingers and robust
8612: patience, but there are still many points of mind and person which they
8613: leave vague and problematic; so I must tell you that Miss Linnet had dark
8614: ringlets, a sallow complexion, and an amiable disposition. As to her
8615: features, there was not much to criticize in them, for she had little
8616: nose, less lip, and no eyebrow; and as to her intellect, her friend Mrs.
8617: Pettifer often said: ‘She didn’t know a more sensible person to talk to
8618: than Mary Linnet. There was no one she liked better to come and take a
8619: quiet cup of tea with her, and read a little of Klopstock’s ‘Messiah.’
8620: Mary Linnet had often told her a great deal of her mind when they were
8621: sitting together: she said there were many things to bear in every
8622: condition of life, and nothing should induce her to marry without a
8623: prospect of happiness. Once, when Mrs. Pettifer admired her wax-flowers,
8624: she said, “Ah, Mrs. Pettifer, think of the beauties of nature!” She
8625: always spoke very prettily, did Mary Linnet; very different, indeed, from
8626: Rebecca.’
8627: 
8628: Miss Rebecca Linnet, indeed, was not a general favourite. While most
8629: people thought it a pity that a sensible woman like Mary had not found a
8630: good husband--and even her female friends said nothing more ill-natured
8631: of her, than that her face was like a piece of putty with two Scotch
8632: pebbles stuck in it--Rebecca was always spoken of sarcastically, and it
8633: was a customary kind of banter with young ladies to recommend her as a
8634: wife to any gentleman they happened to be flirting with--her fat, her
8635: finery, and her thick ankles sufficing to give piquancy to the joke,
8636: notwithstanding the absence of novelty. Miss Rebecca, however, possessed
8637: the accomplishment of music, and her singing of ‘Oh no, we never mention
8638: her’, and ‘The Soldier’s Tear’, was so desirable an accession to the
8639: pleasures of a tea-party that no one cared to offend her, especially as
8640: Rebecca had a high spirit of her own, and in spite of her expansively
8641: rounded contour, had a particularly sharp tongue. Her reading had been
8642: more extensive than her sister’s, embracing most of the fiction in Mr.
8643: Procter’s circulating library, and nothing but an acquaintance with the
8644: course of her studies could afford a clue to the rapid transitions in her
8645: dress, which were suggested by the style of beauty, whether sentimental,
8646: sprightly, or severe, possessed by the heroine of the three volumes
8647: actually in perusal. A piece of lace, which drooped round the edge of her
8648: white bonnet one week, had been rejected by the next; and her cheeks,
8649: which, on Whitsunday, loomed through a Turnerian haze of network, were,
8650: on Trinity Sunday, seen reposing in distinct red outline on her shelving
8651: bust, like the sun on a fog-bank. The black velvet, meeting with a
8652: crystal clasp, which one evening encircled her head, had on another
8653: descended to her neck, and on a third to her waist, suggesting to an
8654: active imagination either a magical contraction of the ornament, or a
8655: fearful ratio of expansion in Miss Rebecca’s person. With this constant
8656: application of art to dress, she could have had little time for
8657: fancy-work, even if she had not been destitute of her sister’s taste for
8658: that delightful and truly feminine occupation. And here, at least, you
8659: perceive the justice of the Milby opinion as to the relative suitability
8660: of the two Miss Linnets for matrimony. When a man is happy enough to win
8661: the affections of a sweet girl, who can soothe his cares with _crochet_,
8662: and respond to all his most cherished ideas with beaded urn-rugs and
8663: chair-covers in German wool, he has, at least, a guarantee of domestic
8664: comfort, whatever trials may await him out of doors. What a resource it
8665: is under fatigue and irritation to have your drawing-room well supplied
8666: with small mats, which would always be ready if you ever wanted to set
8667: anything on them! And what styptic for a bleeding heart can equal copious
8668: squares of _crochet_, which are useful for slipping down the moment you
8669: touch them? How our fathers managed without _crochet_ is the wonder; but
8670: I believe some small and feeble substitute existed in their time under
8671: the name of ‘tatting’. Rebecca Linnet, however, had neglected tatting as
8672: well as other forms of fancy-work. At school, to be sure, she had spent a
8673: great deal of time in acquiring flower-painting, according to the
8674: ingenious method then fashionable, of applying the shapes of leaves and
8675: flowers cut out in cardboard, and scrubbing a brush over the surface thus
8676: conveniently marked out; but even the spill-cases and hand-screens which
8677: were her last half-year’s performances in that way were not considered
8678: eminently successful, and had long been consigned to the retirement of
8679: the best bedroom. Thus there was a good deal of family unlikeness between
8680: Rebecca and her sister, and I am afraid there was also a little family
8681: dislike; but Mary’s disapproval had usually been kept imprisoned behind
8682: her thin lips, for Rebecca was not only of a headstrong disposition, but
8683: was her mother’s pet; the old lady being herself stout, and preferring a
8684: more showy style of cap than she could prevail on her daughter Mary to
8685: make up for her.
8686: 
8687: But I have been describing Miss Rebecca as she was in former days only,
8688: for her appearance this evening, as she sits pasting on the green
8689: tickets, is in striking contrast with what it was three or four months
8690: ago. Her plain grey gingham dress and plain white collar could never have
8691: belonged to her wardrobe before that date; and though she is not reduced
8692: in size, and her brown hair will do nothing but hang in crisp ringlets
8693: down her large cheeks, there is a change in her air and expression which
8694: seems to shed a softened light over her person, and make her look like a
8695: peony in the shade, instead of the same flower flaunting in a parterre in
8696: the hot sunlight.
8697: 
8698: No one could deny that Evangelicalism had wrought a change for the better
8699: in Rebecca Linnet’s person--not even Miss Pratt, the thin stiff lady in
8700: spectacles, seated opposite to her, who always had a peculiar repulsion
8701: for ‘females with a gross habit of body’. Miss Pratt was an old maid; but
8702: that is a no more definite description than if I had said she was in the
8703: autumn of life. Was it autumn when the orchards are fragrant with apples,
8704: or autumn when the oaks are brown, or autumn when the last yellow leaves
8705: are fluttering in the chill breeze? The young ladies in Milby would have
8706: told you that the Miss Linnets were old maids; but the Miss Linnets were
8707: to Miss Pratt what the apple-scented September is to the bare, nipping
8708: days of late November. The Miss Linnets were in that temperate zone of
8709: old-maidism, when a woman will not say but that if a man of suitable
8710: years and character were to offer himself, she might be induced to tread
8711: the remainder of life’s vale in company with him; Miss Pratt was in that
8712: arctic region where a woman is confident that at no time of life would
8713: she have consented to give up her liberty, and that she has never seen
8714: the man whom she would engage to honour and obey. If the Miss Linnets
8715: were old maids, they were old maids with natural ringlets and embonpoint,
8716: not to say obesity; Miss Pratt was an old maid with a cap, a braided
8717: ‘front’, a backbone and appendages. Miss Pratt was the one blue-stocking
8718: of Milby, possessing, she said, no less than five hundred volumes,
8719: competent, as her brother the doctor often observed, to conduct a
8720: conversation on any topic whatever, and occasionally dabbling a little in
8721: authorship, though it was understood that she had never put forth the
8722: full powers of her mind in print. Her ‘Letters to a Young Man on his
8723: Entrance into Life’, and ‘De Courcy, or the Rash Promise, a Tale for
8724: Youth’, were mere trifles which she had been induced to publish because
8725: they were calculated for popular utility, but they were nothing to what
8726: she had for years had by her in manuscript. Her latest production had
8727: been Six Stanzas, addressed to the Rev. Edgar Tryan, printed on glazed
8728: paper with a neat border, and beginning, ‘Forward, young wrestler for the
8729: truth!’
8730: 
8731: Miss Pratt having kept her brother’s house during his long widowhood, his
8732: daughter, Miss Eliza, had had the advantage of being educated by her
8733: aunt, and thus of imbibing a very strong antipathy to all that remarkable
8734: woman’s tastes and opinions. The silent handsome girl of two-and-twenty,
8735: who is covering the ‘Memoirs of Felix Neff,’ is Miss Eliza Pratt; and the
8736: small elderly lady in dowdy clothing, who is also working diligently, is
8737: Mrs. Pettifer, a superior-minded widow, much valued in Milby, being such
8738: a very respectable person to have in the house in case of illness, and of
8739: quite too good a family to receive any money-payment--you could always
8740: send her garden-stuff that would make her ample amends. Miss Pratt has
8741: enough to do in commenting on the heap of volumes before her, feeling it
8742: a responsibility entailed on her by her great powers of mind to leave
8743: nothing without the advantage of her opinion. Whatever was good must be
8744: sprinkled with the chrism of her approval; whatever was evil must be
8745: blighted by her condemnation.
8746: 
8747: ‘Upon my word,’ she said, in a deliberate high voice, as if she were
8748: dictating to an amanuensis, ‘it is a most admirable selection of works
8749: for popular reading, this that our excellent Mr. Tryan has made. I do not
8750: know whether, if the task had been confided to me, I could have made a
8751: selection, combining in a higher degree religious instruction and
8752: edification with a due admixture of the purer species of amusement. This
8753: story of ‘Father Clement’ is a library in itself on the errors of
8754: Romanism. I have ever considered fiction a suitable form for conveying
8755: moral and religious instruction, as I have shown in my little work ‘De
8756: Courcy,’ which, as a very clever writer in the Crompton ‘Argus’ said at
8757: the time of its appearance, is the light vehicle of a weighty moral.’
8758: 
8759: ‘One ’ud think,’ said Mrs. Linnet, who also had her spectacles on, but
8760: chiefly for the purpose of seeing what the others were doing, ‘there
8761: didn’t want much to drive people away from a religion as makes ’em walk
8762: barefoot over stone floors, like that girl in Father Clement--sending the
8763: blood up to the head frightful. Anybody might see that was an unnat’ral
8764: creed.’
8765: 
8766: ‘Yes,’ said Miss Pratt, ‘but asceticism is not the root of the error, as
8767: Mr. Tryan was telling us the other evening--it is the denial of the great
8768: doctrine of justification by faith. Much as I had reflected on all
8769: subjects in the course of my life, I am indebted to Mr. Tryan for opening
8770: my eyes to the full importance of that cardinal doctrine of the
8771: Reformation. From a child I had a deep sense of religion, but in my early
8772: days the Gospel light was obscured in the English Church, notwithstanding
8773: the possession of our incomparable Liturgy, than which I know no human
8774: composition more faultless and sublime. As I tell Eliza I was not blest
8775: as she is at the age of two-and-twenty, in knowing a clergyman who unites
8776: all that is great and admirable in intellect with the highest spiritual
8777: gifts. I am no contemptible judge of a man’s acquirements, and I assure
8778: you I have tested Mr. Tryan’s by questions which are a pretty severe
8779: touchstone. It is true, I sometimes carry him a little beyond the depth
8780: of the other listeners. Profound learning,’ continued Miss Pratt,
8781: shutting her spectacles, and tapping them on the book before her, ‘has
8782: not many to estimate it in Milby.’
8783: 
8784: ‘Miss Pratt,’ said Rebecca, ‘will you please give me Scott’s “Force of
8785: Truth?” There--that small book lying against the “Life of Legh
8786: Richmond.”’
8787: 
8788: ‘That’s a book I’m very fond of--the “Life of Legh Richmond,”’ said Mrs.
8789: Linnet. ‘He found out all about that woman at Tutbury as pretended to
8790: live without eating. Stuff and nonsense!’
8791: 
8792: Mrs. Linnet had become a reader of religious books since Mr. Tryan’s
8793: advent, and as she was in the habit of confining her perusal to the
8794: purely secular portions, which bore a very small proportion to the whole,
8795: she could make rapid progress through a large number of volumes. On
8796: taking up the biography of a celebrated preacher, she immediately turned
8797: to the end to see what disease he died of; and if his legs swelled, as
8798: her own occasionally did, she felt a stronger interest in ascertaining
8799: any earlier facts in the history of the dropsical divine--whether he had
8800: ever fallen off a stage coach, whether he had married more than one wife,
8801: and, in general, any adventures or repartees recorded of him previous to
8802: the epoch of his conversion. She then glanced over the letters and diary,
8803: and wherever there was a predominance of Zion, the River of Life, and
8804: notes of exclamation, she turned over to the next page; but any passage
8805: in which she saw such promising nouns as ‘small-pox’, ‘pony’, or ‘boots
8806: and shoes’, at once arrested her.
8807: 
8808: ‘It is half-past six now,’ said Miss Linnet, looking at her watch as the
8809: servant appeared with the tea-tray. ‘I suppose the delegates are come
8810: back by this time. If Mr. Tryan had not so kindly promised to call and
8811: let us know, I should hardly rest without walking to Milby myself to know
8812: what answer they have brought back. It is a great privilege for us, Mr.
8813: Tryan living at Mrs. Wagstaff’s, for he is often able to take us on his
8814: way backwards and forwards into the town.’
8815: 
8816: ‘I wonder if there’s another man in the world who has been brought up as
8817: Mr. Tryan has, that would choose to live in those small close rooms on
8818: the common, among heaps of dirty cottages, for the sake of being near the
8819: poor people,’ said Mrs. Pettifer. ‘I’m afraid he hurts his health by it;
8820: he looks to me far from strong.’
8821: 
8822: ‘Ah,’ said Miss Pratt, ‘I understand he is of a highly respectable family
8823: indeed, in Huntingdonshire. I heard him myself speak of his father’s
8824: carriage--quite incidentally, you know--and Eliza tells me what very fine
8825: cambric handkerchiefs he uses. My eyes are not good enough to see such
8826: things, but I know what breeding is as well as most people, and it is
8827: easy to see that Mr. Tryan is quite _comme il faw_, to use a French
8828: expression.’
8829: 
8830: ‘I should like to tell him better nor use fine cambric i’ this place,
8831: where there’s such washing, it’s a shame to be seen,’ said Mrs. Linnet;
8832: ‘he’ll get ’em tore to pieces. Good lawn ’ud be far better. I saw what a
8833: colour his linen looked at the sacrament last Sunday. Mary’s making him a
8834: black silk case to hold his bands, but I told her she’d more need wash
8835: ’em for him.’
8836: 
8837: ‘O mother!’ said Rebecca, with solemn severity, ‘pray don’t think of
8838: pocket-handkerchiefs and linen, when we are talking of such a man. And at
8839: this moment, too, when he is perhaps having to bear a heavy blow. We have
8840: more need to help him by prayer, as Aaron and Hur held up the hands of
8841: Moses. We don’t know but wickedness may have triumphed, and Mr.
8842: Prendergast may have consented to forbid the lecture. There have been
8843: dispensations quite as mysterious, and Satan is evidently putting forth
8844: all his strength to resist the entrance of the Gospel into Milby Church.’
8845: 
8846: ‘You niver spoke a truer word than that, my dear,’ said Mrs. Linnet, who
8847: accepted all religious phrases, but was extremely rationalistic in her
8848: interpretation; ‘for if iver Old Harry appeared in a human form, it’s
8849: that Dempster. It was all through him as we got cheated out o’ Pye’s
8850: Croft, making out as the title wasn’t good. Such lawyer’s villany! As if
8851: paying good money wasn’t title enough to anything. If your father as is
8852: dead and gone had been worthy to know it! But he’ll have a fall some day,
8853: Dempster will. Mark my words.’
8854: 
8855: ‘Ah, out of his carriage, you mean,’ said Miss Pratt, who, in the
8856: movement occasioned by the clearing of the table, had lost the first part
8857: of Mrs. Linnet’s speech. ‘It certainly is alarming to see him driving
8858: home from Rotherby, flogging his galloping horse like a madman. My
8859: brother has often said he expected every Thursday evening to be called in
8860: to set some of Dempster’s bones; but I suppose he may drop that
8861: expectation now, for we are given to understand from good authority that
8862: he has forbidden his wife to call my brother in again either to herself
8863: or her mother. He swears no Tryanite doctor shall attend his family. I
8864: have reason to believe that Pilgrim was called in to Mrs. Dempster’s
8865: mother the other day.’
8866: 
8867: ‘Poor Mrs. Raynor! she’s glad to do anything for the sake of peace and
8868: quietness,’ said Mrs. Pettifer; ‘but it’s no trifle at her time of life
8869: to part with a doctor who knows her constitution.’
8870: 
8871: ‘What trouble that poor woman has to bear in her old age!’ said Mary
8872: Linnet, ‘to see her daughter leading such a life!--an only daughter, too,
8873: that she doats on.’
8874: 
8875: ‘Yes, indeed,’ said Miss Pratt. ‘We, of course, know more about it than
8876: most people, my brother having attended the family so many years. For my
8877: part, I never thought well of the marriage; and I endeavoured to dissuade
8878: my brother when Mrs. Raynor asked him to give Janet away at the wedding.
8879: ‘If you will take my advice, Richard,’ I said, ‘you will have nothing to
8880: do with that marriage.’ And he has seen the justice of my opinion since.
8881: Mrs. Raynor herself was against the connection at first; but she always
8882: spoiled Janet, and I fear, too, she was won over by a foolish pride in
8883: having her daughter marry a professional man. I fear it was so. No one
8884: but myself, I think, foresaw the extent of the evil.’
8885: 
8886: ‘Well,’ said Mrs. Pettifer, ‘Janet had nothing to look forward to but
8887: being a governess; and it was hard for Mrs. Raynor to have to work at
8888: millinering--a woman well brought up, and her husband a man who held his
8889: head as high as any man in Thurston. And it isn’t everybody that sees
8890: everything fifteen years beforehand. Robert Dempster was the cleverest
8891: man in Milby; and there weren’t many young men fit to talk to Janet.’
8892: 
8893: ‘It is a thousand pities,’ said Miss Pratt, choosing to ignore Mrs.
8894: Pettifer’s slight sarcasm, ‘for I certainly did consider Janet Raynor the
8895: most promising young woman of my acquaintance;--a little too much lifted
8896: up, perhaps, by her superior education, and too much given to satire, but
8897: able to express herself very well indeed about any book I recommended to
8898: her perusal. There is no young woman in Milby now who can be compared
8899: with what Janet was when she was married, either in mind or person. I
8900: consider Miss Landor far, far below her. Indeed, I cannot say much for
8901: the mental superiority of the young ladies in our first families. They
8902: are superficial--very superficial.’
8903: 
8904: ‘She made the handsomest bride that ever came out of Milby church, too,’
8905: said Mrs. Pettifer. ‘Such a very fine figure! And it showed off her white
8906: poplin so well. And what a pretty smile Janet always had! Poor thing, she
8907: keeps that now for all her old friends. I never see her but she has
8908: something pretty to say to me--living in the same street, you know, I
8909: can’t help seeing her often, though I’ve never been to the house since
8910: Dempster broke out on me in one of his drunken fits. She comes to me
8911: sometimes, poor thing, looking so strange, anybody passing her in the
8912: street may see plain enough what’s the matter; but she’s always got some
8913: little good-natured plan in her head for all that. Only last night I met
8914: her, I saw five yards off she wasn’t fit to be out; but she had a basin
8915: in her hand, full of something she was carrying to Sally Martin, the
8916: deformed girl that’s in a consumption.’
8917: 
8918: ‘But she is just as bitter against Mr. Tryan as her husband is, I
8919: understand,’ said Rebecca. ‘Her heart is very much set against the truth,
8920: for I understand she bought Mr. Tryan’s sermons on purpose to ridicule
8921: them to Mrs. Crewe.’
8922: 
8923: ‘Well, poor thing,’ said Mrs. Pettifer, ‘you know she stands up for
8924: everything her husband says and does. She never will admit to anybody
8925: that he is not a good husband.’
8926: 
8927: ‘That is her pride,’ said Miss Pratt. ‘She married him in opposition to
8928: the advice of her best friends, and now she is not willing to admit that
8929: she was wrong. Why, even to my brother--and a medical attendant, you
8930: know, can hardly fail to be acquainted with family secrets--she has
8931: always pretended to have the highest respect for her husband’s qualities.
8932: Poor Mrs. Raynor, however, is very well aware that every one knows the
8933: real state of things. Latterly, she has not even avoided the subject with
8934: me. The very last time I called on her she said, “Have you been to see my
8935: poor daughter?” and burst into tears.’
8936: 
8937: ‘Pride or no pride,’ said Mrs. Pettifer, ‘I shall always stand up for
8938: Janet Dempster. She sat up with me night after night when I had that
8939: attack of rheumatic fever six years ago. There’s great excuses for her.
8940: When a woman can’t think of her husband coming home without trembling,
8941: it’s enough to make her drink something to blunt her feelings--and no
8942: children either, to keep her from it. You and me might do the same, if we
8943: were in her place.’
8944: 
8945: ‘Speak for yourself, Mrs. Pettifer,’ said Miss Pratt. ‘Under no
8946: circumstances can I imagine myself resorting to a practice so degrading.
8947: A woman should find support in her own strength of mind.’
8948: 
8949: ‘I think,’ said Rebecca, who considered Miss Pratt still very blind in
8950: spiritual things, notwithstanding her assumption of enlightenment, ‘she
8951: will find poor support if she trusts only to her own strength. She must
8952: seek aid elsewhere than in herself.’
8953: 
8954: Happily the removal of the tea-things just then created a little
8955: confusion, which aided Miss Pratt to repress her resentment at
8956: Rebecca’s presumption in correcting her--a person like Rebecca Linnet!
8957: who six months ago was as flighty and vain a woman as Miss Pratt had
8958: ever known--so very unconscious of her unfortunate person!
8959: 
8960: The ladies had scarcely been seated at their work another hour, when the
8961: sun was sinking, and the clouds that flecked the sky to the very zenith
8962: were every moment taking on a brighter gold. The gate of the little
8963: garden opened, and Miss Linnet, seated at her small table near the
8964: window, saw Mr. Tryan enter.
8965: 
8966: ‘There is Mr. Tryan,’ she said, and her pale cheek was lighted up with a
8967: little blush that would have made her look more attractive to almost any
8968: one except Miss Eliza Pratt, whose fine grey eyes allowed few things to
8969: escape her silent observation. ‘Mary Linnet gets more and more in love
8970: with Mr. Tryan,’ thought Miss Eliza; ‘it is really pitiable to see such
8971: feelings in a woman of her age, with those old-maidish little ringlets. I
8972: daresay she flatters herself Mr. Tryan may fall in love with her, because
8973: he makes her useful among the poor.’ At the same time, Miss Eliza, as she
8974: bent her handsome head and large cannon curls with apparent calmness over
8975: her work, felt a considerable internal flutter when she heard the knock
8976: at the door. Rebecca had less self-command. She felt too much agitated to
8977: go on with her pasting, and clutched the leg of the table to counteract
8978: the trembling in her hands.
8979: 
8980: Poor women’s hearts! Heaven forbid that I should laugh at you, and make
8981: cheap jests on your susceptibility towards the clerical sex, as if it had
8982: nothing deeper or more lovely in it than the mere vulgar angling for a
8983: husband. Even in these enlightened days, many a curate who, considered
8984: abstractedly, is nothing more than a sleek bimanous animal in a white
8985: neckcloth, with views more or less Anglican, and furtively addicted to
8986: the flute, is adored by a girl who has coarse brothers, or by a solitary
8987: woman who would like to be a helpmate in good works beyond her own means,
8988: simply because he seems to them the model of refinement and of public
8989: usefulness. What wonder, then, that in Milby society, such as I have told
8990: you it was a very long while ago, a zealous evangelical clergyman, aged
8991: thirty-three, called forth all the little agitations that belong to the
8992: divine necessity of loving, implanted in the Miss Linnets, with their
8993: seven or eight lustrums and their unfashionable ringlets, no less than in
8994: Miss Eliza Pratt, with her youthful bloom and her ample cannon curls.
8995: 
8996: But Mr. Tryan has entered the room, and the strange light from the golden
8997: sky falling on his light-brown hair, which is brushed high up round his
8998: head, makes it look almost like an aureole. His grey eyes, too, shine
8999: with unwonted brilliancy this evening. They were not remarkable eyes, but
9000: they accorded completely in their changing light with the changing
9001: expression of his person, which indicated the paradoxical character often
9002: observable in a large-limbed sanguine blond; at once mild and irritable,
9003: gentle and overbearing, indolent and resolute, self-conscious and dreamy.
9004: Except that the well-filled lips had something of the artificially
9005: compressed look which is often the sign of a struggle to keep the dragon
9006: undermost, and that the complexion was rather pallid, giving the idea of
9007: imperfect health, Mr. Tryan’s face in repose was that of an ordinary
9008: whiskerless blond, and it seemed difficult to refer a certain air of
9009: distinction about him to anything in particular, unless it were his
9010: delicate hands and well-shapen feet.
9011: 
9012: It was a great anomaly to the Milby mind that a canting evangelical
9013: parson, who would take tea with tradespeople, and make friends of vulgar
9014: women like the Linnets, should have so much the air of a gentleman, and
9015: be so little like the splay-footed Mr. Stickney of Salem, to whom he
9016: approximated so closely in doctrine. And this want of correspondence
9017: between the physique and the creed had excited no less surprise in the
9018: larger town of Laxeter, where Mr. Tryan had formerly held a curacy; for
9019: of the two other Low Church clergymen in the neighbourhood, one was a
9020: Welshman of globose figure and unctuous complexion, and the other a man
9021: of atrabiliar aspect, with lank black hair, and a redundance of limp
9022: cravat--in fact, the sort of thing you might expect in men who
9023: distributed the publications of the Religious Tract Society, and
9024: introduced Dissenting hymns into the Church.
9025: 
9026: Mr. Tryan shook hands with Mrs. Linnet, bowed with rather a preoccupied
9027: air to the other ladies, and seated himself in the large horse-hair
9028: easy-chair which had been drawn forward for him, while the ladies ceased
9029: from their work, and fixed their eyes on him, awaiting the news he had
9030: to tell them.
9031: 
9032: ‘It seems,’ he began, in a low and silvery tone, ‘I need a lesson of
9033: patience; there has been something wrong in my thought or action about
9034: this evening lecture. I have been too much bent on doing good to Milby
9035: after my own plan--too reliant on my own wisdom.’
9036: 
9037: Mr. Tryan paused. He was struggling against inward irritation.
9038: 
9039: ‘The delegates are come back, then?’ ‘Has Mr. Prendergast given way?’
9040: ‘Has Dempster succeeded?’--were the eager questions of three ladies at
9041: once.
9042: 
9043: ‘Yes; the town is in an uproar. As we were sitting in Mr. Landor’s
9044: drawing-room we heard a loud cheering, and presently Mr. Thrupp, the
9045: clerk at the bank, who had been waiting at the Red Lion to hear the
9046: result, came to let us know. He said Dempster had been making a speech to
9047: the mob out the window. They were distributing drink to the people, and
9048: hoisting placards in great letters,--“Down with the Tryanites!” “Down
9049: with cant!” They had a hideous caricature of me being tripped-up and
9050: pitched head-foremost out of the pulpit. Good old Mr. Landor would insist
9051: on sending me round in the carriage; he thought I should not be safe from
9052: the mob; but I got down at the Crossways. The row was evidently
9053: preconcerted by Dempster before he set out. He made sure of succeeding.’
9054: 
9055: Mr. Tryan’s utterance had been getting rather louder and more rapid in
9056: the course of this speech, and he now added, in the energetic
9057: chest-voice, which, both in and out of the pulpit, alternated
9058: continually with his more silvery notes,--‘But his triumph will be a
9059: short one. If he thinks he can intimidate me by obloquy or threats, he
9060: has mistaken the man he has to deal with. Mr. Dempster and his
9061: colleagues will find themselves checkmated after all. Mr. Prendergast
9062: has been false to his own conscience in this business. He knows as well
9063: as I do that he is throwing away the souls of the people by leaving
9064: things as they are in the parish. But I shall appeal to the Bishop--I am
9065: confident of his sympathy.’
9066: 
9067: ‘The Bishop will be coming shortly, I suppose,’ said Miss Pratt, ‘to hold
9068: a confirmation?’
9069: 
9070: ‘Yes; but I shall write to him at once, and lay the case before him.
9071: Indeed, I must hurry away now, for I have many matters to attend to. You,
9072: ladies, have been kindly helping me with your labours, I see,’ continued
9073: Mr. Tryan, politely, glancing at the canvass-covered books as he rose
9074: from his seat. Then, turning to Mary Linnet: ‘Our library is really
9075: getting on, I think. You and your sister have quite a heavy task of
9076: distribution now.’
9077: 
9078: Poor Rebecca felt it very hard to bear that Mr. Tryan did not turn
9079: towards her too. If he knew how much she entered into his feelings about
9080: the lecture, and the interest she took in the library. Well! perhaps it
9081: was her lot to be overlooked--and it might be a token of mercy. Even a
9082: good man might not always know the heart that was most with him. But the
9083: next moment poor Mary had a pang, when Mr. Tryan turned to Miss Eliza
9084: Pratt, and the preoccupied expression of his face melted into that
9085: beaming timidity with which a man almost always addresses a pretty woman.
9086: 
9087: ‘I have to thank you, too, Miss Eliza, for seconding me so well in your
9088: visits to Joseph Mercer. The old man tells me how precious he finds your
9089: reading to him, now he is no longer able to go to church.’
9090: 
9091: Miss Eliza only answered by a blush, which made her look all the
9092: handsomer, but her aunt said,--‘Yes, Mr. Tryan, I have ever inculcated on
9093: my dear Eliza the importance of spending her leisure in being useful to
9094: her fellow-creatures. Your example and instruction have been quite in the
9095: spirit of the system which I have always pursued, though we are indebted
9096: to you for a clearer view of the motives that should actuate us in our
9097: pursuit of good works. Not that I can accuse myself of having ever had a
9098: self-righteous spirit, but my humility was rather instinctive than based
9099: on a firm ground of doctrinal knowledge, such as you so admirably impart
9100: to us.’
9101: 
9102: Mrs. Linnet’s usual entreaty that Mr. Tryan would ‘have something--some
9103: wine and water and a biscuit’, was just here a welcome relief from the
9104: necessity of answering Miss Pratt’s oration.
9105: 
9106: ‘Not anything, my dear Mrs. Linnet, thank you. You forget what a
9107: Rechabite I am. By the by, when I went this morning to see a poor girl in
9108: Butcher’s Lane, whom I had heard of as being in a consumption, I found
9109: Mrs. Dempster there. I had often met her in the street, but did not know
9110: it was Mrs. Dempster. It seems she goes among the poor a good deal. She
9111: is really an interesting-looking woman. I was quite surprised, for I have
9112: heard the worst account of her habits--that she is almost as bad as her
9113: husband. She went out hastily as soon as I entered. But’ (apologetically)
9114: ‘I am keeping you all standing, and I must really hurry away. Mrs.
9115: Pettifer, I have not had the pleasure of calling on you for some time; I
9116: shall take an early opportunity of going your way. Good evening, good
9117: evening.’
9118: 
9119: 
9120: 
9121: 
9122: Chapter 4
9123: 
9124: 
9125: Mr. Tryan was right in saying that the ‘row’ in Milby had been
9126: preconcerted by Dempster. The placards and the caricature were prepared
9127: before the departure of the delegates; and it had been settled that Mat
9128: Paine, Dempster’s clerk, should ride out on Thursday morning to meet them
9129: at Whitlow, the last place where they would change horses, that he might
9130: gallop back and prepare an ovation for the triumvirate in case of their
9131: success. Dempster had determined to dine at Whitlow: so that Mat Paine
9132: was in Milby again two hours before the entrance of the delegates, and
9133: had time to send a whisper up the back streets that there was promise of
9134: a ‘spree’ in the Bridge Way, as well as to assemble two knots of picked
9135: men--one to feed the flame of orthodox zeal with gin-and-water, at the
9136: Green Man, near High Street; the other to solidify their church
9137: principles with heady beer at the Bear and Ragged Staff in the Bridge
9138: Way.
9139: 
9140: The Bridge Way was an irregular straggling street, where the town fringed
9141: off raggedly into the Whitlow road: rows of new red-brick houses, in
9142: which ribbon-looms were rattling behind long lines of window, alternating
9143: with old, half-thatched, half-tiled cottages--one of those dismal wide
9144: streets where dirt and misery have no long shadows thrown on them to
9145: soften their ugliness. Here, about half-past five o’clock, Silly Caleb,
9146: an idiot well known in Dog Lane, but more of a stranger in the Bridge
9147: Way, was seen slouching along with a string of boys hooting at his heels;
9148: presently another group, for the most part out at elbows, came briskly in
9149: the same direction, looking round them with an air of expectation; and at
9150: no long interval, Deb Traunter, in a pink flounced gown and floating
9151: ribbons, was observed talking with great affability to two men in
9152: seal-skin caps and fustian, who formed her cortege. The Bridge Way began
9153: to have a presentiment of something in the wind. Phib Cook left her
9154: evening wash-tub and appeared at her door in soap-suds, a bonnet-poke,
9155: and general dampness; three narrow-chested ribbon-weavers, in rusty black
9156: streaked with shreds of many-coloured silk, sauntered out with their
9157: hands in their pockets; and Molly Beale, a brawny old virago, descrying
9158: wiry Dame Ricketts peeping out from her entry, seized the opportunity of
9159: renewing the morning’s skirmish. In short, the Bridge Way was in that
9160: state of excitement which is understood to announce a ‘demonstration’ on
9161: the part of the British public; and the afflux of remote townsmen
9162: increasing, there was soon so large a crowd that it was time for Bill
9163: Powers, a plethoric Goliath, who presided over the knot of beer-drinkers
9164: at the Bear and Ragged Staff, to issue forth with his companions, and,
9165: like the enunciator of the ancient myth, make the assemblage distinctly
9166: conscious of the common sentiment that had drawn them together. The
9167: expectation of the delegates’ chaise, added to the fight between Molly
9168: Beale and Dame Ricketts, and the ill-advised appearance of a lean
9169: bull-terrier, were a sufficient safety-valve to the popular excitement
9170: during the remaining quarter of an hour; at the end of which the chaise
9171: was seen approaching along the Whitlow road, with oak boughs ornamenting
9172: the horses’ heads; and, to quote the account of this interesting scene
9173: which was sent to the _Rotherby Guardian_, ‘loud cheers immediately
9174: testified to the sympathy of the honest fellows collected there, with the
9175: public-spirited exertions of their fellow-townsmen.’ Bill Powers, whose
9176: bloodshot eyes, bent hat, and protuberant altitude, marked him out as the
9177: natural leader of the assemblage, undertook to interpret the common
9178: sentiment by stopping the chaise, advancing to the door with raised hat,
9179: and begging to know of Mr. Dempster, whether the Rector had forbidden the
9180: ‘canting lecture’.
9181: 
9182: ‘Yes, yes,’ said Mr. Dempster. ‘Keep up a jolly good hurray.’
9183: 
9184: No public duty could have been more easy and agreeable to Mr. Powers and
9185: his associates, and the chorus swelled all the way to the High Street,
9186: where, by a mysterious coincidence often observable in these spontaneous
9187: ‘demonstrations’, large placards on long poles were observed to shoot
9188: upwards from among the crowd, principally in the direction of Tucker’s
9189: Lane, where the Green Man was situated. One bore, ‘Down with the
9190: Tryanites!’ another, ‘No Cant!’ another, ‘Long live our venerable
9191: Curate!’ and one in still larger letters, ‘Sound Church Principles and no
9192: Hypocrisy!’ But a still more remarkable impromptu was a huge caricature
9193: of Mr. Tryan in gown and band, with an enormous aureole of yellow hair
9194: and upturned eyes, standing on the pulpit stairs and trying to pull down
9195: old Mr. Crewe. Groans, yells, and hisses--hisses, yells, and groans--only
9196: stemmed by the appearance of another caricature representing Mr. Tryan
9197: being pitched head-foremost from the pulpit stairs by a hand which the
9198: artist, either from subtilty of intention or want of space, had left
9199: unindicated. In the midst of the tremendous cheering that saluted this
9200: piece of symbolical art, the chaise had reached the door of the Red Lion,
9201: and loud cries of ‘Dempster for ever!’ with a feebler cheer now and then
9202: for Tomlinson and Budd, were presently responded to by the appearance of
9203: the public-spirited attorney at the large upper window, where also were
9204: visible a little in the background the small sleek head of Mr. Budd, and
9205: the blinking countenance of Mr. Tomlinson.
9206: 
9207: Mr. Dempster held his hat in his hand, and poked his head forward with a
9208: butting motion by way of bow. A storm of cheers subsided at last into
9209: dropping sounds of ‘Silence!’ ‘Hear him!’ ‘Go it, Dempster!’ and the
9210: lawyer’s rasping voice became distinctly audible.
9211: 
9212: ‘Fellow-townsmen! It gives us the sincerest pleasure--I speak for my
9213: respected colleagues as well as myself--to witness these strong proofs of
9214: your attachment to the principles of our excellent Church, and your zeal
9215: for the honour of our venerable pastor. But it is no more than I expected
9216: of you. I know you well. I’ve known you for the last twenty years to be
9217: as honest and respectable a set of ratepayers as any in this county. Your
9218: hearts are sound to the core! No man had better try to thrust his cant
9219: and hypocrisy down _your_ throats. You’re used to wash them with liquor
9220: of a better flavour. This is the proudest moment in my own life, and I
9221: think I may say in that of my colleagues, in which I have to tell you
9222: that our exertions in the cause of sound religion and manly morality have
9223: been crowned with success. Yes, my fellow-townsmen! I have the
9224: gratification of announcing to you thus formally what you have already
9225: learned indirectly. The pulpit from which our venerable pastor has fed us
9226: with sound doctrine for half a century is not to be invaded by a
9227: fanatical, sectarian, double-faced, Jesuitical interloper! We are not to
9228: have our young people demoralized and corrupted by the temptations to
9229: vice, notoriously connected with Sunday evening lectures! We are not to
9230: have a preacher obtruding himself upon us, who decries good works, and
9231: sneaks into our homes perverting the faith of our wives and daughters! We
9232: are not to be poisoned with doctrines which damp every innocent
9233: enjoyment, and pick a poor man’s pocket of the sixpence with which he
9234: might buy himself a cheerful glass after a hard day’s work, under
9235: pretence of paying for bibles to send to the Chicktaws!
9236: 
9237: ‘But I’m not going to waste your valuable time with unnecessary words. I
9238: am a man of deeds’ (‘Ay, damn you, that you are, and you charge well for
9239: ’em too,’ said a voice from the crowd, probably that of a gentleman who
9240: was immediately afterwards observed with his hat crushed over his head.)
9241: ‘I shall always be at the service of my fellow-townsmen, and whoever
9242: dares to hector over you, or interfere with your innocent pleasures,
9243: shall have an account to settle with Robert Dempster.
9244: 
9245: ‘Now, my boys! you can’t do better than disperse and carry the good news
9246: to all your fellow-townsmen, whose hearts are as sound as your own. Let
9247: some of you go one way and some another, that every man, woman, and child
9248: in Milby may know what you know yourselves. But before we part, let us
9249: have three cheers for True Religion, and down with Cant!’
9250: 
9251: When the last cheer was dying, Mr. Dempster closed the window, and the
9252: judiciously-instructed placards and caricatures moved off in divers
9253: directions, followed by larger or smaller divisions of the crowd. The
9254: greatest attraction apparently lay in the direction of Dog Lane, the
9255: outlet towards Paddiford Common, whither the caricatures were moving; and
9256: you foresee, of course, that those works of symbolical art were consumed
9257: with a liberal expenditure of dry gorse-bushes and vague shouting.
9258: 
9259: After these great public exertions, it was natural that Mr. Dempster and
9260: his colleagues should feel more in need than usual of a little social
9261: relaxation; and a party of their friends was already beginning to
9262: assemble in the large parlour of the Red Lion, convened partly by their
9263: own curiosity, and partly by the invaluable Mat Paine. The most capacious
9264: punch-bowl was put in requisition; and that born gentleman, Mr. Lowme,
9265: seated opposite Mr. Dempster as ‘Vice’, undertook to brew the punch,
9266: defying the criticisms of the envious men out of office, who with the
9267: readiness of irresponsibility, ignorantly suggested more lemons. The
9268: social festivities were continued till long past midnight, when several
9269: friends of sound religion were conveyed home with some difficulty, one of
9270: them showing a dogged determination to seat himself in the gutter.
9271: 
9272: Mr. Dempster had done as much justice to the punch as any of the party;
9273: and his friend Boots, though aware that the lawyer could ‘carry his
9274: liquor like Old Nick’, with whose social demeanour Boots seemed to be
9275: particularly well acquainted, nevertheless thought it might be as well to
9276: see so good a customer in safety to his own door, and walked quietly
9277: behind his elbow out of the inn-yard. Dempster, however, soon became
9278: aware of him, stopped short, and, turning slowly round upon him,
9279: recognized the well-known drab waistcoat sleeves, conspicuous enough in
9280: the starlight.
9281: 
9282: ‘You twopenny scoundrel! What do you mean by dogging a professional man’s
9283: footsteps in this way? I’ll break every bone in your skin if you attempt
9284: to track me, like a beastly cur sniffing at one’s pocket. Do you think a
9285: gentleman will make his way home any the better for having the scent of
9286: your blacking-bottle thrust up his nostrils?’
9287: 
9288: Boots slunk back, in more amusement than ill-humour, thinking the
9289: lawyer’s ‘rum talk’ was doubtless part and parcel of his professional
9290: ability; and Mr. Dempster pursued his slow way alone.
9291: 
9292: His house lay in Orchard Street, which opened on the prettiest outskirt
9293: of the town--the church, the parsonage, and a long stretch of green
9294: fields. It was an old-fashioned house, with an overhanging upper storey;
9295: outside, it had a face of rough stucco, and casement windows with green
9296: frames and shutters; inside, it was full of long passages, and rooms with
9297: low ceilings. There was a large heavy knocker on the green door, and
9298: though Mr. Dempster carried a latch-key, he sometimes chose to use the
9299: knocker. He chose to do so now. The thunder resounded through Orchard
9300: Street, and, after a single minute, there was a second clap louder than
9301: the first. Another minute, and still the door was not opened; whereupon
9302: Mr. Dempster, muttering, took out his latch-key, and, with less
9303: difficulty than might have been expected, thrust it into the door. When
9304: he opened the door the passage was dark.
9305: 
9306: ‘Janet!’ in the loudest rasping tone, was the next sound that rang
9307: through the house.
9308: 
9309: ‘Janet!’ again--before a slow step was heard on the stairs, and a distant
9310: light began to flicker on the wall of the passage.
9311: 
9312: ‘Curse you! you creeping idiot! Come faster, can’t you?’
9313: 
9314: Yet a few seconds, and the figure of a tall woman, holding aslant a
9315: heavy-plated drawing-room candlestick, appeared at the turning of the
9316: passage that led to the broader entrance.
9317: 
9318: She had on a light dress which sat loosely about her figure, but did not
9319: disguise its liberal, graceful outline. A heavy mass of straight
9320: jet-black hair had escaped from its fastening, and hung over her
9321: shoulders. Her grandly-cut features, pale with the natural paleness of a
9322: brunette, had premature lines about them, telling that the years had been
9323: lengthened by sorrow, and the delicately-curved nostril, which seemed
9324: made to quiver with the proud consciousness of power and beauty, must
9325: have quivered to the heart-piercing griefs which had given that worn look
9326: to the corners of the mouth. Her wide open black eyes had a strangely
9327: fixed, sightless gaze, as she paused at the turning, and stood silent
9328: before her husband.
9329: 
9330: ‘I’ll teach you to keep me waiting in the dark, you pale staring fool!’
9331: he said, advancing with his slow drunken step. ‘What, you’ve been
9332: drinking again, have you? I’ll beat you into your senses.’
9333: 
9334: He laid his hand with a firm grip on her shoulder, turned her round, and
9335: pushed her slowly before him along the passage and through the
9336: dining-room door, which stood open on their left hand.
9337: 
9338: There was a portrait of Janet’s mother, a grey-haired, dark-eyed old
9339: woman, in a neatly fluted cap, hanging over the mantelpiece. Surely the
9340: aged eyes take on a look of anguish as they see Janet--not trembling,
9341: no! it would be better if she trembled--standing stupidly unmoved in
9342: her great beauty while the heavy arm is lifted to strike her. The blow
9343: falls--another--and another. Surely the mother hears that cry--‘O
9344: Robert! pity! pity!’
9345: 
9346: Poor grey-haired woman! Was it for this you suffered a mother’s pangs in
9347: your lone widowhood five-and-thirty years ago? Was it for this you kept
9348: the little worn morocco shoes Janet had first run in, and kissed them day
9349: by day when she was away from you, a tall girl at school? Was it for this
9350: you looked proudly at her when she came back to you in her rich pale
9351: beauty, like a tall white arum that has just unfolded its grand pure
9352: curves to the sun?
9353: 
9354: The mother lies sleepless and praying in her lonely house, weeping the
9355: difficult tears of age, because she dreads this may be a cruel night for
9356: her child.
9357: 
9358: She too has a picture over her mantelpiece, drawn in chalk by Janet long
9359: years ago. She looked at it before she went to bed. It is a head bowed
9360: beneath a cross, and wearing a crown of thorns.

9363: 
9364: 
9365: Chapter 5
9366: 
9367: 
9368: It was half-past nine o’clock in the morning. The midsummer sun was
9369: already warm on the roofs and weathercocks of Milby. The church-bells
9370: were ringing, and many families were conscious of Sunday sensations,
9371: chiefly referable to the fact that the daughters had come down to
9372: breakfast in their best frocks, and with their hair particularly well
9373: dressed. For it was not Sunday, but Wednesday; and though the Bishop was
9374: going to hold a Confirmation, and to decide whether or not there should
9375: be a Sunday evening lecture in Milby, the sunbeams had the usual
9376: working-day look to the haymakers already long out in the fields, and to
9377: laggard weavers just ‘setting up’ their week’s ‘piece’. The notion of its
9378: being Sunday was the strongest in young ladies like Miss Phipps, who was
9379: going to accompany her younger sister to the confirmation, and to wear a
9380: ‘sweetly pretty’ transparent bonnet with marabout feathers on the
9381: interesting occasion, thus throwing into relief the suitable simplicity
9382: of her sister’s attire, who was, of course, to appear in a new white
9383: frock; or in the pupils at Miss Townley’s, who were absolved from all
9384: lessons, and were going to church to see the Bishop, and to hear the
9385: Honourable and Reverend Mr. Prendergast, the rector, read prayers--a high
9386: intellectual treat, as Miss Townley assured them. It seemed only natural
9387: that a rector, who was honourable, should read better than old Mr. Crewe,
9388: who was only a curate, and not honourable; and when little Clara Robins
9389: wondered why some clergymen were rectors and others not, Ellen Marriott
9390: assured her with great confidence that it was only the clever men who
9391: were made rectors. Ellen Marriott was going to be confirmed. She was a
9392: short, fair, plump girl, with blue eyes and sandy hair, which was this
9393: morning arranged in taller cannon curls than usual, for the reception of
9394: the Episcopal benediction, and some of the young ladies thought her the
9395: prettiest girl in the school; but others gave the preference to her
9396: rival, Maria Gardner, who was much taller, and had a lovely ‘crop’ of
9397: dark-brown ringlets, and who, being also about to take upon herself the
9398: vows made in her name at her baptism, had oiled and twisted her ringlets
9399: with especial care. As she seated herself at the breakfast-table before
9400: Miss Townley’s entrance to dispense the weak coffee, her crop excited so
9401: strong a sensation that Ellen Marriott was at length impelled to look at
9402: it, and to say with suppressed but bitter sarcasm, ‘Is that Miss
9403: Gardner’s head?’ ‘Yes,’ said Maria, amiable and stuttering, and no match
9404: for Ellen in retort; ‘th--th--this is my head.’ ‘Then I don’t admire it
9405: at all!’ was the crushing rejoinder of Ellen, followed by a murmur of
9406: approval among her friends. Young ladies, I suppose, exhaust their sac of
9407: venom in this way at school. That is the reason why they have such a
9408: harmless tooth for each other in after life.
9409: 
9410: The only other candidate for confirmation at Miss Townley’s was Mary
9411: Dunn, a draper’s daughter in Milby and a distant relation of the Miss
9412: Linnets. Her pale lanky hair could never be coaxed into permanent curl,
9413: and this morning the heat had brought it down to its natural condition of
9414: lankiness earlier than usual. But that was not what made her sit
9415: melancholy and apart at the lower end of the form. Her parents were
9416: admirers of Mr. Tryan, and had been persuaded, by the Miss Linnets’
9417: influence, to insist that their daughter should be prepared for
9418: confirmation by him, over and above the preparation given to Miss
9419: Townley’s pupils by Mr. Crewe. Poor Mary Dunn! I am afraid she thought it
9420: too heavy a price to pay for these spiritual advantages, to be excluded
9421: from every game at ball to be obliged to walk with none but little
9422: girls--in fact, to be the object of an aversion that nothing short of an
9423: incessant supply of plumcakes would have neutralized. And Mrs. Dunn was
9424: of opinion that plumcake was unwholesome. The anti-Tryanite spirit, you
9425: perceive, was very strong at Miss Townley’s, imported probably by day
9426: scholars, as well as encouraged by the fact that that clever woman was
9427: herself strongly opposed to innovation, and remarked every Sunday that
9428: Mr. Crewe had preached an ‘excellent discourse’. Poor Mary Dunn dreaded
9429: the moment when school-hours would be over, for then she was sure to be
9430: the butt of those very explicit remarks which, in young ladies’ as well
9431: as young gentlemen’s seminaries, constitute the most subtle and delicate
9432: form of the innuendo. ‘I’d never be a Tryanite, would you?’ ‘O here comes
9433: the lady that knows so much more about religion than we do!’ ‘Some people
9434: think themselves so very pious!’
9435: 
9436: It is really surprising that young ladies should not be thought competent
9437: to the same curriculum as young gentlemen. I observe that their powers of
9438: sarcasm are quite equal; and if there had been a genteel academy for
9439: young gentlemen at Milby, I am inclined to think that, notwithstanding
9440: Euclid and the classics, the party spirit there would not have exhibited
9441: itself in more pungent irony, or more incisive satire, than was heard in
9442: Miss Townley’s seminary. But there was no such academy, the existence of
9443: the grammar-school under Mr. Crewe’s superintendence probably
9444: discouraging speculations of that kind; and the genteel youths of Milby
9445: were chiefly come home for the midsummer holidays from distant schools.
9446: Several of us had just assumed coat-tails, and the assumption of new
9447: responsibilities apparently following as a matter of course, we were
9448: among the candidates for confirmation. I wish I could say that the
9449: solemnity of our feelings was on a level with the solemnity of the
9450: occasion; but unimaginative boys find it difficult to recognize
9451: apostolical institutions in their developed form, and I fear our chief
9452: emotion concerning the ceremony was a sense of sheepishness, and our
9453: chief opinion, the speculative and heretical position, that it ought to
9454: be confined to the girls. It was a pity, you will say; but it is the way
9455: with us men in other crises, that come a long while after confirmation.
9456: The golden moments in the stream of life rush past us, and we see nothing
9457: but sand; the angels come to visit us, and we only know them when they
9458: are gone.
9459: 
9460: But, as I said, the morning was sunny, the bells were ringing, the ladies
9461: of Milby were dressed in their Sunday garments.
9462: 
9463: And who is this bright-looking woman walking with hasty step along
9464: Orchard Street so early, with a large nosegay in her hand? Can it be
9465: Janet Dempster, on whom we looked with such deep pity, one sad midnight,
9466: hardly a fortnight ago? Yes; no other woman in Milby has those searching
9467: black eyes, that tall graceful unconstrained figure, set off by her
9468: simple muslin dress and black lace shawl, that massy black hair now so
9469: neatly braided in glossy contrast with the white satin ribbons of her
9470: modest cap and bonnet. No other woman has that sweet speaking smile, with
9471: which she nods to Jonathan Lamb, the old parish clerk. And, ah!--now she
9472: comes nearer--there are those sad lines about the mouth and eyes on which
9473: that sweet smile plays like sunbeams on the storm-beaten beauty of the
9474: full and ripened corn.
9475: 
9476: She is turning out of Orchard Street, and making her way as fast as she
9477: can to her mother’s house, a pleasant cottage facing a roadside meadow,
9478: from which the hay is being carried. Mrs. Raynor has had her breakfast,
9479: and is seated in her arm-chair reading, when Janet opens the door,
9480: saying, in her most playful voice,--‘Please, mother, I’m come to show
9481: myself to you before I go to the Parsonage. Have I put on my pretty cap
9482: and bonnet to satisfy you?’
9483: 
9484: Mrs. Raynor looked over her spectacles, and met her daughter’s glance
9485: with eyes as dark and loving as her own. She was a much smaller woman
9486: than Janet, both in figure and feature, the chief resemblance lying in
9487: the eyes and the clear brunette complexion. The mother’s hair had long
9488: been grey, and was gathered under the neatest of caps, made by her own
9489: clever fingers, as all Janet’s caps and bonnets were too. They were
9490: well-practised fingers, for Mrs. Raynor had supported herself in her
9491: widowhood by keeping a millinery establishment, and in this way had
9492: earned money enough to give her daughter what was then thought a
9493: first-rate education, as well as to save a sum which, eked out by her
9494: son-in-law, sufficed to support her in her solitary old age. Always the
9495: same clean, neat old lady, dressed in black silk, was Mrs. Raynor: a
9496: patient, brave woman, who bowed with resignation under the burden of
9497: remembered sorrow, and bore with meek fortitude the new load that the new
9498: days brought with them.
9499: 
9500: ‘Your bonnet wants pulling a trifle forwarder, my child,’ she said,
9501: smiling, and taking off her spectacles, while Janet at once knelt down
9502: before her, and waited to be ‘set to rights’, as she would have done when
9503: she was a child. ‘You’re going straight to Mrs. Crewe’s, I suppose? Are
9504: those flowers to garnish the dishes?’
9505: 
9506: ‘No, indeed, mother. This is a nosegay for the middle of the table. I’ve
9507: sent up the dinner-service and the ham we had cooked at our house
9508: yesterday, and Betty is coming directly with the garnish and the plate.
9509: We shall get our good Mrs. Crewe through her troubles famously. Dear tiny
9510: woman! You should have seen her lift up her hands yesterday, and pray
9511: heaven to take her before ever she should have another collation to get
9512: ready for the Bishop. She said, “It’s bad enough to have the Archdeacon,
9513: though he doesn’t want half so many jelly-glasses. I wouldn’t mind,
9514: Janet, if it was to feed all the old hungry cripples in Milby; but so
9515: much trouble and expense for people who eat too much every day of their
9516: lives!” We had such a cleaning and furbishing-up of the sitting-room
9517: yesterday! Nothing will ever do away with the smell of Mr. Crewe’s pipes,
9518: you know; but we have thrown it into the background, with yellow soap and
9519: dry lavender. And now I must run away. You will come to church, mother?’
9520: 
9521: ‘Yes, my dear, I wouldn’t lose such a pretty sight. It does my old eyes
9522: good to see so many fresh young faces. Is your husband going?’
9523: 
9524: ‘Yes, Robert will be there. I’ve made him as neat as a new pin this
9525: morning, and he says the Bishop will think him too buckish by half. I
9526: took him into Mammy Dempster’s room to show himself. We hear Tryan is
9527: making sure of the Bishop’s support; but we shall see. I would give my
9528: crooked guinea, and all the luck it will ever bring me, to have him
9529: beaten, for I can’t endure the sight of the man coming to harass dear old
9530: Mr. and Mrs. Crewe in their last days. Preaching the Gospel indeed! That
9531: is the best Gospel that makes everybody happy and comfortable, isn’t it,
9532: mother?’
9533: 
9534: ‘Ah, child, I’m afraid there’s no Gospel will do that here below.’
9535: 
9536: ‘Well, I can do something to comfort Mrs. Crewe, at least; so give me a
9537: kiss, and good-bye till church-time.’
9538: 
9539: The mother leaned back in her chair when Janet was gone, and sank into a
9540: painful reverie. When our life is a continuous trial, the moments of
9541: respite seem only to substitute the heaviness of dread for the heaviness
9542: of actual suffering: the curtain of cloud seems parted an instant only
9543: that we may measure all its horror as it hangs low, black, and imminent,
9544: in contrast with the transient brightness; the water drops that visit the
9545: parched lips in the desert bear with them only the keen imagination of
9546: thirst. Janet looked glad and tender now--but what scene of misery was
9547: coming next? She was too like the cistus flowers in the little garden
9548: before the window, that, with the shades of evening, might lie with the
9549: delicate white and glossy dark of their petals trampled in the roadside
9550: dust. When the sun had sunk, and the twilight was deepening, Janet might
9551: be sitting there, heated, maddened, sobbing out her griefs with selfish
9552: passion, and wildly wishing herself dead.
9553: 
9554: Mrs. Raynor had been reading about the lost sheep, and the joy there is
9555: in heaven over the sinner that repenteth. Surely the eternal love she
9556: believed in through all the sadness of her lot, would not leave her child
9557: to wander farther and farther into the wilderness till there was no
9558: turning--the child so lovely, so pitiful to others, so good, till she was
9559: goaded into sin by woman’s bitterest sorrows! Mrs. Raynor had her faith
9560: and her spiritual comforts, though she was not in the least evangelical
9561: and knew nothing of doctrinal zeal. I fear most of Mr. Tryan’s hearers
9562: would have considered her destitute of saving knowledge, and I am quite
9563: sure she had no well-defined views on justification. Nevertheless, she
9564: read her Bible a great deal, and thought she found divine lessons
9565: there--how to bear the cross meekly, and be merciful. Let us hope that
9566: there is a saving ignorance, and that Mrs. Raynor was justified without
9567: knowing exactly how.
9568: 
9569: She tried to have hope and trust, though it was hard to believe that the
9570: future would be anything else than the harvest of the seed that was being
9571: sown before her eyes. But always there is seed being sown silently and
9572: unseen, and everywhere there come sweet flowers without our foresight or
9573: labour. We reap what we sow, but Nature has love over and above that
9574: justice, and gives us shadow and blossom and fruit that spring from no
9575: planting of ours.
9576: 
9577: 
9578: 
9579: 
9580: Chapter 6
9581: 
9582: 
9583: Most people must have agreed with Mrs. Raynor that the Confirmation that
9584: day was a pretty sight, at least when those slight girlish forms and fair
9585: young faces moved in a white rivulet along the aisles, and flowed into
9586: kneeling semicircles under the light of the great chancel window,
9587: softened by patches of dark old painted glass; and one would think that
9588: to look on while a pair of venerable hands pressed such young heads, and
9589: a venerable face looked upward for a blessing on them, would be very
9590: likely to make the heart swell gently, and to moisten the eyes. Yet I
9591: remember the eyes seemed very dry in Milby Church that day,
9592: notwithstanding that the Bishop was an old man, and probably venerable
9593: (for though he was not an eminent Grecian, he was the brother of a Whig
9594: lord); and I think the eyes must have remained dry, because he had small
9595: delicate womanish hands adorned with ruffles, and, instead of laying them
9596: on the girls’ heads, just let them hover over each in quick succession,
9597: as if it were not etiquette to touch them, and as if the laying on of
9598: hands were like the theatrical embrace--part of the play, and not to be
9599: really believed in. To be sure there were a great many heads, and the
9600: Bishop’s time was limited. Moreover, a wig can, under no circumstances,
9601: be affecting, except in rare cases of illusion; and copious lawn-sleeves
9602: cannot be expected to go directly to any heart except a washerwoman’s.
9603: 
9604: I know, Ned Phipps, who knelt against me, and I am sure made me behave
9605: much worse than I should have done without him, whispered that he thought
9606: the Bishop was a ‘guy’, and I certainly remember thinking that Mr.
9607: Prendergast looked much more dignified with his plain white surplice and
9608: black hair. He was a tall commanding man, and read the Liturgy in a
9609: strikingly sonorous and uniform voice, which I tried to imitate the next
9610: Sunday at home, until my little sister began to cry, and said I was
9611: ‘yoaring at her’.
9612: 
9613: Mr. Tryan sat in a pew near the pulpit with several other clergymen. He
9614: looked pale, and rubbed his hand over his face and pushed back his hair
9615: oftener than usual. Standing in the aisle close to him, and repeating the
9616: responses with edifying loudness, was Mr. Budd, churchwarden and
9617: delegate, with a white staff in his hand and a backward bend of his small
9618: head and person, such as, I suppose, he considered suitable to a friend
9619: of sound religion. Conspicuous in the gallery, too, was the tall figure
9620: of Mr. Dempster, whose professional avocations rarely allowed him to
9621: occupy his place at church.
9622: 
9623: ‘There’s Dempster,’ said Mrs. Linnet to her daughter Mary, ‘looking more
9624: respectable than usual, I declare. He’s got a fine speech by heart to
9625: make to the Bishop, I’ll answer for it. But he’ll be pretty well
9626: sprinkled with snuff before service is over, and the Bishop won’t be able
9627: to listen to him for sneezing, that’s one comfort.’
9628: 
9629: At length the last stage in the long ceremony was over, the large
9630: assembly streamed warm and weary into the open afternoon sunshine, and
9631: the Bishop retired to the Parsonage, where, after honouring Mrs. Crewe’s
9632: collation, he was to give audience to the delegates and Mr. Tryan on the
9633: great question of the evening lecture.
9634: 
9635: Between five and six o’clock the Parsonage was once more as quiet as
9636: usual under the shadow of its tall elms, and the only traces of the
9637: Bishop’s recent presence there were the wheel marks on the gravel, and
9638: the long table with its garnished dishes awry, its damask sprinkled with
9639: crumbs, and its decanters without their stoppers. Mr. Crewe was already
9640: calmly smoking his pipe in the opposite sitting-room, and Janet was
9641: agreeing with Mrs. Crewe that some of the blanc-mange would be a nice
9642: thing to take to Sally Martin, while the little old lady herself had a
9643: spoon in her hand ready to gather the crumbs into a plate, that she might
9644: scatter them on the gravel for the little birds.
9645: 
9646: Before that time, the Bishop’s carriage had been seen driving through the
9647: High Street on its way to Lord Trufford’s, where he was to dine. The
9648: question of the lecture was decided, then?
9649: 
9650: The nature of the decision may be gathered from the following
9651: conversation which took place in the bar of the Red Lion that evening.
9652: 
9653: ‘So you’re done, eh, Dempster?’ was Mr. Pilgrim’s observation, uttered
9654: with some gusto. He was not glad Mr. Tryan had gained his point, but he
9655: was not sorry Dempster was disappointed.
9656: 
9657: ‘Done, sir? Not at all. It is what I anticipated. I knew we had nothing
9658: else to expect in these days, when the Church is infested by a set of men
9659: who are only fit to give out hymns from an empty cask, to tunes set by a
9660: journeyman cobbler. But I was not the less to exert myself in the cause
9661: of sound Churchmanship for the good of the town. Any coward can fight a
9662: battle when he’s sure of winning; but give me the man who has pluck to
9663: fight when he’s sure of losing. That’s my way, sir; and there are many
9664: victories worse than a defeat, as Mr. Tryan shall learn to his cost.’
9665: 
9666: ‘He must be a poor shuperannyated sort of a bishop, that’s my opinion,’
9667: said Mr. Tomlinson, ‘to go along with a sneaking Methodist like Tryan.
9668: And, for my part, I think we should be as well wi’out bishops, if they’re
9669: no wiser than that. Where’s the use o’ havin’ thousands a-year an’ livin’
9670: in a pallis, if they don’t stick to the Church?’
9671: 
9672: ‘No. There you’re going out of your depth, Tomlinson,’ said Mr. Dempster.
9673: ‘No one shall hear me say a word against Episcopacy--it is a safeguard of
9674: the Church; we must have ranks and dignities there as well as everywhere
9675: else. No, sir! Episcopacy is a good thing; but it may happen that a
9676: bishop is not a good thing. Just as brandy is a good thing, though this
9677: particular brandy is British, and tastes like sugared rain-water caught
9678: down the chimney. Here, Ratcliffe, let me have something to drink, a
9679: little less like a decoction of sugar and soot.’
9680: 
9681: ‘_I_ said nothing again’ Episcopacy,’ returned Mr. Tomlinson. ‘I only
9682: said I thought we should do as well wi’out bishops; an’ I’ll say it again
9683: for the matter o’ that. Bishops never brought any grist to my mill.’
9684: 
9685: ‘Do you know when the lectures are to begin?’ said Mr. Pilgrim.
9686: 
9687: ‘They are to _begin_ on Sunday next,’ said Mr. Dempster, in a significant
9688: tone; ‘but I think it will not take a long-sighted prophet to foresee the
9689: end of them. It strikes me Mr. Tryan will be looking out for another
9690: curacy shortly.’
9691: 
9692: ‘He’ll not get many Milby people to go and hear his lectures after a
9693: while, I’ll bet a guinea,’ observed Mr. Budd. ‘I know I’ll not keep a
9694: single workman on my ground who either goes to the lecture himself or
9695: lets anybody belonging to him go.’
9696: 
9697: ‘Nor me nayther,’ said Mr. Tomlinson. ‘No Tryanite shall touch a sack or
9698: drive a waggon o’ mine, that you may depend on. An’ I know more besides
9699: me as are o’ the same mind.’
9700: 
9701: ‘Tryan has a good many friends in the town, though, and friends that are
9702: likely to stand by him too,’ said Mr. Pilgrim. ‘I should say it would be
9703: as well to let him and his lectures alone. If he goes on preaching as he
9704: does, with such a constitution as his, he’ll get a relaxed throat
9705: by-and-by, and you’ll be rid of him without any trouble.’
9706: 
9707: ‘We’ll not allow him to do himself that injury,’ said Mr. Dempster.
9708: ‘Since his health is not good, we’ll persuade him to try change of air.
9709: Depend upon it, he’ll find the climate of Milby too hot for him.’
9710: 
9711: 
9712: 
9713: 
9714: Chapter 7
9715: 
9716: 
9717: Mr. Dempster did not stay long at the Red Lion that evening. He was
9718: summoned home to meet Mr. Armstrong, a wealthy client, and as he was kept
9719: in consultation till a late hour, it happened that this was one of the
9720: nights on which Mr. Dempster went to bed tolerably sober. Thus the day,
9721: which had been one of Janet’s happiest, because it had been spent by her
9722: in helping her dear old friend Mrs. Crewe, ended for her with unusual
9723: quietude; and as a bright sunset promises a fair morning, so a calm lying
9724: down is a good augury for a calm waking. Mr. Dempster, on the Thursday
9725: morning, was in one of his best humours, and though perhaps some of the
9726: good-humour might result from the prospect of a lucrative and exciting
9727: bit of business in Mr. Armstrong’s probable lawsuit, the greater part of
9728: it was doubtless due to those stirrings of the more kindly, healthy sap
9729: of human feeling, by which goodness tries to get the upper hand in us
9730: whenever it seems to have the slightest chance--on Sunday mornings,
9731: perhaps, when we are set free from the grinding hurry of the week, and
9732: take the little three-year old on our knee at breakfast to share our egg
9733: and muffin; in moments of trouble, when death visits our roof or illness
9734: makes us dependent on the tending hand of a slighted wife; in quiet talks
9735: with an aged mother, of the days when we stood at her knee with our first
9736: picture-book, or wrote her loving letters from school. In the man whose
9737: childhood has known caresses there is always a fibre of memory that can
9738: be touched to gentle issues, and Mr. Dempster, whom you have hitherto
9739: seen only as the orator of the Red Lion, and the drunken tyrant of a
9740: dreary midnight home, was the first-born darling son of a fair little
9741: mother. That mother was living still, and her own large black easy-chair,
9742: where she sat knitting through the livelong day, was now set ready for
9743: her at the breakfast-table, by her son’s side, a sleek tortoise-shell cat
9744: acting as provisional incumbent.
9745: 
9746: ‘Good morning, Mamsey! why, you’re looking as fresh as a daisy this
9747: morning. You’re getting young again’, said Mr. Dempster, looking up from
9748: his newspaper when the little old lady entered. A very little old lady
9749: she was, with a pale, scarcely wrinkled face, hair of that peculiar white
9750: which tells that the locks have once been blond, a natty pure white cap
9751: on her head, and a white shawl pinned over her shoulders. You saw at a
9752: glance that she had been a mignonne blonde, strangely unlike her tall,
9753: ugly, dingy-complexioned son; unlike her daughter-in-law, too, whose
9754: large-featured brunette beauty seemed always thrown into higher relief by
9755: the white presence of little Mamsey. The unlikeness between Janet and her
9756: mother-in-law went deeper than outline and complexion, and indeed there
9757: was little sympathy between them, for old Mrs. Dempster had not yet
9758: learned to believe that her son, Robert, would have gone wrong if he had
9759: married the right woman--a meek woman like herself, who would have borne
9760: him children, and been a deft, orderly housekeeper. In spite of Janet’s
9761: tenderness and attention to her, she had had little love for her
9762: daughter-in-law from the first, and had witnessed the sad growth of
9763: home-misery through long years, always with a disposition to lay the
9764: blame on the wife rather than on the husband, and to reproach Mrs. Raynor
9765: for encouraging her daughter’s faults by a too exclusive sympathy. But
9766: old Mrs. Dempster had that rare gift of silence and passivity which often
9767: supplies the absence of mental strength; and, whatever were her thoughts,
9768: she said no word to aggravate the domestic discord. Patient and mute she
9769: sat at her knitting through many a scene of quarrel and anguish;
9770: resolutely she appeared unconscious of the sounds that reached her ears,
9771: and the facts she divined after she had retired to her bed; mutely she
9772: witnessed poor Janet’s faults, only registering them as a balance of
9773: excuse on the side of her son. The hard, astute, domineering attorney was
9774: still that little old woman’s pet, as he had been when she watched with
9775: triumphant pride his first tumbling effort to march alone across the
9776: nursery floor. ‘See what a good son he is to me!’ she often thought.
9777: ‘Never gave me a harsh word. And so he might have been a good husband.’
9778: 
9779: O it is piteous--that sorrow of aged women! In early youth, perhaps, they
9780: said to themselves, ‘I shall be happy when I have a husband to love me
9781: best of all’; then, when the husband was too careless, ‘My child will
9782: comfort me’; then, through the mother’s watching and toil, ‘My child will
9783: repay me all when it grows up.’ And at last, after the long journey of
9784: years has been wearily travelled through, the mother’s heart is weighed
9785: down by a heavier burthen, and no hope remains but the grave.
9786: 
9787: But this morning old Mrs. Dempster sat down in her easy-chair without any
9788: painful, suppressed remembrance of the preceding night.
9789: 
9790: ‘I declare mammy looks younger than Mrs. Crewe, who is only sixty-five,’
9791: said Janet. ‘Mrs. Crewe will come to see you to-day, mammy, and tell you
9792: all about her troubles with the Bishop and the collation. She’ll bring
9793: her knitting, and you’ll have a regular gossip together.’
9794: 
9795: ‘The gossip will be all on one side, then, for Mrs. Crewe gets so very
9796: deaf, I can’t make her hear a word. And if I motion to her, she always
9797: understands me wrong.’
9798: 
9799: ‘O, she will have so much to tell you to-day, you will not want to speak
9800: yourself. You, who have patience to knit those wonderful counterpanes,
9801: mammy, must not be impatient with dear Mrs. Crewe. Good old lady! I can’t
9802: bear her to think she’s ever tiresome to people, and you know she’s very
9803: ready to fancy herself in the way. I think she would like to shrink up to
9804: the size of a mouse, that she might run about and do people good without
9805: their noticing her.’
9806: 
9807: ‘It isn’t patience I want, God knows; it’s lungs to speak loud enough.
9808: But you’ll be at home yourself, I suppose, this morning; and you can talk
9809: to her for me.’
9810: 
9811: ‘No, mammy; I promised poor Mrs. Lowme to go and sit with her. She’s
9812: confined to her room, and both the Miss Lowmes are out; so I’m going to
9813: read the newspaper to her and amuse her.’
9814: 
9815: ‘Couldn’t you go another morning? As Mr. Armstrong and that other
9816: gentleman are coming to dinner, I should think it would be better to stay
9817: at home. Can you trust Betty to see to everything? She’s new to the
9818: place.’
9819: 
9820: ‘O I couldn’t disappoint Mrs. Lowme; I promised her. Betty will do very
9821: well, no fear.’
9822: 
9823: Old Mrs. Dempster was silent after this, and began to sip her tea. The
9824: breakfast went on without further conversation for some time, Mr.
9825: Dempster being absorbed in the papers. At length, when he was running
9826: over the advertisements, his eye seemed to be caught by something that
9827: suggested a new thought to him. He presently thumped the table with an
9828: air of exultation, and, said turning to Janet,--‘I’ve a capital idea,
9829: Gypsy!’ (that was his name for his dark-eyed wife when he was in an
9830: extraordinarily good humour), ‘and you shall help me. It’s just what
9831: you’re up to.’
9832: 
9833: ‘What is it?’ said Janet, her face beaming at the sound of the pet name,
9834: now heard so seldom. ‘Anything to do with conveyancing?’
9835: 
9836: ‘It’s a bit of fun worth a dozen fees--a plan for raising a laugh against
9837: Tryan and his gang of hypocrites.’
9838: 
9839: ‘What is it? Nothing that wants a needle and thread, I hope, else I must go
9840: and tease mother.’
9841: 
9842: ‘No, nothing sharper than your wit--except mine. I’ll tell you what it
9843: is. We’ll get up a programme of the Sunday evening lecture, like a
9844: play-bill, you know--“Grand Performance of the celebrated Mountebank,”
9845: and so on. We’ll bring in the Tryanites--old Landor and the rest--in
9846: appropriate characters. Proctor shall print it, and we’ll circulate it in
9847: the town. It will be a capital hit.’
9848: 
9849: ‘Bravo!’ said Janet, clapping her hands. She would just then have
9850: pretended to like almost anything, in her pleasure at being appealed to
9851: by her husband, and she really did like to laugh at the Tryanites. ‘We’ll
9852: set about it directly, and sketch it out before you go to the office.
9853: I’ve got Tryan’s sermons up-stairs, but I don’t think there’s anything in
9854: them we can use. I’ve only just looked into them; they’re not at all what
9855: I expected--dull, stupid things--nothing of the roaring
9856: fire-and-brimstone sort that I expected.’
9857: 
9858: ‘Roaring? No; Tryan’s as soft as a sucking dove--one of your
9859: honey-mouthed hypocrites. Plenty of devil and malice in him, though, I
9860: could see that, while he was talking to the Bishop; but as smooth as a
9861: snake outside. He’s beginning a single-handed fight with me, I can
9862: see--persuading my clients away from me. We shall see who will be the
9863: first to cry _peccavi_. Milby will do better without Mr. Tryan than
9864: without Robert Dempster, I fancy! and Milby shall never be flooded with
9865: cant as long as I can raise a breakwater against it. But now, get the
9866: breakfast things cleared away, and let us set about the play-bill. Come,
9867: mamsey, come and have a walk with me round the garden, and let us see how
9868: the cucumbers are getting on. I’ve never taken you round the garden for
9869: an age. Come, you don’t want a bonnet. It’s like walking in a greenhouse
9870: this morning.’
9871: 
9872: ‘But she will want a parasol,’ said Janet. ‘There’s one on the stand
9873: against the garden-door, Robert.’
9874: 
9875: The little old lady took her son’s arm with placid pleasure. She could
9876: barely reach it so as to rest upon it, but he inclined a little towards
9877: her, and accommodated his heavy long-limbed steps to her feeble pace. The
9878: cat chose to sun herself too, and walked close beside them, with tail
9879: erect, rubbing her sleek sides against their legs,--too well fed to be
9880: excited by the twittering birds. The garden was of the grassy, shady
9881: kind, often seen attached to old houses in provincial towns; the
9882: apple-trees had had time to spread their branches very wide, the shrubs
9883: and hardy perennial plants had grown into a luxuriance that required
9884: constant trimming to prevent them from intruding on the space for
9885: walking. But the farther end, which united with green fields, was open
9886: and sunny.
9887: 
9888: It was rather sad, and yet pretty, to see that little group passing out
9889: of the shadow into the sunshine, and out of the sunshine into the shadow
9890: again: sad, because this tenderness of the son for the mother was hardly
9891: more than a nucleus of healthy life in an organ hardening by disease,
9892: because the man who was linked in this way with an innocent past, had
9893: become callous in worldliness, fevered by sensuality, enslaved by chance
9894: impulses; pretty, because it showed how hard it is to kill the deep-down
9895: fibrous roots of human love and goodness--how the man from whom we make
9896: it our pride to shrink, has yet a close brotherhood with us through some
9897: of our most sacred feelings.
9898: 
9899: As they were returning to the house, Janet met them, and said, ‘Now,
9900: Robert, the writing things are ready. I shall be clerk, and Mat Paine can
9901: copy it out after.’
9902: 
9903: Mammy once more deposited in her arm-chair, with her knitting in her
9904: hand, and the cat purring at her elbow, Janet seated herself at the
9905: table, while Mr. Dempster placed himself near her, took out his
9906: snuff-box, and plentifully suffusing himself with the inspiring powder,
9907: began to dictate.
9908: 
9909: What he dictated, we shall see by-and-by.
9910: 
9911: 
9912: 
9913: 
9914: Chapter 8
9915: 
9916: 
9917: The next day, Friday, at five o’clock by the sun-dial, the large
9918: bow-window of Mrs. Jerome’s parlour was open; and that lady herself was
9919: seated within its ample semicircle, having a table before her on which
9920: her best tea-tray, her best china, and her best urn-rug had already been
9921: standing in readiness for half an hour. Mrs. Jerome’s best tea-service
9922: was of delicate white fluted china, with gold sprigs upon it--as pretty a
9923: tea-service as you need wish to see, and quite good enough for chimney
9924: ornaments; indeed, as the cups were without handles, most visitors who
9925: had the distinction of taking tea out of them, wished that such charming
9926: china had already been promoted to that honorary position. Mrs. Jerome
9927: was like her china, handsome and old-fashioned. She was a buxom lady of
9928: sixty, in an elaborate lace cap fastened by a frill under her chin, a
9929: dark, well-curled front concealing her forehead, a snowy neckerchief
9930: exhibiting its ample folds as far as her waist, and a stiff grey silk
9931: gown. She had a clean damask napkin pinned before her to guard her dress
9932: during the process of tea-making; her favourite geraniums in the
9933: bow-window were looking as healthy as she could desire; her own handsome
9934: portrait, painted when she was twenty years younger, was smiling down on
9935: her with agreeable flattery; and altogether she seemed to be in as
9936: peaceful and pleasant a position as a buxom, well-drest elderly lady need
9937: desire. But, as in so many other cases, appearances were deceptive. Her
9938: mind was greatly perturbed and her temper ruffled by the fact that it was
9939: more than a quarter past five even by the losing timepiece, that it was
9940: half-past by her large gold watch, which she held in her hand as if she
9941: were counting the pulse of the afternoon, and that, by the kitchen clock,
9942: which she felt sure was not an hour too fast, it had already struck six.
9943: The lapse of time was rendered the more unendurable to Mrs. Jerome by her
9944: wonder that Mr. Jerome could stay out in the garden with Lizzie in that
9945: thoughtless way, taking it so easily that tea-time was long past, and
9946: that, after all the trouble of getting down the best tea-things, Mr.
9947: Tryan would not come.
9948: 
9949: This honour had been shown to Mr. Tryan, not at all because Mrs. Jerome
9950: had any high appreciation of his doctrine or of his exemplary activity as
9951: a pastor, but simply because he was a ‘Church clergyman’, and as such was
9952: regarded by her with the same sort of exceptional respect that a white
9953: woman who had married a native of the Society Islands might be supposed
9954: to feel towards a white-skinned visitor from the land of her youth. For
9955: Mrs. Jerome had been reared a Churchwoman, and having attained the age of
9956: thirty before she was married, had felt the greatest repugnance in the
9957: first instance to renouncing the religious forms in which she had been
9958: brought up. ‘You know,’ she said in confidence to her Church
9959: acquaintances, ‘I wouldn’t give no ear at all to Mr. Jerome at fust; but
9960: after all, I begun to think as there was a maeny things worse nor goin’
9961: to chapel, an’ you’d better do that nor not pay your way. Mr. Jerome had
9962: a very pleasant manner with him, an’ there was niver another as kept a
9963: gig, an’ ’ud make a settlement on me like him, chapel or no chapel. It
9964: seemed very odd to me for a long while, the preachin’ without book, an’
9965: the stannin’ up to one long prayer, istid o’ changin’ your postur. But
9966: la! there’s nothin’ as you mayn’t get used to i’ time; you can al’ys sit
9967: down, you know, before the prayer’s done. The ministers say pretty nigh
9968: the same things as the Church parsons, by what I could iver make out, an’
9969: we’re out o’ chapel i’ the mornin’ a deal sooner nor they’re out o’
9970: church. An’ as for pews, ourn’s is a deal comfortabler nor aeny i’ Milby
9971: Church.’
9972: 
9973: Mrs. Jerome, you perceive, had not a keen susceptibility to shades of
9974: doctrine, and it is probable that, after listening to Dissenting
9975: eloquence for thirty years, she might safely have re-entered the
9976: Establishment without performing any spiritual quarantine. Her mind,
9977: apparently, was of that non-porous flinty character which is not in the
9978: least danger from surrounding damp. But on the question of getting start
9979: of the sun on the day’s business, and clearing her conscience of the
9980: necessary sum of meals and the consequent ‘washing up’ as soon as
9981: possible, so that the family might be well in bed at nine, Mrs. Jerome
9982: _was_ susceptible; and the present lingering pace of things, united with
9983: Mr. Jerome’s unaccountable obliviousness, was not to be borne any longer.
9984: So she rang the bell for Sally.
9985: 
9986: ‘Goodness me, Sally! go into the garden an’ see after your master. Tell
9987: him it’s goin’ on for six, an’ Mr. Tryan ’ull niver think o’ comin’ now,
9988: an’ it’s time we got tea over. An’ he’s lettin’ Lizzie stain her frock, I
9989: expect, among them strawberry beds. Mek her come in this minute.’
9990: 
9991: No wonder Mr. Jerome was tempted to linger in the garden, for though the
9992: house was pretty and well deserved its name--‘the White House’, the tall
9993: damask roses that clustered over the porch being thrown into relief by
9994: rough stucco of the most brilliant white, yet the garden and orchards
9995: were Mr. Jerome’s glory, as well they might be; and there was nothing in
9996: which he had a more innocent pride--peace to a good man’s memory! all his
9997: pride was innocent--than in conducting a hitherto uninitiated visitor
9998: over his grounds, and making him in some degree aware of the incomparable
9999: advantages possessed by the inhabitants of the White House in the matter
10000: of red-streaked apples, russets, northern greens (excellent for baking),
10001: swan-egg pears, and early vegetables, to say nothing of flowering
10002: ‘srubs,’ pink hawthorns, lavender bushes more than ever Mrs. Jerome could
10003: use, and, in short, a superabundance of everything that a person retired
10004: from business could desire to possess himself or to share with his
10005: friends. The garden was one of those old-fashioned paradises which hardly
10006: exist any longer except as memories of our childhood: no finical
10007: separation between flower and kitchen garden there; no monotony of
10008: enjoyment for one sense to the exclusion of another; but a charming
10009: paradisiacal mingling of all that was pleasant to the eyes and good for
10010: food. The rich flower-border running along every walk, with its endless
10011: succession of spring flowers, anemones, auriculas, wall-flowers,
10012: sweet-williams, campanulas, snapdragons, and tiger-lilies, had its taller
10013: beauties, such as moss and Provence roses, varied with espalier
10014: apple-trees; the crimson of a carnation was carried out in the lurking
10015: crimson of the neighbouring strawberry-beds; you gathered a moss-rose one
10016: moment and a bunch of currants the next; you were in a delicious
10017: fluctuation between the scent of jasmine and the juice of gooseberries.
10018: Then what a high wall at one end, flanked by a summer-house so lofty,
10019: that after ascending its long flight of steps you could see perfectly
10020: well there was no view worth looking at; what alcoves and garden-seats in
10021: all directions; and along one side, what a hedge, tall, and firm, and
10022: unbroken, like a green wall!
10023: 
10024: It was near this hedge that Mr. Jerome was standing when Sally found him.
10025: He had set down the basket of strawberries on the gravel, and had lifted
10026: up little Lizzie in his arms to look at a bird’s nest. Lizzie peeped, and
10027: then looked at her grandpa with round blue eyes, and then peeped again.
10028: 
10029: ‘D’ye see it, Lizzie?’ he whispered.
10030: 
10031: ‘Yes,’ she whispered in return, putting her lips very near grandpa’s
10032: face. At this moment Sally appeared.
10033: 
10034: ‘Eh, eh, Sally, what’s the matter? Is Mr. Tryan come?’
10035: 
10036: ‘No, sir, an’ Missis says she’s sure he won’t come now, an’ she wants you
10037: to come in an’ hev tea. Dear heart, Miss Lizzie, you’ve stained your
10038: pinafore, an’ I shouldn’t wonder if it’s gone through to your frock.
10039: There’ll be fine work! Come alonk wi’ me, do.’
10040: 
10041: ‘Nay, nay, nay, we’ve done no harm, we’ve done no harm, hev we, Lizzie?
10042: The wash-tub’ll make all right again.’
10043: 
10044: Sally, regarding the wash-tub from a different point of view, looked
10045: sourly serious, and hurried away with Lizzie, who trotted submissively
10046: along, her little head in eclipse under a large nankin bonnet, while Mr.
10047: Jerome followed leisurely with his full broad shoulders in rather a
10048: stooping posture, and his large good-natured features and white locks
10049: shaded by a broad-brimmed hat.
10050: 
10051: ‘Mr. Jerome, I wonder at you,’ said Mrs. Jerome, in a tone of indignant
10052: remonstrance, evidently sustained by a deep sense of injury, as her
10053: husband opened the parlour door. ‘When will you leave off invitin’ people
10054: to meals an’ not lettin’ ’em know the time? I’ll answer for’t, you niver
10055: said a word to Mr. Tryan as we should take tea at five o’clock. It’s just
10056: like you!’
10057: 
10058: ‘Nay, nay, Susan,’ answered the husband in a soothing tone, ‘there’s
10059: nothin’ amiss. I told Mr. Tryan as we took tea at five punctial; mayhap
10060: summat’s a detainin’ on him. He’s a deal to do, an’ to think on,
10061: remember.’
10062: 
10063: ‘Why, it’s struck six i’ the kitchen a’ready. It’s nonsense to look for
10064: him comin’ now. So you may’s well ring for th’ urn. Now Sally’s got th’
10065: heater in the fire, we may’s well hev th’ urn in, though he doesn’t come.
10066: I niver see’d the like o’ you, Mr. Jerome, for axin’ people an’ givin’ me
10067: the trouble o’ gettin’ things down an’ hevin’ crumpets made, an’ after
10068: all they don’t come. I shall hev to wash every one o’ these tea-things
10069: myself, for there’s no trustin’ Sally--she’d break a fortin i’ crockery
10070: i’ no time!’
10071: 
10072: ‘But why will you give yourself sich trouble, Susan? Our everyday
10073: tea-things would ha’ done as well for Mr. Tryan, an’ they’re a deal
10074: convenenter to hold.’
10075: 
10076: ‘Yes, that’s just your way, Mr. Jerome, you’re al’ys a-findin’ faut wi’
10077: my chany, because I bought it myself afore I was married. But let me tell
10078: you, I knowed how to choose chany if I didn’t know how to choose a
10079: husband. An’ where’s Lizzie? You’ve niver left her i’ the garden by
10080: herself, with her white frock on an’ clean stockins?’
10081: 
10082: ‘Be easy, my dear Susan, be easy; Lizzie’s come in wi’ Sally. She’s
10083: hevin’ her pinafore took off, I’ll be bound. Ah! there’s Mr. Tryan
10084: a-comin’ through the gate.’
10085: 
10086: Mrs. Jerome began hastily to adjust her damask napkin and the expression
10087: of her countenance for the reception of the clergyman, and Mr. Jerome
10088: went out to meet his guest, whom he greeted outside the door.
10089: 
10090: ‘Mr. Tryan, how do you do, Mr. Tryan? Welcome to the White House! I’m
10091: glad to see you, sir--I’m glad to see you.’
10092: 
10093: If you had heard the tone of mingled good-will, veneration, and
10094: condolence in which this greeting was uttered, even without seeing the
10095: face that completely harmonized with it, you would have no difficulty in
10096: inferring the ground-notes of Mr. Jerome’s character. To a fine ear that
10097: tone said as plainly as possible--‘Whatever recommends itself to me,
10098: Thomas Jerome, as piety and goodness, shall have my love and honour. Ah,
10099: friends, this pleasant world is a sad one, too, isn’t it? Let us help one
10100: another, let us help one another.’ And it was entirely owing to this
10101: basis of character, not at all from any clear and precise doctrinal
10102: discrimination, that Mr. Jerome had very early in life become a
10103: Dissenter. In his boyish days he had been thrown where Dissent seemed to
10104: have the balance of piety, purity, and good works on its side, and to
10105: become a Dissenter seemed to him identical with choosing God instead of
10106: mammon. That race of Dissenters is extinct in these days, when opinion
10107: has got far ahead of feeling, and every chapel-going youth can fill our
10108: ears with the advantages of the Voluntary system, the corruptions of a
10109: State Church, and the Scriptural evidence that the first Christians were
10110: Congregationalists. Mr. Jerome knew nothing of this theoretic basis for
10111: Dissent, and in the utmost extent of his polemical discussion he had not
10112: gone further than to question whether a Christian man was bound in
10113: conscience to distinguish Christmas and Easter by any peculiar observance
10114: beyond the eating of mince-pies and cheese-cakes. It seemed to him that
10115: all seasons were alike good for thanking God, departing from evil and
10116: doing well, whereas it might be desirable to restrict the period for
10117: indulging in unwholesome forms of pastry. Mr. Jerome’s dissent being of
10118: this simple, non-polemical kind, it is easy to understand that the report
10119: he heard of Mr. Tryan as a good man and a powerful preacher, who was
10120: stirring the hearts of the people, had been enough to attract him to the
10121: Paddiford Church, and that having felt himself more edified there than he
10122: had of late been under Mr. Stickney’s discourses at Salem, he had driven
10123: thither repeatedly in the Sunday afternoons, and had sought an
10124: opportunity of making Mr. Tryan’s acquaintance. The evening lecture was a
10125: subject of warm interest with him, and the opposition Mr. Tryan met with
10126: gave that interest a strong tinge of partisanship; for there was a store
10127: of irascibility in Mr. Jerome’s nature which must find a vent somewhere,
10128: and in so kindly and upright a man could only find it in indignation
10129: against those whom he held to be enemies of truth and goodness. Mr. Tryan
10130: had not hitherto been to the White House, but yesterday, meeting Mr.
10131: Jerome in the street, he had at once accepted the invitation to tea,
10132: saying there was something he wished to talk about. He appeared worn and
10133: fatigued now, and after shaking hands with Mrs. Jerome, threw himself
10134: into a chair and looked out on the pretty garden with an air of relief.
10135: 
10136: ‘What a nice place you have here, Mr. Jerome! I’ve not seen anything so
10137: quiet and pretty since I came to Milby. On Paddiford Common, where I
10138: live, you know, the bushes are all sprinkled with soot, and there’s never
10139: any quiet except in the dead of night.’
10140: 
10141: ‘Dear heart! dear heart! That’s very bad--and for you, too, as hev to
10142: study. Wouldn’t it be better for you to be somewhere more out i’ the
10143: country like?’
10144: 
10145: ‘O no! I should lose so much time in going to and fro, and besides I like
10146: to be _among_ the people. I’ve no face to go and preach resignation to
10147: those poor things in their smoky air and comfortless homes, when I come
10148: straight from every luxury myself. There are many things quite lawful for
10149: other men, which a clergyman must forego if he would do any good in a
10150: manufacturing population like this.’
10151: 
10152: Here the preparations for tea were crowned by the simultaneous appearance
10153: of Lizzie and the crumpet. It is a pretty surprise, when one visits an
10154: elderly couple, to see a little figure enter in a white frock with a
10155: blond head as smooth as satin, round blue eyes, and a cheek like an apple
10156: blossom. A toddling little girl is a centre of common feeling which makes
10157: the most dissimilar people understand each other; and Mr. Tryan looked at
10158: Lizzie with that quiet pleasure which is always genuine.
10159: 
10160: ‘Here we are, here we are!’ said proud grandpapa. ‘You didn’t think we’d
10161: got such a little gell as this, did you, Mr. Tryan? Why, it seems but th’
10162: other day since her mother was just such another. This is our little
10163: Lizzie, this is. Come an’ shake hands wi’ Mr. Tryan, Lizzie; come.’
10164: 
10165: Lizzie advanced without hesitation, and put out one hand, while she
10166: fingered her coral necklace with the other, and looked up into Mr.
10167: Tryan’s face with a reconnoitring gaze. He stroked the satin head, and
10168: said in his gentlest voice, ‘How do you do, Lizzie? will you give me a
10169: kiss?’ She put up her little bud of a mouth, and then retreating a little
10170: and glancing down at her frock, said,--‘Dit id my noo fock. I put it on
10171: ’tod you wad toming. Tally taid you wouldn’t ’ook at it.’
10172: 
10173: ‘Hush, hush, Lizzie, little gells must be seen and not heard,’ said Mrs.
10174: Jerome; while grandpapa, winking significantly, and looking radiant with
10175: delight at Lizzie’s extraordinary promise of cleverness, set her up on
10176: her high cane-chair by the side of grandma, who lost no time in shielding
10177: the beauties of the new frock with a napkin.
10178: 
10179: ‘Well now, Mr. Tryan,’ said Mr. Jerome, in a very serious tone, when tea
10180: had been distributed, ‘let me hear how you’re a-goin’ on about the
10181: lectur. When I was i’ the town yisterday, I heared as there was
10182: pessecutin’ schemes a-bein’ laid again’ you. I fear me those raskills ’ll
10183: mek things very onpleasant to you.’
10184: 
10185: ‘I’ve no doubt they will attempt it; indeed, I quite expect there will be
10186: a regular mob got up on Sunday evening, as there was when the delegates
10187: returned, on purpose to annoy me and the congregation on our way to
10188: church.’
10189: 
10190: ‘Ah, they’re capible o’ anything, such men as Dempster an’ Budd; an’
10191: Tomlinson backs ’em wi’ money, though he can’t wi’ brains. Howiver,
10192: Dempster’s lost one client by his wicked doins, an’ I’m deceived if he
10193: won’t lose more nor one. I little thought, Mr. Tryan, when I put my
10194: affairs into his hands twenty ’ear ago this Michaelmas, as he was to turn
10195: out a pessecutor o’ religion. I niver lighted on a cliverer, promisiner
10196: young man nor he was then. They talked of his bein’ fond of a extry glass
10197: now an’ then, but niver nothin’ like what he’s come to since. An’ it’s
10198: head-piece you must look for in a lawyer, Mr. Tryan, it’s head-piece. His
10199: wife, too, was al’ys an uncommon favourite o’ mine--poor thing! I hear
10200: sad stories about her now. But she’s druv to it, she’s druv to it, Mr.
10201: Tryan. A tender-hearted woman to the poor, she is, as iver lived; an’ as
10202: pretty-spoken a woman as you need wish to talk to. Yes! I’d al’ys a
10203: likin’ for Dempster an’ his wife, spite o’ iverything. But as soon as
10204: iver I heared o’ that dilegate business, I says, says I, that man shall
10205: hev no more to do wi’ my affairs. It may put me t’ inconvenience, but
10206: I’ll encourage no man as pessecutes religion.’
10207: 
10208: ‘He is evidently the brain and hand of the persecution,’ said Mr. Tryan.
10209: ‘There may be a strong feeling against me in a large number of the
10210: inhabitants--it must be so from the great ignorance of spiritual things
10211: in this place. But I fancy there would have been no formal opposition to
10212: the lecture, if Dempster had not planned it. I am not myself the least
10213: alarmed at anything he can do; he will find I am not to be cowed or
10214: driven away by insult or personal danger. God has sent me to this place,
10215: and, by His blessing, I’ll not shrink from anything I may have to
10216: encounter in doing His work among the people. But I feel it right to call
10217: on all those who know the value of the Gospel, to stand by me publicly. I
10218: think--and Mr. Landor agrees with me--that it will be well for my friends
10219: to proceed with me in a body to the church on Sunday evening. Dempster,
10220: you know, has pretended that almost all the respectable inhabitants are
10221: opposed to the lecture. Now, I wish that falsehood to be visibly
10222: contradicted. What do you think of the plan? I have to-day been to see
10223: several of my friends, who will make a point of being there to accompany
10224: me, and will communicate with others on the subject.’
10225: 
10226: ‘I’ll mek one, Mr. Tryan, I’ll mek one. You shall not be wantin’ in any
10227: support as I can give. Before you come to it, sir, Milby was a dead an’
10228: dark place; you are the fust man i’ the Church to my knowledge as has
10229: brought the word o’ God home to the people; an’ I’ll stan’ by you, sir,
10230: I’ll stan’ by you. I’m a Dissenter, Mr. Tryan; I’ve been a Dissenter ever
10231: sin’ I was fifteen ’ear old; but show me good i’ the Church, an’ I’m a
10232: Churchman too. When I was a boy I lived at Tilston; you mayn’t know the
10233: place; the best part o’ the land there belonged to Squire Sandeman; he’d
10234: a club-foot, had Squire Sandeman--lost a deal o’ money by canal shares.
10235: Well, sir, as I was sayin’, I lived at Tilston, an’ the rector there was
10236: a terrible drinkin’, fox-huntin’ man; you niver see’d such a parish i’
10237: your time for wickedness; Milby’s nothin’ to it. Well, sir, my father was
10238: a workin’ man, an’ couldn’t afford to gi’ me ony eddication, so I went to
10239: a night-school as was kep by a Dissenter, one Jacob Wright; an’ it was
10240: from that man, sir, as I got my little schoolin’ an’ my knowledge o’
10241: religion. I went to chapel wi’ Jacob--he was a good man was Jacob--an’ to
10242: chapel I’ve been iver since. But I’m no enemy o’ the Church, sir, when
10243: the Church brings light to the ignorant and the sinful; an’ that’s what
10244: you’re a-doin’, Mr. Tryan. Yes, sir, I’ll stan’ by you. I’ll go to church
10245: wi’ you o’ Sunday evenin’.’
10246: 
10247: ‘You’d far better stay at home, Mr. Jerome, if I may give my opinion,’
10248: interposed Mrs. Jerome. ‘It’s not as I hevn’t ivery respect for you, Mr.
10249: Tryan, but Mr. Jerome ’ull do you no good by his interferin’. Dissenters
10250: are not at all looked on i’ Milby, an’ he’s as nervous as iver he can be;
10251: he’ll come back as ill as ill, an’ niver let me hev a wink o’ sleep all
10252: night.’
10253: 
10254: Mrs. Jerome had been frightened at the mention of a mob, and her
10255: retrospective regard for the religious communion of her youth by no means
10256: inspired her with the temper of a martyr. Her husband looked at her with
10257: an expression of tender and grieved remonstrance, which might have been
10258: that of the patient patriarch on the memorable occasion when he rebuked
10259: his wife.
10260: 
10261: ‘Susan, Susan, let me beg on you not to oppose me, and put
10262: stumblin’-blocks i’ the way o’ doing’ what’s right. I can’t give up my
10263: conscience, let me give up what else I may.’
10264: 
10265: ‘Perhaps,’ said Mr. Tryan, feeling slightly uncomfortable, ‘since you are
10266: not very strong, my dear sir, it will be well, as Mrs. Jerome suggests,
10267: that you should not run the risk of any excitement.’
10268: 
10269: ‘Say no more, Mr. Tryan. I’ll stan’ by you, sir. It’s my duty. It’s the
10270: cause o’ God, sir; it’s the cause o’ God.’
10271: 
10272: Mr. Tryan obeyed his impulse of admiration and gratitude, and put out his
10273: hand to the white-haired old man, saying, ‘Thank you, Mr. Jerome, thank
10274: you.’
10275: 
10276: Mr. Jerome grasped the proffered hand in silence, and then threw himself
10277: back in his chair, casting a regretful look at his wife, which seemed to
10278: say, ‘Why don’t you feel with me, Susan?’
10279: 
10280: The sympathy of this simple-minded old man was more precious to Mr. Tryan
10281: than any mere onlooker could have imagined. To persons possessing a great
10282: deal of that facile psychology which prejudges individuals by means of
10283: formulæ, and casts them, without further trouble, into duly lettered
10284: pigeon-holes, the Evangelical curate might seem to be doing simply what
10285: all other men like to do--carrying out objects which were identified not
10286: only with his theory, which is but a kind of secondary egoism, but also
10287: with the primary egoism of his feelings. Opposition may become sweet to a
10288: man when he has christened it persecution: a self-obtrusive, over-hasty
10289: reformer complacently disclaiming all merit, while his friends call him a
10290: martyr, has not in reality a career the most arduous to the fleshly mind.
10291: But Mr. Tryan was not cast in the mould of the gratuitous martyr. With a
10292: power of persistence which had been often blamed as obstinacy, he had an
10293: acute sensibility to the very hatred or ridicule he did not flinch from
10294: provoking. Every form of disapproval jarred him painfully; and, though he
10295: fronted his opponents manfully, and often with considerable warmth of
10296: temper, he had no pugnacious pleasure in the contest. It was one of the
10297: weaknesses of his nature to be too keenly alive to every harsh wind of
10298: opinion; to wince under the frowns of the foolish; to be irritated by the
10299: injustice of those who could not possibly have the elements indispensable
10300: for judging him rightly; and with all this acute sensibility to blame,
10301: this dependence on sympathy, he had for years been constrained into a
10302: position of antagonism. No wonder, then, that good old Mr. Jerome’s
10303: cordial words were balm to him. He had often been thankful to an old
10304: woman for saying ‘God bless you’; to a little child for smiling at him;
10305: to a dog for submitting to be patted by him.
10306: 
10307: Tea being over by this time, Mr. Tryan proposed a walk in the garden as a
10308: means of dissipating all recollection of the recent conjugal dissidence.
10309: Little Lizzie’s appeal, ‘Me go, gandpa!’ could not be rejected, so she
10310: was duly bonneted and pinafored, and then they turned out into the
10311: evening sunshine. Not Mrs. Jerome, however; she had a deeply-meditated
10312: plan of retiring _ad interim_ to the kitchen and washing up the best
10313: tea-things, as a mode of getting forward with the sadly-retarded business
10314: of the day.
10315: 
10316: ‘This way, Mr. Tryan, this way,’ said the old gentleman; ‘I must take you
10317: to my pastur fust, an’ show you our cow--the best milker i’ the county.
10318: An’ see here at these backbuildins, how convenent the dairy is; I planned
10319: it ivery bit myself. An’ here I’ve got my little carpenter’s shop an’ my
10320: blacksmith’s shop; I do no end o’ jobs here myself. I niver could bear to
10321: be idle, Mr. Tryan; I must al’ys be at somethin’ or other. It was time
10322: for me to lay by business an mek room for younger folks. I’d got money
10323: enough, wi’ only one daughter to leave it to, an’ I says to myself, says
10324: I, it’s time to leave off moitherin’ myself wi’ this world so much, an’
10325: give more time to thinkin’ of another. But there’s a many hours atween
10326: getting up an’ lyin’ down, an’ thoughts are no cumber; you can move about
10327: wi’ a good many on ’em in your head. See, here’s the pastur.’
10328: 
10329: A very pretty pasture it was, where the large-spotted short-horned cow
10330: quietly chewed the cud as she lay and looked sleepily at her admirers--a
10331: daintily-trimmed hedge all round, dotted here and there with a
10332: mountain-ash or a cherry-tree.
10333: 
10334: ‘I’ve a good bit more land besides this, worth your while to look at, but
10335: mayhap it’s further nor you’d like to walk now. Bless you! I’ve welly an’
10336: acre o’ potato-ground yonders; I’ve a good big family to supply, you
10337: know.’ (Here Mr. Jerome winked and smiled significantly.) ‘An’ that puts
10338: me i’ mind, Mr. Tryan, o’ summat I wanted to say to you. Clergymen like
10339: you, I know, see a deal more poverty an’ that, than other folks, an’ hev
10340: a many claims on ’em more nor they can well meet; an’ if you’ll mek use
10341: o’ my purse any time, or let me know where I can be o’ any help, I’ll tek
10342: it very kind on you.’
10343: 
10344: ‘Thank you, Mr. Jerome, I will do so, I promise you. I saw a sad case
10345: yesterday; a collier--a fine broad-chested fellow about thirty--was
10346: killed by the falling of a wall in the Paddiford colliery. I was in one
10347: of the cottages near, when they brought him home on a door, and the
10348: shriek of the wife has been ringing in my ears ever since. There are
10349: three little children. Happily the woman has her loom, so she will be
10350: able to keep out of the workhouse; but she looks very delicate.’
10351: 
10352: ‘Give me her name, Mr. Tryan,’ said Mr. Jerome, drawing out his
10353: pocket-book. ‘I’ll call an’ see her.’
10354: 
10355: Deep was the fountain of pity in the good old man’s heart! He often ate
10356: his dinner stintingly, oppressed by the thought that there were men,
10357: women, and children, with no dinner to sit down to, and would relieve his
10358: mind by going out in the afternoon to look for some need that he could
10359: supply, some honest struggle in which he could lend a helping hand. That
10360: any living being should want, was his chief sorrow; that any rational
10361: being should waste, was the next. Sally, indeed, having been scolded by
10362: master for a too lavish use of sticks in lighting the kitchen fire, and
10363: various instances of recklessness with regard to candle ends, considered
10364: him ‘as mean as aenythink;’ but he had as kindly a warmth as the morning
10365: sunlight, and, like the sunlight, his goodness shone on all that came in
10366: his way, from the saucy rosy-cheeked lad whom he delighted to make happy
10367: with a Christmas box, to the pallid sufferers up dim entries, languishing
10368: under the tardy death of want and misery.
10369: 
10370: It was very pleasant to Mr. Tryan to listen to the simple chat of the old
10371: man--to walk in the shade of the incomparable orchard, and hear the story
10372: of the crops yielded by the red-streaked apple-tree, and the quite
10373: embarrassing plentifulness of the summer-pears--to drink-in the sweet
10374: evening breath of the garden, as they sat in the alcove--and so, for a
10375: short interval, to feel the strain of his pastoral task relaxed.
10376: 
10377: Perhaps he felt the return to that task through the dusty roads all the
10378: more painfully, perhaps something in that quiet shady home had reminded
10379: him of the time before he had taken on him the yoke of self-denial. The
10380: strongest heart will faint sometimes under the feeling that enemies are
10381: bitter, and that friends only know half its sorrows. The most resolute
10382: soul will now and then cast back a yearning look in treading the rough
10383: mountain-path, away from the greensward and laughing voices of the
10384: valley. However it was, in the nine o’clock twilight that evening, when
10385: Mr. Tryan had entered his small study and turned the key in the door, he
10386: threw himself into the chair before his writing-table, and, heedless of
10387: the papers there, leaned his face low on his hand, and moaned heavily.
10388: 
10389: It is apt to be so in this life, I think. While we are coldly discussing
10390: a man’s career, sneering at his mistakes, blaming his rashness, and
10391: labelling his opinions--‘he is Evangelical and narrow’, or
10392: ‘Latitudinarian and Pantheistic’ or ‘Anglican and supercilious’--that
10393: man, in his solitude, is perhaps shedding hot tears because his sacrifice
10394: is a hard one, because strength and patience are failing him to speak the
10395: difficult word, and do the difficult deed.
10396: 
10397: 
10398: 
10399: 
10400: Chapter 9
10401: 
10402: 
10403: Mr. Tryan showed no such symptoms of weakness on the critical Sunday. He
10404: unhesitatingly rejected the suggestion that he should be taken to church
10405: in Mr. Landor’s carriage--a proposition which that gentleman made as an
10406: amendment on the original plan, when the rumours of meditated insult
10407: became alarming. Mr. Tryan declared he would have no precautions taken,
10408: but would simply trust in God and his good cause. Some of his more timid
10409: friends thought this conduct rather defiant than wise, and reflecting
10410: that a mob has great talents for impromptu, and that legal redress is
10411: imperfect satisfaction for having one’s head broken with a brickbat, were
10412: beginning to question their consciences very closely as to whether it was
10413: not a duty they owed to their families to stay at home on Sunday evening.
10414: These timorous persons, however, were in a small minority, and the
10415: generality of Mr. Tryan’s friends and hearers rather exulted in an
10416: opportunity of braving insult for the sake of a preacher to whom they
10417: were attached on personal as well as doctrinal grounds. Miss Pratt spoke
10418: of Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer, and observed that the present crisis
10419: afforded an occasion for emulating their heroism even in these degenerate
10420: times; while less highly instructed persons, whose memories were not well
10421: stored with precedents, simply expressed their determination, as Mr.
10422: Jerome had done, to ‘stan’ by’ the preacher and his cause, believing it
10423: to be the ‘cause of God’.
10424: 
10425: On Sunday evening, then, at a quarter past six, Mr. Tryan, setting out
10426: from Mr. Landor’s with a party of his friends who had assembled there,
10427: was soon joined by two other groups from Mr. Pratt’s and Mr. Dunn’s; and
10428: stray persons on their way to church naturally falling into rank behind
10429: this leading file, by the time they reached the entrance of Orchard
10430: Street, Mr. Tryan’s friends formed a considerable procession, walking
10431: three or four abreast. It was in Orchard Street, and towards the church
10432: gates, that the chief crowd was collected; and at Mr. Dempster’s
10433: drawing-room window, on the upper floor, a more select assembly of
10434: Anti-Tryanites were gathered to witness the entertaining spectacle of the
10435: Tryanites walking to church amidst the jeers and hootings of the crowd.
10436: 
10437: To prompt the popular wit with appropriate sobriquets, numerous copies of
10438: Mr. Dempster’s play-bill were posted on the walls, in suitably large and
10439: emphatic type. As it is possible that the most industrious collector of
10440: mural literature may not have been fortunate enough to possess himself of
10441: this production, which ought by all means to be preserved amongst the
10442: materials of our provincial religious history, I subjoin a faithful copy.
10443: 
10444:                    GRAND ENTERTAINMENT!!!
10445: 
10446:           To be given at Milby on Sunday evening next, by the
10447: 
10448:                  FAMOUS COMEDIAN, TRY-IT-ON!
10449: 
10450:           And his first-rate company, including not only an

10498:                        To be followed by
10499:                The favourite Cackling Quartette,

10526: 
10527: This satire, though it presents the keenest edge of Milby wit, does not
10528: strike you as lacerating, I imagine. But hatred is like fire--it makes
10529: even light rubbish deadly. And Mr. Dempster’s sarcasms were not merely
10530: visible on the walls; they were reflected in the derisive glances, and
10531: audible in the jeering voices of the crowd. Through this pelting shower
10532: of nicknames and bad puns, with an _ad libitum_ accompaniment of groans,
10533: howls, hisses, and hee-haws, but of no heavier missiles, Mr. Tryan walked
10534: pale and composed, giving his arm to old Mr. Landor, whose step was
10535: feeble. On the other side of him was Mr. Jerome, who still walked firmly,
10536: though his shoulders were slightly bowed.
10537: 
10538: Outwardly Mr. Tryan was composed, but inwardly he was suffering acutely
10539: from these tones of hatred and scorn. However strong his consciousness of
10540: right, he found it no stronger armour against such weapons as derisive
10541: glances and virulent words, than against stones and clubs: his conscience
10542: was in repose, but his sensibility was bruised.
10543: 
10544: Once more only did the Evangelical curate pass up Orchard Street followed
10545: by a train of friends; once more only was there a crowd assembled to
10546: witness his entrance through the church gates. But that second time no
10547: voice was heard above a whisper, and the whispers were words of sorrow
10548: and blessing. That second time, Janet Dempster was not looking on in
10549: scorn and merriment; her eyes were worn with grief and watching, and she
10550: was following her beloved friend and pastor to the grave.
10551: 
10552: 
10553: 
10554: 
10555: Chapter 10
10556: 
10557: 
10558: History, we know, is apt to repeat herself, and to foist very old
10559: incidents upon us with only a slight change of costume. From the time of
10560: Xerxes downwards, we have seen generals playing the braggadocio at the
10561: outset of their campaigns, and conquering the enemy with the greatest
10562: ease in after-dinner speeches. But events are apt to be in disgusting
10563: discrepancy with the anticipations of the most ingenious tacticians; the
10564: difficulties of the expedition are ridiculously at variance with able
10565: calculations; the enemy has the impudence not to fall into confusion as
10566: had been reasonably expected of him; the mind of the gallant general
10567: begins to be distracted by news of intrigues against him at home, and,
10568: notwithstanding the handsome compliments he paid to Providence as his
10569: undoubted patron before setting out, there seems every probability that
10570: the _Te Deums_ will be all on the other side.
10571: 
10572: So it fell out with Mr. Dempster in his memorable campaign against the
10573: Tryanites. After all the premature triumph of the return from Elmstoke,
10574: the battle of the Evening Lecture had been lost; the enemy was in
10575: possession of the field; and the utmost hope remaining was, that by a
10576: harassing guerilla warfare he might be driven to evacuate the country.
10577: 
10578: For some time this sort of warfare was kept up with considerable spirit.
10579: The shafts of Milby ridicule were made more formidable by being poisoned
10580: with calumny; and very ugly stories, narrated with circumstantial
10581: minuteness, were soon in circulation concerning Mr. Tryan and his
10582: hearers, from which stories it was plainly deducible that Evangelicalism
10583: led by a necessary consequence to hypocritical indulgence in vice. Some
10584: old friendships were broken asunder, and there were near relations who
10585: felt that religious differences, unmitigated by any prospect of a legacy,
10586: were a sufficient ground for exhibiting their family antipathy. Mr. Budd
10587: harangued his workmen, and threatened them with dismissal if they or
10588: their families were known to attend the evening lecture; and Mr.
10589: Tomlinson, on discovering that his foreman was a rank Tryanite, blustered
10590: to a great extent, and would have cashiered that valuable functionary on
10591: the spot, if such a retributive procedure had not been inconvenient.
10592: 
10593: On the whole, however, at the end of a few months, the balance of
10594: substantial loss was on the side of the Anti-Tryanites. Mr. Pratt,
10595: indeed, had lost a patient or two besides Mr. Dempster’s family; but as
10596: it was evident that Evangelicalism had not dried up the stream of his
10597: anecdote, or in the least altered his view of any lady’s constitution, it
10598: is probable that a change accompanied by so few outward and visible
10599: signs, was rather the pretext than the ground of his dismissal in those
10600: additional cases. Mr. Dunn was threatened with the loss of several good
10601: customers, Mrs. Phipps and Mrs. Lowme having set the example of ordering
10602: him to send in his bill; and the draper began to look forward to his next
10603: stock-taking with an anxiety which was but slightly mitigated by the
10604: parallel his wife suggested between his own case and that of Shadrach,
10605: Meshech, and Abednego, who were thrust into a burning fiery furnace. For,
10606: as he observed to her the next morning, with that perspicacity which
10607: belongs to the period of shaving, whereas their deliverance consisted in
10608: the fact that their linen and woollen goods were not consumed, his own
10609: deliverance lay in precisely the opposite result. But convenience, that
10610: admirable branch system from the main line of self-interest, makes us all
10611: fellow-helpers in spite of adverse resolutions. It is probable that no
10612: speculative or theological hatred would be ultimately strong enough to
10613: resist the persuasive power of convenience: that a latitudinarian baker,
10614: whose bread was honourably free from alum, would command the custom of
10615: any dyspeptic Puseyite; that an Arminian with the toothache would prefer
10616: a skilful Calvinistic dentist to a bungler stanch against the doctrines
10617: of Election and Final Perseverance, who would be likely to break the
10618: tooth in his head; and that a Plymouth Brother, who had a well furnished
10619: grocery shop in a favourable vicinage, would occasionally have the
10620: pleasure of furnishing sugar or vinegar to orthodox families that found
10621: themselves unexpectedly ‘out of’ those indispensable commodities. In this
10622: persuasive power of convenience lay Mr. Dunn’s ultimate security from
10623: martyrdom. His drapery was the best in Milby; the comfortable use and
10624: wont of procuring satisfactory articles at a moment’s notice proved too
10625: strong for Anti-Tryanite zeal; and the draper could soon look forward to
10626: his next stock-taking without the support of a Scriptural parallel.
10627: 
10628: On the other hand, Mr. Dempster had lost his excellent client, Mr.
10629: Jerome--a loss which galled him out of proportion to the mere monetary
10630: deficit it represented. The attorney loved money, but he loved power
10631: still better. He had always been proud of having early won the confidence
10632: of a conventicle-goer, and of being able to ‘turn the prop of Salem round
10633: his thumb’. Like most other men, too, he had a certain kindness towards
10634: those who had employed him when he was only starting in life; and just as
10635: we do not like to part with an old weather-glass from our study, or a
10636: two-feet ruler that we have carried in our pocket ever since we began
10637: business, so Mr. Dempster did not like having to erase his old client’s
10638: name from the accustomed drawer in the bureau. Our habitual life is like
10639: a wall hung with pictures, which has been shone on by the suns of many
10640: years: take one of the pictures away, and it leaves a definite blank
10641: space, to which our eyes can never turn without a sensation of
10642: discomfort. Nay, the involuntary loss of any familiar object almost
10643: always brings a chill as from an evil omen; it seems to be the first
10644: finger-shadow of advancing death.
10645: 
10646: From all these causes combined, Mr. Dempster could never think of his
10647: lost client without strong irritation, and the very sight of Mr. Jerome
10648: passing in the street was wormwood to him.
10649: 
10650: One day, when the old gentleman was coming up Orchard Street on his roan
10651: mare, shaking the bridle, and tickling her flank with the whip as usual,
10652: though there was a perfect mutual understanding that she was not to
10653: quicken her pace, Janet happened to be on her own door-step, and he could
10654: not resist the temptation of stopping to speak to that ‘nice little
10655: woman’, as he always called her, though she was taller than all the rest
10656: of his feminine acquaintances. Janet, in spite of her disposition to take
10657: her husband’s part in all public matters, could bear no malice against
10658: her old friend; so they shook hands.
10659: 
10660: ‘Well, Mrs. Dempster, I’m sorry to my heart not to see you sometimes,
10661: that I am,’ said Mr. Jerome, in a plaintive tone. ‘But if you’ve got any
10662: poor people as wants help, and you know’s deservin’, send ’em to me, send
10663: ’em to me, just the same.’
10664: 
10665: ‘Thank you, Mr. Jerome, that I will. Good-bye.’
10666: 
10667: Janet made the interview as short as she could, but it was not short
10668: enough to escape the observation of her husband, who, as she feared, was
10669: on his mid-day return from his office at the other end of the street, and
10670: this offence of hers, in speaking to Mr. Jerome, was the frequently
10671: recurring theme of Mr. Dempster’s objurgatory domestic eloquence.
10672: 
10673: Associating the loss of his old client with Mr. Tryan’s influence,
10674: Dempster began to know more distinctly why he hated the obnoxious curate.
10675: But a passionate hate, as well as a passionate love, demands some leisure
10676: and mental freedom. Persecution and revenge, like courtship and toadyism,
10677: will not prosper without a considerable expenditure of time and
10678: ingenuity, and these are not to spare with a man whose law-business and
10679: liver are both beginning to show unpleasant symptoms. Such was the
10680: disagreeable turn affairs were taking with Mr. Dempster, and, like the
10681: general distracted by home intrigues, he was too much harassed himself to
10682: lay ingenious plans for harassing the enemy.
10683: 
10684: Meanwhile, the evening lecture drew larger and larger congregations; not
10685: perhaps attracting many from that select aristocratic circle in which the
10686: Lowmes and Pittmans were predominant, but winning the larger proportion
10687: of Mr. Crewe’s morning and afternoon hearers, and thinning Mr. Stickney’s
10688: evening audiences at Salem. Evangelicalism was making its way in Milby,
10689: and gradually diffusing its subtle odour into chambers that were bolted
10690: and barred against it. The movement, like all other religious ‘revivals’,
10691: had a mixed effect. Religious ideas have the fate of melodies, which,
10692: once set afloat in the world, are taken up by all sorts of instruments,
10693: some of them woefully coarse, feeble, or out of tune, until people are in
10694: danger of crying out that the melody itself is detestable. It may be that
10695: some of Mr. Tryan’s hearers had gained a religious vocabulary rather than
10696: religious experience; that here and there a weaver’s wife, who, a few
10697: months before, had been simply a silly slattern, was converted into that
10698: more complex nuisance, a silly and sanctimonious slattern; that the old
10699: Adam, with the pertinacity of middle age, continued to tell fibs behind
10700: the counter, notwithstanding the new Adam’s addiction to Bible-reading
10701: and family prayer: that the children in the Paddiford Sunday school had
10702: their memories crammed with phrases about the blood of cleansing, imputed
10703: righteousness, and justification by faith alone, which an experience
10704: lying principally in chuck-farthing, hop-scotch, parental slappings, and
10705: longings after unattainable lollypop, served rather to darken than to
10706: illustrate; and that at Milby, in those distant days, as in all other
10707: times and places where the mental atmosphere is changing, and men are
10708: inhaling the stimulus of new ideas, folly often mistook itself for
10709: wisdom, ignorance gave itself airs of knowledge, and selfishness, turning
10710: its eyes upward, called itself religion.
10711: 
10712: Nevertheless, Evangelicalism had brought into palpable existence and
10713: operation in Milby society that idea of duty, that recognition of
10714: something to be lived for beyond the mere satisfaction of self, which is
10715: to the moral life what the addition of a great central ganglion is to
10716: animal life. No man can begin to mould himself on a faith or an idea
10717: without rising to a higher order of experience: a principle of
10718: subordination, of self-mastery, has been introduced into his nature; he
10719: is no longer a mere bundle of impressions, desires, and impulses.
10720: Whatever might be the weaknesses of the ladies who pruned the luxuriance
10721: of their lace and ribbons, cut out garments for the poor, distributed
10722: tracts, quoted Scripture, and defined the true Gospel, they had learned
10723: this--that there was a divine work to be done in life, a rule of goodness
10724: higher than the opinion of their neighbours; and if the notion of a
10725: heaven in reserve for themselves was a little too prominent, yet the
10726: theory of fitness for that heaven consisted in purity of heart, in
10727: Christ-like compassion, in the subduing of selfish desires. They might
10728: give the name of piety to much that was only puritanic egoism; they might
10729: call many things sin that were not sin; but they had at least the feeling
10730: that sin was to be avoided and resisted, and colour-blindness, which may
10731: mistake drab for scarlet, is better than total blindness, which sees no
10732: distinction of colour at all. Miss Rebecca Linnet, in quiet attire, with
10733: a somewhat excessive solemnity of countenance, teaching at the Sunday
10734: school, visiting the poor, and striving after a standard of purity and
10735: goodness, had surely more moral loveliness than in those flaunting
10736: peony-days, when she had no other model than the costumes of the heroines
10737: in the circulating library. Miss Eliza Pratt, listening in rapt attention
10738: to Mr. Tryan’s evening lecture, no doubt found evangelical channels for
10739: vanity and egoism; but she was clearly in moral advance of Miss Phipps
10740: giggling under her feathers at old Mr. Crewe’s peculiarities of
10741: enunciation. And even elderly fathers and mothers, with minds, like Mrs.
10742: Linnet’s, too tough to imbibe much doctrine, were the better for having
10743: their hearts inclined towards the new preacher as a messenger from God.
10744: They became ashamed, perhaps, of their evil tempers, ashamed of their
10745: worldliness, ashamed of their trivial, futile past. The first condition
10746: of human goodness is something to love; the second, something to
10747: reverence. And this latter precious gift was brought to Milby by Mr.
10748: Tryan and Evangelicalism.
10749: 
10750: Yes, the movement was good, though it had that mixture of folly and evil
10751: which often makes what is good an offence to feeble and fastidious minds,
10752: who want human actions and characters riddled through the sieve of their
10753: own ideas, before they can accord their sympathy or admiration. Such
10754: minds, I daresay, would have found Mr. Tryan’s character very much in
10755: need of that riddling process. The blessed work of helping the world
10756: forward, happily does not wait to be done by perfect men; and I should
10757: imagine that neither Luther nor John Bunyan, for example, would have
10758: satisfied the modern demand for an ideal hero, who believes nothing but
10759: what is true, feels nothing but what is exalted, and does nothing but
10760: what is graceful. The real heroes, of God’s making, are quite different:
10761: they have their natural heritage of love and conscience which they drew
10762: in with their mother’s milk; they know one or two of those deep spiritual
10763: truths which are only to be won by long wrestling with their own sins and
10764: their own sorrows; they have earned faith and strength so far as they
10765: have done genuine work; but the rest is dry barren theory, blank
10766: prejudice, vague hearsay. Their insight is blended with mere opinion;
10767: their sympathy is perhaps confined in narrow conduits of doctrine,
10768: instead of flowing forth with the freedom of a stream that blesses every
10769: weed in its course; obstinacy or self-assertion will often interfuse
10770: itself with their grandest impulses; and their very deeds of
10771: self-sacrifice are sometimes only the rebound of a passionate egoism. So
10772: it was with Mr. Tryan: and any one looking at him with the bird’s-eye
10773: glance of a critic might perhaps say that he made the mistake of
10774: identifying Christianity with a too narrow doctrinal system; that he saw
10775: God’s work too exclusively in antagonism to the world, the flesh, and the
10776: devil; that his intellectual culture was too limited--and so on; making
10777: Mr. Tryan the text for a wise discourse on the characteristics of the
10778: Evangelical school in his day.
10779: 
10780: But I am not poised at that lofty height. I am on the level and in the
10781: press with him, as he struggles his way along the stony road, through the
10782: crowd of unloving fellow-men. He is stumbling, perhaps; his heart now
10783: beats fast with dread, now heavily with anguish; his eyes are sometimes
10784: dim with tears, which he makes haste to dash away; he pushes manfully on,
10785: with fluctuating faith and courage, with a sensitive failing body; at
10786: last he falls, the struggle is ended, and the crowd closes over the space
10787: he has left.
10788: 
10789: ‘One of the Evangelical clergy, a disciple of Venn,’ says the critic from
10790: his bird’s-eye station. ‘Not a remarkable specimen; the anatomy and
10791: habits of his species have been determined long ago.’
10792: 
10793: Yet surely, surely the only true knowledge of our fellow-man is that
10794: which enables us to feel with him--which gives us a fine ear for the
10795: heart-pulses that are beating under the mere clothes of circumstance and
10796: opinion. Our subtlest analysis of schools and sects must miss the
10797: essential truth, unless it be lit up by the love that sees in all forms
10798: of human thought and work, the life and death struggles of separate human
10799: beings.
10800:

10804: Chapter 11
10805: 
10806: 
10807: Mr. Tryan’s most unfriendly observers were obliged to admit that he gave
10808: himself no rest. Three sermons on Sunday, a night-school for young men on
10809: Tuesday, a cottage-lecture on Thursday, addresses to school-teachers, and
10810: catechizing of school-children, with pastoral visits, multiplying as his
10811: influence extended beyond his own district of Paddiford Common, would
10812: have been enough to tax severely the powers of a much stronger man. Mr.
10813: Pratt remonstrated with him on his imprudence, but could not prevail on
10814: him so far to economize time and strength as to keep a horse. On some
10815: ground or other, which his friends found difficult to explain to
10816: themselves, Mr. Tryan seemed bent on wearing himself out. His enemies
10817: were at no loss to account for such a course. The Evangelical curate’s
10818: selfishness was clearly of too bad a kind to exhibit itself after the
10819: ordinary manner of a sound, respectable selfishness. ‘He wants to get the
10820: reputation of a saint,’ said one; ‘He’s eaten up with spiritual pride,’
10821: said another; ‘He’s got his eye on some fine living, and wants to creep
10822: up the Bishop’s sleeve,’ said a third.
10823: 
10824: Mr. Stickney, of Salem, who considered all voluntary discomfort as a
10825: remnant of the legal spirit, pronounced a severe condemnation on this
10826: self-neglect, and expressed his fear that Mr. Tryan was still far from
10827: having attained true Christian liberty. Good Mr. Jerome eagerly seized
10828: this doctrinal view of the subject as a means of enforcing the
10829: suggestions of his own benevolence; and one cloudy afternoon, in the end
10830: of November, he mounted his roan mare with the determination of riding to
10831: Paddiford and ‘arguying’ the point with Mr. Tryan.
10832: 
10833: The old gentleman’s face looked very mournful as he rode along the dismal
10834: Paddiford lanes, between rows of grimy houses, darkened with hand-looms,
10835: while the black dust was whirled about him by the cold November wind. He
10836: was thinking of the object which had brought him on this afternoon ride,
10837: and his thoughts, according to his habit when alone, found vent every now
10838: and then in audible speech. It seemed to him, as his eyes rested on this
10839: scene of Mr. Tryan’s labours, that he could understand the clergyman’s
10840: self-privation without resorting to Mr. Stickney’s theory of defective
10841: spiritual enlightenment. Do not philosophic doctors tell us that we are
10842: unable to discern so much as a tree, except by an unconscious cunning
10843: which combines many past and separate sensations; that no one sense is
10844: independent of another, so that in the dark we can hardly taste a
10845: fricassee, or tell whether our pipe is alight or not, and the most
10846: intelligent boy, if accommodated with claws or hoofs instead of fingers,
10847: would be likely to remain on the lowest form? If so, it is easy to
10848: understand that our discernment of men’s motives must depend on the
10849: completeness of the elements we can bring from our own susceptibility and
10850: our own experience. See to it, friend, before you pronounce a too hasty
10851: judgement, that your own moral sensibilities are not of a hoofed or
10852: clawed character. The keenest eye will not serve, unless you have the
10853: delicate fingers, with their subtle nerve filaments, which elude
10854: scientific lenses, and lose themselves in the invisible world of human
10855: sensations.
10856: 
10857: As for Mr. Jerome, he drew the elements of his moral vision from the
10858: depths of his veneration and pity. If he himself felt so much for these
10859: poor things to whom life was so dim and meagre, what must the clergyman
10860: feel who had undertaken before God to be their shepherd?
10861: 
10862: ‘Ah!’ he whispered, interruptedly, ‘it’s too big a load for his
10863: conscience, poor man! He wants to mek himself their brother, like; can’t
10864: abide to preach to the fastin’ on a full stomach. Ah! he’s better nor we
10865: are, that’s it--he’s a deal better nor we are.’
10866: 
10867: Here Mr. Jerome shook his bridle violently, and looked up with an air of
10868: moral courage, as if Mr. Stickney had been present, and liable to take
10869: offence at this conclusion. A few minutes more brought him in front of
10870: Mrs. Wagstaff’s, where Mr. Tryan lodged. He had often been here before,
10871: so that the contrast between this ugly square brick house, with its
10872: shabby bit of grass-plot, stared at all round by cottage windows, and his
10873: own pretty white home, set in a paradise of orchard and garden and
10874: pasture was not new to him; but he felt it with fresh force to-day, as he
10875: slowly fastened his roan by the bridle to the wooden paling, and knocked
10876: at the door. Mr. Tryan was at home, and sent to request that Mr. Jerome
10877: would walk up into his study, as the fire was out in the parlour below.
10878: 
10879: At the mention of a clergyman’s study, perhaps, your too active
10880: imagination conjures up a perfect snuggery, where the general air of
10881: comfort is rescued from a secular character by strong ecclesiastical
10882: suggestions in the shape of the furniture, the pattern of the carpet, and
10883: the prints on the wall; where, if a nap is taken, it is an easy-chair
10884: with a Gothic back, and the very feet rest on a warm and velvety
10885: simulation of church windows; where the pure art of rigorous English
10886: Protestantism smiles above the mantelpiece in the portrait of an eminent
10887: bishop, or a refined Anglican taste is indicated by a German print from
10888: Overbeck; where the walls are lined with choice divinity in sombre
10889: binding, and the light is softened by a screen of boughs with a grey
10890: church in the background.
10891: 
10892: But I must beg you to dismiss all such scenic prettiness, suitable as
10893: they may be to a clergyman’s character and complexion; for I have to
10894: confess that Mr. Tryan’s study was a very ugly little room indeed, with
10895: an ugly slapdash pattern on the walls, an ugly carpet on the floor, and
10896: an ugly view of cottage roofs and cabbage-gardens from the window. His
10897: own person, his writing table, and his bookcase, were the only objects in
10898: the room that had the slightest air of refinement; and the sole provision
10899: for comfort was a clumsy straight-backed arm-chair covered with faded
10900: chintz. The man who could live in such a room, unconstrained by poverty,
10901: must either have his vision fed from within by an intense passion, or he
10902: must have chosen that least attractive form of self-mortification which
10903: wears no haircloth and has no meagre days, but accepts the vulgar, the
10904: commonplace, and the ugly, whenever the highest duty seems to lie among
10905: them.
10906: 
10907: ‘Mr. Tryan, I hope you’ll excuse me disturbin’ on you,’ said Mr. Jerome.
10908: ‘But I’d summat partickler to say.’
10909: 
10910: ‘You don’t disturb me at all, Mr. Jerome; I’m very glad to have a visit
10911: from you,’ said Mr. Tryan, shaking him heartily by the hand, and offering
10912: him the chintz-covered ‘easy’ chair; ‘it is some time since I’ve had an
10913: opportunity of seeing you, except on a Sunday.’
10914: 
10915: ‘Ah, sir! your time’s so taken up, I’m well aware o’ that; it’s not only
10916: what you hev to do, but it’s goin’ about from place to place; an’ you
10917: don’t keep a hoss, Mr. Tryan. You don’t take care enough o’ yourself--you
10918: don’t indeed, an’ that’s what I come to talk to y’ about.’
10919: 
10920: ‘That’s very good of you, Mr. Jerome; but I assure you I think walking
10921: does me no harm. It is rather a relief to me after speaking or writing.
10922: You know I have no great circuit to make. The farthest distance I have to
10923: walk is to Milby Church, and if ever I want a horse on a Sunday, I hire
10924: Radley’s, who lives not many hundred yards from me.’
10925: 
10926: ‘Well, but now! the winter’s comin’ on, an’ you’ll get wet i’ your feet,
10927: an’ Pratt tells me as your constitution’s dillicate, as anybody may see,
10928: for the matter o’ that, wi’out bein’ a doctor. An’ this is the light I
10929: look at it in, Mr. Tryan: who’s to fill up your place, if you was to be
10930: disabled, as I may say? Consider what a valyable life yours is. You’ve
10931: begun a great work i’ Milby, and so you might carry it on, if you’d your
10932: health and strength. The more care you take o’ yourself, the longer
10933: you’ll live, belike, God willing, to do good to your fellow-creaturs.’
10934: 
10935: ‘Why, my dear Mr. Jerome, I think I should not be a long-lived man in any
10936: case; and if I were to take care of myself under the pretext of doing
10937: more good, I should very likely die and leave nothing done after all.’
10938: 
10939: ‘Well! but keepin’ a hoss wouldn’t hinder you from workin’. It ’ud help
10940: you to do more, though Pratt says as it’s usin’ your voice so constant as
10941: does you the most harm. Now, isn’t it--I’m no scholard, Mr. Tryan, an’
10942: I’m not a-goin’ to dictate to you--but isn’t it a’most a-killin’ o’
10943: yourself, to go on a’ that way beyond your strength? We mustn’t fling
10944: ower lives away.’
10945: 
10946: ‘No, not fling them away lightly, but we are permitted to lay down our
10947: lives in a right cause. There are many duties, as you know, Mr. Jerome,
10948: which stand before taking care of our own lives.’
10949: 
10950: ‘Ah! I can’t arguy wi’ you, Mr. Tryan; but what I wanted to say’s
10951: this--There’s my little chacenut hoss; I should take it quite a kindness
10952: if you’d hev him through the winter an’ ride him. I’ve thought o’ sellin’
10953: him a many times, for Mrs. Jerome can’t abide him; and what do I want wi’
10954: two nags? But I’m fond o’ the little chacenut, an’ I shouldn’t like to
10955: sell him. So if you’ll only ride him for me, you’ll do me a kindness--you
10956: will, indeed, Mr. Tryan.’
10957: 
10958: ‘Thank you, Mr. Jerome. I promise you to ask for him, when I feel that I
10959: want a nag. There is no man I would more gladly be indebted to than you;
10960: but at present I would rather not have a horse. I should ride him very
10961: little, and it would be an inconvenience to me to keep him rather than
10962: otherwise.’
10963: 
10964: Mr. Jerome looked troubled and hesitating, as if he had something on his
10965: mind that would not readily shape itself into words. At last he said,
10966: ‘You’ll excuse me, Mr. Tryan, I wouldn’t be takin’ a liberty, but I know
10967: what great claims you hev on you as a clergyman. Is it th’ expense, Mr.
10968: Tryan? is it the money?’
10969: 
10970: ‘No, my dear sir. I have much more than a single man needs. My way of
10971: living is quite of my own choosing, and I am doing nothing but what I
10972: feel bound to do, quite apart from money considerations. We cannot judge
10973: for one another, you know; we have each our peculiar weaknesses and
10974: temptations. I quite admit that it might be right for another man to
10975: allow himself more luxuries, and I assure you I think it no superiority
10976: in myself to do without them. On the contrary, if my heart were less
10977: rebellious, and if I were less liable to temptation, I should not need
10978: that sort of self-denial. But,’ added Mr. Tryan, holding out his hand to
10979: Mr. Jerome, ‘I understand your kindness, and bless you for it. If I want
10980: a horse, I shall ask for the chesnut.’
10981: 
10982: Mr. Jerome was obliged to rest contented with this promise, and rode home
10983: sorrowfully, reproaching himself with not having said one thing he meant
10984: to say when setting out, and with having ‘clean forgot’ the arguments he
10985: had intended to quote from Mr. Stickney.
10986: 
10987: Mr. Jerome’s was not the only mind that was seriously disturbed by the
10988: idea that the curate was over-working himself. There were tender women’s
10989: hearts in which anxiety about the state of his affections was beginning
10990: to be merged in anxiety about the state of his health. Miss Eliza Pratt
10991: had at one time passed through much sleepless cogitation on the
10992: possibility of Mr. Tryan’s being attached to some lady at a distance--at
10993: Laxeter, perhaps, where he had formerly held a curacy; and her fine eyes
10994: kept close watch lest any symptom of engaged affections on his part
10995: should escape her. It seemed an alarming fact that his handkerchiefs were
10996: beautifully marked with hair, until she reflected that he had an
10997: unmarried sister of whom he spoke with much affection as his father’s
10998: companion and comforter. Besides, Mr. Tryan had never paid any distant
10999: visit, except one for a few days to his father, and no hint escaped him
11000: of his intending to take a house, or change his mode of living. No! he
11001: could not be engaged, though he might have been disappointed. But this
11002: latter misfortune is one from which a devoted clergyman has been known to
11003: recover, by the aid of a fine pair of grey eyes that beam on him with
11004: affectionate reverence. Before Christmas, however, her cogitations began
11005: to take another turn. She heard her father say very confidently that
11006: ‘Tryan was consumptive, and if he didn’t take more care of himself, his
11007: life would not be worth a year’s purchase;’ and shame at having
11008: speculated on suppositions that were likely to prove so false, sent poor
11009: Miss Eliza’s feelings with all the stronger impetus into the one channel
11010: of sorrowful alarm at the prospect of losing the pastor who had opened to
11011: her a new life of piety and self-subjection. It is a sad weakness in us,
11012: after all, that the thought of a man’s death hallows him anew to us; as
11013: if life were not sacred too--as if it were comparatively a light thing to
11014: fail in love and reverence to the brother who has to climb the whole
11015: toilsome steep with us, and all our tears and tenderness were due to the
11016: one who is spared that hard journey.
11017: 
11018: The Miss Linnets, too, were beginning to take a new view of the future,
11019: entirely uncoloured by jealousy of Miss Eliza Pratt.
11020: 
11021: ‘Did you notice,’ said Mary, one afternoon when Mrs. Pettifer was taking
11022: tea with them--‘did you notice that short dry cough of Mr. Tryan’s
11023: yesterday? I think he looks worse and worse every week, and I only wish I
11024: knew his sister; I would write to her about him. I’m sure something
11025: should be done to make him give up part of his work, and he will listen
11026: to no one here.’
11027: 
11028: ‘Ah,’ said Mrs. Pettifer, ‘it’s a thousand pities his father and sister
11029: can’t come and live with him, if he isn’t to marry. But I wish with all
11030: my heart he could have taken to some nice woman as would have made a
11031: comfortable home for him. I used to think he might take to Eliza Pratt;
11032: she’s a good girl, and very pretty; but I see no likelihood of it now.’
11033: 
11034: ‘No, indeed,’ said Rebecca, with some emphasis: ‘Mr. Tryan’s heart is not
11035: for any woman to win; it is all given to his work; and I could never wish
11036: to see him with a young inexperienced wife who would be a drag on him
11037: instead of a helpmate.’
11038: 
11039: ‘He’d need have somebody, young or old,’ observed Mrs. Linnet, ‘to see as
11040: he wears a flannel wescoat, an’ changes his stockins when he comes in.
11041: It’s my opinion he’s got that cough wi’ sittin i’ wet shoes and stockins;
11042: an’ that Mrs. Wagstaff’s a poor addle-headed thing; she doesn’t half tek
11043: care on him.’
11044: 
11045: ‘O mother!’ said Rebecca, ‘she’s a very pious woman. And I’m sure she
11046: thinks it too great a privilege to have Mr. Tryan with her, not to do the
11047: best she can to make him comfortable. She can’t help her rooms being
11048: shabby.’
11049: 
11050: ‘I’ve nothing to say again’ her piety, my dear; but I know very well I
11051: shouldn’t like her to cook my victual. When a man comes in hungry an’
11052: tired, piety won’t feed him, I reckon. Hard carrots ’ull lie heavy on his
11053: stomach, piety or no piety. I called in one day when she was dishin’ up
11054: Mr. Tryan’s dinner, an’ I could see the potatoes was as watery as watery.
11055: It’s right enough to be speritial--I’m no enemy to that; but I like my
11056: potatoes mealy. I don’t see as anybody ’ull go to heaven the sooner for
11057: not digestin’ their dinner--providin’ they don’t die sooner, as mayhap
11058: Mr. Tryan will, poor dear man!’
11059: 
11060: ‘It will be a heavy day for us all when that comes to pass,’ said Mrs.
11061: Pettifer. ‘We shall never get anybody to fill up _that_ gap. There’s the
11062: new clergyman that’s just come to Shepperton--Mr. Parry; I saw him the
11063: other day at Mrs. Bond’s. He may be a very good man, and a fine preacher;
11064: they say he is; but I thought to myself, What a difference between him
11065: and Mr. Tryan! He’s a sharp-sort-of-looking man, and hasn’t that feeling
11066: way with him that Mr. Tryan has. What is so wonderful to me in Mr. Tryan
11067: is the way he puts himself on a level with one, and talks to one like a
11068: brother. I’m never afraid of telling him anything. He never seems to look
11069: down on anybody. He knows how to lift up those that are cast down, if
11070: ever man did.’
11071: 
11072: ‘Yes,’ said Mary. ‘And when I see all the faces turned up to him in
11073: Paddiford Church, I often think how hard it would be for any clergyman
11074: who had to come after him; he has made the people love him so.’
11075: 
11076: 
11077: 
11078: 
11079: Chapter 12
11080: 
11081: 
11082: In her occasional visits to her near neighbour Mrs. Pettifer, too old a
11083: friend to be shunned because she was a Tryanite, Janet was obliged
11084: sometimes to hear allusions to Mr. Tryan, and even to listen to his
11085: praises, which she usually met with playful incredulity.
11086: 
11087: ‘Ah, well,’ she answered one day, ‘I like dear old Mr. Crewe and his
11088: pipes a great deal better than your Mr. Tryan and his Gospel. When I was
11089: a little toddle, Mr. and Mrs. Crewe used to let me play about in their
11090: garden, and have a swing between the great elm-trees, because mother had
11091: no garden. I like people who are kind; kindness is my religion; and
11092: that’s the reason I like you, dear Mrs. Pettifer, though you are a
11093: Tryanite.’
11094: 
11095: ‘But that’s Mr. Tryan’s religion too--at least partly. There’s nobody can
11096: give himself up more to doing good amongst the poor; and he thinks of
11097: their bodies too, as well as their souls.’
11098: 
11099: ‘O yes, yes; but then he talks about faith, and grace, and all that,
11100: making people believe they are better than others, and that God loves
11101: them more than He does the rest of the world. I know he has put a great
11102: deal of that into Sally Martin’s head, and it has done her no good at
11103: all. She was as nice, honest, patient a girl as need be before; and now
11104: she fancies she has new light and new wisdom. I don’t like those
11105: notions.’
11106: 
11107: ‘You mistake him, indeed you do, my dear Mrs. Dempster; I wish you’d go
11108: and hear him preach.’
11109: 
11110: ‘Hear him preach! Why, you wicked woman, you would persuade me to disobey
11111: my husband, would you? O, shocking! I shall run away from you. Good-bye.’
11112: 
11113: A few days after this conversation, however, Janet went to Sally Martin’s
11114: about three o’clock in the afternoon. The pudding that had been sent in
11115: for herself and ‘Mammy,’ struck her as just the sort of delicate morsel
11116: the poor consumptive girl would be likely to fancy, and in her usual
11117: impulsive way she had started up from the dinner table at once, put on
11118: her bonnet, and set off with a covered plateful to the neighbouring
11119: street. When she entered the house there was no one to be seen; but in
11120: the little sideroom where Sally lay, Janet heard a voice. It was one she
11121: had not heard before, but she immediately guessed it to be Mr. Tryan’s.
11122: Her first impulse was to set down her plate and go away, but Mrs. Martin
11123: might not be in, and then there would be no one to give Sally that
11124: delicious bit of pudding. So she stood still, and was obliged to hear
11125: what Mr. Tryan was saying. He was interrupted by one of the invalid’s
11126: violent fits of coughing.
11127: 
11128: ‘It is very hard to bear, is it not?’ he said when she was still again.
11129: ‘Yet God seems to support you under it wonderfully. Pray for me, Sally,
11130: that I may have strength too when the hour of great suffering comes. It
11131: is one of my worst weaknesses to shrink from bodily pain, and I think the
11132: time is perhaps not far off when I shall have to bear what you are
11133: bearing. But now I have tired you. We have talked enough. Good-bye.’
11134: 
11135: Janet was surprised, and forgot her wish not to encounter Mr. Tryan: the
11136: tone and the words were so unlike what she had expected to hear. There
11137: was none of the self-satisfied unction of the teacher, quoting, or
11138: exhorting, or expounding, for the benefit of the hearer, but a simple
11139: appeal for help, a confession of weakness. Mr. Tryan had his deeply-felt
11140: troubles, then? Mr. Tryan, too, like herself, knew what it was to tremble
11141: at a foreseen trial--to shudder at an impending burthen, heavier than he
11142: felt able to bear?
11143: 
11144: The most brilliant deed of virtue could not have inclined Janet’s
11145: good-will towards Mr. Tryan so much as this fellowship in suffering, and
11146: the softening thought was in her eyes when he appeared in the doorway,
11147: pale, weary, and depressed. The sight of Janet standing there with the
11148: entire absence of self-consciousness which belongs to a new and vivid
11149: impression, made him start and pause a little. Their eyes met, and they
11150: looked at each other gravely for a few moments. Then they bowed, and Mr.
11151: Tryan passed out.
11152: 
11153: There is a power in the direct glance of a sincere and loving human soul,
11154: which will do more to dissipate prejudice and kindle charity than the
11155: most elaborate arguments. The fullest exposition of Mr. Tryan’s doctrine
11156: might not have sufficed to convince Janet that he had not an odious
11157: self-complacency in believing himself a peculiar child of God; but one
11158: direct, pathetic look of his had dissociated him with that conception for
11159: ever.
11160: 
11161: This happened late in the autumn, not long before Sally Martin died.
11162: Janet mentioned her new impression to no one, for she was afraid of
11163: arriving at a still more complete contradiction of her former ideas. We
11164: have all of us considerable regard for our past self, and are not fond of
11165: casting reflections on that respected individual by a total negation of
11166: his opinions. Janet could no longer think of Mr. Tryan without sympathy,
11167: but she still shrank from the idea of becoming his hearer and admirer.
11168: That was a reversal of the past which was as little accordant with her
11169: inclination as her circumstances.
11170: 
11171: And indeed this interview with Mr. Tryan was soon thrust into the
11172: background of poor Janet’s memory by the daily thickening miseries of her
11173: life.
11174:

11177: 
11178: Chapter 13
11179: 
11180: 
11181: The loss of Mr. Jerome as a client proved only the beginning of
11182: annoyances to Dempster. That old gentleman had in him the vigorous
11183: remnant of an energy and perseverance which had created his own fortune;
11184: and being, as I have hinted, given to chewing the cud of a righteous
11185: indignation with considerable relish, he was determined to carry on his
11186: retributive war against the persecuting attorney. Having some influence
11187: with Mr. Pryme, who was one of the most substantial ratepayers in the
11188: neighbouring parish of Dingley, and who had himself a complex and
11189: long-standing private account with Dempster, Mr. Jerome stirred up this
11190: gentleman to an investigation of some suspicious points in the attorney’s
11191: conduct of the parish affairs. The natural consequence was a personal
11192: quarrel between Dempster and Mr. Pryme; the client demanded his account,
11193: and then followed the old story of an exorbitant lawyer’s bill, with the
11194: unpleasant anti-climax of taxing.
11195: 
11196: These disagreeables, extending over many months, ran along side by side
11197: with the pressing business of Mr. Armstrong’s lawsuit, which was
11198: threatening to take a turn rather depreciatory of Dempster’s professional
11199: prevision; and it is not surprising that, being thus kept in a constant
11200: state of irritated excitement about his own affairs, he had little time
11201: for the further exhibition of his public spirit, or for rallying the
11202: forlorn hope of sound churchmanship against cant and hypocrisy. Not a few
11203: persons who had a grudge against him, began to remark, with satisfaction,
11204: that ‘Dempster’s luck was forsaking him’; particularly Mrs. Linnet, who
11205: thought she saw distinctly the gradual ripening of a providential scheme,
11206: whereby a just retribution would be wrought on the man who had deprived
11207: her of Pye’s Croft. On the other hand, Dempster’s well-satisfied clients,
11208: who were of opinion that the punishment of his wickedness might
11209: conveniently be deferred to another world, noticed with some concern that
11210: he was drinking more than ever, and that both his temper and his driving
11211: were becoming more furious. Unhappily those additional glasses of brandy,
11212: that exasperation of loud-tongued abuse, had other effects than any that
11213: entered into the contemplation of anxious clients: they were the little
11214: super-added symbols that were perpetually raising the sum of home misery.
11215: 
11216: Poor Janet! how heavily the months rolled on for her, laden with fresh
11217: sorrows as the summer passed into autumn, the autumn into winter, and the
11218: winter into spring again. Every feverish morning, with its blank
11219: listlessness and despair, seemed more hateful than the last; every coming
11220: night more impossible to brave without arming herself in leaden stupor.
11221: The morning light brought no gladness to her: it seemed only to throw its
11222: glare on what had happened in the dim candle-light--on the cruel man
11223: seated immovable in drunken obstinacy by the dead fire and dying lights
11224: in the dining-room, rating her in harsh tones, reiterating old
11225: reproaches--or on a hideous blank of something unremembered, something
11226: that must have made that dark bruise on her shoulder, which aches as she
11227: dressed herself.
11228: 
11229: Do you wonder how it was that things had come to this pass--what offence
11230: Janet had committed in the early years of marriage to rouse the brutal
11231: hatred of this man? The seeds of things are very small: the hours that
11232: lie between sunrise and the gloom of midnight are travelled through by
11233: tiniest markings of the clock: and Janet, looking back along the fifteen
11234: years of her married life, hardly knew how or where this total misery
11235: began; hardly knew when the sweet wedded love and hope that had set for
11236: ever had ceased to make a twilight of memory and relenting, before the
11237: on-coming of the utter dark.
11238: 
11239: Old Mrs. Dempster thought she saw the true beginning of it all in Janet’s
11240: want of housekeeping skill and exactness. ‘Janet,’ she said to herself,
11241: ‘was always running about doing things for other people, and neglecting
11242: her own house. That provokes a man: what use is it for a woman to be
11243: loving, and making a fuss with her husband, if she doesn’t take care and
11244: keep his home just as he likes it; if she isn’t at hand when he wants
11245: anything done; if she doesn’t attend to all his wishes, let them be as
11246: small as they may? That was what I did when I was a wife, though I didn’t
11247: make half so much fuss about loving my husband. Then, Janet had no
11248: children.’ ... Ah! there Mammy Dempster had touched a true spring, not
11249: perhaps of her son’s cruelty, but of half Janet’s misery. If she had had
11250: babes to rock to sleep--little ones to kneel in their night-dress and say
11251: their prayers at her knees--sweet boys and girls to put their young arms
11252: round her neck and kiss away her tears, her poor hungry heart would have
11253: been fed with strong love, and might never have needed that fiery poison
11254: to still its cravings. Mighty is the force of motherhood! says the great
11255: tragic poet to us across the ages, finding, as usual, the simplest words
11256: for the sublimest fact--δεινόν τὸ τίκτειν ἐστίν. It transforms all
11257: things by its vital heat: it turns timidity into fierce courage, and
11258: dreadless defiance into tremulous submission; it turns thoughtlessness
11259: into foresight, and yet stills all anxiety into calm content; it makes
11260: selfishness become self-denial, and gives even to hard vanity the
11261: glance of admiring love. Yes! if Janet had been a mother, she might
11262: have been saved from much sin, and therefore from much of her sorrow.
11263: 
11264: But do not believe that it was anything either present or wanting in poor
11265: Janet that formed the motive of her husband’s cruelty. Cruelty, like
11266: every other vice, requires no motive outside itself--it only requires
11267: opportunity. You do not suppose Dempster had any motive for drinking
11268: beyond the craving for drink; the presence of brandy was the only
11269: necessary condition. And an unloving, tyrannous, brutal man needs no
11270: motive to prompt his cruelty; he needs only the perpetual presence of a
11271: woman he can call his own. A whole park full of tame or timid-eyed
11272: animals to torment at his will would not serve him so well to glut his
11273: lust of torture; they could not feel as one woman does; they could not
11274: throw out the keen retort which whets the edge of hatred.
11275: 
11276: Janet’s bitterness would overflow in ready words; she was not to be made
11277: meek by cruelty; she would repent of nothing in the face of injustice,
11278: though she was subdued in a moment by a word or a look that recalled the
11279: old days of fondness; and in times of comparative calm would often
11280: recover her sweet woman’s habit of caressing playful affection. But such
11281: days were become rare, and poor Janet’s soul was kept like a vexed sea,
11282: tossed by a new storm before the old waves have fallen. Proud, angry
11283: resistance and sullen endurance were now almost the only alternations she
11284: knew. She would bear it all proudly to the world, but proudly towards him
11285: too; her woman’s weakness might shriek a cry for pity under a heavy blow,
11286: but voluntarily she would do nothing to mollify him, unless he first
11287: relented. What had she ever done to him but love him too well--but
11288: believe in him too foolishly? He had no pity on her tender flesh; he
11289: could strike the soft neck he had once asked to kiss. Yet she would not
11290: admit her wretchedness; she had married him blindly, and she would bear
11291: it out to the terrible end, whatever that might be. Better this misery
11292: than the blank that lay for her outside her married home.
11293: 
11294: But there was one person who heard all the plaints and all the outbursts
11295: of bitterness and despair which Janet was never tempted to pour into any
11296: other ear; and alas! in her worst moments, Janet would throw out wild
11297: reproaches against that patient listener. For the wrong that rouses our
11298: angry passions finds only a medium in us; it passes through us like a
11299: vibration, and we inflict what we have suffered.
11300: 
11301: Mrs. Raynor saw too clearly all through the winter that things were
11302: getting worse in Orchard Street. She had evidence enough of it in Janet’s
11303: visits to her; and, though her own visits to her daughter were so timed
11304: that she saw little of Dempster personally, she noticed many indications
11305: not only that he was drinking to greater excess, but that he was
11306: beginning to lose that physical power of supporting excess which had long
11307: been the admiration of such fine spirits as Mr. Tomlinson. It seemed as
11308: if Dempster had some consciousness of this--some new distrust of himself;
11309: for, before winter was over, it was observed that he had renounced his
11310: habit of driving out alone, and was never seen in his gig without a
11311: servant by his side.
11312: 
11313: Nemesis is lame, but she is of colossal stature, like the gods; and
11314: sometimes, while her sword is not yet unsheathed, she stretches out her
11315: huge left arm and grasps her victim. The mighty hand is invisible, but
11316: the victim totters under the dire clutch.
11317: 
11318: The various symptoms that things were getting worse with the Dempsters
11319: afforded Milby gossip something new to say on an old subject. Mrs.
11320: Dempster, every one remarked, looked more miserable than ever, though she
11321: kept up the old pretence of being happy and satisfied. She was scarcely
11322: ever seen, as she used to be, going about on her good-natured errands;
11323: and even old Mrs. Crewe, who had always been wilfully blind to anything
11324: wrong in her favourite Janet, was obliged to admit that she had not
11325: seemed like herself lately. ‘The poor thing’s out of health,’ said the
11326: kind little old lady, in answer to all gossip about Janet; ‘her headaches
11327: always were bad, and I know what headaches are; why, they make one quite
11328: delirious sometimes.’ Mrs. Phipps, for her part, declared she would never
11329: accept an invitation to Dempster’s again; it was getting so very
11330: disagreeable to go there, Mrs. Dempster was often ‘so strange’. To be
11331: sure, there were dreadful stories about the way Dempster used his wife;
11332: but in Mrs. Phipps’s opinion, it was six of one and half-a-dozen of the
11333: other. Mrs. Dempster had never been like other women; she had always a
11334: flighty way with her, carrying parcels of snuff to old Mrs. Tooke, and
11335: going to drink tea with Mrs. Brinley, the carpenter’s wife; and then
11336: never taking care of her clothes, always wearing the same things week-day
11337: or Sunday. A man has a poor look-out with a wife of that sort. Mr.
11338: Phipps, amiable and laconic, wondered how it was women were so fond of
11339: running each other down.
11340: 
11341: Mr. Pratt having been called in provisionally to a patient of Mr.
11342: Pilgrim’s in a case of compound fracture, observed in a friendly colloquy
11343: with his brother surgeon the next day,--‘So Dempster has left off driving
11344: himself, I see; he won’t end with a broken neck after all. You’ll have a
11345: case of meningitis and delirium tremens instead.’
11346: 
11347: ‘Ah,’ said Mr. Pilgrim, ‘he can hardly stand it much longer at the rate
11348: he’s going on, one would think. He’s been confoundedly cut up about that
11349: business of Armstrong’s, I fancy. It may do him some harm, perhaps, but
11350: Dempster must have feathered his nest pretty well; he can afford to lose
11351: a little business.’
11352: 
11353: ‘His business will outlast him, that’s pretty clear,’ said Pratt; ‘he’ll
11354: run down like a watch with a broken spring one of these days.’
11355: 
11356: Another prognostic of evil to Dempster came at the beginning of March.
11357: For then little ‘Mamsey’ died--died suddenly. The housemaid found her
11358: seated motionless in her arm-chair, her knitting fallen down, and the
11359: tortoise-shell cat reposing on it unreproved. The little white old woman
11360: had ended her wintry age of patient sorrow, believing to the last that
11361: ‘Robert might have been a good husband as he had been a good son.’
11362: 
11363: When the earth was thrown on Mamsey’s coffin, and the son, in crape scarf
11364: and hatband, turned away homeward, his good angel, lingering with
11365: outstretched wing on the edge of the grave, cast one despairing look
11366: after him, and took flight for ever.
11367: 
11368: 
11369: 
11370: 
11371: Chapter 14
11372: 
11373: 
11374: The last week in March--three weeks after old Mrs. Dempster
11375: died--occurred the unpleasant winding-up of affairs between Dempster and
11376: Mr. Pryme, and under this additional source of irritation the attorney’s
11377: diurnal drunkenness had taken on its most ill-tempered and brutal phase.
11378: On the Friday morning, before setting out for Rotherby, he told his wife
11379: that he had invited ‘four men’ to dinner at half-past six that evening.
11380: The previous night had been a terrible one for Janet, and when her
11381: husband broke his grim morning silence to say these few words, she was
11382: looking so blank and listless that he added in a loud sharp key, ‘Do you
11383: hear what I say? or must I tell the cook?’ She started, and said, ‘Yes, I
11384: hear.’
11385: 
11386: ‘Then mind and have a dinner provided, and don’t go mooning about like
11387: crazy Jane.’
11388: 
11389: Half an hour afterwards Mrs. Raynor, quietly busy in her kitchen with her
11390: household labours--for she had only a little twelve-year-old girl as a
11391: servant--heard with trembling the rattling of the garden gate and the
11392: opening of the outer door. She knew the step, and in one short moment she
11393: lived beforehand through the coming scene. She hurried out of the
11394: kitchen, and there in the passage, as she had felt, stood Janet, her eyes
11395: worn as if by night-long watching, her dress careless, her step languid.
11396: No cheerful morning greeting to her mother--no kiss. She turned into the
11397: parlour, and, seating herself on the sofa opposite her mother’s chair,
11398: looked vacantly at the walls and furniture until the corners of her mouth
11399: began to tremble, and her dark eyes filled with tears that fell unwiped
11400: down her cheeks. The mother sat silently opposite to her, afraid to
11401: speak. She felt sure there was nothing new the matter--sure that the
11402: torrent of words would come sooner or later.
11403: 
11404: ‘Mother! why don’t you speak to me?’ Janet burst out at last; ‘you don’t
11405: care about my suffering; you are blaming me because I feel--because I am
11406: miserable.’
11407: 
11408: ‘My child, I am not blaming you--my heart is bleeding for you. Your head
11409: is bad this morning--you have had a bad night. Let me make you a cup of
11410: tea now. Perhaps you didn’t like your breakfast.’
11411: 
11412: ‘Yes, that is what you always think, mother. It is the old story, you
11413: think. You don’t ask me what it is I have had to bear. You are tired of
11414: hearing me. You are cruel, like the rest; every one is cruel in this
11415: world. Nothing but blame--blame--blame; never any pity. God is cruel to
11416: have sent me into the world to bear all this misery.’
11417: 
11418: ‘Janet, Janet, don’t say so. It is not for us to judge; we must submit;
11419: we must be thankful for the gift of life.’
11420: 
11421: ‘Thankful for life! Why should I be thankful? God has made me with a
11422: heart to feel, and He has sent me nothing but misery. How could I help
11423: it? How could I know what would come? Why didn’t you tell me,
11424: mother?--why did you let me marry? You knew what brutes men could be; and
11425: there’s no help for me--no hope. I can’t kill myself; I’ve tried; but I
11426: can’t leave this world and go to another. There may be no pity for me
11427: there, as there is none here.’
11428: 
11429: ‘Janet, my child, there _is_ pity. Have I ever done anything but love
11430: you? And there is pity in God. Hasn’t He put pity into your heart for
11431: many a poor sufferer? Where did it come from, if not from Him?’
11432: 
11433: Janet’s nervous irritation now broke out into sobs instead of
11434: complainings; and her mother was thankful, for after that crisis there
11435: would very likely come relenting, and tenderness, and comparative calm.
11436: She went out to make some tea, and when she returned with the tray in her
11437: hands, Janet had dried her eyes and now turned them towards her mother
11438: with a faint attempt to smile; but the poor face, in its sad blurred
11439: beauty, looked all the more piteous.
11440: 
11441: ‘Mother will insist upon her tea,’ she said, ‘and I really think I can
11442: drink a cup. But I must go home directly, for there are people coming to
11443: dinner. Could you go with me and help me, mother?’
11444: 
11445: Mrs. Raynor was always ready to do that. She went to Orchard Street with
11446: Janet, and remained with her through the day--comforted, as evening
11447: approached, to see her become more cheerful and willing to attend to her
11448: toilette. At half-past five everything was in order; Janet was dressed;
11449: and when the mother had kissed her and said good-bye, she could not help
11450: pausing a moment in sorrowful admiration at the tall rich figure, looking
11451: all the grander for the plainness of the deep mourning dress, and the
11452: noble face with its massy folds of black hair, made matronly by a simple
11453: white cap. Janet had that enduring beauty which belongs to pure majestic
11454: outline and depth of tint. Sorrow and neglect leave their traces on such
11455: beauty, but it thrills us to the last, like a glorious Greek temple,
11456: which, for all the loss it has suffered from time and barbarous hands,
11457: has gained a solemn history, and fills our imagination the more because
11458: it is incomplete to the sense.
11459: 
11460: It was six o’clock before Dempster returned from Rotherby. He had
11461: evidently drunk a great deal, and was in an angry humour; but Janet, who
11462: had gathered some little courage and forbearance from the consciousness
11463: that she had done her best to-day, was determined to speak pleasantly to
11464: him.
11465: 
11466: ‘Robert,’ she said gently, as she saw him seat himself in the dining-room
11467: in his dusty snuffy clothes, and take some documents out of his pocket,
11468: ‘will you not wash and change your dress? It will refresh you.’
11469: 
11470: ‘Leave me alone, will you?’ said Dempster, in his most brutal tone.
11471: 
11472: ‘Do change your coat and waistcoat, they are so dusty. I’ve laid all your
11473: things out ready.’
11474: 
11475: ‘O, you have, have you?’ After a few minutes he rose very deliberately
11476: and walked up-stairs into his bedroom. Janet had often been scolded before
11477: for not laying out his clothes, and she thought now, not without some
11478: wonder, that this attention of hers had brought him to compliance.
11479: 
11480: Presently he called out, ‘Janet!’ and she went up-stairs.
11481: 
11482: ‘Here! Take that!’ he said, as soon as she reached the door, flinging at
11483: her the coat she had laid out. ‘Another time, leave me to do as I please,
11484: will you?’
11485: 
11486: The coat, flung with great force, only brushed her shoulder, and fell
11487: some distance within the drawing-room, the door of which stood open just
11488: opposite. She hastily retreated as she saw the waistcoat coming, and one
11489: by one the clothes she had laid out were all flung into the drawing-room.
11490: 
11491: Janet’s face flushed with anger, and for the first time in her life her
11492: resentment overcame the long cherished pride that made her hide her
11493: griefs from the world. There are moments when by some strange impulse we
11494: contradict our past selves--fatal moments, when a fit of passion, like a
11495: lava stream, lays low the work of half our lives. Janet thought, ‘I will
11496: not pick up the clothes; they shall lie there until the visitors come,
11497: and he shall be ashamed of himself.’
11498: 
11499: There was a knock at the door, and she made haste to seat herself in the
11500: drawing-room, lest the servant should enter and remove the clothes, which
11501: were lying half on the table and half on the ground. Mr. Lowme entered
11502: with a less familiar visitor, a client of Dempster’s, and the next moment
11503: Dempster himself came in.
11504: 
11505: His eye fell at once on the clothes, and then turned for an instant with
11506: a devilish glance of concentrated hatred on Janet, who, still flushed and
11507: excited, affected unconsciousness. After shaking hands with his visitors
11508: he immediately rang the bell.
11509: 
11510: ‘Take those clothes away,’ he said to the servant, not looking at Janet
11511: again.
11512: 
11513: During dinner, she kept up her assumed air of indifference, and tried to
11514: seem in high spirits, laughing and talking more than usual. In reality,
11515: she felt as if she had defied a wild beast within the four walls of his
11516: den, and he was crouching backward in preparation for his deadly spring.
11517: Dempster affected to take no notice of her, talked obstreperously, and
11518: drank steadily.
11519: 
11520: About eleven the party dispersed, with the exception of Mr. Budd, who had
11521: joined them after dinner, and appeared disposed to stay drinking a little
11522: longer. Janet began to hope that he would stay long enough for Dempster
11523: to become heavy and stupid, and so to fall asleep down-stairs, which was
11524: a rare but occasional ending of his nights. She told the servants to sit
11525: up no longer, and she herself undressed and went to bed, trying to cheat
11526: her imagination into the belief that the day was ended for her. But when
11527: she lay down, she became more intensely awake than ever. Everything she
11528: had taken this evening seemed only to stimulate her senses and her
11529: apprehensions to new vividness. Her heart beat violently, and she heard
11530: every sound in the house.
11531: 
11532: At last, when it was twelve, she heard Mr. Budd go out; she heard the
11533: door slam. Dempster had not moved. Was he asleep? Would he forget? The
11534: minute seemed long, while, with a quickening pulse, she was on the
11535: stretch to catch every sound.
11536: 
11537: ‘Janet!’ The loud jarring voice seemed to strike her like a hurled
11538: weapon.
11539: 
11540: ‘Janet!’ he called again, moving out of the dining-room to the foot of
11541: the stairs.
11542: 
11543: There was a pause of a minute.
11544: 
11545: ‘If you don’t come, I’ll kill you.’
11546: 
11547: Another pause, and she heard him turn back into the dining-room. He was
11548: gone for a light--perhaps for a weapon. Perhaps he _would_ kill her. Let
11549: him. Life was as hideous as death. For years she had been rushing on to
11550: some unknown but certain horror; and now she was close upon it. She was
11551: almost glad. She was in a state of flushed feverish defiance that
11552: neutralized her woman’s terrors.
11553: 
11554: She heard his heavy step on the stairs; she saw the slowly advancing
11555: light. Then she saw the tall massive figure, and the heavy face, now
11556: fierce with drunken rage. He had nothing but the candle in his hand. He
11557: set it down on the table, and advanced close to the bed.
11558: 
11559: ‘So you think you’ll defy me, do you? We’ll see how long that will last.
11560: Get up, madam; out of bed this instant!’
11561: 
11562: In the close presence of the dreadful man--of this huge crushing force,
11563: armed with savage will--poor Janet’s desperate defiance all forsook her,
11564: and her terrors came back. Trembling she got up, and stood helpless in
11565: her night-dress before her husband.
11566: 
11567: He seized her with his heavy grasp by the shoulder, and pushed her before
11568: him.
11569: 
11570: ‘I’ll cool your hot spirit for you! I’ll teach you to brave me!’
11571: 
11572: Slowly he pushed her along before him, down-stairs and through the
11573: passage, where a small oil-lamp was still flickering. What was he going
11574: to do to her? She thought every moment he was going to dash her before
11575: him on the ground. But she gave no scream--she only trembled.
11576: 
11577: He pushed her on to the entrance, and held her firmly in his grasp while
11578: he lifted the latch of the door. Then he opened the door a little way,
11579: thrust her out, and slammed it behind her.
11580: 
11581: For a short space, it seemed like a deliverance to Janet. The harsh
11582: north-east wind, that blew through her thin night-dress, and sent her
11583: long heavy black hair streaming, seemed like the breath of pity after the
11584: grasp of that threatening monster. But soon the sense of release from an
11585: overpowering terror gave way before the sense of the fate that had really
11586: come upon her.
11587: 
11588: This, then, was what she had been travelling towards through her long
11589: years of misery! Not yet death. O! if she had been brave enough for it,
11590: death would have been better. The servants slept at the back of the
11591: house; it was impossible to make them hear, so that they might let her in
11592: again quietly, without her husband’s knowledge. And she would not have
11593: tried. He had thrust her out, and it should be for ever.
11594: 
11595: There would have been dead silence in Orchard Street but for the
11596: whistling of the wind and the swirling of the March dust on the pavement.
11597: Thick clouds covered the sky; every door was closed; every window was
11598: dark. No ray of light fell on the tall white figure that stood in lonely
11599: misery on the doorstep; no eye rested on Janet as she sank down on the
11600: cold stone, and looked into the dismal night. She seemed to be looking
11601: into her own blank future.
11602: 
11603: 
11604: 
11605: 
11606: Chapter 15
11607: 
11608: 
11609: The stony street, the bitter north-east wind and darkness--and in the
11610: midst of them a tender woman thrust out from her husband’s home in her
11611: thin night-dress, the harsh wind cutting her naked feet, and driving her
11612: long hair away from her half-clad bosom, where the poor heart is crushed
11613: with anguish and despair.
11614: 
11615: The drowning man, urged by the supreme agony, lives in an instant through
11616: all his happy and unhappy past: when the dark flood has fallen like a
11617: curtain, memory, in a single moment, sees the drama acted over again. And
11618: even in those earlier crises, which are but types of death--when we are
11619: cut off abruptly from the life we have known, when we can no longer
11620: expect to-morrow to resemble yesterday, and find ourselves by some sudden
11621: shock on the confines of the unknown--there is often the same sort of
11622: lightning-flash through the dark and unfrequented chambers of memory.
11623: 
11624: When Janet sat down shivering on the door-stone, with the door shut upon
11625: her past life, and the future black and unshapen before her as the night,
11626: the scenes of her childhood, her youth and her painful womanhood, rushed
11627: back upon her consciousness, and made one picture with her present
11628: desolation. The petted child taking her newest toy to bed with her--the
11629: young girl, proud in strength and beauty, dreaming that life was an easy
11630: thing, and that it was pitiful weakness to be unhappy--the bride, passing
11631: with trembling joy from the outer court to the inner sanctuary of woman’s
11632: life--the wife, beginning her initiation into sorrow, wounded, resenting,
11633: yet still hoping and forgiving--the poor bruised woman, seeking through
11634: weary years the one refuge of despair, oblivion:--Janet seemed to herself
11635: all these in the same moment that she was conscious of being seated on
11636: the cold stone under the shock of a new misery. All her early gladness,
11637: all her bright hopes and illusions, all her gifts of beauty and
11638: affection, served only to darken the riddle of her life; they were the
11639: betraying promises of a cruel destiny which had brought out those sweet
11640: blossoms only that the winds and storms might have a greater work of
11641: desolation, which had nursed her like a pet fawn into tenderness and fond
11642: expectation, only that she might feel a keener terror in the clutch of
11643: the panther. Her mother had sometimes said that troubles were sent to
11644: make us better and draw us nearer to God. What mockery that seemed to
11645: Janet! _Her_ troubles had been sinking her lower from year to year,
11646: pressing upon her like heavy fever-laden vapours, and perverting the very
11647: plenitude of her nature into a deeper source of disease. Her wretchedness
11648: had been a perpetually tightening instrument of torture, which had
11649: gradually absorbed all the other sensibilities of her nature into the
11650: sense of pain and the maddened craving for relief. Oh, if some ray of
11651: hope, of pity, of consolation, would pierce through the horrible gloom,
11652: she might believe _then_ in a Divine love--in a heavenly Father who cared
11653: for His children! But now she had no faith, no trust. There was nothing
11654: she could lean on in the wide world, for her mother was only a
11655: fellow-sufferer in her own lot. The poor patient woman could do little
11656: more than mourn with her daughter: she had humble resignation enough to
11657: sustain her own soul, but she could no more give comfort and fortitude to
11658: Janet, than the withered ivy-covered trunk can bear up its strong,
11659: full-boughed offspring crashing down under an Alpine storm. Janet felt
11660: she was alone: no human soul had measured her anguish, had understood her
11661: self-despair, had entered into her sorrows and her sins with that
11662: deep-sighted sympathy which is wiser than all blame, more potent than all
11663: reproof--such sympathy as had swelled her own heart for many a sufferer.
11664: And if there was any Divine Pity, she could not feel it; it kept aloof
11665: from her, it poured no balm into her wounds, it stretched out no hand to
11666: bear up her weak resolve, to fortify her fainting courage.
11667: 
11668: Now, in her utmost loneliness, she shed no tear: she sat staring fixedly
11669: into the darkness, while inwardly she gazed at her own past, almost
11670: losing the sense that it was her own, or that she was anything more than
11671: a spectator at a strange and dreadful play.
11672: 
11673: The loud sound of the church clock, striking one, startled her. She had
11674: not been there more than half an hour, then? And it seemed to her as if
11675: she had been there half the night. She was getting benumbed with cold.
11676: With that strong instinctive dread of pain and death which had made her
11677: recoil from suicide, she started up, and the disagreeable sensation of
11678: resting on her benumbed feet helped to recall her completely to the sense
11679: of the present. The wind was beginning to make rents in the clouds, and
11680: there came every now and then a dim light of stars that frightened her
11681: more than the darkness; it was like a cruel finger pointing her out in
11682: her wretchedness and humiliation; it made her shudder at the thought of
11683: the morning twilight. What could she do? Not go to her mother--not rouse
11684: her in the dead of night to tell her this. Her mother would think she was
11685: a spectre; it would be enough to kill her with horror. And the way there
11686: was so long ... if she should meet some one ... yet she must seek some
11687: shelter, somewhere to hide herself. Five doors off there was Mrs.
11688: Pettifer’s; that kind woman would take her in. It was of no use now to be
11689: proud and mind about the world’s knowing: she had nothing to wish for,
11690: nothing to care about; only she could not help shuddering at the thought
11691: of braving the morning light, there in the street--she was frightened at
11692: the thought of spending long hours in the cold. Life might mean anguish,
11693: might mean despair; but oh, she must clutch it, though with bleeding
11694: fingers; her feet must cling to the firm earth that the sunlight would
11695: revisit, not slip into the untried abyss, where she might long even for
11696: familiar pains.
11697: 
11698: Janet trod slowly with her naked feet on the rough pavement, trembling at
11699: the fitful gleams of starlight, and supporting herself by the wall, as
11700: the gusts of wind drove right against her. The very wind was cruel: it
11701: tried to push her back from the door where she wanted to go and knock and
11702: ask for pity.
11703: 
11704: Mrs. Pettifer’s house did not look into Orchard Street: it stood a little
11705: way up a wide passage which opened into the street through an archway.
11706: Janet turned up the archway, and saw a faint light coming from Mrs.
11707: Pettifer’s bedroom window. The glimmer of a rushlight from a room where a
11708: friend was lying, was like a ray of mercy to Janet, after that long, long
11709: time of darkness and loneliness; it would not be so dreadful to awake
11710: Mrs. Pettifer as she had thought. Yet she lingered some minutes at the
11711: door before she gathered courage to knock; she felt as if the sound must
11712: betray her to others besides Mrs. Pettifer, though there was no other
11713: dwelling that opened into the passage--only warehouses and outbuildings.
11714: There was no gravel for her to throw up at the window, nothing but heavy
11715: pavement; there was no door-bell; she must knock. Her first rap was very
11716: timid--one feeble fall of the knocker; and then she stood still again for
11717: many minutes; but presently she rallied her courage and knocked several
11718: times together, not loudly, but rapidly, so that Mrs. Pettifer, if she
11719: only heard the sound, could not mistake it. And she _had_ heard it, for
11720: by and by the casement of her window was opened, and Janet perceived that
11721: she was bending out to try and discern who it was at the door.
11722: 
11723: ‘It is I, Mrs. Pettifer; it is Janet Dempster. Take me in, for pity’s
11724: sake.’
11725: 
11726: ‘Merciful God! what has happened?’
11727: 
11728: ‘Robert has turned me out. I have been in the cold a long while.’
11729: 
11730: Mrs. Pettifer said no more, but hurried away from the window, and was
11731: soon at the door with a light in her hand.
11732: 
11733: ‘Come in, my poor dear, come in,’ said the good woman in a tremulous
11734: voice, drawing Janet within the door. ‘Come into my warm bed, and may God
11735: in heaven save and comfort you.’
11736: 
11737: The pitying eyes, the tender voice, the warm touch, caused a rush of new
11738: feeling in Janet. Her heart swelled, and she burst out suddenly, like a
11739: child, into loud passionate sobs. Mrs. Pettifer could not help crying
11740: with her, but she said, ‘Come up-stairs, my dear, come. Don’t linger in
11741: the cold.’
11742: 
11743: She drew the poor sobbing thing gently up-stairs, and persuaded her to
11744: get into the warm bed. But it was long before Janet could lie down. She
11745: sat leaning her head on her knees, convulsed by sobs, while the motherly
11746: woman covered her with clothes and held her arms round her to comfort her
11747: with warmth. At last the hysterical passion had exhausted itself, and she
11748: fell back on the pillow; but her throat was still agitated by piteous
11749: after-sobs, such as shake a little child even when it has found a refuge
11750: from its alarms on its mother’s lap.
11751: 
11752: Now Janet was getting quieter, Mrs. Pettifer determined to go down and
11753: make a cup of tea, the first thing a kind old woman thinks of as a solace
11754: and restorative under all calamities. Happily there was no danger of
11755: awaking her servant, a heavy girl of sixteen, who was snoring blissfully
11756: in the attic, and might be kept ignorant of the way in which Mrs.
11757: Dempster had come in. So Mrs. Pettifer busied herself with rousing the
11758: kitchen fire, which was kept in under a huge ‘raker’--a possibility by
11759: which the coal of the midland counties atones for all its slowness and
11760: white ashes.
11761: 
11762: When she carried up the tea, Janet was lying quite still; the spasmodic
11763: agitation had ceased, and she seemed lost in thought; her eyes were fixed
11764: vacantly on the rushlight shade, and all the lines of sorrow were
11765: deepened in her face.
11766: 
11767: ‘Now, my dear,’ said Mrs. Pettifer, ‘let me persuade you to drink a cup
11768: of tea; you’ll find it warm you and soothe you very much. Why, dear
11769: heart, your feet are like ice still. Now, do drink this tea, and I’ll
11770: wrap ’em up in flannel, and then they’ll get warm.’
11771: 
11772: Janet turned her dark eyes on her old friend and stretched out her arms.
11773: She was too much oppressed to say anything; her suffering lay like a
11774: heavy weight on her power of speech; but she wanted to kiss the good kind
11775: woman. Mrs. Pettifer, setting down the cup, bent towards the sad
11776: beautiful face, and Janet kissed her with earnest sacramental
11777: kisses--such kisses as seal a new and closer bond between the helper
11778: and the helped.
11779: 
11780: She drank the tea obediently. ‘It _does_ warm me,’ she said. ‘But now you
11781: will get into bed. I shall lie still now.’
11782: 
11783: Mrs. Pettifer felt it was the best thing she could do to lie down quietly
11784: and say no more. She hoped Janet might go to sleep. As for herself, with
11785: that tendency to wakefulness common to advanced years, she found it
11786: impossible to compose herself to sleep again after this agitating
11787: surprise. She lay listening to the clock, wondering what had led to this
11788: new outrage of Dempster’s, praying for the poor thing at her side, and
11789: pitying the mother who would have to hear it all to-morrow.
11790: 
11791: 
11792: 
11793: 
11794: Chapter 16
11795: 
11796: 
11797: Janet lay still, as she had promised; but the tea, which had warmed her
11798: and given her a sense of greater bodily ease, had only heightened the
11799: previous excitement of her brain. Her ideas had a new vividness, which
11800: made her feel as if she had only seen life through a dim haze before; her
11801: thoughts, instead of springing from the action of her own mind, were
11802: external existences, that thrust themselves imperiously upon her like
11803: haunting visions. The future took shape after shape of misery before her,
11804: always ending in her being dragged back again to her old life of terror,
11805: and stupor, and fevered despair. Her husband had so long overshadowed her
11806: life that her imagination could not keep hold of a condition in which
11807: that great dread was absent; and even his absence--what was it? only a
11808: dreary vacant flat, where there was nothing to strive after, nothing to
11809: long for.
11810: 
11811: At last, the light of morning quenched the rushlight, and Janet’s
11812: thoughts became more and more fragmentary and confused. She was every
11813: moment slipping off the level on which she lay thinking, down, down into
11814: some depth from which she tried to rise again with a start. Slumber was
11815: stealing over her weary brain: that uneasy slumber which is only better
11816: than wretched waking, because the life we seemed to live in it determines
11817: no wretched future, because the things we do and suffer in it are but
11818: hateful shadows, and leave no impress that petrifies into an irrevocable
11819: past.
11820: 
11821: She had scarcely been asleep an hour when her movements became more
11822: violent, her mutterings more frequent and agitated, till at last she
11823: started up with a smothered cry, and looked wildly round her, shaking
11824: with terror.
11825: 
11826: ‘Don’t be frightened, dear Mrs. Dempster,’ said Mrs. Pettifer, who was up
11827: and dressing, ‘you are with me, your old friend, Mrs. Pettifer. Nothing
11828: will harm you.’
11829: 
11830: Janet sank back again on her pillow, still trembling. After lying silent
11831: a little while, she said, ‘It was a horrible dream. Dear Mrs. Pettifer,
11832: don’t let any one know I am here. Keep it a secret. If he finds out, he
11833: will come and drag me back again.’
11834: 
11835: ‘No, my dear, depend on me. I’ve just thought I shall send the servant
11836: home on a holiday--I’ve promised her a good while. I’ll send her away as
11837: soon as she’s had her breakfast, and she’ll have no occasion to know
11838: you’re here. There’s no holding servants’ tongues, if you let ’em know
11839: anything. What they don’t know, they won’t tell; you may trust ’em so
11840: far. But shouldn’t you like me to go and fetch your mother?’
11841: 
11842: ‘No, not yet, not yet. I can’t bear to see her yet.’
11843: 
11844: ‘Well, it shall be just as you like. Now try and get to sleep again. I
11845: shall leave you for an hour or two, and send off Phœbe, and then bring
11846: you some breakfast. I’ll lock the door behind me, so that the girl mayn’t
11847: come in by chance.’
11848: 
11849: The daylight changes the aspect of misery to us, as of everything else.
11850: In the night it presses on our imagination--the forms it takes are false,
11851: fitful, exaggerated; in broad day it sickens our sense with the dreary
11852: persistence of definite measurable reality. The man who looks with
11853: ghastly horror on all his property aflame in the dead of night, has not
11854: half the sense of destitution he will have in the morning, when he walks
11855: over the ruins lying blackened in the pitiless sunshine. That moment of
11856: intensest depression was come to Janet, when the daylight which showed
11857: her the walls, and chairs, and tables, and all the commonplace reality
11858: that surrounded her, seemed to lay bare the future too, and bring out
11859: into oppressive distinctness all the details of a weary life to be lived
11860: from day to day, with no hope to strengthen her against that evil habit,
11861: which she loathed in retrospect and yet was powerless to resist. Her
11862: husband would never consent to her living away from him: she was become
11863: necessary to his tyranny; he would never willingly loosen his grasp on
11864: her. She had a vague notion of some protection the law might give her, if
11865: she could prove her life in danger from him; but she shrank utterly, as
11866: she had always done, from any active, public resistance or vengeance: she
11867: felt too crushed, too faulty, too liable to reproach, to have the
11868: courage, even if she had had the wish to put herself openly in the
11869: position of a wronged woman seeking redress. She had no strength to
11870: sustain her in a course of self-defence and independence: there was a
11871: darker shadow over her life than the dread of her husband--it was the
11872: shadow of self-despair. The easiest thing would be to go away and hide
11873: herself from him. But then there was her mother: Robert had all her
11874: little property in his hands, and that little was scarcely enough to keep
11875: her in comfort without his aid. If Janet went away alone he would be sure
11876: to persecute her mother; and if she _did_ go away--what then? She must
11877: work to maintain herself; she must exert herself, weary and hopeless as
11878: she was, to begin life afresh. How hard that seemed to her! Janet’s
11879: nature did not belie her grand face and form: there was energy, there was
11880: strength in it; but it was the strength of the vine, which must have its
11881: broad leaves and rich clusters borne up by a firm stay. And now she had
11882: nothing to rest on--no faith, no love. If her mother had been very
11883: feeble, aged, or sickly, Janet’s deep pity and tenderness might have made
11884: a daughter’s duties an interest and a solace; but Mrs. Raynor had never
11885: needed tendance; she had always been giving help to her daughter; she had
11886: always been a sort of humble ministering spirit; and it was one of
11887: Janet’s pangs of memory, that instead of being her mother’s comfort, she
11888: had been her mother’s trial. Everywhere the same sadness! Her life was a
11889: sun-dried, barren tract, where there was no shadow, and where all the
11890: waters were bitter.
11891: 
11892: No! She suddenly thought--and the thought was like an electric
11893: shock--there was one spot in her memory which seemed to promise her an
11894: untried spring, where the waters might be sweet. That short interview
11895: with Mr. Tryan had come back upon her--his voice, his words, his look,
11896: which told her that he knew sorrow. His words have implied that he
11897: thought his death was near; yet he had a faith which enabled him to
11898: labour--enabled him to give comfort to others. That look of his came back
11899: on her with a vividness greater than it had had for her in reality:
11900: surely he knew more of the secrets of sorrow than other men; perhaps he
11901: had some message of comfort, different from the feeble words she had been
11902: used to hear from others. She was tired, she was sick of that barren
11903: exhortation--Do right, and keep a clear conscience, and God will reward
11904: you, and your troubles will be easier to bear. She wanted _strength_ to
11905: do right--she wanted something to rely on besides her own resolutions;
11906: for was not the path behind her all strewn with _broken_ resolutions? How
11907: could she trust in new ones? She had often heard Mr. Tryan laughed at for
11908: being fond of great sinners. She began to see a new meaning in those
11909: words; he would perhaps understand her helplessness, her wants. If she
11910: could pour out her heart to him! if she could for the first time in her
11911: life unlock all the chambers of her soul!
11912: 
11913: The impulse to confession almost always requires the presence of a fresh
11914: ear and a fresh heart; and in our moments of spiritual need, the man to
11915: whom we have no tie but our common nature, seems nearer to us than
11916: mother, brother, or friend. Our daily familiar life is but a hiding of
11917: ourselves from each other behind a screen of trivial words and deeds, and
11918: those who sit with us at the same hearth are often the farthest off from
11919: the deep human soul within us, full of unspoken evil and unacted good.
11920: 
11921: When Mrs. Pettifer came back to her, turning the key and opening the door
11922: very gently, Janet, instead of being asleep, as her good friend had
11923: hoped, was intensely occupied with her new thought. She longed to ask
11924: Mrs. Pettifer if she could see Mr. Tryan; but she was arrested by doubts
11925: and timidity. He might not feel for her--he might be shocked at her
11926: confession--he might talk to her of doctrines she could not understand or
11927: believe. She could not make up her mind yet; but she was too restless
11928: under this mental struggle to remain in bed.
11929: 
11930: ‘Mrs. Pettifer,’ she said, ‘I can’t lie here any longer; I must get up.
11931: Will you lend me some clothes?’
11932: 
11933: Wrapt in such drapery as Mrs. Pettifer could find for her tall figure,
11934: Janet went down into the little parlour, and tried to take some of the
11935: breakfast her friend had prepared for her. But her effort was not a
11936: successful one; her cup of tea and bit of toast were only half finished.
11937: The leaden weight of discouragement pressed upon her more and more
11938: heavily. The wind had fallen, and a drizzling rain had come on; there was
11939: no prospect from Mrs. Pettifer’s parlour but a blank wall; and as Janet
11940: looked out at the window, the rain and the smoke-blackened bricks seemed
11941: to blend themselves in sickening identity with her desolation of spirit
11942: and the headachy weariness of her body.
11943: 
11944: Mrs. Pettifer got through her household work as soon as she could, and
11945: sat down with her sewing, hoping that Janet would perhaps be able to talk
11946: a little of what had passed, and find some relief by unbosoming herself
11947: in that way. But Janet could not speak to her; she was importuned with
11948: the longing to see Mr. Tryan, and yet hesitating to express it.
11949: 
11950: Two hours passed in this way. The rain went on drizzling, and Janet sat
11951: still, leaning her aching head on her hand, and looking alternately at
11952: the fire and out of the window. She felt this could not last--this
11953: motionless, vacant misery. She must determine on something, she must take
11954: some step; and yet everything was so difficult.
11955: 
11956: It was one o’clock, and Mrs. Pettifer rose from her seat, saying, ‘I must
11957: go and see about dinner.’
11958: 
11959: The movement and the sound startled Janet from her reverie. It seemed as
11960: if an opportunity were escaping her, and she said hastily, ‘Is Mr. Tryan
11961: in the town to-day, do you think?’
11962: 
11963: ‘No, I should think not, being Saturday, you know,’ said Mrs. Pettifer,
11964: her face lighting up with pleasure; ‘but he _would_ come, if he was sent
11965: for. I can send Jesson’s boy with a note to him any time. Should you like
11966: to see him?’
11967: 
11968: ‘Yes, I think I should.’
11969: 
11970: ‘Then I’ll send for him this instant.’
11971: 
11972: 
11973: 
11974: 
11975: Chapter 17
11976: 
11977: 
11978: When Dempster awoke in the morning, he was at no loss to account to
11979: himself for the fact that Janet was not by his side. His hours of
11980: drunkenness were not cut off from his other hours by any blank wall of
11981: oblivion; he remembered what Janet had done to offend him the evening
11982: before, he remembered what he had done to her at midnight, just as he
11983: would have remembered if he had been consulted about a right of road.
11984: 
11985: The remembrance gave him a definite ground for the extra ill-humour which
11986: had attended his waking every morning this week, but he would not admit
11987: to himself that it cost him any anxiety. ‘Pooh,’ he said inwardly, ‘she
11988: would go straight to her mother’s. She’s as timid as a hare; and she’ll
11989: never let anybody know about it. She’ll be back again before night.’
11990: 
11991: But it would be as well for the servants not to know anything of the
11992: affair: so he collected the clothes she had taken off the night before,
11993: and threw them into a fire-proof closet of which he always kept the key
11994: in his pocket. When he went down-stairs he said to the housemaid, ‘Mrs.
11995: Dempster is gone to her mother’s; bring in the breakfast.’
11996: 
11997: The servants, accustomed to hear domestic broils, and to see their
11998: mistress put on her bonnet hastily and go to her mother’s, thought it
11999: only something a little worse than usual that she should have gone
12000: thither in consequence of a violent quarrel, either at midnight, or in
12001: the early morning before they were up. The housemaid told the cook what
12002: she supposed had happened; the cook shook her head and said, ‘Eh, dear,
12003: dear!’ but they both expected to see their mistress back again in an hour
12004: or two.
12005: 
12006: Dempster, on his return home the evening before, had ordered his man, who
12007: lived away from the house, to bring up his horse and gig from the stables
12008: at ten. After breakfast he said to the housemaid, ‘No one need sit up for
12009: me to-night; I shall not be at home till to-morrow evening;’ and then he
12010: walked to the office to give some orders, expecting, as he returned, to
12011: see the man waiting with his gig. But though the church clock had struck
12012: ten, no gig was there. In Dempster’s mood this was more than enough to
12013: exasperate him. He went in to take his accustomed glass of brandy before
12014: setting out, promising himself the satisfaction of presently thundering
12015: at Dawes for being a few minutes behind his time. An outbreak of temper
12016: towards his man was not common with him; for Dempster, like most
12017: tyrannous people, had that dastardly kind of self-restraint which enabled
12018: him to control his temper where it suited his own convenience to do so;
12019: and feeling the value of Dawes, a steady punctual fellow, he not only
12020: gave him high wages, but usually treated him with exceptional civility.
12021: This morning, however, ill-humour got the better of prudence, and
12022: Dempster was determined to rate him soundly; a resolution for which Dawes
12023: gave him much better ground than he expected. Five minutes, ten minutes,
12024: a quarter of an hour, had passed, and Dempster was setting off to the
12025: stables in a back street to see what was the cause of the delay, when
12026: Dawes appeared with the gig.
12027: 
12028: ‘What the devil do you keep me here for?’ thundered Dempster, ‘kicking my
12029: heels like a beggarly tailor waiting for a carrier’s cart? I ordered you
12030: to be here at ten. We might have driven to Whitlow by this time.’
12031: 
12032: ‘Why, one o’ the traces was welly i’ two, an’ I had to take it to Brady’s
12033: to be mended, an’ he didn’t get it done i’ time.’
12034: 
12035: ‘Then why didn’t you take it to him last night? Because of your damned
12036: laziness, I suppose. Do you think I give you wages for you to choose your
12037: own hours, and come dawdling up a quarter of an hour after my time?’
12038: 
12039: ‘Come, give me good words, will yer?’ said Dawes, sulkily. ‘I’m not lazy,
12040: nor no man shall call me lazy. I know well anuff what you gi’ me wages
12041: for; it’s for doin’ what yer won’t find many men as ’ull do.’
12042: 
12043: ‘What, you impudent scoundrel,’ said Dempster, getting into the gig, ‘you
12044: think you’re necessary to me, do you? As if a beastly bucket-carrying
12045: idiot like you wasn’t to be got any day. Look out for a new master, then,
12046: who’ll pay you for not doing as you’re bid.’
12047: 
12048: Dawe’s blood was now fairly up. ‘I’ll look out for a master as has got a
12049: better charicter nor a lyin’, bletherin’ drunkard, an’ I shouldn’t hev to
12050: go fur.’
12051: 
12052: Dempster, furious, snatched the whip from the socket, and gave Dawes a
12053: cut which he meant to fall across his shoulders saying, ‘Take that, sir,
12054: and go to hell with you!’
12055: 
12056: Dawes was in the act of turning with the reins in his hand when the lash
12057: fell, and the cut went across his face. With white lips, he said, ‘I’ll
12058: have the law on yer for that, lawyer as y’are,’ and threw the reins on
12059: the horse’s back.
12060: 
12061: Dempster leaned forward, seized the reins, and drove off.
12062: 
12063: ‘Why, there’s your friend Dempster driving out without his man again,’
12064: said Mr. Luke Byles, who was chatting with Mr. Budd in the Bridge Way.
12065: ‘What a fool he is to drive that two-wheeled thing! he’ll get pitched on
12066: his head one of these days.’
12067: 
12068: ‘Not he,’ said Mr. Budd, nodding to Dempster as he passed; ‘he’s got nine
12069: lives, Dempster has.’
12070: 
12071: 
12072: 
12073: 
12074: Chapter 18
12075: 
12076: 
12077: It was dusk, and the candles were lighted before Mr. Tryan knocked at
12078: Mrs. Pettifer’s door. Her messenger had brought back word that he was not
12079: at home, and all afternoon Janet had been agitated by the fear that he
12080: would not come; but as soon as that anxiety was removed by the knock at
12081: the door, she felt a sudden rush of doubt and timidity: she trembled and
12082: turned cold.
12083: 
12084: Mrs. Pettifer went to open the door, and told Mr. Tryan, in as few words
12085: as possible, what had happened in the night. As he laid down his hat and
12086: prepared to enter the parlour, she said, ‘I won’t go in with you, for I
12087: think perhaps she would rather see you go in alone.’
12088: 
12089: Janet, wrapped up in a large white shawl which threw her dark face into
12090: startling relief, was seated with her eyes turned anxiously towards the
12091: door when Mr. Tryan entered. He had not seen her since their interview at
12092: Sally Martin’s long months ago; and he felt a strong movement of
12093: compassion at the sight of the pain-stricken face which seemed to bear
12094: written on it the signs of all Janet’s intervening misery. Her heart gave
12095: a great leap, as her eyes met his once more. No! she had not deceived
12096: herself: there was all the sincerity, all the sadness, all the deep pity
12097: in them her memory had told her of; more than it had told her, for in
12098: proportion as his face had become thinner and more worn, his eyes
12099: appeared to have gathered intensity.
12100: 
12101: He came forward, and, putting out his hand, said, ‘I am so glad you sent
12102: for me--I am so thankful you thought I could be any comfort to you.’
12103: Janet took his hand in silence. She was unable to utter any words of mere
12104: politeness, or even of gratitude; her heart was too full of other words
12105: that had welled up the moment she met his pitying glance, and felt her
12106: doubts fall away.
12107: 
12108: They sat down opposite each other, and she said in a low voice, while
12109: slow difficult tears gathered in her aching eyes,--‘I want to tell you
12110: how unhappy I am--how weak and wicked. I feel no strength to live or die.
12111: I thought you could tell me something that would help me.’ She paused.
12112: 
12113: ‘Perhaps I can,’ Mr. Tryan said, ‘for in speaking to me you are speaking
12114: to a fellow-sinner who has needed just the comfort and help you are
12115: needing.’
12116: 
12117: ‘And you did find it?’
12118: 
12119: ‘Yes; and I trust you will find it.’
12120: 
12121: ‘O, I should like to be good and to do right,’ Janet burst forth; ‘but
12122: indeed, indeed, my lot has been a very hard one. I loved my husband very
12123: dearly when we were married, and I meant to make him happy--I wanted
12124: nothing else. But he began to be angry with me for little things and ...
12125: I don’t want to accuse him ... but he drank and got more and more unkind
12126: to me, and then very cruel, and he beat me. And that cut me to the heart.
12127: It made me almost mad sometimes to think all our love had come to that
12128: ... I couldn’t bear up against it. I had never been used to drink
12129: anything but water. I hated wine and spirits because Robert drank them
12130: so; but one day when I was very wretched, and the wine was standing on
12131: the table, I suddenly ... I can hardly remember how I came to do it ... I
12132: poured some wine into a large glass and drank it. It blunted my feelings,
12133: and made me more indifferent. After that, the temptation was always
12134: coming, and it got stronger and stronger. I was ashamed, and I hated what
12135: I did; but almost while the thought was passing through my mind that I
12136: would never do it again, I did it. It seemed as if there was a demon in
12137: me always making me rush to do what I longed not to do. And I thought all
12138: the more that God was cruel; for if He had not sent me that dreadful
12139: trial, so much worse than other women have to bear, I should not have
12140: done wrong in that way. I suppose it is wicked to think so ... I feel as
12141: if there must be goodness and right above us, but I can’t see it, I can’t
12142: trust in it. And I have gone on in that way for years and years. At one
12143: time it used to be better now and then, but everything has got worse
12144: lately. I felt sure it must soon end somehow. And last night he turned me
12145: out of doors ... I don’t know what to do. I will never go back to that
12146: life again if I can help it; and yet everything else seems so miserable.
12147: I feel sure that demon will always be urging me to satisfy the craving
12148: that comes upon me, and the days will go on as they have done through all
12149: those miserable years. I shall always be doing wrong, and hating myself
12150: after--sinking lower and lower, and knowing that I am sinking. O can you
12151: tell me any way of getting strength? Have you ever known any one like me
12152: that got peace of mind and power to do right? Can you give me any
12153: comfort--any hope?’
12154: 
12155: While Janet was speaking, she had forgotten everything but her misery and
12156: her yearning for comfort. Her voice had risen from the low tone of timid
12157: distress to an intense pitch of imploring anguish. She clasped her hands
12158: tightly, and looked at Mr. Tryon with eager questioning eyes, with
12159: parted, trembling lips, with the deep horizontal lines of overmastering
12160: pain on her brow. In this artificial life of ours, it is not often we see
12161: a human face with all a heart’s agony in it, uncontrolled by
12162: self-consciousness; when we do see it, it startles us as if we had
12163: suddenly waked into the real world of which this everyday one is but a
12164: puppet-show copy. For some moments Mr. Tryan was too deeply moved to
12165: speak.
12166: 
12167: ‘Yes, dear Mrs. Dempster,’ he said at last, ‘there _is_ comfort, there
12168: _is_ hope for you. Believe me there is, for I speak from my own deep and
12169: hard experience.’ He paused, as if he had not made up his mind to utter
12170: the words that were urging themselves to his lips. Presently he
12171: continued, ‘Ten years ago, I felt as wretched as you do. I think my
12172: wretchedness was even worse than yours, for I had a heavier sin on my
12173: conscience. I had suffered no wrong from others as you have, and I had
12174: injured another irreparably in body and soul. The image of the wrong I
12175: had done pursued me everywhere, and I seemed on the brink of madness. I
12176: hated my life, for I thought, just as you do, that I should go on falling
12177: into temptation and doing more harm in the world; and I dreaded death,
12178: for with that sense of guilt on my soul, I felt that whatever state I
12179: entered on must be one of misery. But a dear friend to whom I opened my
12180: mind showed me it was just such as I--the helpless who feel themselves
12181: helpless--that God specially invites to come to Him, and offers all the
12182: riches of His salvation: not forgiveness only; forgiveness would be worth
12183: little if it left us under the powers of our evil passions; but
12184: strength--that strength which enables us to conquer sin.’
12185: 
12186: ‘But,’ said Janet, ‘I can feel no trust in God. He seems always to have
12187: left me to myself. I have sometimes prayed to Him to help me, and yet
12188: everything has been just the same as before. If you felt like me, how did
12189: you come to have hope and trust?’
12190: 
12191: ‘Do not believe that God has left you to yourself. How can you tell but
12192: that the hardest trials you have known have been only the road by which
12193: He was leading you to that complete sense of your own sin and
12194: helplessness, without which you would never have renounced all other
12195: hopes, and trusted in His love alone? I know, dear Mrs. Dempster, I know
12196: it is hard to bear. I would not speak lightly of your sorrows. I feel
12197: that the mystery of our life is great, and at one time it seemed as dark
12198: to me as it does to you.’ Mr. Tryan hesitated again. He saw that the
12199: first thing Janet needed was to be assured of sympathy. She must be made
12200: to feel that her anguish was not strange to him; that he entered into the
12201: only half-expressed secrets of her spiritual weakness, before any other
12202: message of consolation could find its way to her heart. The tale of the
12203: Divine Pity was never yet believed from lips that were not felt to be
12204: moved by human pity. And Janet’s anguish was not strange to Mr. Tryan. He
12205: had never been in the presence of a sorrow and a self-despair that had
12206: sent so strong a thrill through all the recesses of his saddest
12207: experience; and it is because sympathy is but a living again through our
12208: own past in a new form, that confession often prompts a response of
12209: confession. Mr. Tryan felt this prompting, and his judgement, too, told
12210: him that in obeying it he would be taking the best means of administering
12211: comfort to Janet. Yet he hesitated; as we tremble to let in the daylight
12212: on a chamber of relics which we have never visited except in curtained
12213: silence. But the first impulse triumphed, and he went on. ‘I had lived
12214: all my life at a distance from God. My youth was spent in thoughtless
12215: self-indulgence, and all my hopes were of a vain worldly kind. I had no
12216: thought of entering the Church; I looked forward to a political career,
12217: for my father was private secretary to a man high in the Whig Ministry,
12218: and had been promised strong interest in my behalf. At college I lived in
12219: intimacy with the gayest men, even adopting follies and vices for which I
12220: had no taste, out of mere pliancy and the love of standing well with my
12221: companions. You see, I was more guilty even then than you have been, for
12222: I threw away all the rich blessings of untroubled youth and health; I had
12223: no excuse in my outward lot. But while I was at college that event in my
12224: life occurred, which in the end brought on the state of mind I have
12225: mentioned to you--the state of self-reproach and despair, which enables
12226: me to understand to the full what you are suffering; and I tell you the
12227: facts, because I want you to be assured that I am not uttering mere vague
12228: words when I say that I have been raised from as low a depth of sin and
12229: sorrow as that in which you feel yourself to be. At college I had an
12230: attachment to a lovely girl of seventeen; she was very much below my own
12231: station in life, and I never contemplated marrying her; but I induced her
12232: to leave her father’s house. I did not mean to forsake her when I left
12233: college, and I quieted all scruples of conscience by promising myself
12234: that I would always take care of poor Lucy. But on my return from a
12235: vacation spent in travelling, I found that Lucy was gone--gone away with
12236: a gentleman, her neighbours said. I was a good deal distressed, but I
12237: tried to persuade myself that no harm would come to her. Soon afterwards
12238: I had an illness which left my health delicate, and made all dissipation
12239: distasteful to me. Life seemed very wearisome and empty, and I looked
12240: with envy on every one who had some great and absorbing object--even on
12241: my cousin who was preparing to go out as a missionary, and whom I had
12242: been used to think a dismal, tedious person, because he was constantly
12243: urging religious subjects upon me. We were living in London then; it was
12244: three years since I had lost sight of Lucy; and one summer evening, about
12245: nine o’clock, as I was walking along Gower Street, I saw a knot of people
12246: on the causeway before me. As I came up to them, I heard one woman say,
12247: “I tell you, she is dead.” This awakened my interest, and I pushed my way
12248: within the circle. The body of a woman, dressed in fine clothes, was
12249: lying against a door-step. Her head was bent on one side, and the long
12250: curls had fallen over her cheek. A tremor seized me when I saw the hair:
12251: it was light chestnut--the colour of Lucy’s. I knelt down and turned
12252: aside the hair; it was Lucy--dead--with paint on her cheeks. I found out
12253: afterwards that she had taken poison--that she was in the power of a
12254: wicked woman--that the very clothes on her back were not her own. It was
12255: then that my past life burst upon me in all its hideousness. I wished I
12256: had never been born. I couldn’t look into the future. Lucy’s dead painted
12257: face would follow me there, as it did when I looked back into the
12258: past--as it did when I sat down to table with my friends, when I lay down
12259: in my bed, and when I rose up. There was only one thing that could make
12260: life tolerable to me; that was, to spend all the rest of it in trying to
12261: save others from the ruin I had brought on one. But how was that possible
12262: for me? I had no comfort, no strength, no wisdom in my own soul; how
12263: could I give them to others? My mind was dark, rebellious, at war with
12264: itself and with God.’
12265: 
12266: Mr. Tryan had been looking away from Janet. His face was towards the
12267: fire, and he was absorbed in the images his memory was recalling. But now
12268: he turned his eyes on her, and they met hers, fixed on him with the look
12269: of rapt expectation, with which one clinging to a slippery summit of a
12270: rock, while the waves are rising higher and higher, watches the boat that
12271: has put from shore to his rescue.
12272: 
12273: ‘You see, Mrs. Dempster, how deep my need was. I went on in this way for
12274: months. I was convinced that if I ever got health and comfort, it must be
12275: from religion. I went to hear celebrated preachers, and I read religious
12276: books. But I found nothing that fitted my own need. The faith which puts
12277: the sinner in possession of salvation seemed, as I understood it, to be
12278: quite out of my reach. I had no faith; I only felt utterly wretched,
12279: under the power of habits and dispositions which had wrought hideous
12280: evil. At last, as I told you, I found a friend to whom I opened all my
12281: feelings--to whom I confessed everything. He was a man who had gone
12282: through very deep experience, and could understand the different wants of
12283: different minds. He made it clear to me that the only preparation for
12284: coming to Christ and partaking of his salvation, was that very sense of
12285: guilt and helplessness which was weighing me down. He said, You are weary
12286: and heavy-laden; well, it is you Christ invites to come to him and find
12287: rest. He asks you to cling to him, to lean on him; he does not command
12288: you to walk alone without stumbling. He does not tell you, as your
12289: fellow-men do, that you must first merit his love; he neither condemns
12290: nor reproaches you for the past, he only bids you come to him that you
12291: may have life: he bids you stretch out your hands, and take of the
12292: fulness of his love. You have only to rest on him as a child rests on its
12293: mother’s arms, and you will be upborne by his divine strength. That is
12294: what is meant by faith. Your evil habits, you feel, are too strong for
12295: you; you are unable to wrestle with them; you know beforehand you shall
12296: fall. But when once we feel our helplessness in that way, and go to the
12297: Saviour, desiring to be freed from the power as well as the punishment of
12298: sin, we are no longer left to our own strength. As long as we live in
12299: rebellion against God, desiring to have our own will, seeking happiness
12300: in the things of this world, it is as if we shut ourselves up in a
12301: crowded stifling room, where we breathe only poisoned air; but we have
12302: only to walk out under the infinite heavens, and we breathe the pure free
12303: air that gives us health, and strength, and gladness. It is just so with
12304: God’s spirit: as soon as we submit ourselves to his will, as soon as we
12305: desire to be united to him, and made pure and holy, it is as if the walls
12306: had fallen down that shut us out from God, and we are fed with his
12307: spirit, which gives us new strength.’
12308: 
12309: ‘That is what I want,’ said Janet; ‘I have left off minding about
12310: pleasure. I think I could be contented in the midst of hardship, if I
12311: felt that God cared for me, and would give me strength to lead a pure
12312: life. But tell me, did you soon find peace and strength?’
12313: 
12314: ‘Not perfect peace for a long while, but hope and trust, which is
12315: strength. No sense of pardon for myself could do away with the pain I had
12316: in thinking what I had helped to bring on another. My friend used to urge
12317: upon me that my sin against God was greater than my sin against her;
12318: but--it may be from want of deeper spiritual feeling--that has remained
12319: to this hour the sin which causes me the bitterest pang. I could never
12320: rescue Lucy; but by God’s blessing I might rescue other weak and falling
12321: souls; and that was why I entered the Church. I asked for nothing through
12322: the rest of my life but that I might be devoted to God’s work, without
12323: swerving in search of pleasure either to the right hand or to the left.
12324: It has been often a hard struggle--but God has been with me--and perhaps
12325: it may not last much longer.’
12326: 
12327: Mr. Tryan paused. For a moment he had forgotten Janet, and for a moment
12328: she had forgotten her own sorrows. When she recurred to herself, it was
12329: with a new feeling.
12330: 
12331: ‘Ah, what a difference between our lives! you have been choosing pain,
12332: and working, and denying yourself; and I have been thinking only of
12333: myself. I was only angry and discontented because I had pain to bear. You
12334: never had that wicked feeling that I have had so often, did you? that God
12335: was cruel to send me trials and temptations worse than others have.’
12336: 
12337: ‘Yes, I had; I had very blasphemous thoughts, and I know that spirit of
12338: rebellion must have made the worst part of your lot. You did not feel how
12339: impossible it is for us to judge rightly of God’s dealings, and you
12340: opposed yourself to his will. But what do we know? We cannot foretell the
12341: working of the smallest event in our own lot; how can we presume to judge
12342: of things that are so much too high for us? There is nothing that becomes
12343: us but entire submission, perfect resignation. As long as we set up our
12344: own will and our own wisdom against God’s, we make that wall between us
12345: and his love which I have spoken of just now. But as soon as we lay
12346: ourselves entirely at his feet, we have enough light given us to guide
12347: our own steps; as the foot-soldier who hears nothing of the councils that
12348: determine the course of the great battle he is in, hears plainly enough
12349: the word of command which he must himself obey. I know, dear Mrs.
12350: Dempster, I know it is hard--the hardest thing of all, perhaps--to flesh
12351: and blood. But carry that difficulty to the Saviour along with all your
12352: other sins and weaknesses, and ask him to pour into you a spirit of
12353: submission. He enters into your struggles; he has drunk the cup of our
12354: suffering to the dregs; he knows the hard wrestling it costs us to say,
12355: “Not my will, but Thine be done.”’
12356: 
12357: ‘Pray with me,’ said Janet--‘pray now that I may have light and
12358: strength.’
12359: 
12360: 
12361: 
12362: 
12363: Chapter 19
12364: 
12365: 
12366: Before leaving Janet, Mr. Tryan urged her strongly to send for her
12367: mother.
12368: 
12369: ‘Do not wound her,’ he said, ‘by shutting her out any longer from your
12370: troubles. It is right that you should be with her.’
12371: 
12372: ‘Yes, I will send for her,’ said Janet. ‘But I would rather not go to my
12373: mother’s yet, because my husband is sure to think I am there, and he
12374: might come and fetch me. I can’t go back to him ... at least, not yet.
12375: Ought I to go back to him?’
12376: 
12377: ‘No, certainly not, at present. Something should be done to secure you
12378: from violence. Your mother, I think, should consult some confidential
12379: friend, some man of character and experience, who might mediate between
12380: you and your husband.’
12381: 
12382: ‘Yes, I will send for my mother directly. But I will stay here, with Mrs.
12383: Pettifer, till something has been done. I want no one to know where I am,
12384: except you. You will come again, will you not? you will not leave me to
12385: myself?’
12386: 
12387: ‘You will not be left to yourself. God is with you. If I have been able
12388: to give you any comfort, it is because His power and love have been
12389: present with us. But I am very thankful that He has chosen to work
12390: through me. I shall see you again to-morrow--not before evening, for it
12391: will be Sunday, you know; but after the evening lecture I shall be at
12392: liberty. You will be in my prayers till then. In the meantime, dear Mrs.
12393: Dempster, open your heart as much as you can to your mother and Mrs.
12394: Pettifer. Cast away from you the pride that makes us shrink from
12395: acknowledging our weakness to our friends. Ask them to help you in
12396: guarding yourself from the least approach of the sin you most dread.
12397: Deprive yourself as far as possible of the very means and opportunity of
12398: committing it. Every effort of that kind made in humility and dependence
12399: is a prayer. Promise me you will do this.’
12400: 
12401: ‘Yes, I promise you. I know I have always been too proud; I could never
12402: bear to speak to any one about myself. I have been proud towards my
12403: mother, even; it has always made me angry when she has seemed to take
12404: notice of my faults.’
12405: 
12406: ‘Ah, dear Mrs. Dempster, you will never say again that life is blank, and
12407: that there is nothing to live for, will you? See what work there is to be
12408: done in life, both in our own souls and for others. Surely it matters
12409: little whether we have more or less of this world’s comfort in these
12410: short years, when God is training us for the eternal enjoyment of his
12411: love. Keep that great end of life before you, and your troubles here will
12412: seem only the small hardships of a journey. Now I must go.’
12413: 
12414: Mr. Tryan rose and held out his hand. Janet took it and said, ‘God has
12415: been very good to me in sending you to me. I will trust in Him. I will
12416: try to do everything you tell me.’
12417: 
12418: Blessed influence of one true loving human soul on another! Not
12419: calculable by algebra, not deducible by logic, but mysterious, effectual,
12420: mighty as the hidden process by which the tiny seed is quickened, and
12421: bursts forth into tall stem and broad leaf, and glowing tasseled flower.
12422: Ideas are often poor ghosts; our sun-filled eyes cannot discern them;
12423: they pass athwart us in thin vapour, and cannot make themselves felt. But
12424: sometimes they are made flesh; they breathe upon us with warm breath,
12425: they touch us with soft responsive hands, they look at us with sad
12426: sincere eyes, and speak to us in appealing tones; they are clothed in a
12427: living human soul, with all its conflicts, its faith, and its love. Then
12428: their presence is a power, then they shake us like a passion, and we are
12429: drawn after them with gentle compulsion, as flame is drawn to flame.
12430: 
12431: Janet’s dark grand face, still fatigued, had become quite calm, and
12432: looked up, as she sat, with a humble childlike expression at the thin
12433: blond face and slightly sunken grey eyes which now shone with hectic
12434: brightness. She might have been taken for an image of passionate strength
12435: beaten and worn with conflict; and he for an image of the self-renouncing
12436: faith which has soothed that conflict into rest. As he looked at the
12437: sweet submissive face, he remembered its look of despairing anguish, and
12438: his heart was very full as he turned away from her. ‘Let me only live to
12439: see this work confirmed, and then ...’
12440: 
12441: It was nearly ten o’clock when Mr. Tryan left, but Janet was bent on
12442: sending for her mother; so Mrs. Pettifer, as the readiest plan, put on
12443: her bonnet and went herself to fetch Mrs. Raynor. The mother had been too
12444: long used to expect that every fresh week would be more painful than the
12445: last, for Mrs. Pettifer’s news to come upon her with the shock of a
12446: surprise. Quietly, without any show of distress, she made up a bundle of
12447: clothes, and, telling her little maid that she should not return home
12448: that night, accompanied Mrs. Pettifer back in silence.
12449: 
12450: When they entered the parlour, Janet, wearied out, had sunk to sleep in
12451: the large chair, which stood with its back to the door. The noise of the
12452: opening door disturbed her, and she was looking round wonderingly when
12453: Mrs. Raynor came up to her chair, and said, ‘It’s your mother, Janet.’
12454: 
12455: ‘Mother, dear mother!’ Janet cried, clasping her closely. ‘I have not
12456: been a good tender child to you, but I will be--I will not grieve you any
12457: more.’
12458: 
12459: The calmness which had withstood a new sorrow was overcome by a new joy,
12460: and the mother burst into tears.
12461: 
12462: 
12463: 
12464: 
12465: Chapter 20
12466: 
12467: 
12468: On Sunday morning the rain had ceased, and Janet, looking out of the
12469: bedroom window, saw, above the house-tops, a shining mass of white cloud
12470: rolling under the far-away blue sky. It was going to be a lovely April
12471: day. The fresh sky, left clear and calm after the long vexation of wind
12472: and rain, mingled its mild influence with Janet’s new thoughts and
12473: prospects. She felt a buoyant courage that surprised herself, after the
12474: cold crushing weight of despondency which had oppressed her the day
12475: before: she could think even of her husband’s rage without the old
12476: overpowering dread. For a delicious hope--the hope of purification and
12477: inward peace--had entered into Janet’s soul, and made it spring-time
12478: there as well as in the outer world.
12479: 
12480: While her mother was brushing and coiling up her thick black hair--a
12481: favourite task, because it seemed to renew the days of her daughter’s
12482: girlhood--Janet told how she came to send for Mr. Tryan, how she had
12483: remembered their meeting at Sally Martin’s in the autumn, and had felt an
12484: irresistible desire to see him, and tell him her sins and her troubles.
12485: 
12486: ‘I see God’s goodness now, mother, in ordering it so that we should meet
12487: in that way, to overcome my prejudice against him, and make me feel that
12488: he was good, and then bringing it back to my mind in the depth of my
12489: trouble. You know what foolish things I used to say about him, knowing
12490: nothing of him all the while. And yet he was the man who was to give me
12491: comfort and help when everything else failed me. It is wonderful how I
12492: feel able to speak to him as I never have done to any one before; and how
12493: every word he says to me enters my heart and has a new meaning for me. I
12494: think it must be because he has felt life more deeply than others, and
12495: has a deeper faith. I believe everything he says at once. His words come
12496: to me like rain on the parched ground. It has always seemed to me before
12497: as if I could see behind people’s words, as one sees behind a screen; but
12498: in Mr. Tryan it is his very soul that speaks.’
12499: 
12500: ‘Well, my dear child, I love and bless him for your sake, if he has given
12501: you any comfort. I never believed the harm people said of him, though I
12502: had no desire to go and hear him, for I am contented with old-fashioned
12503: ways. I find more good teaching than I can practise in reading my Bible
12504: at home, and hearing Mr. Crewe at church. But your wants are different,
12505: my dear, and we are not all led by the same road. That was certainly good
12506: advice of Mr. Tryan’s you told me of last night--that we should consult
12507: some one that may interfere for you with your husband; and I have been
12508: turning it over in my mind while I’ve been lying awake in the night. I
12509: think nobody will do so well as Mr. Benjamin Landor, for we must have a
12510: man that knows the law, and that Robert is rather afraid of. And perhaps
12511: he could bring about an agreement for you to live apart. Your husband’s
12512: bound to maintain you, you know; and, if you liked, we could move away
12513: from Milby and live somewhere else.’
12514: 
12515: ‘O, mother, we must do nothing yet; I must think about it a little
12516: longer. I have a different feeling this morning from what I had
12517: yesterday. Something seems to tell me that I must go back to Robert some
12518: time--after a little while. I loved him once better than all the world,
12519: and I have never had any children to love. There were things in me that
12520: were wrong, and I should like to make up for them if I can.’
12521: 
12522: ‘Well, my dear, I won’t persuade you. Think of it a little longer. But
12523: something must be done soon.’
12524: 
12525: ‘How I wish I had my bonnet, and shawl, and black gown here!’ said Janet,
12526: after a few minutes’ silence. ‘I should like to go to Paddiford Church
12527: and hear Mr. Tryan. There would be no fear of my meeting Robert, for he
12528: never goes out on a Sunday morning.’
12529: 
12530: ‘I’m afraid it would not do for me to go to the house and fetch your
12531: clothes,’ said Mrs. Raynor.
12532: 
12533: ‘O no, no! I must stay quietly here while you two go to church. I will be
12534: Mrs. Pettifer’s maid, and get the dinner ready for her by the time she
12535: comes back. Dear good woman! She was so tender to me when she took me in,
12536: in the night, mother, and all the next day, when I couldn’t speak a word
12537: to her to thank her.’
12538: 
12539: 
12540: 
12541: 
12542: Chapter 21
12543: 
12544: 
12545: The servants at Dempster’s felt some surprise when the morning, noon, and
12546: evening of Saturday had passed, and still their mistress did not
12547: reappear.
12548: 
12549: ‘It’s very odd,’ said Kitty, the housemaid, as she trimmed her next
12550: week’s cap, while Betty, the middle-aged cook, looked on with folded
12551: arms. ‘Do you think as Mrs. Raynor was ill, and sent for the missis afore
12552: we was up?’
12553: 
12554: ‘O,’ said Betty, ‘if it had been that, she’d ha’ been back’ards an’
12555: for’ards three or four times afore now; leastways, she’d ha’ sent little
12556: Ann to let us know.’
12557: 
12558: ‘There’s summat up more nor usual between her an’ the master, that you
12559: may depend on,’ said Kitty. ‘I know those clothes as was lying i’ the
12560: drawing-room yesterday, when the company was come, meant summat. I
12561: shouldn’t wonder if that was what they’ve had a fresh row about. She’s
12562: p’raps gone away, an’s made up her mind not to come back again.’
12563: 
12564: ‘An’ i’ the right on’t, too,’ said Betty. ‘I’d ha’ overrun him long afore
12565: now, if it had been me. I wouldn’t stan’ bein’ mauled as she is by no
12566: husband, not if he was the biggest lord i’ the land. It’s poor work bein’
12567: a wife at that price: I’d sooner be a cook wi’out perkises, an’ hev
12568: roast, an’ boil, an’ fry, an’ bake, all to mind at once. She may well do
12569: as she does. I know I’m glad enough of a drop o’ summat myself when I’m
12570: plagued. I feel very low, like, to-night; I think I shall put my beer i’
12571: the saucepan an’ warm it.’
12572: 
12573: ‘What a one you are for warmin’ your beer, Betty! I couldn’t abide
12574: it--nasty bitter stuff!’
12575: 
12576: ‘It’s fine talkin’; if you was a cook you’d know what belongs to bein’ a
12577: cook. It’s none so nice to hev a sinkin’ at your stomach, I can tell you.
12578: You wouldn’t think so much o’ fine ribbins i’ your cap then.’
12579: 
12580: ‘Well, well, Betty, don’t be grumpy. Liza Thomson, as is at Phipps’s,
12581: said to me last Sunday, “I wonder you’ll stay at Dempster’s,” she says,
12582: “such goins-on as there is.” But I says, “There’s things to put up wi’ in
12583: ivery place, an’ you may change, an’ change, an’ not better yourself when
12584: all’s said an’ done.” Lors! why, Liza told me herself as Mrs. Phipps was
12585: as skinny as skinny i’ the kitchen, for all they keep so much company;
12586: and as for follyers, she’s as cross as a turkey-cock if she finds ’em
12587: out. There’s nothin’ o’ that sort i’ the missis. How pretty she come an’
12588: spoke to Job last Sunday! There isn’t a good-natur’der woman i’ the
12589: world, that’s my belief--an’ hansome too. I al’ys think there’s nobody
12590: looks half so well as the missis when she’s got her ’air done nice. Lors!
12591: I wish I’d got long ’air like her--my ’air’s a-comin’ off dreadful.’
12592: 
12593: ‘There’ll be fine work to-morrow, I expect,’ said Betty, ‘when the master
12594: comes home, an’ Dawes a-swearin’ as he’ll niver do a stroke o’ work for
12595: him again. It’ll be good fun if he sets the justice on him for cuttin’
12596: him wi’ the whip; the master’ll p’raps get his comb cut for once in his
12597: life!’
12598: 
12599: ‘Why, he was in a temper like a fiend this morning,’ said Kitty. ‘I
12600: daresay it was along o’ what had happened wi’ the missis. We shall hev a
12601: pretty house wi’ him if she doesn’t come back--he’ll want to be
12602: leatherin’ us, I shouldn’t wonder. He must hev somethin’ t’ ill-use when
12603: he’s in a passion.’
12604: 
12605: ‘I’d tek care he didn’t leather me--no, not if he was my husban’ ten
12606: times o’er; I’d pour hot drippin’ on him sooner. But the missis hasn’t a
12607: sperrit like me. He’ll mek her come back, you’ll see; he’ll come round
12608: her somehow. There’s no likelihood of her coming back to-night, though;
12609: so I should think we might fasten the doors and go to bed when we like.’
12610: 
12611: On Sunday morning, however, Kitty’s mind became disturbed by more
12612: definite and alarming conjectures about her mistress. While Betty,
12613: encouraged by the prospect of unwonted leisure, was sitting down to
12614: continue a letter which had long lain unfinished between the leaves of
12615: her Bible, Kitty came running into the kitchen and said,--‘Lor! Betty,
12616: I’m all of a tremble; you might knock me down wi’ a feather. I’ve just
12617: looked into the missis’s wardrobe, an’ there’s both her bonnets. She must
12618: ha’ gone wi’out her bonnet. An’ then I remember as her night-clothes
12619: wasn’t on the bed yisterday mornin’; I thought she’d put ’em away to be
12620: washed; but she hedn’t, for I’ve been lookin’. It’s my belief he’s
12621: murdered her, and shut her up i’ that closet as he keeps locked al’ys.
12622: He’s capible on’t.’
12623: 
12624: ‘Lors-ha’-massy, why you’d better run to Mrs. Raynor’s an’ see if she’s
12625: there, arter all. It was p’raps all a lie.’
12626: 
12627: Mrs. Raynor had returned home to give directions to her little maiden,
12628: when Kitty, with the elaborate manifestation of alarm which servants
12629: delight in, rushed in without knocking, and, holding her hands on her
12630: heart as if the consequences to that organ were likely to be very
12631: serious, said,--‘If you please ’m, is the missis here?’
12632: 
12633: ‘No, Kitty; why are you come to ask?’
12634: 
12635: ‘Because ’m, she’s niver been at home since yesterday mornin’, since
12636: afore we was up; an’ we thought somethin’ must ha’ happened to her.’
12637: 
12638: ‘No, don’t be frightened, Kitty. Your mistress is quite safe; I know
12639: where she is. Is your master at home?’
12640: 
12641: ‘No ’m; he went out yesterday mornin’, an’ said he shouldn’t be back
12642: afore to-night.’
12643: 
12644: ‘Well, Kitty, there’s nothing the matter with your mistress. You needn’t
12645: say anything to any one about her being away from home. I shall call
12646: presently and fetch her gown and bonnet. She wants them to put on.’
12647: 
12648: Kitty, perceiving there was a mystery she was not to inquire into,
12649: returned to Orchard Street, really glad to know that her mistress was
12650: safe, but disappointed nevertheless at being told that she was not to be
12651: frightened. She was soon followed by Mrs. Raynor in quest of the gown and
12652: bonnet. The good mother, on learning that Dempster was not at home, had
12653: at once thought that she could gratify Janet’s wish to go to Paddiford
12654: Church.
12655: 
12656: ‘See, my dear,’ she said, as she entered Mrs. Pettifer’s parlour; ‘I’ve
12657: brought you your black clothes. Robert’s not at home, and is not coming
12658: till this evening. I couldn’t find your best black gown, but this will
12659: do. I wouldn’t bring anything else, you know; but there can’t be any
12660: objection to my fetching clothes to cover you. You can go to Paddiford
12661: Church, now, if you like; and I will go with you.’
12662: 
12663: ‘That’s a dear mother! Then we’ll all three go together. Come and help me
12664: to get ready. Good little Mrs. Crewe! It will vex her sadly that I should
12665: go to hear Mr. Tryan. But I must kiss her, and make it up with her.’
12666: 
12667: Many eyes were turned on Janet with a look of surprise as she walked up
12668: the aisle of Paddiford Church. She felt a little tremor at the notice she
12669: knew she was exciting, but it was a strong satisfaction to her that she
12670: had been able at once to take a step that would let her neighbours know
12671: her change of feeling towards Mr. Tryan: she had left herself now no room
12672: for proud reluctance or weak hesitation. The walk through the sweet
12673: spring air had stimulated all her fresh hopes, all her yearning desires
12674: after purity, strength, and peace. She thought she should find a new
12675: meaning in the prayers this morning; her full heart, like an overflowing
12676: river, wanted those ready-made channels to pour itself into; and then she
12677: should hear Mr. Tryan again, and his words would fall on her like
12678: precious balm, as they had done last night. There was a liquid brightness
12679: in her eyes as they rested on the mere walls, the pews, the weavers and
12680: colliers in their Sunday clothes. The commonest things seemed to touch
12681: the spring of love within her, just as, when we are suddenly released
12682: from an acute absorbing bodily pain, our heart and senses leap out in new
12683: freedom; we think even the noise of streets harmonious, and are ready to
12684: hug the tradesman who is wrapping up our change. A door had been opened
12685: in Janet’s cold dark prison of self-despair, and the golden light of
12686: morning was pouring in its slanting beams through the blessed opening.
12687: There was sunlight in the world; there was a divine love caring for her;
12688: it had given her an earnest of good things: it had been preparing comfort
12689: for her in the very moment when she had thought herself most forsaken.
12690: 
12691: Mr. Tryan might well rejoice when his eye rested on her as he entered his
12692: desk; but he rejoiced with trembling. He could not look at the sweet
12693: hopeful face without remembering its yesterday’s look of agony; and there
12694: was the possibility that that look might return.
12695: 
12696: Janet’s appearance at church was greeted not only by wondering eyes, but
12697: by kind hearts, and after the service several of Mr. Tryan’s hearers with
12698: whom she had been on cold terms of late, contrived to come up to her and
12699: take her by the hand.
12700: 
12701: ‘Mother,’ said Miss Linnet, ‘do let us go and speak to Mrs. Dempster. I’m
12702: sure there’s a great change in her mind towards Mr. Tryan. I noticed how
12703: eagerly she listened to the sermon, and she’s come with Mrs. Pettifer,
12704: you see. We ought to go and give her a welcome among us.’
12705: 
12706: ‘Why, my dear, we’ve never spoke friendly these five year. You know she’s
12707: been as haughty as anything since I quarrelled with her husband. However,
12708: let bygones be bygones: I’ve no grudge again’ the poor thing, more
12709: particular as she must ha’ flew in her husband’s face to come an’ hear
12710: Mr. Tryan. Yes, let us go an’ speak to her.’
12711: 
12712: The friendly words and looks touched Janet a little too keenly, and Mrs.
12713: Pettifer wisely hurried her home by the least-frequented road. When they
12714: reached home, a violent fit of weeping, followed by continuous lassitude,
12715: showed that the emotions of the morning had overstrained her nerves. She
12716: was suffering, too, from the absence of the long-accustomed stimulus
12717: which she had promised Mr. Tryan not to touch again. The poor thing was
12718: conscious of this, and dreaded her own weakness, as the victim of
12719: intermittent insanity dreads the oncoming of the old illusion.
12720: 
12721: ‘Mother,’ she whispered, when Mrs. Raynor urged her to lie down and rest
12722: all the afternoon, that she might be the better prepared to see Mr. Tryan
12723: in the evening--‘mother, don’t let me have anything if I ask for it.’
12724: 
12725: In the mother’s mind there was the same anxiety, and in her it was
12726: mingled with another fear--the fear lest Janet, in her present excited
12727: state of mind, should take some premature step in relation to her
12728: husband, which might lead back to all the former troubles. The hint she
12729: had thrown out in the morning of her wish to return to him after a time,
12730: showed a new eagerness for difficult duties, that only made the
12731: long-saddened sober mother tremble. But as evening approached, Janet’s
12732: morning heroism all forsook her: her imagination influenced by physical
12733: depression as well as by mental habits, was haunted by the vision of her
12734: husband’s return home, and she began to shudder with the yesterday’s
12735: dread. She heard him calling her, she saw him going to her mother’s to
12736: look for her, she felt sure he would find her out, and burst in upon her.
12737: 
12738: ‘Pray, pray, don’t leave me, don’t go to church,’ she said to Mrs.
12739: Pettifer. ‘You and mother both stay with me till Mr. Tryan comes.’
12740: 
12741: At twenty minutes past six the church bells were ringing for the evening
12742: service, and soon the congregation was streaming along Orchard Street in
12743: the mellow sunset. The street opened toward the west. The red half-sunken
12744: sun shed a solemn splendour on the everyday houses, and crimsoned the
12745: windows of Dempster’s projecting upper storey.
12746: 
12747: Suddenly a loud murmur arose and spread along the stream of church-goers,
12748: and one group after another paused and looked backward. At the far end of
12749: the street, men, accompanied by a miscellaneous group of onlookers, were
12750: slowly carrying something--a body stretched on a door. Slowly they passed
12751: along the middle of the street, lined all the way with awe-struck faces,
12752: till they turned aside and paused in the red sunlight before Dempster’s
12753: door.
12754: 
12755: It was Dempster’s body. No one knew whether he was alive or dead.
12756: 
12757: 
12758: 
12759: 
12760: Chapter 22
12761: 
12762: 
12763: It was probably a hard saying to the Pharisees, that ‘there is more joy
12764: in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, than over ninety and nine just
12765: persons that need no repentance.’ And certain ingenious philosophers of
12766: our own day must surely take offence at a joy so entirely out of
12767: correspondence with arithmetical proportion. But a heart that has been
12768: taught by its own sore struggles to bleed for the woes of another--that
12769: has ‘learned pity through suffering’--is likely to find very imperfect
12770: satisfaction in the ‘balance of happiness,’ ‘doctrine of compensations,’
12771: and other short and easy methods of obtaining thorough complacency in the
12772: presence of pain; and for such a heart that saying will not be altogether
12773: dark. The emotions, I have observed, are but slightly influenced by
12774: arithmetical considerations: the mother, when her sweet lisping little
12775: ones have all been taken from her one after another, and she is hanging
12776: over her last dead babe, finds small consolation in the fact that the
12777: tiny dimpled corpse is but one of a necessary average, and that a
12778: thousand other babes brought into the world at the same time are doing
12779: well, and are likely to live; and if you stood beside that mother--if you
12780: knew her pang and shared it--it is probable you would be equally unable
12781: to see a ground of complacency in statistics.
12782: 
12783: Doubtless a complacency resting on that basis is highly rational; but
12784: emotion, I fear, is obstinately irrational: it insists on caring for
12785: individuals; it absolutely refuses to adopt the quantitative view of
12786: human anguish, and to admit that thirteen happy lives are a set-off
12787: against twelve miserable lives, which leaves a clear balance on the side
12788: of satisfaction. This is the inherent imbecility of feeling, and one must
12789: be a great philosopher to have got quite clear of all that, and to have
12790: emerged into the serene air of pure intellect, in which it is evident
12791: that individuals really exist for no other purpose than that abstractions
12792: may be drawn from them--abstractions that may rise from heaps of ruined
12793: lives like the sweet savour of a sacrifice in the nostrils of
12794: philosophers, and of a philosophic Deity. And so it comes to pass that
12795: for the man who knows sympathy because he has known sorrow, that old, old
12796: saying about the joy of angels over the repentant sinner outweighing
12797: their joy over the ninety-nine just, has a meaning which does not jar
12798: with the language of his own heart. It only tells him, that for angels
12799: too there is a transcendent value in human pain, which refuses to be
12800: settled by equations; that the eyes of angels too are turned away from
12801: the serene happiness of the righteous to bend with yearning pity on the
12802: poor erring soul wandering in the desert where no water is: that for
12803: angels too the misery of one casts so tremendous a shadow as to eclipse
12804: the bliss of ninety-nine.
12805: 
12806: Mr. Tryan had gone through the initiation of suffering: it is no wonder,
12807: then, that Janet’s restoration was the work that lay nearest his heart;
12808: and that, weary as he was in body when he entered the vestry after the
12809: evening service, he was impatient to fulfil the promise of seeing her.
12810: His experience enabled him to divine--what was the fact--that the
12811: hopefulness of the morning would be followed by a return of depression
12812: and discouragement; and his sense of the inward and outward difficulties
12813: in the way of her restoration was so keen, that he could only find relief
12814: from the foreboding it excited by lifting up his heart in prayer. There
12815: are unseen elements which often frustrate our wisest calculations--which
12816: raise up the sufferer from the edge of the grave, contradicting the
12817: prophecies of the clear-sighted physician, and fulfilling the blind
12818: clinging hopes of affection; such unseen elements Mr. Tryan called the
12819: Divine Will, and filled up the margin of ignorance which surrounds all
12820: our knowledge with the feelings of trust and resignation. Perhaps the
12821: profoundest philosophy could hardly fill it up better.
12822: 
12823: His mind was occupied in this way as he was absently taking off his gown,
12824: when Mr. Landor startled him by entering the vestry and asking abruptly,
12825: ‘Have you heard the news about Dempster?’
12826: 
12827: ‘No,’ said Mr. Tryan, anxiously; ‘what is it?’
12828: 
12829: ‘He has been thrown out of his gig in the Bridge Way, and he was taken up
12830: for dead. They were carrying him home as we were coming to church, and I
12831: stayed behind to see what I could do. I went in to speak to Mrs.
12832: Dempster, and prepare her a little, but she was not at home. Dempster is
12833: not dead, however, he was stunned with the fall. Pilgrim came in a few
12834: minutes, and he says the right leg is broken in two places. It’s likely
12835: to be a terrible case, with his state of body. It seems he was more drunk
12836: than usual, and they say he came along the Bridge Way flogging his horse
12837: like a madman, till at last it gave a sudden wheel, and he was pitched
12838: out. The servants said they didn’t know where Mrs. Dempster was: she had
12839: been away from home since yesterday morning; but Mrs. Raynor knew.’
12840: 
12841: ‘I know where she is,’ said Mr. Tryan; ‘but I think it will be better for
12842: her not to be told of this just yet.’
12843: 
12844: ‘Ah, that was what Pilgrim said, and so I didn’t go round to Mrs.
12845: Raynor’s. He said it would be all the better if Mrs. Dempster could be
12846: kept out of the house for the present. Do you know if anything new has
12847: happened between Dempster and his wife lately? I was surprised to hear of
12848: her being at Paddiford Church this morning.’
12849: 
12850: ‘Yes, something has happened; but I believe she is anxious that the
12851: particulars of his behaviour towards her should not be known. She is at
12852: Mrs. Pettifer’s--there is no reason for concealing that, since what has
12853: happened to her husband; and yesterday, when she was in very deep
12854: trouble, she sent for me. I was very thankful she did so: I believe a
12855: great change of feeling has begun in her. But she is at present in that
12856: excitable state of mind--she has been shaken by so many painful emotions
12857: during the last two days, that I think it would be better, for this
12858: evening at least, to guard her from a new shock, if possible. But I am
12859: going now to call upon her, and I shall see how she is.’
12860: 
12861: ‘Mr. Tryan,’ said Mr. Jerome, who had entered during the dialogue, and
12862: had been standing by, listening with a distressed face, ‘I shall take it
12863: as a favour if you’ll let me know if iver there’s anything I can do for
12864: Mrs. Dempster. Eh, dear, what a world this is! I think I see ’em fifteen
12865: year ago--as happy a young couple as iver was; and now, what it’s all
12866: come to! I was in a hurry, like, to punish Dempster for pessecutin’, but
12867: there was a stronger hand at work nor mine.’
12868: 
12869: ‘Yes, Mr. Jerome; but don’t let us rejoice in punishment, even when the
12870: hand of God alone inflicts it. The best of us are but poor wretches just
12871: saved from shipwreck: can we feel anything but awe and pity when we see a
12872: fellow-passenger swallowed by the waves?’
12873: 
12874: ‘Right, right, Mr. Tryan. I’m over hot and hasty, that I am. But I beg on
12875: you to tell Mrs. Dempster--I mean, in course, when you’ve an
12876: opportunity--tell her she’s a friend at the White House as she may send
12877: for any hour o’ the day.’
12878: 
12879: ‘Yes; I shall have an opportunity, I dare say, and I will remember your
12880: wish. I think,’ continued Mr. Tryan, turning to Mr. Landor, ‘I had better
12881: see Mr. Pilgrim on my way, and learn what is exactly the state of things
12882: by this time. What do you think?’
12883: 
12884: ‘By all means: if Mrs. Dempster is to know, there’s no one can break the
12885: news to her so well as you. I’ll walk with you to Dempster’s door. I dare
12886: say Pilgrim is there still. Come, Mr. Jerome, you’ve got to go our way
12887: too, to fetch your horse.’
12888: 
12889: Mr. Pilgrim was in the passage giving some directions to his assistant,
12890: when, to his surprise, he saw Mr. Tryan enter. They shook hands; for Mr.
12891: Pilgrim, never having joined the party of the Anti-Tryanites, had no
12892: ground for resisting the growing conviction, that the Evangelical curate
12893: was really a good fellow, though he was a fool for not taking better care
12894: of himself.
12895: 
12896: ‘Why, I didn’t expect to see you in your old enemy’s quarters,’ he said
12897: to Mr. Tryan. ‘However, it will be a good while before poor Dempster
12898: shows any fight again.’
12899: 
12900: ‘I came on Mrs. Dempster’s account,’ said Mr. Tryan. ‘She is staying at
12901: Mrs. Pettifer’s; she has had a great shock from some severe domestic
12902: trouble lately, and I think it will be wiser to defer telling her of this
12903: dreadful event for a short time.’
12904: 
12905: ‘Why, what has been up, eh?’ said Mr. Pilgrim, whose curiosity was at
12906: once awakened. ‘She used to be no friend of yours. Has there been some
12907: split between them? It’s a new thing for her to turn round on him.’
12908: 
12909: ‘O, merely an exaggeration of scenes that must often have happened
12910: before. But the question now is, whether you think there is any immediate
12911: danger of her husband’s death; for in that case, I think, from what I
12912: have observed of her feelings, she would be pained afterwards to have
12913: been kept in ignorance.’
12914: 
12915: ‘Well, there’s no telling in these cases, you know. I don’t apprehend
12916: speedy death, and it is not absolutely impossible that we may bring him
12917: round again. At present he’s in a state of apoplectic stupor; but if that
12918: subsides, delirium is almost sure to supervene, and we shall have some
12919: painful scenes. It’s one of those complicated cases in which the delirium
12920: is likely to be of the worst kind--meningitis and delirium tremens
12921: together--and we may have a good deal of trouble with him. If Mrs.
12922: Dempster were told, I should say it would be desirable to persuade her to
12923: remain out of the house at present. She could do no good, you know. I’ve
12924: got nurses.’
12925: 
12926: ‘Thank you,’ said Mr. Tryan. ‘That is what I wanted to know. Good-bye.’
12927: 
12928: When Mrs. Pettifer opened the door for Mr. Tryan, he told her in a few
12929: words what had happened, and begged her to take an opportunity of letting
12930: Mrs. Raynor know, that they might, if possible, concur in preventing a
12931: premature or sudden disclosure of the event to Janet.
12932: 
12933: ‘Poor thing!’ said Mrs. Pettifer. ‘She’s not fit to hear any bad news;
12934: she’s very low this evening--worn out with feeling; and she’s not had
12935: anything to keep her up, as she’s been used to. She seems frightened at
12936: the thought of being tempted to take it.’
12937: 
12938: ‘Thank God for it; that fear is her greatest security.’
12939: 
12940: When Mr. Tryan entered the parlour this time, Janet was again awaiting
12941: him eagerly, and her pale sad face was lighted up with a smile as she
12942: rose to meet him. But the next moment she said, with a look of
12943: anxiety,--‘How very ill and tired you look! You have been working so
12944: hard all day, and yet you are come to talk to me. O, you are wearing
12945: yourself out. I must go and ask Mrs. Pettifer to come and make you have
12946: some supper. But this is my mother; you have not seen her before, I
12947: think.’
12948: 
12949: While Mr. Tryan was speaking to Mrs. Raynor, Janet hurried out, and he,
12950: seeing that this good-natured thoughtfulness on his behalf would help to
12951: counteract her depression, was not inclined to oppose her wish, but
12952: accepted the supper Mrs. Pettifer offered him, quietly talking the while
12953: about a clothing club he was going to establish in Paddiford, and the
12954: want of provident habits among the poor.
12955: 
12956: Presently, however, Mrs. Raynor said she must go home for an hour, to see
12957: how her little maiden was going on, and Mrs. Pettifer left the room with
12958: her to take the opportunity of telling her what had happened to Dempster.
12959: When Janet was left alone with Mr. Tryan, she said,--‘I feel so uncertain
12960: what to do about my husband. I am so weak--my feelings change so from
12961: hour to hour. This morning, when I felt so hopeful and happy, I thought I
12962: should like to go back to him, and try to make up for what has been wrong
12963: in me. I thought, now God would help me, and I should have you to teach
12964: and advise me, and I could bear the troubles that would come. But since
12965: then--all this afternoon and evening--I have had the same feelings I used
12966: to have, the same dread of his anger and cruelty, and it seems to me as
12967: if I should never be able to bear it without falling into the same sins,
12968: and doing just what I did before. Yet, if it were settled that I should
12969: live apart from him, I know it would always be a load on my mind that I
12970: had shut myself out from going back to him. It seems a dreadful thing in
12971: life, when any one has been so near to one as a husband for fifteen
12972: years, to part and be nothing to each other any more. Surely that is a
12973: very strong tie, and I feel as if my duty can never lie quite away from
12974: it. It is very difficult to know what to do: what ought I to do?’
12975: 
12976: ‘I think it will be well not to take any decisive step yet. Wait until
12977: your mind is calmer. You might remain with your mother for a little
12978: while; I think you have no real ground for fearing any annoyance from
12979: your husband at present; he has put himself too much in the wrong; he
12980: will very likely leave you unmolested for some time. Dismiss this
12981: difficult question from your mind just now, if you can. Every new day may
12982: bring you new grounds for decision, and what is most needful for your
12983: health of mind is repose from that haunting anxiety about the future
12984: which has been preying on you. Cast yourself on God, and trust that He
12985: will direct you; he will make your duty clear to you, if you wait
12986: submissively on Him.’
12987: 
12988: ‘Yes; I will wait a little, as you tell me. I will go to my mother’s
12989: to-morrow, and pray to be guided rightly. You will pray for me, too.’
12990: 
12991: 
12992: 
12993: 
12994: Chapter 23
12995: 
12996: 
12997: The next morning Janet was so much calmer, and at breakfast spoke so
12998: decidedly of going to her mother’s, that Mrs. Pettifer and Mrs. Raynor
12999: agreed it would be wise to let her know by degrees what had befallen her
13000: husband, since as soon as she went out there would be danger of her
13001: meeting some one who would betray the fact. But Mrs. Raynor thought it
13002: would be well first to call at Dempster’s, and ascertain how he was: so
13003: she said to Janet,--‘My dear, I’ll go home first, and see to things, and
13004: get your room ready. You needn’t come yet, you know. I shall be back
13005: again in an hour or so, and we can go together.’
13006: 
13007: ‘O no,’ said Mrs. Pettifer. ‘Stay with me till evening. I shall be lost
13008: without you. You needn’t go till quite evening.’
13009: 
13010: Janet had dipped into the ‘Life of Henry Martyn,’ which Mrs. Pettifer had
13011: from the Paddiford Lending Library, and her interest was so arrested by
13012: that pathetic missionary story, that she readily acquiesced in both
13013: propositions, and Mrs. Raynor set out.
13014: 
13015: She had been gone more than an hour, and it was nearly twelve o’clock,
13016: when Janet put down her book; and after sitting meditatively for some
13017: minutes with her eyes unconsciously fixed on the opposite wall, she rose,
13018: went to her bedroom, and, hastily putting on her bonnet and shawl, came
13019: down to Mrs. Pettifer, who was busy in the kitchen.
13020: 
13021: ‘Mrs. Pettifer,’ she said, ‘tell mother, when she comes back, I’m gone to
13022: see what has become of those poor Lakins in Butchers Lane. I know they’re
13023: half starving, and I’ve neglected them so, lately. And then, I think,
13024: I’ll go on to Mrs. Crewe. I want to see the dear little woman, and tell
13025: her myself about my going to hear Mr. Tryan. She won’t feel it half so
13026: much if I tell her myself.’
13027: 
13028: ‘Won’t you wait till your mother comes, or put it off till to-morrow?’
13029: said Mrs. Pettifer, alarmed. ‘You’ll hardly be back in time for dinner,
13030: if you get talking to Mrs. Crewe. And you’ll have to pass by your
13031: husband’s, you know; and yesterday, you were so afraid of seeing him.’
13032: 
13033: ‘O, Robert will be shut up at the office now, if he’s not gone out of the
13034: town. I must go--I feel I must be doing something for some one--not be a
13035: mere useless log any longer. I’ve been reading about that wonderful Henry
13036: Martyn; he’s just like Mr. Tryan--wearing himself out for other people,
13037: and I sit thinking of nothing but myself. I _must_ go. Good-bye; I shall
13038: be back soon.’
13039: 
13040: She ran off before Mrs. Pettifer could utter another word of dissuasion,
13041: leaving the good woman in considerable anxiety lest this new impulse of
13042: Janet’s should frustrate all precautions to save her from a sudden shock.
13043: 
13044: Janet having paid her visit in Butcher Lane, turned again into Orchard
13045: Street on her way to Mrs. Crewe’s, and was thinking, rather sadly, that
13046: her mother’s economical housekeeping would leave no abundant surplus to
13047: be sent to the hungry Lakins, when she saw Mr. Pilgrim in advance of her
13048: on the other side of the street. He was walking at a rapid pace, and when
13049: he reached Dempster’s door he turned and entered without knocking.
13050: 
13051: Janet was startled. Mr. Pilgrim would never enter in that way unless
13052: there were some one very ill in the house. It was her husband; she felt
13053: certain of it at once. Something had happened to him. Without a moment’s
13054: pause, she ran across the street, opened the door, and entered. There was
13055: no one in the passage. The dining-room door was wide open--no one was
13056: there. Mr. Pilgrim, then, was already up-stairs. She rushed up at once to
13057: Dempster’s room--her own room. The door was open, and she paused in pale
13058: horror at the sight before her, which seemed to stand out only with the
13059: more appalling distinctness because the noonday light was darkened to
13060: twilight in the chamber.
13061: 
13062: Two strong nurses were using their utmost force to hold Dempster in bed,
13063: while the medical assistant was applying a sponge to his head, and Mr.
13064: Pilgrim was busy adjusting some apparatus in the background. Dempster’s
13065: face was purple and swollen, his eyes dilated, and fixed with a look of
13066: dire terror on something he seemed to see approaching him from the iron
13067: closet. He trembled violently, and struggled as if to jump out of bed.
13068: 
13069: ‘Let me go, let me go,’ he said in a loud, hoarse whisper; ‘she’s coming
13070: ... she’s cold ... she’s dead ... she’ll strangle me with her black hair.
13071: Ah!’ he shrieked aloud, ‘her hair is all serpents ... they’re black
13072: serpents ... they hiss ... they hiss . .. let me go . . . let me go . . .
13073: she wants to drag me with her cold arms ... her arms are serpents ...
13074: they are great white serpents ... they’ll twine round me ... she wants to
13075: drag me into the cold water ... her bosom is cold ... it is black ... it
13076: is all serpents ...’
13077: 
13078: ‘No, Robert,’ Janet cried, in tones of yearning pity, rushing to the side
13079: of the bed, and stretching out her arms towards him, ‘no, here is Janet.
13080: She is not dead--she forgives you.’
13081: 
13082: Dempster’s maddened senses seemed to receive some new impression from her
13083: appearance. The terror gave way to rage.
13084: 
13085: ‘Ha! you sneaking hypocrite!’ he burst out in a grating voice, ‘you
13086: threaten me ... you mean to have your revenge on me, do you? Do your
13087: worst! I’ve got the law on my side ... I know the law ... I’ll hunt you
13088: down like a hare ... prove it ... prove that I was tampered with ...
13089: prove that I took the money ... prove it ... you can prove nothing ...
13090: you damned psalm-singing maggots! I’ll make a fire under you, and smoke
13091: off the whole pack of you ... I’ll sweep you up ... I’ll grind you to
13092: powder ... small powder ... (here his voice dropt to a low tone of
13093: shuddering disgust) ... powder on the bed-clothes ... running about ...
13094: black lice ... they are coming in swarms ... Janet! come and take them
13095: away ... curse you! why don’t you come? Janet!’
13096: 
13097: Poor Janet was kneeling by the bed with her face buried in her hands. She
13098: almost wished her worst moment back again rather than this. It seemed as
13099: if her husband was already imprisoned in misery, and she could not reach
13100: him--his ear deaf for ever to the sounds of love and forgiveness. His
13101: sins had made a hard crust round his soul; her pitying voice could not
13102: pierce it.
13103: 
13104: ‘Not there, isn’t she?’ he went on in a defiant tone. ‘Why do you ask me
13105: where she is? I’ll have every drop of yellow blood out of your veins if
13106: you come questioning me. Your blood is yellow ... in your purse ...
13107: running out of your purse ... What! you’re changing it into toads, are
13108: you? They’re crawling ... they’re flying ... they’re flying about my head
13109: ... the toads are flying about. Ostler! ostler! bring out my gig ...
13110: bring it out, you lazy beast . . . ha! you’ll follow me, will you? ...
13111: you’ll fly about my head ... you’ve got fiery tongues ... Ostler! curse
13112: you! why don’t you come? Janet! come and take the toads away ... Janet!’
13113: 
13114: This last time he uttered her name with such a shriek of terror, that
13115: Janet involuntarily started up from her knees, and stood as if petrified
13116: by the horrible vibration. Dempster stared wildly in silence for some
13117: moments; then he spoke again in a hoarse whisper:--
13118: 
13119: ‘Dead ... is she dead? She did it, then. She buried herself in the iron
13120: chest ... she left her clothes out, though ... she isn’t dead ... why
13121: do you pretend she’s dead? ... she’s coming ... she’s coming out of the
13122: iron closet ... there are the black serpents ... stop her ... let me go
13123: ... stop her ... she wants to drag me away into the cold black water
13124: ... her bosom is black ... it is all serpents ... they are getting
13125: longer ... the great white serpents are getting longer ...’
13126: 
13127: Here Mr. Pilgrim came forward with the apparatus to bind him, but
13128: Dempster’s struggles became more and more violent. ‘Ostler! ostler!’ he
13129: shouted, ‘bring out the gig ... give me the whip!’--and bursting loose
13130: from the strong hands that held him, he began to flog the bed-clothes
13131: furiously with his right arm.
13132: 
13133: ‘Get along, you lame brute!--sc--sc--sc! that’s it! there you go! They
13134: think they’ve outwitted me, do they? The sneaking idiots! I’ll be up with
13135: them by-and-by. I’ll make them say the Lord’s Prayer backwards ... I’ll
13136: pepper them so that the devil shall eat them raw ... sc--sc--sc--we shall
13137: see who’ll be the winner yet ... get along, you damned limping beast ...
13138: I’ll lay your back open ... I’ll ...’
13139: 
13140: He raised himself with a stronger effort than ever to flog the
13141: bed-clothes, and fell back in convulsions. Janet gave a scream, and sank
13142: on her knees again. She thought he was dead.
13143: 
13144: As soon as Mr. Pilgrim was able to give her a moment’s attention, he came
13145: to her, and, taking her by the arm, attempted to draw her gently out of
13146: the room.
13147: 
13148: ‘Now, my dear Mrs. Dempster, let me persuade you not to remain in the
13149: room at present. We shall soon relieve these symptoms, I hope: it is
13150: nothing but the delirium that ordinarily attends such cases.’
13151: 
13152: ‘Oh, what is the matter? what brought it on?’
13153: 
13154: ‘He fell out of the gig; the right leg is broken. It is a terrible
13155: accident, and I don’t disguise that there is considerable danger
13156: attending it, owing to the state of the brain. But Mr. Dempster has a
13157: strong constitution, you know; in a few days these symptoms may be
13158: allayed, and he may do well. Let me beg of you to keep out of the room at
13159: present: you can do no good until Mr. Dempster is better, and able to
13160: know you. But you ought not to be alone; let me advise you to have Mrs.
13161: Raynor with you.’
13162: 
13163: ‘Yes, I will send for mother. But you must not object to my being in the
13164: room. I shall be very quiet now, only just at first the shock was so
13165: great; I knew nothing about it. I can help the nurses a great deal; I can
13166: put the cold things to his head. He may be sensible for a moment and know
13167: me. Pray do not say any more against it: my heart is set on being with
13168: him.’
13169: 
13170: Mr. Pilgrim gave way, and Janet, having sent for her mother and put off
13171: her bonnet and shawl, returned to take her place by the side of her
13172: husband’s bed.
13173: 
13174: 
13175: 
13176: 
13177: Chapter 24
13178: 
13179: 
13180: Day after day, with only short intervals of rest, Janet kept her place in
13181: that sad chamber. No wonder the sick-room and the lazaretto have so often
13182: been a refuge from the tossings of intellectual doubt--a place of repose
13183: for the worn and wounded spirit. Here is a duty about which all creeds
13184: and all philosophies are at one: here, at least, the conscience will not
13185: be dogged by doubt, the benign impulse will not be checked by adverse
13186: theory: here you may begin to act without settling one preliminary
13187: question. To moisten the sufferer’s parched lips through the long
13188: night-watches, to bear up the drooping head, to lift the helpless limbs,
13189: to divine the want that can find no utterance beyond the feeble motion of
13190: the hand or beseeching glance of the eye--these are offices that demand
13191: no self-questionings, no casuistry, no assent to propositions, no
13192: weighing of consequences. Within the four walls where the stir and glare
13193: of the world are shut out, and every voice is subdued--where a human
13194: being lies prostrate, thrown on the tender mercies of his fellow, the
13195: moral relation of man to man is reduced to its utmost clearness and
13196: simplicity: bigotry cannot confuse it, theory cannot pervert it, passion,
13197: awed into quiescence, can neither pollute nor perturb it. As we bend over
13198: the sick-bed, all the forces of our nature rush towards the channels of
13199: pity, of patience, and of love, and sweep down the miserable choking
13200: drift of our quarrels, our debates, our would-be wisdom, and our
13201: clamorous selfish desires. This blessing of serene freedom from the
13202: importunities of opinion lies in all simple direct acts of mercy, and is
13203: one source of that sweet calm which is often felt by the watcher in the
13204: sick-room, even when the duties there are of a hard and terrible kind.
13205: 
13206: Something of that benign result was felt by Janet during her tendance in
13207: her husband’s chamber. When the first heart-piercing hours were
13208: over--when her horror at his delirium was no longer fresh, she began to
13209: be conscious of her relief from the burden of decision as to her future
13210: course. The question that agitated her, about returning to her husband,
13211: had been solved in a moment; and this illness, after all, might be the
13212: herald of another blessing, just as that dreadful midnight when she stood
13213: an outcast in cold and darkness had been followed by the dawn of a new
13214: hope. Robert would get better; this illness might alter him; he would be
13215: a long time feeble, needing help, walking with a crutch, perhaps. She
13216: would wait on him with such tenderness, such all-forgiving love, that the
13217: old harshness and cruelty must melt away for ever under the
13218: heart-sunshine she would pour around him. Her bosom heaved at the
13219: thought, and delicious tears fell. Janet’s was a nature in which hatred
13220: and revenge could find no place; the long bitter years drew half their
13221: bitterness from her ever-living remembrance of the too short years of
13222: love that went before; and the thought that her husband would ever put
13223: her hand to his lips again, and recall the days when they sat on the
13224: grass together, and he laid scarlet poppies on her black hair, and called
13225: her his gypsy queen, seemed to send a tide of loving oblivion over all
13226: the harsh and stony space they had traversed since. The Divine Love that
13227: had already shone upon her would be with her; she would lift up her soul
13228: continually for help; Mr. Tryan, she knew, would pray for her. If she
13229: felt herself failing, she would confess it to him at once; if her feet
13230: began to slip, there was that stay for her to cling to. O she could never
13231: be drawn back into that cold damp vault of sin and despair again; she had
13232: felt the morning sun, she had tasted the sweet pure air of trust and
13233: penitence and submission.
13234: 
13235: These were the thoughts passing through Janet’s mind as she hovered about
13236: her husband’s bed, and these were the hopes she poured out to Mr. Tryan
13237: when he called to see her. It was so evident that they were strengthening
13238: her in her new struggle--they shed such a glow of calm enthusiasm over
13239: her face as she spoke of them, that Mr. Tryan could not bear to throw on
13240: them the chill of premonitory doubts, though a previous conversation he
13241: had had with Mr. Pilgrim had convinced him that there was not the
13242: faintest probability of Dempster’s recovery. Poor Janet did not know the
13243: significance of the changing symptoms, and when, after the lapse of a
13244: week, the delirium began to lose some of its violence, and to be
13245: interrupted by longer and longer intervals of stupor, she tried to think
13246: that these might be steps on the way to recovery, and she shrank from
13247: questioning Mr. Pilgrim lest he should confirm the fears that began to
13248: get predominance in her mind. But before many days were past, he thought
13249: it right not to allow her to blind herself any longer. One day--it was
13250: just about noon, when bad news always seems most sickening--he led her
13251: from her husband’s chamber into the opposite drawing-room, where Mrs.
13252: Raynor was sitting, and said to her, in that low tone of sympathetic
13253: feeling which sometimes gave a sudden air of gentleness to this rough
13254: man--‘My dear Mrs. Dempster, it is right in these cases, you know, to be
13255: prepared for the worst. I think I shall be saving you pain by preventing
13256: you from entertaining any false hopes, and Mr. Dempster’s state is now
13257: such that I fear we must consider recovery impossible. The affection of
13258: the brain might not have been hopeless, but, you see, there is a terrible
13259: complication; and, I am grieved to say, the broken limb is mortifying.’
13260: 
13261: Janet listened with a sinking heart. That future of love and forgiveness
13262: would never come then: he was going out of her sight for ever, where her
13263: pity could never reach him. She turned cold, and trembled.
13264: 
13265: ‘But do you think he will die,’ she said, ‘without ever coming to
13266: himself? without ever knowing me?’
13267: 
13268: ‘One cannot say that with certainty. It is not impossible that the
13269: cerebral oppression may subside, and that he may become conscious. If
13270: there is anything you would wish to be said or done in that case, it
13271: would be well to be prepared. I should think,’ Mr. Pilgrim continued,
13272: turning to Mrs. Raynor, ‘Mr. Dempster’s affairs are likely to be in
13273: order--his will is ...’
13274: 
13275: ‘O, I wouldn’t have him troubled about those things,’ interrupted Janet,
13276: ‘he has no relations but quite distant ones--no one but me. I wouldn’t
13277: take up the time with that. I only want to ...’
13278: 
13279: She was unable to finish; she felt her sobs rising, and left the room. ‘O
13280: God!’ she said, inwardly, ‘is not Thy love greater than mine? Have mercy
13281: on him! have mercy on him!’
13282: 
13283: This happened on Wednesday, ten days after the fatal accident. By the
13284: following Sunday, Dempster was in a state of rapidly increasing
13285: prostration; and when Mr. Pilgrim, who, in turn with his assistant, had
13286: slept in the house from the beginning, came in, about half-past ten, as
13287: usual, he scarcely believed that the feebly struggling life would last
13288: out till morning. For the last few days he had been administering
13289: stimulants to relieve the exhaustion which had succeeded the alternations
13290: of delirium and stupor. This slight office was all that now remained to
13291: be done for the patient; so at eleven o’clock Mr. Pilgrim went to bed,
13292: having given directions to the nurse, and desired her to call him if any
13293: change took place, or if Mrs. Dempster desired his presence.
13294: 
13295: Janet could not be persuaded to leave the room. She was yearning and
13296: watching for a moment in which her husband’s eyes would rest consciously
13297: upon her, and he would know that she had forgiven him.
13298: 
13299: How changed he was since that terrible Monday, nearly a fortnight ago! He
13300: lay motionless, but for the irregular breathing that stirred his broad
13301: chest and thick muscular neck. His features were no longer purple and
13302: swollen; they were pale, sunken, and haggard. A cold perspiration stood
13303: in beads on the protuberant forehead, and on the wasted hands stretched
13304: motionless on the bed-clothes. It was better to see the hands so, than
13305: convulsively picking the air, as they had been a week ago.
13306: 
13307: Janet sat on the edge of the bed through the long hours of candle-light,
13308: watching the unconscious half-closed eyes, wiping the perspiration from
13309: the brow and cheeks, and keeping her left hand on the cold unanswering
13310: right hand that lay beside her on the bed-clothes. She was almost as pale
13311: as her dying husband, and there were dark lines under her eyes, for this
13312: was the third night since she had taken off her clothes; but the eager
13313: straining gaze of her dark eyes, and the acute sensibility that lay in
13314: every line about her mouth, made a strange contrast with the blank
13315: unconsciousness and emaciated animalism of the face she was watching.
13316: 
13317: There was profound stillness in the house. She heard no sound but her
13318: husband’s breathing and the ticking of the watch on the mantelpiece. The
13319: candle, placed high up, shed a soft light down on the one object she
13320: cared to see. There was a smell of brandy in the room; it was given to
13321: her husband from time to time; but this smell, which at first had
13322: produced in her a faint shuddering sensation, was now becoming
13323: indifferent to her: she did not even perceive it; she was too unconscious
13324: of herself to feel either temptations or accusations. She only felt that
13325: the husband of her youth was dying; far, far out of her reach, as if she
13326: were standing helpless on the shore, while he was sinking in the black
13327: storm-waves; she only yearned for one moment in which she might satisfy
13328: the deep forgiving pity of her soul by one look of love, one word of
13329: tenderness.
13330: 
13331: Her sensations and thoughts were so persistent that she could not measure
13332: the hours, and it was a surprise to her when the nurse put out the
13333: candle, and let in the faint morning light. Mrs. Raynor, anxious about
13334: Janet, was already up, and now brought in some fresh coffee for her; and
13335: Mr. Pilgrim having awaked, had hurried on his clothes, and was coming in
13336: to see how Dempster was.
13337: 
13338: This change from candle-light to morning, this recommencement of the same
13339: round of things that had happened yesterday, was a discouragement rather
13340: than a relief to Janet. She was more conscious of her chill weariness:
13341: the new light thrown on her husband’s face seemed to reveal the still
13342: work that death had been doing through the night; she felt her last
13343: lingering hope that he would ever know her again forsake her.
13344: 
13345: But now, Mr. Pilgrim, having felt the pulse, was putting some brandy in a
13346: tea-spoon between Dempster’s lips; the brandy went down, and his
13347: breathing became freer. Janet noticed the change, and her heart beat
13348: faster as she leaned forward to watch him. Suddenly a slight movement,
13349: like the passing away of a shadow, was visible in his face, and he opened
13350: his eyes full on Janet. It was almost like meeting him again on the
13351: resurrection morning, after the night of the grave.
13352: 
13353: ‘Robert, do you know me?’
13354: 
13355: He kept his eyes fixed on her, and there was a faintly perceptible motion
13356: of the lips, as if he wanted to speak.
13357: 
13358: But the moment of speech was for ever gone--the moment for asking pardon
13359: of her, if he wanted to ask it. Could he read the full forgiveness that
13360: was written in her eyes? She never knew; for, as she was bending to kiss
13361: him, the thick veil of death fell between them, and her lips touched a

13367: Chapter 25
13368: 
13369: 
13370: The faces looked very hard and unmoved that surrounded Dempster’s grave,
13371: while old Mr. Crewe read the burial-service in his low, broken voice. The
13372: pall-bearers were such men as Mr. Pittman, Mr. Lowme, and Mr. Budd--men
13373: whom Dempster had called his friends while he was in life; and worldly
13374: faces never look so worldly as at a funeral. They have the same effect of
13375: grating incongruity as the sound of a coarse voice breaking the solemn
13376: silence of night.
13377: 
13378: The one face that had sorrow in it was covered by a thick crape-veil, and
13379: the sorrow was suppressed and silent. No one knew how deep it was; for
13380: the thought in most of her neighbours’ minds was, that Mrs. Dempster
13381: could hardly have had better fortune than to lose a bad husband who had
13382: left her the compensation of a good income. They found it difficult to
13383: conceive that her husband’s death could be felt by her otherwise than as
13384: a deliverance. The person who was most thoroughly convinced that Janet’s
13385: grief was deep and real, was Mr. Pilgrim, who in general was not at all
13386: weakly given to a belief in disinterested feeling.
13387: 
13388: ‘That woman has a tender heart,’ he was frequently heard to observe in
13389: his morning rounds about this time. ‘I used to think there was a great
13390: deal of palaver in her, but you may depend upon it there’s no pretence
13391: about her. If he’d been the kindest husband in the world she couldn’t
13392: have felt more. There’s a great deal of good in Mrs. Dempster--a great
13393: deal of good.’
13394: 
13395: ‘_I_ always said so,’ was Mrs. Lowme’s reply, when he made the
13396: observation to her; ‘she was always so very full of pretty attentions to
13397: me when I was ill. But they tell me now she’s turned Tryanite; if that’s
13398: it we shan’t agree again. It’s very inconsistent in her, I think, turning
13399: round in that way, after being the foremost to laugh at the Tryanite
13400: cant, and especially in a woman of her habits; she should cure herself of
13401: them before she pretends to be over-religious.’
13402: 
13403: ‘Well, I think she means to cure herself, do you know,’ said Mr. Pilgrim,
13404: whose goodwill towards Janet was just now quite above that temperate
13405: point at which he could indulge his feminine patients with a little
13406: judicious detraction. ‘I feel sure she has not taken any stimulants all
13407: through her husband’s illness; and she has been constantly in the way of
13408: them. I can see she sometimes suffers a good deal of depression for want
13409: of them--it shows all the more resolution in her. Those cures are rare:
13410: but I’ve known them happen sometimes with people of strong will.’
13411: 
13412: Mrs. Lowme took an opportunity of retailing Mr. Pilgrim’s conversation to
13413: Mrs. Phipps, who, as a victim of Pratt and plethora, could rarely enjoy
13414: that pleasure at first-hand. Mrs. Phipps was a woman of decided opinions,
13415: though of wheezy utterance.
13416: 
13417: ‘For my part,’ she remarked, ‘I’m glad to hear there’s any likelihood of
13418: improvement in Mrs. Dempster, but I think the way things have turned out
13419: seems to show that she was more to blame than people thought she was;
13420: else, why should she feel so much about her husband? And Dempster, I
13421: understand, has left his wife pretty nearly all his property to do as she
13422: likes with; _that_ isn’t behaving like such a very bad husband. I don’t
13423: believe Mrs. Dempster can have had so much provocation as they pretended.
13424: I’ve known husbands who’ve laid plans for tormenting their wives when
13425: they’re underground--tying up their money and hindering them from
13426: marrying again. Not that _I_ should ever wish to marry again; I think one
13427: husband in one’s life is enough in all conscience’;--here she threw a
13428: fierce glance at the amiable Mr. Phipps, who was innocently delighting
13429: himself with the _facetiæ_ in the ‘Rotherby Guardian,’ and thinking the
13430: editor must be a droll fellow--‘but it’s aggravating to be tied up in
13431: that way. Why, they say Mrs. Dempster will have as good as six hundred
13432: a-year at least. A fine thing for her, that was a poor girl without a
13433: farthing to her fortune. It’s well if she doesn’t make ducks and drakes
13434: of it somehow.’
13435: 
13436: Mrs. Phipps’s view of Janet, however, was far from being the prevalent
13437: one in Milby. Even neighbours who had no strong personal interest in her,
13438: could hardly see the noble-looking woman in her widow’s dress, with a sad
13439: sweet gravity in her face, and not be touched with fresh admiration for
13440: her--and not feel, at least vaguely, that she had entered on a new life
13441: in which it was a sort of desecration to allude to the painful past. And
13442: the old friends who had a real regard for her, but whose cordiality had
13443: been repelled or chilled of late years, now came round her with hearty
13444: demonstrations of affection. Mr. Jerome felt that his happiness had a
13445: substantial addition now he could once more call on that ‘nice little
13446: woman Mrs. Dempster’, and think of her with rejoicing instead of sorrow.
13447: The Pratts lost no time in returning to the footing of old-established
13448: friendship with Janet and her mother; and Miss Pratt felt it incumbent on
13449: her, on all suitable occasions, to deliver a very emphatic approval of
13450: the remarkable strength of mind she understood Mrs. Dempster to be
13451: exhibiting. The Miss Linnets were eager to meet Mr. Tryan’s wishes by
13452: greeting Janet as one who was likely to be a sister in religious feeling
13453: and good works; and Mrs. Linnet was so agreeably surprised by the fact
13454: that Dempster had left his wife the money ‘in that handsome way, to do
13455: what she liked with it,’ that she even included Dempster himself, and his
13456: villanous discovery of the flaw in her title to Pye’s Croft, in her
13457: magnanimous oblivion of past offences. She and Mrs. Jerome agreed over a
13458: friendly cup of tea that there were ‘a many husbands as was very fine
13459: spoken an’ all that, an’ yet all the while kep’ a will locked up from
13460: you, as tied you up as tight as anything. I assure _you_,’ Mrs. Jerome
13461: continued, dropping her voice in a confidential manner, ‘I know no more
13462: to this day about Mr. Jerome’s will, nor the child as is unborn. I’ve no
13463: fears about a income--I’m well aware Mr. Jerome ’ud niver leave me stret
13464: for that; but I should like to hev a thousand or two at my own disposial;
13465: it makes a widow a deal more looked on.’
13466: 
13467: Perhaps this ground of respect to widows might not be entirely without
13468: its influence on the Milby mind, and might do something towards
13469: conciliating those more aristocratic acquaintances of Janet’s, who would
13470: otherwise have been inclined to take the severest view of her apostasy
13471: towards Evangelicalism. Errors look so very ugly in persons of small
13472: means--one feels they are taking quite a liberty in going astray; whereas
13473: people of fortune may naturally indulge in a few delinquencies. ‘They’ve
13474: got the money for it,’ as the girl said of her mistress who had made
13475: herself ill with pickled salmon. However it may have been, there was not
13476: an acquaintance of Janet’s, in Milby, that did not offer her civilities
13477: in the early days of her widowhood. Even the severe Mrs. Phipps was not
13478: an exception; for heaven knows what would become of our sociality if we
13479: never visited people we speak ill of: we should live, like Egyptian
13480: hermits, in crowded solitude.
13481: 
13482: Perhaps the attentions most grateful to Janet were those of her old
13483: friend Mrs. Crewe, whose attachment to her favourite proved quite too
13484: strong for any resentment she might be supposed to feel on the score of
13485: Mr. Tryan. The little deaf old lady couldn’t do without her accustomed
13486: visitor, whom she had seen grow up from child to woman, always so willing
13487: to chat with her and tell her all the news, though she _was_ deaf; while
13488: other people thought it tiresome to shout in her ear, and irritated her
13489: by recommending ear-trumpets of various construction.
13490: 
13491: All this friendliness was very precious to Janet. She was conscious of
13492: the aid it gave her in the self-conquest which was the blessing she
13493: prayed for with every fresh morning. The chief strength of her nature lay
13494: in her affection, which coloured all the rest of her mind: it gave a
13495: personal sisterly tenderness to her acts of benevolence; it made her
13496: cling with tenacity to every object that had once stirred her kindly
13497: emotions. Alas! it was unsatisfied, wounded affection that had made her
13498: trouble greater than she could bear. And now there was no check to the
13499: full flow of that plenteous current in her nature--no gnawing secret
13500: anguish--no overhanging terror--no inward shame. Friendly faces beamed on
13501: her; she felt that friendly hearts were approving her, and wishing her
13502: well, and that mild sunshine of goodwill fell beneficently on her new
13503: hopes and efforts, as the clear shining after rain falls on the tender
13504: leaf-buds of spring, and wins them from promise to fulfilment.
13505: 
13506: And she needed these secondary helps, for her wrestling with her past
13507: self was not always easy. The strong emotions from which the life of a
13508: human being receives a new bias, win their victory as the sea wins his:
13509: though their advance may be sure, they will often, after a mightier wave
13510: than usual, seem to roll back so far as to lose all the ground they had
13511: made. Janet showed the strong bent of her will by taking every outward
13512: precaution against the occurrence of a temptation. Her mother was now her
13513: constant companion, having shut up her little dwelling and come to reside
13514: in Orchard Street; and Janet gave all dangerous keys into her keeping,
13515: entreating her to lock them away in some secret place. Whenever the too
13516: well-known depression and craving threatened her, she would seek a refuge
13517: in what had always been her purest enjoyment--in visiting one of her poor
13518: neighbours, in carrying some food or comfort to a sick-bed, in cheering
13519: with her smile some of the familiar dwellings up the dingy back-lanes.
13520: But the great source of courage, the great help to perseverance, was the
13521: sense that she had a friend and teacher in Mr. Tryan: she could confess
13522: her difficulties to him; she knew he prayed for her; she had always
13523: before her the prospect of soon seeing him, and hearing words of
13524: admonition and comfort, that came to her charged with a divine power such
13525: as she had never found in human words before.
13526: 
13527: So the time passed, till it was far on in May, nearly a month after her
13528: husband’s death, when, as she and her mother were seated peacefully at
13529: breakfast in the dining-room, looking through the open window at the
13530: old-fashioned garden, where the grass-plot was now whitened with
13531: apple-blossoms, a letter was brought in for Mrs. Raynor.
13532: 
13533: ‘Why, there’s the Thurston post-mark on it,’ she said. ‘It must be about
13534: your aunt Anna. Ah, so it is, poor thing! she’s been taken worse this
13535: last day or two, and has asked them to send for me. That dropsy is
13536: carrying her off at last, I daresay. Poor thing! it will be a happy
13537: release. I must go, my dear--she’s your father’s last sister--though I am
13538: sorry to leave you. However, perhaps I shall not have to stay more than a
13539: night or two.’
13540: 
13541: Janet looked distressed as she said, ‘Yes, you must go, mother. But I
13542: don’t know what I shall do without you. I think I shall run in to Mrs.
13543: Pettifer, and ask her to come and stay with me while you’re away. I’m
13544: sure she will.’
13545: 
13546: At twelve o’clock, Janet, having seen her mother in the coach that was to
13547: carry her to Thurston, called, on her way back, at Mrs. Pettifer’s, but
13548: found, to her great disappointment, that her old friend was gone out for
13549: the day. So she wrote on a leaf of her pocket-book an urgent request that
13550: Mrs. Pettifer would come and stay with her while her mother was away;
13551: and, desiring the servant-girl to give it to her mistress as soon as she
13552: came home, walked on to the Vicarage to sit with Mrs. Crewe, thinking to
13553: relieve in this way the feeling of desolateness and undefined fear that
13554: was taking possession of her on being left alone for the first time since
13555: that great crisis in her life. And Mrs. Crewe, too, was not at home!
13556: 
13557: Janet, with a sense of discouragement for which she rebuked herself as
13558: childish, walked sadly home again; and when she entered the vacant
13559: dining-room, she could not help bursting into tears. It is such vague
13560: undefinable states of susceptibility as this--states of excitement or
13561: depression, half mental, half physical--that determine many a tragedy in
13562: women’s lives. Janet could scarcely eat anything at her solitary dinner:
13563: she tried to fix her attention on a book in vain; she walked about the
13564: garden, and felt the very sunshine melancholy.
13565: 
13566: Between four and five o’clock, old Mr. Pittman called, and joined her in
13567: the garden, where she had been sitting for some time under one of the
13568: great apple-trees, thinking how Robert, in his best moods, used to take
13569: little Mamsey to look at the cucumbers, or to see the Alderney cow with
13570: its calf in the paddock. The tears and sobs had come again at these
13571: thoughts; and when Mr. Pittman approached her, she was feeling languid
13572: and exhausted. But the old gentleman’s sight and sensibility were obtuse,
13573: and, to Janet’s satisfaction, he showed no consciousness that she was in
13574: grief.
13575: 
13576: ‘I have a task to impose upon you, Mrs. Dempster,’ he said, with a
13577: certain toothless pomposity habitual to him: ‘I want you to look over
13578: those letters again in Dempster’s bureau, and see if you can find one
13579: from Poole about the mortgage on those houses at Dingley. It will be
13580: worth twenty pounds, if you can find it; and I don’t know where it can
13581: be, if it isn’t among those letters in the bureau. I’ve looked everywhere
13582: at the office for it. I’m going home now, but I’ll call again to-morrow,
13583: if you’ll be good enough to look in the meantime.’
13584: 
13585: Janet said she would look directly, and turned with Mr. Pittman into the
13586: house. But the search would take her some time, so he bade her good-bye,
13587: and she went at once to a bureau which stood in a small back-room, where
13588: Dempster used sometimes to write letters and receive people who came on
13589: business out of office hours. She had looked through the contents of the
13590: bureau more than once; but to-day, on removing the last bundle of letters
13591: from one of the compartments, she saw what she had never seen before, a
13592: small nick in the wood, made in the shape of a thumb-nail, evidently
13593: intended as a means of pushing aside the movable back of the compartment.
13594: In her examination hitherto she had not found such a letter as Mr.
13595: Pittman had described--perhaps there might be more letters behind this
13596: slide. She pushed it back at once, and saw--no letters, but a small
13597: spirit-decanter, half full of pale brandy, Dempster’s habitual drink.
13598: 
13599: An impetuous desire shook Janet through all her members; it seemed to
13600: master her with the inevitable force of strong fumes that flood our
13601: senses before we are aware. Her hand was on the decanter: pale and
13602: excited, she was lifting it out of its niche, when, with a start and a
13603: shudder, she dashed it to the ground, and the room was filled with the
13604: odour of the spirit. Without staying to shut up the bureau, she rushed
13605: out of the room, snatched up her bonnet and mantle which lay in the
13606: dining-room, and hurried out of the house.
13607: 
13608: Where should she go? In what place would this demon that had re-entered
13609: her be scared back again? She walks rapidly along the street in the
13610: direction of the church. She is soon at the gate of the churchyard; she
13611: passes through it, and makes her way across the graves to a spot she
13612: knows--a spot where the turf was stirred not long ago, where a tomb is to
13613: be erected soon. It is very near the church wall, on the side which now
13614: lies in deep shadow, quite shut out from the rays of the westering sun by
13615: a projecting buttress.
13616: 
13617: Janet sat down on the ground. It was a sombre spot. A thick hedge,
13618: surmounted by elm-trees, was in front of her; a projecting buttress on
13619: each side. But she wanted to shut out even these objects. Her thick crape
13620: veil was down; but she closed her eyes behind it, and pressed her hands
13621: upon them. She wanted to summon up the vision of the past; she wanted to
13622: lash the demon out of her soul with the stinging memories of the bygone
13623: misery; she wanted to renew the old horror and the old anguish, that she
13624: might throw herself with the more desperate clinging energy at the foot
13625: of the cross, where the Divine Sufferer would impart divine strength. She
13626: tried to recall those first bitter moments of shame, which were like the
13627: shuddering discovery of the leper that the dire taint is upon him; the
13628: deeper and deeper lapse; the on-coming of settled despair; the awful
13629: moments by the bedside of her self-maddened husband. And then she tried
13630: to live through, with a remembrance made more vivid by that contrast, the
13631: blessed hours of hope and joy and peace that had come to her of late,
13632: since her whole soul had been bent towards the attainment of purity and
13633: holiness.
13634: 
13635: But now, when the paroxysm of temptation was past, dread and despondency
13636: began to thrust themselves, like cold heavy mists, between her and the
13637: heaven to which she wanted to look for light and guidance. The temptation
13638: would come again--that rush of desire might overmaster her the next
13639: time--she would slip back again into that deep slimy pit from which she
13640: had been once rescued, and there might be no deliverance for her more.
13641: Her prayers did not help her, for fear predominated over trust; she had
13642: no confidence that the aid she sought would be given; the idea of her
13643: future fall had grasped her mind too strongly. Alone, in this way, she
13644: was powerless. If she could see Mr. Tryan, if she could confess all to
13645: him, she might gather hope again. She _must_ see him; she must go to him.
13646: 
13647: Janet rose from the ground, and walked away with a quick resolved step.
13648: She had been seated there a long while, and the sun had already sunk. It
13649: was late for her to walk to Paddiford and go to Mr. Tryan’s, where she
13650: had never called before; but there was no other way of seeing him that
13651: evening, and she could not hesitate about it. She walked towards a
13652: footpath through the fields, which would take her to Paddiford without
13653: obliging her to go through the town. The way was rather long, but she
13654: preferred it, because it left less probability of her meeting
13655: acquaintances, and she shrank from having to speak to any one.
13656: 
13657: The evening red had nearly faded by the time Janet knocked at Mrs.
13658: Wagstaff’s door. The good woman looked surprised to see her at that hour;
13659: but Janet’s mourning weeds and the painful agitation of her face quickly
13660: brought the second thought, that some urgent trouble had sent her there.
13661: 
13662: ‘Mr. Tryan’s just come in,’ she said. ‘If you’ll step into the parlour,
13663: I’ll go up and tell him you’re here. He seemed very tired and poorly.’
13664: 
13665: At another time Janet would have felt distress at the idea that she was
13666: disturbing Mr. Tryan when he required rest; but now her need was too
13667: great for that: she could feel nothing but a sense of coming relief, when
13668: she heard his step on the stair and saw him enter the room.
13669: 
13670: He went towards her with a look of anxiety, and said, ‘I fear something
13671: is the matter. I fear you are in trouble.’
13672: 
13673: Then poor Janet poured forth her sad tale of temptation and despondency;
13674: and even while she was confessing she felt half her burden removed. The
13675: act of confiding in human sympathy, the consciousness that a fellow-being
13676: was listening to her with patient pity, prepared her soul for that
13677: stronger leap by which faith grasps the idea of the Divine sympathy. When
13678: Mr. Tryan spoke words of consolation and encouragement, she could now
13679: believe the message of mercy; the water-floods that had threatened to
13680: overwhelm her rolled back again, and life once more spread its
13681: heaven-covered space before her. She had been unable to pray alone; but
13682: now his prayer bore her own soul along with it, as the broad tongue of
13683: flame carries upwards in its vigorous leap the little flickering fire
13684: that could hardly keep alight by itself.
13685: 
13686: But Mr. Tryan was anxious that Janet should not linger out at this late
13687: hour. When he saw that she was calmed, he said, ‘I will walk home with
13688: you now; we can talk on the way.’ But Janet’s mind was now sufficiently
13689: at liberty for her to notice the signs of feverish weariness in his
13690: appearance, and she would not hear of causing him any further fatigue.
13691: 
13692: ‘No, no,’ she said, earnestly, ‘you will pain me very much--indeed you
13693: will, by going out again to-night on my account. There is no real reason
13694: why I should not go alone.’ And when he persisted, fearing that for her
13695: to be seen out so late alone might excite remark, she said imploringly,
13696: with a half sob in her voice, ‘What should I--what would others like me
13697: do, if you went from us? _Why_ will you not think more of that, and take
13698: care of yourself?’
13699: 
13700: He had often had that appeal made to him before, but to-night--from
13701: Janet’s lips--it seemed to have a new force for him, and he gave way. At
13702: first, indeed, he only did so on condition that she would let Mrs.
13703: Wagstaff go with her; but Janet had determined to walk home alone. She
13704: preferred solitude; she wished not to have her present feelings
13705: distracted by any conversation.
13706: 
13707: So she went out into the dewy starlight; and as Mr. Tryan turned away
13708: from her, he felt a stronger wish than ever that his fragile life might
13709: last out for him to see Janet’s restoration thoroughly established--to
13710: see her no longer fleeing, struggling, clinging up the steep sides of a
13711: precipice whence she might be any moment hurled back into the depths of
13712: despair, but walking firmly on the level ground of habit. He inwardly
13713: resolved that nothing but a peremptory duty should ever take him from
13714: Milby--that he would not cease to watch over her until life forsook him.
13715: 
13716: Janet walked on quickly till she turned into the fields; then she
13717: slackened her pace a little, enjoying the sense of solitude which a few
13718: hours before had been intolerable to her. The Divine Presence did not now
13719: seem far off, where she had not wings to reach it; prayer itself seemed
13720: superfluous in those moments of calm trust. The temptation which had so
13721: lately made her shudder before the possibilities of the future, was now a
13722: source of confidence; for had she not been delivered from it? Had not
13723: rescue come in the extremity of danger? Yes; Infinite Love was caring for
13724: her. She felt like a little child whose hand is firmly grasped by its
13725: father, as its frail limbs make their way over the rough ground; if it
13726: should stumble, the father will not let it go.
13727: 
13728: That walk in the dewy starlight remained for ever in Janet’s memory as
13729: one of those baptismal epochs, when the soul, dipped in the sacred waters
13730: of joy and peace, rises from them with new energies, with more
13731: unalterable longings.
13732: 
13733: When she reached home she found Mrs. Pettifer there, anxious for her
13734: return. After thanking her for coming, Janet only said, ‘I have been to
13735: Mr. Tryan’s; I wanted to speak to him;’ and then remembering how she had
13736: left the bureau and papers, she went into the back-room, where,
13737: apparently, no one had been since she quitted it; for there lay the
13738: fragments of glass, and the room was still full of the hateful odour. How
13739: feeble and miserable the temptation seemed to her at this moment! She
13740: rang for Kitty to come and pick up the fragments and rub the floor, while
13741: she herself replaced the papers and locked up the bureau.
13742: 
13743: The next morning, when seated at breakfast with Mrs. Pettifer, Janet
13744: said,--‘What a dreary unhealthy-looking place that is where Mr. Tryan
13745: lives! I’m sure it must be very bad for him to live there. Do you know,
13746: all this morning, since I’ve been awake, I’ve been turning over a little
13747: plan in my mind. I think it a charming one--all the more, because you are
13748: concerned in it.’
13749: 
13750: ‘Why, what can that be?’
13751: 
13752: ‘You know that house on the Redhill road they call Holly Mount; it is
13753: shut up now. That is Robert’s house; at least, it is mine now, and it
13754: stands on one of the healthiest spots about here. Now, I’ve been settling
13755: in my own mind, that if a dear good woman of my acquaintance, who knows
13756: how to make a home as comfortable and cosy as a bird’s nest, were to take
13757: up her abode there, and have Mr. Tryan as a lodger, she would be doing
13758: one of the most useful deeds in all her useful life.’
13759: 
13760: ‘You’ve such a way of wrapping up things in pretty words. You must speak
13761: plainer.’
13762: 
13763: ‘In plain words, then, I should like to settle you at Holly Mount. You
13764: would not have to pay any more rent than where you are, and it would be
13765: twenty times pleasanter for you than living up that passage where you see
13766: nothing but a brick wall. And then, as it is not far from Paddiford, I
13767: think Mr. Tryan might be persuaded to lodge with you, instead of in that
13768: musty house, among dead cabbages and smoky cottages. I know you would
13769: like to have him live with you, and you would be such a mother to him.’
13770: 
13771: ‘To be sure I should like it; it would be the finest thing in the world
13772: for me. But there’ll be furniture wanted. My little bit of furniture
13773: won’t fill that house.’
13774: 
13775: ‘O, I can put some in out of this house; it is too full; and we can buy
13776: the rest. They tell me I’m to have more money than I shall know what to
13777: do with.’
13778: 
13779: ‘I’m almost afraid,’ said Mrs. Pettifer, doubtfully, ‘Mr. Tryan will
13780: hardly be persuaded. He’s been talked to so much about leaving that
13781: place; and he always said he must stay there--he must be among the
13782: people, and there was no other place for him in Paddiford. It cuts me to
13783: the heart to see him getting thinner and thinner, and I’ve noticed him
13784: quite short o’ breath sometimes. Mrs. Linnet will have it, Mrs. Wagstaff
13785: half poisons him with bad cooking. I don’t know about that, but he can’t
13786: have many comforts. I expect he’ll break down all of a sudden some day,
13787: and never be able to preach any more.’
13788: 
13789: ‘Well, I shall try my skill with him by and by. I shall be very cunning,
13790: and say nothing to him till all is ready. You and I and mother, when she
13791: comes home, will set to work directly and get the house in order, and
13792: then we’ll get you snugly settled in it. I shall see Mr. Pittman to-day,
13793: and I will tell him what I mean to do. I shall say I wish to have you for
13794: a tenant. Everybody knows I’m very fond of that naughty person, Mrs.
13795: Pettifer; so it will seem the most natural thing in the world. And then I
13796: shall by and by point out to Mr. Tryan that he will be doing you a
13797: service as well as himself by taking up his abode with you. I think I can
13798: prevail upon him; for last night, when he was quite bent on coming out
13799: into the night air, I persuaded him to give it up.’
13800: 
13801: ‘Well, I only hope you may, my dear. I don’t desire anything better than
13802: to do something towards prolonging Mr. Tryan’s life, for I’ve sad fears
13803: about him.’
13804: 
13805: ‘Don’t speak of them--I can’t bear to think of them. We will only think
13806: about getting the house ready. We shall be as busy as bees. How we shall
13807: want mother’s clever fingers! I know the room up-stairs that will just do
13808: for Mr. Tryan’s study. There shall be no seats in it except a very easy
13809: chair and a very easy sofa, so that he shall be obliged to rest himself
13810: when he comes home.’
13811: 
13812: 
13813: 
13814: 
13815: Chapter 26
13816: 
13817: 
13818: That was the last terrible crisis of temptation Janet had to pass
13819: through. The goodwill of her neighbours, the helpful sympathy of the
13820: friends who shared her religious feelings, the occupations suggested to
13821: her by Mr. Tryan, concurred, with her strong spontaneous impulses towards
13822: works of love and mercy, to fill up her days with quiet social
13823: intercourse and charitable exertion. Besides, her constitution, naturally
13824: healthy and strong, was every week tending, with the gathering force of
13825: habit, to recover its equipoise, and set her free from those physical
13826: solicitations which the smallest habitual vice always leaves behind it.
13827: The prisoner feels where the iron has galled him, long after his fetters
13828: have been loosed.
13829: 
13830: There were always neighbourly visits to be paid and received; and as the
13831: months wore on, increasing familiarity with Janet’s present self began to
13832: efface, even from minds as rigid as Mrs. Phipps’s, the unpleasant
13833: impressions that had been left by recent years. Janet was recovering the
13834: popularity which her beauty and sweetness of nature had won for her when
13835: she was a girl; and popularity, as every one knows, is the most complex
13836: and self-multiplying of echoes. Even anti-Tryanite prejudice could not
13837: resist the fact that Janet Dempster was a changed woman--changed as the
13838: dusty, bruised, and sun-withered plant is changed when the soft rains of
13839: heaven have fallen on it--and that this change was due to Mr. Tryan’s
13840: influence. The last lingering sneers against the Evangelical curate began
13841: to die out; and though much of the feeling that had prompted them
13842: remained behind, there was an intimidating consciousness that the
13843: expression of such feeling would not be effective--jokes of that sort had
13844: ceased to tickle the Milby mind. Even Mr. Budd and Mr. Tomlinson, when
13845: they saw Mr. Tryan passing pale and worn along the street, had a secret
13846: sense that this man was somehow not that very natural and comprehensible
13847: thing, a humbug--that, in fact, it was impossible to explain him from the
13848: stomach and pocket point of view. Twist and stretch their theory as they
13849: might, it would not fit Mr. Tryan; and so, with that remarkable
13850: resemblance as to mental processes which may frequently be observed to
13851: exist between plain men and philosophers, they concluded that the less
13852: they said about him the better.
13853: 
13854: Among all Janet’s neighbourly pleasures, there was nothing she liked
13855: better than to take an early tea at the White House, and to stroll with
13856: Mr. Jerome round the old-fashioned garden and orchard. There was endless
13857: matter for talk between her and the good old man, for Janet had that
13858: genuine delight in human fellowship which gives an interest to all
13859: personal details that come warm from truthful lips; and, besides, they
13860: had a common interest in good-natured plans for helping their poorer
13861: neighbours. One great object of Mr. Jerome’s charities was, as he often
13862: said, ‘to keep industrious men an’ women off the parish. I’d rether given
13863: ten shillin’ an’ help a man to stand on his own legs, nor pay
13864: half-a-crown to buy him a parish crutch; it’s the ruination on him if he
13865: once goes to the parish. I’ve see’d many a time, if you help a man wi’ a
13866: present in a neeborly way, it sweetens his blood--he thinks it kind on
13867: you; but the parish shillins turn it sour--he niver thinks ’em enough.’
13868: In illustration of this opinion Mr. Jerome had a large store of details
13869: about such persons as Jim Hardy, the coal-carrier, ‘as lost his hoss,’
13870: and Sally Butts, ‘as hed to sell her mangle, though she was as decent a
13871: woman as need to be’; to the hearing of which details Janet seriously
13872: inclined; and you would hardly desire to see a prettier picture than the
13873: kind-faced white-haired old man telling these fragments of his simple
13874: experience as he walked, with shoulders slightly bent, among the
13875: moss-roses and espalier apple-trees, while Janet in her widow’s cap, her
13876: dark eyes bright with interest, went listening by his side, and little
13877: Lizzie, with her nankeen bonnet hanging down her back, toddled on before
13878: them. Mrs. Jerome usually declined these lingering strolls, and often
13879: observed, ‘I niver see the like to Mr. Jerome when he’s got Mrs. Dempster
13880: to talk to; it sinnifies nothin’ to him whether we’ve tea at four or at
13881: five o’clock; he’d go on till six, if you’d let him alone--he’s like off
13882: his head.’ However, Mrs. Jerome herself could not deny that Janet was a
13883: very pretty-spoken woman: ‘She al’ys says, she niver gets sich pikelets
13884: as mine nowhere; I know that very well--other folks buy ’em at
13885: shops--thick, unwholesome things, you might as well eat a sponge.’
13886: 
13887: The sight of little Lizzie often stirred in Janet’s mind a sense of the
13888: childlessness which had made a fatal blank in her life. She had fleeting
13889: thoughts that perhaps among her husband’s distant relatives there might
13890: be some children whom she could help to bring up, some little girl whom
13891: she might adopt; and she promised herself one day or other to hunt out a
13892: second cousin of his--a married woman, of whom he had lost sight for many
13893: years.
13894: 
13895: But at present her hands and heart were too full for her to carry out
13896: that scheme. To her great disappointment, her project of settling Mrs.
13897: Pettifer at Holly Mount had been delayed by the discovery that some
13898: repairs were necessary in order to make the house habitable, and it was
13899: not till September had set in that she had the satisfaction of seeing her
13900: old friend comfortably installed, and the rooms destined for Mr. Tryan
13901: looking pretty and cosy to her heart’s content. She had taken several of
13902: his chief friends into her confidence, and they were warmly wishing
13903: success to her plan for inducing him to quit poor Mrs. Wagstaff’s dingy
13904: house and dubious cookery. That he should consent to some such change was
13905: becoming more and more a matter of anxiety to his hearers; for though no
13906: more decided symptoms were yet observable in him than increasing
13907: emaciation, a dry hacking cough, and an occasional shortness of breath,
13908: it was felt that the fulfilment of Mr. Pratt’s prediction could not long
13909: be deferred, and that this obstinate persistence in labour and
13910: self-disregard must soon be peremptorily cut short by a total failure of
13911: strength. Any hopes that the influence of Mr. Tryan’s father and sister
13912: would prevail on him to change his mode of life--that they would perhaps
13913: come to live with him, or that his sister at least might come to see him,
13914: and that the arguments which had failed from other lips might be more
13915: persuasive from hers--were now quite dissipated. His father had lately
13916: had an attack of paralysis, and could not spare his only daughter’s
13917: tendance. On Mr. Tryan’s return from a visit to his father, Miss Linnet
13918: was very anxious to know whether his sister had not urged him to try
13919: change of air. From his answers she gathered that Miss Tryan wished him
13920: to give up his curacy and travel, or at least go to the south Devonshire
13921: coast.
13922: 
13923: ‘And why will you not do so?’ Miss Linnet said; ‘you might come back to
13924: us well and strong, and have many years of usefulness before you.’
13925: 
13926: ‘No,’ he answered quietly, ‘I think people attach more importance to such
13927: measures than is warranted. I don’t see any good end that is to be served
13928: by going to die at Nice, instead of dying amongst one’s friends and one’s
13929: work. I cannot leave Milby--at least I will not leave it voluntarily.’
13930: 
13931: But though he remained immovable on this point, he had been compelled to
13932: give up his afternoon service on the Sunday, and to accept Mr. Parry’s
13933: offer of aid in the evening service, as well as to curtail his week-day
13934: labours; and he had even written to Mr. Prendergast to request that he
13935: would appoint another curate to the Paddiford district, on the
13936: understanding that the new curate should receive the salary, but that Mr.
13937: Tryan should co-operate with him as long as he was able. The hopefulness
13938: which is an almost constant attendant on consumption, had not the effect
13939: of deceiving him as to the nature of his malady, or of making him look
13940: forward to ultimate recovery. He believed himself to be consumptive, and
13941: he had not yet felt any desire to escape the early death which he had for
13942: some time contemplated as probable. Even diseased hopes will take their
13943: direction from the strong habitual bias of the mind, and to Mr. Tryan
13944: death had for years seemed nothing else than the laying down of a burden,
13945: under which he sometimes felt himself fainting. He was only sanguine
13946: about his powers of work: he flattered himself that what he was unable to
13947: do one week he should be equal to the next, and he would not admit that
13948: in desisting from any part of his labour he was renouncing it
13949: permanently. He had lately delighted Mr. Jerome by accepting his
13950: long-proffered loan of the ‘little chacenut hoss;’ and he found so much
13951: benefit from substituting constant riding exercise for walking, that he
13952: began to think he should soon be able to resume some of the work he had
13953: dropped.
13954: 
13955: That was a happy afternoon for Janet, when, after exerting herself busily
13956: for a week with her mother and Mrs. Pettifer, she saw Holly Mount looking
13957: orderly and comfortable from attic to cellar. It was an old red-brick
13958: house, with two gables in front, and two clipped holly-trees flanking the
13959: garden-gate; a simple, homely-looking place, that quiet people might
13960: easily get fond of; and now it was scoured and polished and carpeted and
13961: furnished so as to look really snug within. When there was nothing more
13962: to be done, Janet delighted herself with contemplating Mr. Tryan’s study,
13963: first sitting down in the easy-chair, and then lying for a moment on the
13964: sofa, that she might have a keener sense of the repose he would get from
13965: those well-stuffed articles of furniture, which she had gone to Rotherby
13966: on purpose to choose.
13967: 
13968: ‘Now, mother,’ she said, when she had finished her survey, ‘you have done
13969: your work as well as any fairy-mother or god-mother that ever turned a
13970: pumpkin into a coach and horses. You stay and have tea cosily with Mrs.
13971: Pettifer while I go to Mrs. Linnet’s. I want to tell Mary and Rebecca the
13972: good news, that I’ve got the exciseman to promise that he will take Mrs.
13973: Wagstaff’s lodgings when Mr. Tryan leaves. They’ll be so pleased to hear
13974: it, because they thought he would make her poverty an objection to his
13975: leaving her.’
13976: 
13977: ‘But, my dear child,’ said Mrs. Raynor, whose face, always calm, was now
13978: a happy one, ‘have a cup of tea with us first. You’ll perhaps miss Mrs.
13979: Linnet’s tea-time.’
13980: 
13981: ‘No, I feel too excited to take tea yet. I’m like a child with a new
13982: baby-house. Walking in the air will do me good.’
13983: 
13984: So she set out. Holly Mount was about a mile from that outskirt of
13985: Paddiford Common where Mrs. Linnet’s house stood nestled among its
13986: laburnums, lilacs, and syringas. Janet’s way thither lay for a little
13987: while along the high-road, and then led her into a deep-rutted lane,
13988: which wound through a flat tract of meadow and pasture, while in front
13989: lay smoky Paddiford, and away to the left the mother-town of Milby. There
13990: was no line of silvery willows marking the course of a stream--no group
13991: of Scotch firs with their trunks reddening in the level sunbeams--nothing
13992: to break the flowerless monotony of grass and hedgerow but an occasional
13993: oak or elm, and a few cows sprinkled here and there. A very commonplace
13994: scene, indeed. But what scene was ever commonplace in the descending
13995: sunlight, when colour has awakened from its noonday sleep, and the long
13996: shadows awe us like a disclosed presence? Above all, what scene is
13997: commonplace to the eye that is filled with serene gladness, and brightens
13998: all things with its own joy?
13999: 
14000: And Janet just now was very happy. As she walked along the rough lane
14001: with a buoyant step, a half smile of innocent, kindly triumph played
14002: about her mouth. She was delighting beforehand in the anticipated success
14003: of her persuasive power, and for the time her painful anxiety about Mr.
14004: Tryan’s health was thrown into abeyance. But she had not gone far along
14005: the lane before she heard the sound of a horse advancing at a walking
14006: pace behind her. Without looking back, she turned aside to make way for
14007: it between the ruts, and did not notice that for a moment it had stopped,
14008: and had then come on with a slightly quickened pace. In less than a
14009: minute she heard a well-known voice say, ‘Mrs. Dempster’; and, turning,
14010: saw Mr. Tryan close to her, holding his horse by the bridle. It seemed
14011: very natural to her that he should be there. Her mind was so full of his
14012: presence at that moment, that the actual sight of him was only like a
14013: more vivid thought, and she behaved, as we are apt to do when feeling
14014: obliges us to be genuine, with a total forgetfulness of polite forms. She
14015: only looked at him with a slight deepening of the smile that was already
14016: on her face. He said gently, ‘Take my arm’; and they walked on a little
14017: way in silence.
14018: 
14019: It was he who broke it. ‘You are going to Paddiford, I suppose?’
14020: 
14021: The question recalled Janet to the consciousness that this was an
14022: unexpected opportunity for beginning her work of persuasion, and that she
14023: was stupidly neglecting it.
14024: 
14025: ‘Yes,’ she said, ‘I was going to Mrs. Linnet’s. I knew Miss Linnet would
14026: like to hear that our friend Mrs. Pettifer is quite settled now in her
14027: new house. She is as fond of Mrs. Pettifer as I am--almost; I won’t admit
14028: that any one loves her _quite_ as well, for no one else has such good
14029: reason as I have. But now the dear woman wants a lodger, for you know she
14030: can’t afford to live in so large a house by herself. But I knew when I
14031: persuaded her to go there that she would be sure to get one--she’s such a
14032: comfortable creature to live with; and I didn’t like her to spend all the
14033: rest of her days up that dull passage, being at every one’s beck and call
14034: who wanted to make use of her.’
14035: 
14036: ‘Yes,’ said Mr. Tryan, ‘I quite understand your feeling; I don’t wonder
14037: at your strong regard for her.’
14038: 
14039: ‘Well, but now I want her other friends to second me. There she is, with
14040: three rooms to let, ready furnished, everything in order; and I know some
14041: one, who thinks as well of her as I do, and who would be doing good all
14042: round--to every one that knows him, as well as to Mrs. Pettifer, if he
14043: would go to live with her. He would leave some uncomfortable lodgings,
14044: which another person is already coveting and would take immediately; and
14045: he would go to breathe pure air at Holly Mount, and gladden Mrs.
14046: Pettifer’s heart by letting her wait on him; and comfort all his friends,
14047: who are quite miserable about him.’
14048: 
14049: Mr. Tryan saw it all in a moment--he saw that it had all been done for
14050: his sake. He could not be sorry; he could not say no; he could not resist
14051: the sense that life had a new sweetness for him, and that he should like
14052: it to be prolonged a little--only a little, for the sake of feeling a
14053: stronger security about Janet. When she had finished speaking, she looked
14054: at him with a doubtful, inquiring glance. He was not looking at her; his
14055: eyes were cast downwards; but the expression of his face encouraged her,
14056: and she said, in a half-playful tone of entreaty,--‘You _will_ go and
14057: live with her? I know you will. You will come back with me now and see
14058: the house.’
14059: 
14060: He looked at her then, and smiled. There is an unspeakable blending of
14061: sadness and sweetness in the smile of a face sharpened and paled by slow
14062: consumption. That smile of Mr. Tryan’s pierced poor Janet’s heart: she
14063: felt in it at once the assurance of grateful affection and the prophecy
14064: of coming death. Her tears rose; they turned round without speaking, and
14065: went back again along the lane.
14066: 
14067: 
14068: 
14069: 
14070: Chapter 27
14071: 
14072: 
14073: In less than a week Mr. Tryan was settled at Holly Mount, and there was
14074: not one of his many attached hearers who did not sincerely rejoice at the
14075: event.
14076: 
14077: The autumn that year was bright and warm, and at the beginning of
14078: October, Mr. Walsh, the new curate, came. The mild weather, the
14079: relaxation from excessive work, and perhaps another benignant influence,
14080: had for a few weeks a visibly favourable effect on Mr. Tryan. At least he
14081: began to feel new hopes, which sometimes took the guise of new strength.
14082: He thought of the cases in which consumption patients remain nearly
14083: stationary for years, without suffering so as to make their life
14084: burdensome to themselves or to others; and he began to struggle with a
14085: longing that it might be so with him. He struggled with it, because he
14086: felt it to be an indication that earthly affection was beginning to have
14087: too strong a hold on him, and he prayed earnestly for more perfect
14088: submission, and for a more absorbing delight in the Divine Presence as
14089: the chief good. He was conscious that he did not wish for prolonged life
14090: solely that he might reclaim the wanderers and sustain the feeble: he was
14091: conscious of a new yearning for those pure human joys which he had
14092: voluntarily and determinedly banished from his life--for a draught of
14093: that deep affection from which he had been cut off by a dark chasm of
14094: remorse. For now, that affection was within his reach; he saw it there,
14095: like a palm-shadowed well in the desert; he _could_ not desire to die in
14096: sight of it.
14097: 
14098: And so the autumn rolled gently by in its ‘calm decay’. Until November,
14099: Mr. Tryan continued to preach occasionally, to ride about visiting his
14100: flock, and to look in at his schools: but his growing satisfaction in Mr.
14101: Walsh as his successor saved him from too eager exertion and from
14102: worrying anxieties. Janet was with him a great deal now, for she saw that
14103: he liked her to read to him in the lengthening evenings, and it became
14104: the rule for her and her mother to have tea at Holly Mount, where, with
14105: Mrs. Pettifer, and sometimes another friend or two, they brought Mr.
14106: Tryan the unaccustomed enjoyment of companionship by his own fireside.
14107: 
14108: Janet did not share his new hopes, for she was not only in the habit of
14109: hearing Mr. Pratt’s opinion that Mr. Tryan could hardly stand out through
14110: the winter, but she also knew that it was shared by Dr Madely of
14111: Rotherby, whom, at her request, he had consented to call in. It was not
14112: necessary or desirable to tell Mr. Tryan what was revealed by the
14113: stethoscope, but Janet knew the worst.
14114: 
14115: She felt no rebellion under this prospect of bereavement, but rather a
14116: quiet submissive sorrow. Gratitude that his influence and guidance had
14117: been given her, even if only for a little while--gratitude that she was
14118: permitted to be with him, to take a deeper and deeper impress from daily
14119: communion with him, to be something to him in these last months of his
14120: life, was so strong in her that it almost silenced regret. Janet had
14121: lived through the great tragedy of woman’s life. Her keenest personal
14122: emotions had been poured forth in her early love--her wounded affection
14123: with its years of anguish--her agony of unavailing pity over that
14124: deathbed seven months ago. The thought of Mr. Tryan was associated for
14125: her with repose from that conflict of emotion, with trust in the
14126: unchangeable, with the influx of a power to subdue self. To have been
14127: assured of his sympathy, his teaching, his help, all through her life,
14128: would have been to her like a heaven already begun--a deliverance from
14129: fear and danger; but the time was not yet come for her to be conscious
14130: that the hold he had on her heart was any other than that of the
14131: heaven-sent friend who had come to her like the angel in the prison, and
14132: loosed her bonds, and led her by the hand till she could look back on the
14133: dreadful doors that had once closed her in.
14134: 
14135: Before November was over Mr. Tryan had ceased to go out. A new crisis had
14136: come on: the cough had changed its character, and the worst symptoms
14137: developed themselves so rapidly that Mr. Pratt began to think the end
14138: would arrive sooner than he had expected. Janet became a constant
14139: attendant on him now, and no one could feel that she was performing
14140: anything but a sacred office. She made Holly Mount her home, and, with
14141: her mother and Mrs. Pettifer to help her, she filled the painful days and
14142: nights with every soothing influence that care and tenderness could
14143: devise. There were many visitors to the sick-room, led thither by
14144: venerating affection; and there could hardly be one who did not retain in
14145: after years a vivid remembrance of the scene there--of the pale wasted
14146: form in the easy-chair (for he sat up to the last), of the grey eyes so
14147: full even yet of inquiring kindness, as the thin, almost transparent hand
14148: was held out to give the pressure of welcome; and of the sweet woman,
14149: too, whose dark watchful eyes detected every want, and who supplied the
14150: want with a ready hand.
14151: 
14152: There were others who would have had the heart and the skill to fill this
14153: place by Mr. Tryan’s side, and who would have accepted it as an honour;
14154: but they could not help feeling that God had given it to Janet by a train
14155: of events which were too impressive not to shame all jealousies into
14156: silence.
14157: 
14158: That sad history which most of us know too well, lasted more than three
14159: months. He was too feeble and suffering for the last few weeks to see any
14160: visitors, but he still sat up through the day. The strange hallucinations
14161: of the disease which had seemed to take a more decided hold on him just
14162: at the fatal crisis, and had made him think he was perhaps getting better
14163: at the very time when death had begun to hurry on with more rapid
14164: movement, had now given way, and left him calmly conscious of the
14165: reality. One afternoon, near the end of February, Janet was moving gently
14166: about the room, in the fire-lit dusk, arranging some things that would be
14167: wanted in the night. There was no one else in the room, and his eyes
14168: followed her as she moved with the firm grace natural to her, while the
14169: bright fire every now and then lit up her face, and gave an unusual glow
14170: to its dark beauty. Even to follow her in this way with his eyes was an
14171: exertion that gave a painful tension to his face; while she looked like
14172: an image of life and strength.
14173: 
14174: ‘Janet,’ he said presently, in his faint voice--he always called her
14175: Janet now. In a moment she was close to him, bending over him. He opened
14176: his hand as he looked up at her, and she placed hers within it.
14177: 
14178: ‘Janet,’ he said again, ‘you will have a long while to live after I am
14179: gone.’
14180: 
14181: A sudden pang of fear shot through her. She thought he felt himself
14182: dying, and she sank on her knees at his feet, holding his hand, while she
14183: looked up at him, almost breathless.
14184: 
14185: ‘But you will not feel the need of me as you have done ... You have a
14186: sure trust in God ... I shall not look for you in vain at the last.’
14187: 
14188: ‘No ... no ... I shall be there ... God will not forsake me.’
14189: 
14190: She could hardly utter the words, though she was not weeping. She was
14191: waiting with trembling eagerness for anything else he might have to say.
14192: 
14193: ‘Let us kiss each other before we part.’
14194: 
14195: She lifted up her face to his, and the full life-breathing lips met the
14196: wasted dying ones in a sacred kiss of promise.
14197: 
14198: 
14199: 
14200: 
14201: Chapter 28
14202: 
14203: 
14204: It soon came--the blessed day of deliverance, the sad day of bereavement;
14205: and in the second week of March they carried him to the grave. He was
14206: buried as he had desired: there was no hearse, no mourning-coach; his
14207: coffin was borne by twelve of his humbler hearers, who relieved each
14208: other by turns. But he was followed by a long procession of mourning
14209: friends, women as well as men.
14210: 
14211: Slowly, amid deep silence, the dark stream passed along Orchard Street,
14212: where eighteen months before the Evangelical curate had been saluted with
14213: hooting and hisses. Mr. Jerome and Mr. Landor were the eldest
14214: pall-bearers; and behind the coffin, led by Mr. Tryan’s cousin, walked
14215: Janet, in quiet submissive sorrow. She could not feel that he was quite
14216: gone from her; the unseen world lay so very near her--it held all that
14217: had ever stirred the depths of anguish and joy within her.
14218: 
14219: It was a cloudy morning, and had been raining when they left Holly Mount;
14220: but as they walked, the sun broke out, and the clouds were rolling off in
14221: large masses when they entered the churchyard, and Mr. Walsh’s voice was
14222: heard saying, ‘I am the Resurrection and the Life’. The faces were not
14223: hard at this funeral; the burial-service was not a hollow form. Every
14224: heart there was filled with the memory of a man who, through a
14225: self-sacrificing life and in a painful death, had been sustained by the
14226: faith which fills that form with breath and substance.
14227: 
14228: When Janet left the grave, she did not return to Holly Mount; she went to
14229: her home in Orchard Street, where her mother was waiting to receive her.
14230: She said quite calmly, ‘Let us walk round the garden, mother.’ And they
14231: walked round in silence, with their hands clasped together, looking at
14232: the golden crocuses bright in the spring sunshine. Janet felt a deep
14233: stillness within. She thirsted for no pleasure; she craved no worldly
14234: good. She saw the years to come stretch before her like an autumn
14235: afternoon, filled with resigned memory. Life to her could never more have
14236: any eagerness; it was a solemn service of gratitude and patient effort.
14237: She walked in the presence of unseen witnesses--of the Divine love that
14238: had rescued her, of the human love that waited for its eternal repose
14239: until it had seen her endure to the end.
14240: 
14241: Janet is living still. Her black hair is grey, and her step is no longer
14242: buoyant; but the sweetness of her smile remains, the love is not gone
14243: from her eyes; and strangers sometimes ask, Who is that noble-looking
14244: elderly woman, that walks about holding a little boy by the hand? The
14245: little boy is the son of Janet’s adopted daughter, and Janet in her old
14246: age has children about her knees, and loving young arms round her neck.
14247: 
14248: There is a simple gravestone in Milby Churchyard, telling that in this
14249: spot lie the remains of Edgar Tryan, for two years officiating curate at
14250: the Paddiford Chapel-of-Ease, in this parish. It is a meagre memorial,
14251: and tells you simply that the man who lies there took upon him,
14252: faithfully or unfaithfully, the office of guide and instructor to his
14253: fellow-men.
14254: 
14255: But there is another memorial of Edgar Tryan, which bears a fuller
14256: record: it is Janet Dempster, rescued from self-despair, strengthened
14257: with divine hopes, and now looking back on years of purity and helpful
14258: labour. The man who has left such a memorial behind him, must have been
14259: one whose heart beat with true compassion, and whose lips were moved by
14260: fervent faith.
14261:

14263: THE END
