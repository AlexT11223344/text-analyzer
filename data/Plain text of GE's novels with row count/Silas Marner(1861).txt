52: In the days when the spinning-wheels hummed busily in the
53: farmhouses—and even great ladies, clothed in silk and thread-lace, had
54: their toy spinning-wheels of polished oak—there might be seen in
55: districts far away among the lanes, or deep in the bosom of the hills,
56: certain pallid undersized men, who, by the side of the brawny
57: country-folk, looked like the remnants of a disinherited race. The
58: shepherd’s dog barked fiercely when one of these alien-looking men
59: appeared on the upland, dark against the early winter sunset; for what
60: dog likes a figure bent under a heavy bag?—and these pale men rarely
61: stirred abroad without that mysterious burden. The shepherd himself,
62: though he had good reason to believe that the bag held nothing but
63: flaxen thread, or else the long rolls of strong linen spun from that
64: thread, was not quite sure that this trade of weaving, indispensable
65: though it was, could be carried on entirely without the help of the
66: Evil One. In that far-off time superstition clung easily round every
67: person or thing that was at all unwonted, or even intermittent and
68: occasional merely, like the visits of the pedlar or the knife-grinder.
69: No one knew where wandering men had their homes or their origin; and
70: how was a man to be explained unless you at least knew somebody who
71: knew his father and mother? To the peasants of old times, the world
72: outside their own direct experience was a region of vagueness and
73: mystery: to their untravelled thought a state of wandering was a
74: conception as dim as the winter life of the swallows that came back
75: with the spring; and even a settler, if he came from distant parts,
76: hardly ever ceased to be viewed with a remnant of distrust, which would
77: have prevented any surprise if a long course of inoffensive conduct on
78: his part had ended in the commission of a crime; especially if he had
79: any reputation for knowledge, or showed any skill in handicraft. All
80: cleverness, whether in the rapid use of that difficult instrument the
81: tongue, or in some other art unfamiliar to villagers, was in itself
82: suspicious: honest folk, born and bred in a visible manner, were mostly
83: not overwise or clever—at least, not beyond such a matter as knowing
84: the signs of the weather; and the process by which rapidity and
85: dexterity of any kind were acquired was so wholly hidden, that they
86: partook of the nature of conjuring. In this way it came to pass that
87: those scattered linen-weavers—emigrants from the town into the
88: country—were to the last regarded as aliens by their rustic neighbours,
89: and usually contracted the eccentric habits which belong to a state of
90: loneliness.
91: 
92: In the early years of this century, such a linen-weaver, named Silas
93: Marner, worked at his vocation in a stone cottage that stood among the
94: nutty hedgerows near the village of Raveloe, and not far from the edge
95: of a deserted stone-pit. The questionable sound of Silas’s loom, so
96: unlike the natural cheerful trotting of the winnowing-machine, or the
97: simpler rhythm of the flail, had a half-fearful fascination for the
98: Raveloe boys, who would often leave off their nutting or birds’-nesting
99: to peep in at the window of the stone cottage, counterbalancing a
100: certain awe at the mysterious action of the loom, by a pleasant sense
101: of scornful superiority, drawn from the mockery of its alternating
102: noises, along with the bent, tread-mill attitude of the weaver. But
103: sometimes it happened that Marner, pausing to adjust an irregularity in
104: his thread, became aware of the small scoundrels, and, though chary of
105: his time, he liked their intrusion so ill that he would descend from
106: his loom, and, opening the door, would fix on them a gaze that was
107: always enough to make them take to their legs in terror. For how was it
108: possible to believe that those large brown protuberant eyes in Silas
109: Marner’s pale face really saw nothing very distinctly that was not
110: close to them, and not rather that their dreadful stare could dart
111: cramp, or rickets, or a wry mouth at any boy who happened to be in the
112: rear? They had, perhaps, heard their fathers and mothers hint that
113: Silas Marner could cure folks’ rheumatism if he had a mind, and add,
114: still more darkly, that if you could only speak the devil fair enough,
115: he might save you the cost of the doctor. Such strange lingering echoes
116: of the old demon-worship might perhaps even now be caught by the
117: diligent listener among the grey-haired peasantry; for the rude mind
118: with difficulty associates the ideas of power and benignity. A shadowy
119: conception of power that by much persuasion can be induced to refrain
120: from inflicting harm, is the shape most easily taken by the sense of
121: the Invisible in the minds of men who have always been pressed close by
122: primitive wants, and to whom a life of hard toil has never been
123: illuminated by any enthusiastic religious faith. To them pain and
124: mishap present a far wider range of possibilities than gladness and
125: enjoyment: their imagination is almost barren of the images that feed
126: desire and hope, but is all overgrown by recollections that are a
127: perpetual pasture to fear. “Is there anything you can fancy that you
128: would like to eat?” I once said to an old labouring man, who was in his
129: last illness, and who had refused all the food his wife had offered
130: him. “No,” he answered, “I’ve never been used to nothing but common
131: victual, and I can’t eat that.” Experience had bred no fancies in him
132: that could raise the phantasm of appetite.
133: 
134: And Raveloe was a village where many of the old echoes lingered,
135: undrowned by new voices. Not that it was one of those barren parishes
136: lying on the outskirts of civilization—inhabited by meagre sheep and
137: thinly-scattered shepherds: on the contrary, it lay in the rich central
138: plain of what we are pleased to call Merry England, and held farms
139: which, speaking from a spiritual point of view, paid highly-desirable
140: tithes. But it was nestled in a snug well-wooded hollow, quite an
141: hour’s journey on horseback from any turnpike, where it was never
142: reached by the vibrations of the coach-horn, or of public opinion. It
143: was an important-looking village, with a fine old church and large
144: churchyard in the heart of it, and two or three large brick-and-stone
145: homesteads, with well-walled orchards and ornamental weathercocks,
146: standing close upon the road, and lifting more imposing fronts than the
147: rectory, which peeped from among the trees on the other side of the
148: churchyard:—a village which showed at once the summits of its social
149: life, and told the practised eye that there was no great park and
150: manor-house in the vicinity, but that there were several chiefs in
151: Raveloe who could farm badly quite at their ease, drawing enough money
152: from their bad farming, in those war times, to live in a rollicking
153: fashion, and keep a jolly Christmas, Whitsun, and Easter tide.
154: 
155: It was fifteen years since Silas Marner had first come to Raveloe; he
156: was then simply a pallid young man, with prominent short-sighted brown
157: eyes, whose appearance would have had nothing strange for people of
158: average culture and experience, but for the villagers near whom he had
159: come to settle it had mysterious peculiarities which corresponded with
160: the exceptional nature of his occupation, and his advent from an
161: unknown region called “North’ard”. So had his way of life:—he invited
162: no comer to step across his door-sill, and he never strolled into the
163: village to drink a pint at the Rainbow, or to gossip at the
164: wheelwright’s: he sought no man or woman, save for the purposes of his
165: calling, or in order to supply himself with necessaries; and it was
166: soon clear to the Raveloe lasses that he would never urge one of them
167: to accept him against her will—quite as if he had heard them declare
168: that they would never marry a dead man come to life again. This view of
169: Marner’s personality was not without another ground than his pale face
170: and unexampled eyes; for Jem Rodney, the mole-catcher, averred that one
171: evening as he was returning homeward, he saw Silas Marner leaning
172: against a stile with a heavy bag on his back, instead of resting the
173: bag on the stile as a man in his senses would have done; and that, on
174: coming up to him, he saw that Marner’s eyes were set like a dead man’s,
175: and he spoke to him, and shook him, and his limbs were stiff, and his
176: hands clutched the bag as if they’d been made of iron; but just as he
177: had made up his mind that the weaver was dead, he came all right again,
178: like, as you might say, in the winking of an eye, and said
179: “Good-night”, and walked off. All this Jem swore he had seen, more by
180: token that it was the very day he had been mole-catching on Squire
181: Cass’s land, down by the old saw-pit. Some said Marner must have been
182: in a “fit”, a word which seemed to explain things otherwise incredible;
183: but the argumentative Mr. Macey, clerk of the parish, shook his head,
184: and asked if anybody was ever known to go off in a fit and not fall
185: down. A fit was a stroke, wasn’t it? and it was in the nature of a
186: stroke to partly take away the use of a man’s limbs and throw him on
187: the parish, if he’d got no children to look to. No, no; it was no
188: stroke that would let a man stand on his legs, like a horse between the
189: shafts, and then walk off as soon as you can say “Gee!” But there might
190: be such a thing as a man’s soul being loose from his body, and going
191: out and in, like a bird out of its nest and back; and that was how
192: folks got over-wise, for they went to school in this shell-less state
193: to those who could teach them more than their neighbours could learn
194: with their five senses and the parson. And where did Master Marner get
195: his knowledge of herbs from—and charms too, if he liked to give them
196: away? Jem Rodney’s story was no more than what might have been expected
197: by anybody who had seen how Marner had cured Sally Oates, and made her
198: sleep like a baby, when her heart had been beating enough to burst her
199: body, for two months and more, while she had been under the doctor’s
200: care. He might cure more folks if he would; but he was worth speaking
201: fair, if it was only to keep him from doing you a mischief.
202: 
203: It was partly to this vague fear that Marner was indebted for
204: protecting him from the persecution that his singularities might have
205: drawn upon him, but still more to the fact that, the old linen-weaver
206: in the neighbouring parish of Tarley being dead, his handicraft made
207: him a highly welcome settler to the richer housewives of the district,
208: and even to the more provident cottagers, who had their little stock of
209: yarn at the year’s end. Their sense of his usefulness would have
210: counteracted any repugnance or suspicion which was not confirmed by a
211: deficiency in the quality or the tale of the cloth he wove for them.
212: And the years had rolled on without producing any change in the
213: impressions of the neighbours concerning Marner, except the change from
214: novelty to habit. At the end of fifteen years the Raveloe men said just
215: the same things about Silas Marner as at the beginning: they did not
216: say them quite so often, but they believed them much more strongly when
217: they did say them. There was only one important addition which the
218: years had brought: it was, that Master Marner had laid by a fine sight
219: of money somewhere, and that he could buy up “bigger men” than himself.
220: 
221: But while opinion concerning him had remained nearly stationary, and
222: his daily habits had presented scarcely any visible change, Marner’s
223: inward life had been a history and a metamorphosis, as that of every
224: fervid nature must be when it has fled, or been condemned, to solitude.
225: His life, before he came to Raveloe, had been filled with the movement,
226: the mental activity, and the close fellowship, which, in that day as in
227: this, marked the life of an artisan early incorporated in a narrow
228: religious sect, where the poorest layman has the chance of
229: distinguishing himself by gifts of speech, and has, at the very least,
230: the weight of a silent voter in the government of his community. Marner
231: was highly thought of in that little hidden world, known to itself as
232: the church assembling in Lantern Yard; he was believed to be a young
233: man of exemplary life and ardent faith; and a peculiar interest had
234: been centred in him ever since he had fallen, at a prayer-meeting, into
235: a mysterious rigidity and suspension of consciousness, which, lasting
236: for an hour or more, had been mistaken for death. To have sought a
237: medical explanation for this phenomenon would have been held by Silas
238: himself, as well as by his minister and fellow-members, a wilful
239: self-exclusion from the spiritual significance that might lie therein.
240: Silas was evidently a brother selected for a peculiar discipline; and
241: though the effort to interpret this discipline was discouraged by the
242: absence, on his part, of any spiritual vision during his outward
243: trance, yet it was believed by himself and others that its effect was
244: seen in an accession of light and fervour. A less truthful man than he
245: might have been tempted into the subsequent creation of a vision in the
246: form of resurgent memory; a less sane man might have believed in such a
247: creation; but Silas was both sane and honest, though, as with many
248: honest and fervent men, culture had not defined any channels for his
249: sense of mystery, and so it spread itself over the proper pathway of
250: inquiry and knowledge. He had inherited from his mother some
251: acquaintance with medicinal herbs and their preparation—a little store
252: of wisdom which she had imparted to him as a solemn bequest—but of late
253: years he had had doubts about the lawfulness of applying this
254: knowledge, believing that herbs could have no efficacy without prayer,
255: and that prayer might suffice without herbs; so that the inherited
256: delight he had in wandering in the fields in search of foxglove and
257: dandelion and coltsfoot, began to wear to him the character of a
258: temptation.
259: 
260: Among the members of his church there was one young man, a little older
261: than himself, with whom he had long lived in such close friendship that
262: it was the custom of their Lantern Yard brethren to call them David and
263: Jonathan. The real name of the friend was William Dane, and he, too,
264: was regarded as a shining instance of youthful piety, though somewhat
265: given to over-severity towards weaker brethren, and to be so dazzled by
266: his own light as to hold himself wiser than his teachers. But whatever
267: blemishes others might discern in William, to his friend’s mind he was
268: faultless; for Marner had one of those impressible self-doubting
269: natures which, at an inexperienced age, admire imperativeness and lean
270: on contradiction. The expression of trusting simplicity in Marner’s
271: face, heightened by that absence of special observation, that
272: defenceless, deer-like gaze which belongs to large prominent eyes, was
273: strongly contrasted by the self-complacent suppression of inward
274: triumph that lurked in the narrow slanting eyes and compressed lips of
275: William Dane. One of the most frequent topics of conversation between
276: the two friends was Assurance of salvation: Silas confessed that he
277: could never arrive at anything higher than hope mingled with fear, and
278: listened with longing wonder when William declared that he had
279: possessed unshaken assurance ever since, in the period of his
280: conversion, he had dreamed that he saw the words “calling and election
281: sure” standing by themselves on a white page in the open Bible. Such
282: colloquies have occupied many a pair of pale-faced weavers, whose
283: unnurtured souls have been like young winged things, fluttering
284: forsaken in the twilight.
285: 
286: It had seemed to the unsuspecting Silas that the friendship had
287: suffered no chill even from his formation of another attachment of a
288: closer kind. For some months he had been engaged to a young
289: servant-woman, waiting only for a little increase to their mutual
290: savings in order to their marriage; and it was a great delight to him
291: that Sarah did not object to William’s occasional presence in their
292: Sunday interviews. It was at this point in their history that Silas’s
293: cataleptic fit occurred during the prayer-meeting; and amidst the
294: various queries and expressions of interest addressed to him by his
295: fellow-members, William’s suggestion alone jarred with the general
296: sympathy towards a brother thus singled out for special dealings. He
297: observed that, to him, this trance looked more like a visitation of
298: Satan than a proof of divine favour, and exhorted his friend to see
299: that he hid no accursed thing within his soul. Silas, feeling bound to
300: accept rebuke and admonition as a brotherly office, felt no resentment,
301: but only pain, at his friend’s doubts concerning him; and to this was
302: soon added some anxiety at the perception that Sarah’s manner towards
303: him began to exhibit a strange fluctuation between an effort at an
304: increased manifestation of regard and involuntary signs of shrinking
305: and dislike. He asked her if she wished to break off their engagement;
306: but she denied this: their engagement was known to the church, and had
307: been recognized in the prayer-meetings; it could not be broken off
308: without strict investigation, and Sarah could render no reason that
309: would be sanctioned by the feeling of the community. At this time the
310: senior deacon was taken dangerously ill, and, being a childless
311: widower, he was tended night and day by some of the younger brethren or
312: sisters. Silas frequently took his turn in the night-watching with
313: William, the one relieving the other at two in the morning. The old
314: man, contrary to expectation, seemed to be on the way to recovery, when
315: one night Silas, sitting up by his bedside, observed that his usual
316: audible breathing had ceased. The candle was burning low, and he had to
317: lift it to see the patient’s face distinctly. Examination convinced him
318: that the deacon was dead—had been dead some time, for the limbs were
319: rigid. Silas asked himself if he had been asleep, and looked at the
320: clock: it was already four in the morning. How was it that William had
321: not come? In much anxiety he went to seek for help, and soon there were
322: several friends assembled in the house, the minister among them, while
323: Silas went away to his work, wishing he could have met William to know
324: the reason of his non-appearance. But at six o’clock, as he was
325: thinking of going to seek his friend, William came, and with him the
326: minister. They came to summon him to Lantern Yard, to meet the church
327: members there; and to his inquiry concerning the cause of the summons
328: the only reply was, “You will hear.” Nothing further was said until
329: Silas was seated in the vestry, in front of the minister, with the eyes
330: of those who to him represented God’s people fixed solemnly upon him.
331: Then the minister, taking out a pocket-knife, showed it to Silas, and
332: asked him if he knew where he had left that knife? Silas said, he did
333: not know that he had left it anywhere out of his own pocket—but he was
334: trembling at this strange interrogation. He was then exhorted not to
335: hide his sin, but to confess and repent. The knife had been found in
336: the bureau by the departed deacon’s bedside—found in the place where
337: the little bag of church money had lain, which the minister himself had
338: seen the day before. Some hand had removed that bag; and whose hand
339: could it be, if not that of the man to whom the knife belonged? For
340: some time Silas was mute with astonishment: then he said, “God will
341: clear me: I know nothing about the knife being there, or the money
342: being gone. Search me and my dwelling; you will find nothing but three
343: pound five of my own savings, which William Dane knows I have had these
344: six months.” At this William groaned, but the minister said, “The proof
345: is heavy against you, brother Marner. The money was taken in the night
346: last past, and no man was with our departed brother but you, for
347: William Dane declares to us that he was hindered by sudden sickness
348: from going to take his place as usual, and you yourself said that he
349: had not come; and, moreover, you neglected the dead body.”
350: 
351: “I must have slept,” said Silas. Then, after a pause, he added, “Or I
352: must have had another visitation like that which you have all seen me
353: under, so that the thief must have come and gone while I was not in the
354: body, but out of the body. But, I say again, search me and my dwelling,
355: for I have been nowhere else.”
356: 
357: The search was made, and it ended—in William Dane’s finding the
358: well-known bag, empty, tucked behind the chest of drawers in Silas’s
359: chamber! On this William exhorted his friend to confess, and not to
360: hide his sin any longer. Silas turned a look of keen reproach on him,
361: and said, “William, for nine years that we have gone in and out
362: together, have you ever known me tell a lie? But God will clear me.”
363: 
364: “Brother,” said William, “how do I know what you may have done in the
365: secret chambers of your heart, to give Satan an advantage over you?”
366: 
367: Silas was still looking at his friend. Suddenly a deep flush came over
368: his face, and he was about to speak impetuously, when he seemed checked
369: again by some inward shock, that sent the flush back and made him
370: tremble. But at last he spoke feebly, looking at William.
371: 
372: “I remember now—the knife wasn’t in my pocket.”
373: 
374: William said, “I know nothing of what you mean.” The other persons
375: present, however, began to inquire where Silas meant to say that the
376: knife was, but he would give no further explanation: he only said, “I
377: am sore stricken; I can say nothing. God will clear me.”
378: 
379: On their return to the vestry there was further deliberation. Any
380: resort to legal measures for ascertaining the culprit was contrary to
381: the principles of the church in Lantern Yard, according to which
382: prosecution was forbidden to Christians, even had the case held less
383: scandal to the community. But the members were bound to take other
384: measures for finding out the truth, and they resolved on praying and
385: drawing lots. This resolution can be a ground of surprise only to those
386: who are unacquainted with that obscure religious life which has gone on
387: in the alleys of our towns. Silas knelt with his brethren, relying on
388: his own innocence being certified by immediate divine interference, but
389: feeling that there was sorrow and mourning behind for him even
390: then—that his trust in man had been cruelly bruised. _The lots declared
391: that Silas Marner was guilty._ He was solemnly suspended from
392: church-membership, and called upon to render up the stolen money: only
393: on confession, as the sign of repentance, could he be received once
394: more within the folds of the church. Marner listened in silence. At
395: last, when everyone rose to depart, he went towards William Dane and
396: said, in a voice shaken by agitation—
397: 
398: “The last time I remember using my knife, was when I took it out to cut
399: a strap for you. I don’t remember putting it in my pocket again. _You_
400: stole the money, and you have woven a plot to lay the sin at my door.
401: But you may prosper, for all that: there is no just God that governs
402: the earth righteously, but a God of lies, that bears witness against
403: the innocent.”
404: 
405: There was a general shudder at this blasphemy.
406: 
407: William said meekly, “I leave our brethren to judge whether this is the
408: voice of Satan or not. I can do nothing but pray for you, Silas.”
409: 
410: Poor Marner went out with that despair in his soul—that shaken trust in
411: God and man, which is little short of madness to a loving nature. In
412: the bitterness of his wounded spirit, he said to himself, “_She_ will
413: cast me off too.” And he reflected that, if she did not believe the
414: testimony against him, her whole faith must be upset as his was. To
415: people accustomed to reason about the forms in which their religious
416: feeling has incorporated itself, it is difficult to enter into that
417: simple, untaught state of mind in which the form and the feeling have
418: never been severed by an act of reflection. We are apt to think it
419: inevitable that a man in Marner’s position should have begun to
420: question the validity of an appeal to the divine judgment by drawing
421: lots; but to him this would have been an effort of independent thought
422: such as he had never known; and he must have made the effort at a
423: moment when all his energies were turned into the anguish of
424: disappointed faith. If there is an angel who records the sorrows of men
425: as well as their sins, he knows how many and deep are the sorrows that
426: spring from false ideas for which no man is culpable.
427: 
428: Marner went home, and for a whole day sat alone, stunned by despair,
429: without any impulse to go to Sarah and attempt to win her belief in his
430: innocence. The second day he took refuge from benumbing unbelief, by
431: getting into his loom and working away as usual; and before many hours
432: were past, the minister and one of the deacons came to him with the
433: message from Sarah, that she held her engagement to him at an end.
434: Silas received the message mutely, and then turned away from the
435: messengers to work at his loom again. In little more than a month from
436: that time, Sarah was married to William Dane; and not long afterwards
437: it was known to the brethren in Lantern Yard that Silas Marner had
438: departed from the town.
439: 
440: 
441: 
442: CHAPTER II.
443: 
444: Even people whose lives have been made various by learning, sometimes
445: find it hard to keep a fast hold on their habitual views of life, on
446: their faith in the Invisible, nay, on the sense that their past joys
447: and sorrows are a real experience, when they are suddenly transported
448: to a new land, where the beings around them know nothing of their
449: history, and share none of their ideas—where their mother earth shows
450: another lap, and human life has other forms than those on which their
451: souls have been nourished. Minds that have been unhinged from their old
452: faith and love, have perhaps sought this Lethean influence of exile, in
453: which the past becomes dreamy because its symbols have all vanished,
454: and the present too is dreamy because it is linked with no memories.
455: But even _their_ experience may hardly enable them thoroughly to
456: imagine what was the effect on a simple weaver like Silas Marner, when
457: he left his own country and people and came to settle in Raveloe.
458: Nothing could be more unlike his native town, set within sight of the
459: widespread hillsides, than this low, wooded region, where he felt
460: hidden even from the heavens by the screening trees and hedgerows.
461: There was nothing here, when he rose in the deep morning quiet and
462: looked out on the dewy brambles and rank tufted grass, that seemed to
463: have any relation with that life centring in Lantern Yard, which had
464: once been to him the altar-place of high dispensations. The whitewashed
465: walls; the little pews where well-known figures entered with a subdued
466: rustling, and where first one well-known voice and then another,
467: pitched in a peculiar key of petition, uttered phrases at once occult
468: and familiar, like the amulet worn on the heart; the pulpit where the
469: minister delivered unquestioned doctrine, and swayed to and fro, and
470: handled the book in a long accustomed manner; the very pauses between
471: the couplets of the hymn, as it was given out, and the recurrent swell
472: of voices in song: these things had been the channel of divine
473: influences to Marner—they were the fostering home of his religious
474: emotions—they were Christianity and God’s kingdom upon earth. A weaver
475: who finds hard words in his hymn-book knows nothing of abstractions; as
476: the little child knows nothing of parental love, but only knows one
477: face and one lap towards which it stretches its arms for refuge and
478: nurture.
479: 
480: And what could be more unlike that Lantern Yard world than the world in
481: Raveloe?—orchards looking lazy with neglected plenty; the large church
482: in the wide churchyard, which men gazed at lounging at their own doors
483: in service-time; the purple-faced farmers jogging along the lanes or
484: turning in at the Rainbow; homesteads, where men supped heavily and
485: slept in the light of the evening hearth, and where women seemed to be
486: laying up a stock of linen for the life to come. There were no lips in
487: Raveloe from which a word could fall that would stir Silas Marner’s
488: benumbed faith to a sense of pain. In the early ages of the world, we
489: know, it was believed that each territory was inhabited and ruled by
490: its own divinities, so that a man could cross the bordering heights and
491: be out of the reach of his native gods, whose presence was confined to
492: the streams and the groves and the hills among which he had lived from
493: his birth. And poor Silas was vaguely conscious of something not unlike
494: the feeling of primitive men, when they fled thus, in fear or in
495: sullenness, from the face of an unpropitious deity. It seemed to him
496: that the Power he had vainly trusted in among the streets and at the
497: prayer-meetings, was very far away from this land in which he had taken
498: refuge, where men lived in careless abundance, knowing and needing
499: nothing of that trust, which, for him, had been turned to bitterness.
500: The little light he possessed spread its beams so narrowly, that
501: frustrated belief was a curtain broad enough to create for him the
502: blackness of night.
503: 
504: His first movement after the shock had been to work in his loom; and he
505: went on with this unremittingly, never asking himself why, now he was
506: come to Raveloe, he worked far on into the night to finish the tale of
507: Mrs. Osgood’s table-linen sooner than she expected—without
508: contemplating beforehand the money she would put into his hand for the
509: work. He seemed to weave, like the spider, from pure impulse, without
510: reflection. Every man’s work, pursued steadily, tends in this way to
511: become an end in itself, and so to bridge over the loveless chasms of
512: his life. Silas’s hand satisfied itself with throwing the shuttle, and
513: his eye with seeing the little squares in the cloth complete themselves
514: under his effort. Then there were the calls of hunger; and Silas, in
515: his solitude, had to provide his own breakfast, dinner, and supper, to
516: fetch his own water from the well, and put his own kettle on the fire;
517: and all these immediate promptings helped, along with the weaving, to
518: reduce his life to the unquestioning activity of a spinning insect. He
519: hated the thought of the past; there was nothing that called out his
520: love and fellowship toward the strangers he had come amongst; and the
521: future was all dark, for there was no Unseen Love that cared for him.
522: Thought was arrested by utter bewilderment, now its old narrow pathway
523: was closed, and affection seemed to have died under the bruise that had
524: fallen on its keenest nerves.
525: 
526: But at last Mrs. Osgood’s table-linen was finished, and Silas was paid
527: in gold. His earnings in his native town, where he worked for a
528: wholesale dealer, had been after a lower rate; he had been paid weekly,
529: and of his weekly earnings a large proportion had gone to objects of
530: piety and charity. Now, for the first time in his life, he had five
531: bright guineas put into his hand; no man expected a share of them, and
532: he loved no man that he should offer him a share. But what were the
533: guineas to him who saw no vista beyond countless days of weaving? It
534: was needless for him to ask that, for it was pleasant to him to feel
535: them in his palm, and look at their bright faces, which were all his
536: own: it was another element of life, like the weaving and the
537: satisfaction of hunger, subsisting quite aloof from the life of belief
538: and love from which he had been cut off. The weaver’s hand had known
539: the touch of hard-won money even before the palm had grown to its full
540: breadth; for twenty years, mysterious money had stood to him as the
541: symbol of earthly good, and the immediate object of toil. He had seemed
542: to love it little in the years when every penny had its purpose for
543: him; for he loved the _purpose_ then. But now, when all purpose was
544: gone, that habit of looking towards the money and grasping it with a
545: sense of fulfilled effort made a loam that was deep enough for the
546: seeds of desire; and as Silas walked homeward across the fields in the
547: twilight, he drew out the money and thought it was brighter in the
548: gathering gloom.
549: 
550: About this time an incident happened which seemed to open a possibility
551: of some fellowship with his neighbours. One day, taking a pair of shoes
552: to be mended, he saw the cobbler’s wife seated by the fire, suffering
553: from the terrible symptoms of heart-disease and dropsy, which he had
554: witnessed as the precursors of his mother’s death. He felt a rush of
555: pity at the mingled sight and remembrance, and, recalling the relief
556: his mother had found from a simple preparation of foxglove, he promised
557: Sally Oates to bring her something that would ease her, since the
558: doctor did her no good. In this office of charity, Silas felt, for the
559: first time since he had come to Raveloe, a sense of unity between his
560: past and present life, which might have been the beginning of his
561: rescue from the insect-like existence into which his nature had shrunk.
562: But Sally Oates’s disease had raised her into a personage of much
563: interest and importance among the neighbours, and the fact of her
564: having found relief from drinking Silas Marner’s “stuff” became a
565: matter of general discourse. When Doctor Kimble gave physic, it was
566: natural that it should have an effect; but when a weaver, who came from
567: nobody knew where, worked wonders with a bottle of brown waters, the
568: occult character of the process was evident. Such a sort of thing had
569: not been known since the Wise Woman at Tarley died; and she had charms
570: as well as “stuff”: everybody went to her when their children had fits.
571: Silas Marner must be a person of the same sort, for how did he know
572: what would bring back Sally Oates’s breath, if he didn’t know a fine
573: sight more than that? The Wise Woman had words that she muttered to
574: herself, so that you couldn’t hear what they were, and if she tied a
575: bit of red thread round the child’s toe the while, it would keep off
576: the water in the head. There were women in Raveloe, at that present
577: time, who had worn one of the Wise Woman’s little bags round their
578: necks, and, in consequence, had never had an idiot child, as Ann
579: Coulter had. Silas Marner could very likely do as much, and more; and
580: now it was all clear how he should have come from unknown parts, and be
581: so “comical-looking”. But Sally Oates must mind and not tell the
582: doctor, for he would be sure to set his face against Marner: he was
583: always angry about the Wise Woman, and used to threaten those who went
584: to her that they should have none of his help any more.
585: 
586: Silas now found himself and his cottage suddenly beset by mothers who
587: wanted him to charm away the whooping-cough, or bring back the milk,
588: and by men who wanted stuff against the rheumatics or the knots in the
589: hands; and, to secure themselves against a refusal, the applicants
590: brought silver in their palms. Silas might have driven a profitable
591: trade in charms as well as in his small list of drugs; but money on
592: this condition was no temptation to him: he had never known an impulse
593: towards falsity, and he drove one after another away with growing
594: irritation, for the news of him as a wise man had spread even to
595: Tarley, and it was long before people ceased to take long walks for the
596: sake of asking his aid. But the hope in his wisdom was at length
597: changed into dread, for no one believed him when he said he knew no
598: charms and could work no cures, and every man and woman who had an
599: accident or a new attack after applying to him, set the misfortune down
600: to Master Marner’s ill-will and irritated glances. Thus it came to pass
601: that his movement of pity towards Sally Oates, which had given him a
602: transient sense of brotherhood, heightened the repulsion between him
603: and his neighbours, and made his isolation more complete.
604: 
605: Gradually the guineas, the crowns, and the half-crowns grew to a heap,
606: and Marner drew less and less for his own wants, trying to solve the
607: problem of keeping himself strong enough to work sixteen hours a-day on
608: as small an outlay as possible. Have not men, shut up in solitary
609: imprisonment, found an interest in marking the moments by straight
610: strokes of a certain length on the wall, until the growth of the sum of
611: straight strokes, arranged in triangles, has become a mastering
612: purpose? Do we not wile away moments of inanity or fatigued waiting by
613: repeating some trivial movement or sound, until the repetition has bred
614: a want, which is incipient habit? That will help us to understand how
615: the love of accumulating money grows an absorbing passion in men whose
616: imaginations, even in the very beginning of their hoard, showed them no
617: purpose beyond it. Marner wanted the heaps of ten to grow into a
618: square, and then into a larger square; and every added guinea, while it
619: was itself a satisfaction, bred a new desire. In this strange world,
620: made a hopeless riddle to him, he might, if he had had a less intense
621: nature, have sat weaving, weaving—looking towards the end of his
622: pattern, or towards the end of his web, till he forgot the riddle, and
623: everything else but his immediate sensations; but the money had come to
624: mark off his weaving into periods, and the money not only grew, but it
625: remained with him. He began to think it was conscious of him, as his
626: loom was, and he would on no account have exchanged those coins, which
627: had become his familiars, for other coins with unknown faces. He
628: handled them, he counted them, till their form and colour were like the
629: satisfaction of a thirst to him; but it was only in the night, when his
630: work was done, that he drew them out to enjoy their companionship. He
631: had taken up some bricks in his floor underneath his loom, and here he
632: had made a hole in which he set the iron pot that contained his guineas
633: and silver coins, covering the bricks with sand whenever he replaced
634: them. Not that the idea of being robbed presented itself often or
635: strongly to his mind: hoarding was common in country districts in those
636: days; there were old labourers in the parish of Raveloe who were known
637: to have their savings by them, probably inside their flock-beds; but
638: their rustic neighbours, though not all of them as honest as their
639: ancestors in the days of King Alfred, had not imaginations bold enough
640: to lay a plan of burglary. How could they have spent the money in their
641: own village without betraying themselves? They would be obliged to “run
642: away”—a course as dark and dubious as a balloon journey.
643: 
644: So, year after year, Silas Marner had lived in this solitude, his
645: guineas rising in the iron pot, and his life narrowing and hardening
646: itself more and more into a mere pulsation of desire and satisfaction
647: that had no relation to any other being. His life had reduced itself to
648: the functions of weaving and hoarding, without any contemplation of an
649: end towards which the functions tended. The same sort of process has
650: perhaps been undergone by wiser men, when they have been cut off from
651: faith and love—only, instead of a loom and a heap of guineas, they have
652: had some erudite research, some ingenious project, or some well-knit
653: theory. Strangely Marner’s face and figure shrank and bent themselves
654: into a constant mechanical relation to the objects of his life, so that
655: he produced the same sort of impression as a handle or a crooked tube,
656: which has no meaning standing apart. The prominent eyes that used to
657: look trusting and dreamy, now looked as if they had been made to see
658: only one kind of thing that was very small, like tiny grain, for which
659: they hunted everywhere: and he was so withered and yellow, that, though
660: he was not yet forty, the children always called him “Old Master
661: Marner”.
662: 
663: Yet even in this stage of withering a little incident happened, which
664: showed that the sap of affection was not all gone. It was one of his
665: daily tasks to fetch his water from a well a couple of fields off, and
666: for this purpose, ever since he came to Raveloe, he had had a brown
667: earthenware pot, which he held as his most precious utensil among the
668: very few conveniences he had granted himself. It had been his companion
669: for twelve years, always standing on the same spot, always lending its
670: handle to him in the early morning, so that its form had an expression
671: for him of willing helpfulness, and the impress of its handle on his
672: palm gave a satisfaction mingled with that of having the fresh clear
673: water. One day as he was returning from the well, he stumbled against
674: the step of the stile, and his brown pot, falling with force against
675: the stones that overarched the ditch below him, was broken in three
676: pieces. Silas picked up the pieces and carried them home with grief in
677: his heart. The brown pot could never be of use to him any more, but he
678: stuck the bits together and propped the ruin in its old place for a
679: memorial.
680: 
681: This is the history of Silas Marner, until the fifteenth year after he
682: came to Raveloe. The livelong day he sat in his loom, his ear filled
683: with its monotony, his eyes bent close down on the slow growth of
684: sameness in the brownish web, his muscles moving with such even
685: repetition that their pause seemed almost as much a constraint as the
686: holding of his breath. But at night came his revelry: at night he
687: closed his shutters, and made fast his doors, and drew forth his gold.
688: Long ago the heap of coins had become too large for the iron pot to
689: hold them, and he had made for them two thick leather bags, which
690: wasted no room in their resting-place, but lent themselves flexibly to
691: every corner. How the guineas shone as they came pouring out of the
692: dark leather mouths! The silver bore no large proportion in amount to
693: the gold, because the long pieces of linen which formed his chief work
694: were always partly paid for in gold, and out of the silver he supplied
695: his own bodily wants, choosing always the shillings and sixpences to
696: spend in this way. He loved the guineas best, but he would not change
697: the silver—the crowns and half-crowns that were his own earnings,
698: begotten by his labour; he loved them all. He spread them out in heaps
699: and bathed his hands in them; then he counted them and set them up in
700: regular piles, and felt their rounded outline between his thumb and
701: fingers, and thought fondly of the guineas that were only half-earned
702: by the work in his loom, as if they had been unborn children—thought of
703: the guineas that were coming slowly through the coming years, through
704: all his life, which spread far away before him, the end quite hidden by
705: countless days of weaving. No wonder his thoughts were still with his
706: loom and his money when he made his journeys through the fields and the
707: lanes to fetch and carry home his work, so that his steps never
708: wandered to the hedge-banks and the lane-side in search of the once
709: familiar herbs: these too belonged to the past, from which his life had
710: shrunk away, like a rivulet that has sunk far down from the grassy
711: fringe of its old breadth into a little shivering thread, that cuts a
712: groove for itself in the barren sand.
713: 
714: But about the Christmas of that fifteenth year, a second great change
715: came over Marner’s life, and his history became blent in a singular
716: manner with the life of his neighbours.
717: 
718: 
719: 
720: CHAPTER III.
721: 
722: The greatest man in Raveloe was Squire Cass, who lived in the large red
723: house with the handsome flight of stone steps in front and the high
724: stables behind it, nearly opposite the church. He was only one among
725: several landed parishioners, but he alone was honoured with the title
726: of Squire; for though Mr. Osgood’s family was also understood to be of
727: timeless origin—the Raveloe imagination having never ventured back to
728: that fearful blank when there were no Osgoods—still, he merely owned
729: the farm he occupied; whereas Squire Cass had a tenant or two, who
730: complained of the game to him quite as if he had been a lord.
731: 
732: It was still that glorious war-time which was felt to be a peculiar
733: favour of Providence towards the landed interest, and the fall of
734: prices had not yet come to carry the race of small squires and yeomen
735: down that road to ruin for which extravagant habits and bad husbandry
736: were plentifully anointing their wheels. I am speaking now in relation
737: to Raveloe and the parishes that resembled it; for our old-fashioned
738: country life had many different aspects, as all life must have when it
739: is spread over a various surface, and breathed on variously by
740: multitudinous currents, from the winds of heaven to the thoughts of
741: men, which are for ever moving and crossing each other with
742: incalculable results. Raveloe lay low among the bushy trees and the
743: rutted lanes, aloof from the currents of industrial energy and Puritan
744: earnestness: the rich ate and drank freely, accepting gout and apoplexy
745: as things that ran mysteriously in respectable families, and the poor
746: thought that the rich were entirely in the right of it to lead a jolly
747: life; besides, their feasting caused a multiplication of orts, which
748: were the heirlooms of the poor. Betty Jay scented the boiling of Squire
749: Cass’s hams, but her longing was arrested by the unctuous liquor in
750: which they were boiled; and when the seasons brought round the great
751: merry-makings, they were regarded on all hands as a fine thing for the
752: poor. For the Raveloe feasts were like the rounds of beef and the
753: barrels of ale—they were on a large scale, and lasted a good while,
754: especially in the winter-time. After ladies had packed up their best
755: gowns and top-knots in bandboxes, and had incurred the risk of fording
756: streams on pillions with the precious burden in rainy or snowy weather,
757: when there was no knowing how high the water would rise, it was not to
758: be supposed that they looked forward to a brief pleasure. On this
759: ground it was always contrived in the dark seasons, when there was
760: little work to be done, and the hours were long, that several
761: neighbours should keep open house in succession. So soon as Squire
762: Cass’s standing dishes diminished in plenty and freshness, his guests
763: had nothing to do but to walk a little higher up the village to Mr.
764: Osgood’s, at the Orchards, and they found hams and chines uncut,
765: pork-pies with the scent of the fire in them, spun butter in all its
766: freshness—everything, in fact, that appetites at leisure could desire,
767: in perhaps greater perfection, though not in greater abundance, than at
768: Squire Cass’s.
769: 
770: For the Squire’s wife had died long ago, and the Red House was without
771: that presence of the wife and mother which is the fountain of wholesome
772: love and fear in parlour and kitchen; and this helped to account not
773: only for there being more profusion than finished excellence in the
774: holiday provisions, but also for the frequency with which the proud
775: Squire condescended to preside in the parlour of the Rainbow rather
776: than under the shadow of his own dark wainscot; perhaps, also, for the
777: fact that his sons had turned out rather ill. Raveloe was not a place
778: where moral censure was severe, but it was thought a weakness in the
779: Squire that he had kept all his sons at home in idleness; and though
780: some licence was to be allowed to young men whose fathers could afford
781: it, people shook their heads at the courses of the second son, Dunstan,
782: commonly called Dunsey Cass, whose taste for swopping and betting might
783: turn out to be a sowing of something worse than wild oats. To be sure,
784: the neighbours said, it was no matter what became of Dunsey—a spiteful
785: jeering fellow, who seemed to enjoy his drink the more when other
786: people went dry—always provided that his doings did not bring trouble
787: on a family like Squire Cass’s, with a monument in the church, and
788: tankards older than King George. But it would be a thousand pities if
789: Mr. Godfrey, the eldest, a fine open-faced good-natured young man who
790: was to come into the land some day, should take to going along the same
791: road with his brother, as he had seemed to do of late. If he went on in
792: that way, he would lose Miss Nancy Lammeter; for it was well known that
793: she had looked very shyly on him ever since last Whitsuntide
794: twelvemonth, when there was so much talk about his being away from home
795: days and days together. There was something wrong, more than
796: common—that was quite clear; for Mr. Godfrey didn’t look half so
797: fresh-coloured and open as he used to do. At one time everybody was
798: saying, What a handsome couple he and Miss Nancy Lammeter would make!
799: and if she could come to be mistress at the Red House, there would be a
800: fine change, for the Lammeters had been brought up in that way, that
801: they never suffered a pinch of salt to be wasted, and yet everybody in
802: their household had of the best, according to his place. Such a
803: daughter-in-law would be a saving to the old Squire, if she never
804: brought a penny to her fortune; for it was to be feared that,
805: notwithstanding his incomings, there were more holes in his pocket than
806: the one where he put his own hand in. But if Mr. Godfrey didn’t turn
807: over a new leaf, he might say “Good-bye” to Miss Nancy Lammeter.
808: 
809: It was the once hopeful Godfrey who was standing, with his hands in his
810: side-pockets and his back to the fire, in the dark wainscoted parlour,
811: one late November afternoon in that fifteenth year of Silas Marner’s
812: life at Raveloe. The fading grey light fell dimly on the walls
813: decorated with guns, whips, and foxes’ brushes, on coats and hats flung
814: on the chairs, on tankards sending forth a scent of flat ale, and on a
815: half-choked fire, with pipes propped up in the chimney-corners: signs
816: of a domestic life destitute of any hallowing charm, with which the
817: look of gloomy vexation on Godfrey’s blond face was in sad accordance.
818: He seemed to be waiting and listening for some one’s approach, and
819: presently the sound of a heavy step, with an accompanying whistle, was
820: heard across the large empty entrance-hall.
821: 
822: The door opened, and a thick-set, heavy-looking young man entered, with
823: the flushed face and the gratuitously elated bearing which mark the
824: first stage of intoxication. It was Dunsey, and at the sight of him
825: Godfrey’s face parted with some of its gloom to take on the more active
826: expression of hatred. The handsome brown spaniel that lay on the hearth
827: retreated under the chair in the chimney-corner.
828: 
829: “Well, Master Godfrey, what do you want with me?” said Dunsey, in a
830: mocking tone. “You’re my elders and betters, you know; I was obliged to
831: come when you sent for me.”
832: 
833: “Why, this is what I want—and just shake yourself sober and listen,
834: will you?” said Godfrey, savagely. He had himself been drinking more
835: than was good for him, trying to turn his gloom into uncalculating
836: anger. “I want to tell you, I must hand over that rent of Fowler’s to
837: the Squire, or else tell him I gave it you; for he’s threatening to
838: distrain for it, and it’ll all be out soon, whether I tell him or not.
839: He said, just now, before he went out, he should send word to Cox to
840: distrain, if Fowler didn’t come and pay up his arrears this week. The
841: Squire’s short o’ cash, and in no humour to stand any nonsense; and you
842: know what he threatened, if ever he found you making away with his
843: money again. So, see and get the money, and pretty quickly, will you?”
844: 
845: “Oh!” said Dunsey, sneeringly, coming nearer to his brother and looking
846: in his face. “Suppose, now, you get the money yourself, and save me the
847: trouble, eh? Since you was so kind as to hand it over to me, you’ll not
848: refuse me the kindness to pay it back for me: it was your brotherly
849: love made you do it, you know.”
850: 
851: Godfrey bit his lips and clenched his fist. “Don’t come near me with
852: that look, else I’ll knock you down.”
853: 
854: “Oh no, you won’t,” said Dunsey, turning away on his heel, however.
855: “Because I’m such a good-natured brother, you know. I might get you
856: turned out of house and home, and cut off with a shilling any day. I
857: might tell the Squire how his handsome son was married to that nice
858: young woman, Molly Farren, and was very unhappy because he couldn’t
859: live with his drunken wife, and I should slip into your place as
860: comfortable as could be. But you see, I don’t do it—I’m so easy and
861: good-natured. You’ll take any trouble for me. You’ll get the hundred
862: pounds for me—I know you will.”
863: 
864: “How can I get the money?” said Godfrey, quivering. “I haven’t a
865: shilling to bless myself with. And it’s a lie that you’d slip into my
866: place: you’d get yourself turned out too, that’s all. For if you begin
867: telling tales, I’ll follow. Bob’s my father’s favourite—you know that
868: very well. He’d only think himself well rid of you.”
869: 
870: “Never mind,” said Dunsey, nodding his head sideways as he looked out
871: of the window. “It ’ud be very pleasant to me to go in your
872: company—you’re such a handsome brother, and we’ve always been so fond
873: of quarrelling with one another, I shouldn’t know what to do without
874: you. But you’d like better for us both to stay at home together; I know
875: you would. So you’ll manage to get that little sum o’ money, and I’ll
876: bid you good-bye, though I’m sorry to part.”
877: 
878: Dunstan was moving off, but Godfrey rushed after him and seized him by
879: the arm, saying, with an oath—
880: 
881: “I tell you, I have no money: I can get no money.”
882: 
883: “Borrow of old Kimble.”
884: 
885: “I tell you, he won’t lend me any more, and I shan’t ask him.”
886: 
887: “Well, then, sell Wildfire.”
888: 
889: “Yes, that’s easy talking. I must have the money directly.”
890: 
891: “Well, you’ve only got to ride him to the hunt to-morrow. There’ll be
892: Bryce and Keating there, for sure. You’ll get more bids than one.”
893: 
894: “I daresay, and get back home at eight o’clock, splashed up to the
895: chin. I’m going to Mrs. Osgood’s birthday dance.”
896: 
897: “Oho!” said Dunsey, turning his head on one side, and trying to speak
898: in a small mincing treble. “And there’s sweet Miss Nancy coming; and we
899: shall dance with her, and promise never to be naughty again, and be
900: taken into favour, and—”
901: 
902: “Hold your tongue about Miss Nancy, you fool,” said Godfrey, turning
903: red, “else I’ll throttle you.”
904: 
905: “What for?” said Dunsey, still in an artificial tone, but taking a whip
906: from the table and beating the butt-end of it on his palm. “You’ve a
907: very good chance. I’d advise you to creep up her sleeve again: it ’ud
908: be saving time, if Molly should happen to take a drop too much laudanum
909: some day, and make a widower of you. Miss Nancy wouldn’t mind being a
910: second, if she didn’t know it. And you’ve got a good-natured brother,
911: who’ll keep your secret well, because you’ll be so very obliging to
912: him.”
913: 
914: “I’ll tell you what it is,” said Godfrey, quivering, and pale again,
915: “my patience is pretty near at an end. If you’d a little more sharpness
916: in you, you might know that you may urge a man a bit too far, and make
917: one leap as easy as another. I don’t know but what it is so now: I may
918: as well tell the Squire everything myself—I should get you off my back,
919: if I got nothing else. And, after all, he’ll know some time. She’s been
920: threatening to come herself and tell him. So, don’t flatter yourself
921: that your secrecy’s worth any price you choose to ask. You drain me of
922: money till I have got nothing to pacify _her_ with, and she’ll do as
923: she threatens some day. It’s all one. I’ll tell my father everything
924: myself, and you may go to the devil.”
925: 
926: Dunsey perceived that he had overshot his mark, and that there was a
927: point at which even the hesitating Godfrey might be driven into
928: decision. But he said, with an air of unconcern—
929: 
930: “As you please; but I’ll have a draught of ale first.” And ringing the
931: bell, he threw himself across two chairs, and began to rap the
932: window-seat with the handle of his whip.
933: 
934: Godfrey stood, still with his back to the fire, uneasily moving his
935: fingers among the contents of his side-pockets, and looking at the
936: floor. That big muscular frame of his held plenty of animal courage,
937: but helped him to no decision when the dangers to be braved were such
938: as could neither be knocked down nor throttled. His natural
939: irresolution and moral cowardice were exaggerated by a position in
940: which dreaded consequences seemed to press equally on all sides, and
941: his irritation had no sooner provoked him to defy Dunstan and
942: anticipate all possible betrayals, than the miseries he must bring on
943: himself by such a step seemed more unendurable to him than the present
944: evil. The results of confession were not contingent, they were certain;
945: whereas betrayal was not certain. From the near vision of that
946: certainty he fell back on suspense and vacillation with a sense of
947: repose. The disinherited son of a small squire, equally disinclined to
948: dig and to beg, was almost as helpless as an uprooted tree, which, by
949: the favour of earth and sky, has grown to a handsome bulk on the spot
950: where it first shot upward. Perhaps it would have been possible to
951: think of digging with some cheerfulness if Nancy Lammeter were to be
952: won on those terms; but, since he must irrevocably lose _her_ as well
953: as the inheritance, and must break every tie but the one that degraded
954: him and left him without motive for trying to recover his better self,
955: he could imagine no future for himself on the other side of confession
956: but that of “’listing for a soldier”—the most desperate step, short of
957: suicide, in the eyes of respectable families. No! he would rather trust
958: to casualties than to his own resolve—rather go on sitting at the
959: feast, and sipping the wine he loved, though with the sword hanging
960: over him and terror in his heart, than rush away into the cold darkness
961: where there was no pleasure left. The utmost concession to Dunstan
962: about the horse began to seem easy, compared with the fulfilment of his
963: own threat. But his pride would not let him recommence the conversation
964: otherwise than by continuing the quarrel. Dunstan was waiting for this,
965: and took his ale in shorter draughts than usual.
966: 
967: “It’s just like you,” Godfrey burst out, in a bitter tone, “to talk
968: about my selling Wildfire in that cool way—the last thing I’ve got to
969: call my own, and the best bit of horse-flesh I ever had in my life. And
970: if you’d got a spark of pride in you, you’d be ashamed to see the
971: stables emptied, and everybody sneering about it. But it’s my belief
972: you’d sell yourself, if it was only for the pleasure of making somebody
973: feel he’d got a bad bargain.”
974: 
975: “Aye, aye,” said Dunstan, very placably, “you do me justice, I see. You
976: know I’m a jewel for ’ticing people into bargains. For which reason I
977: advise you to let _me_ sell Wildfire. I’d ride him to the hunt
978: to-morrow for you, with pleasure. I shouldn’t look so handsome as you
979: in the saddle, but it’s the horse they’ll bid for, and not the rider.”
980: 
981: “Yes, I daresay—trust my horse to you!”
982: 
983: “As you please,” said Dunstan, rapping the window-seat again with an
984: air of great unconcern. “It’s _you_ have got to pay Fowler’s money;
985: it’s none of my business. You received the money from him when you went
986: to Bramcote, and _you_ told the Squire it wasn’t paid. I’d nothing to
987: do with that; you chose to be so obliging as to give it me, that was
988: all. If you don’t want to pay the money, let it alone; it’s all one to
989: me. But I was willing to accommodate you by undertaking to sell the
990: horse, seeing it’s not convenient to you to go so far to-morrow.”
991: 
992: Godfrey was silent for some moments. He would have liked to spring on
993: Dunstan, wrench the whip from his hand, and flog him to within an inch
994: of his life; and no bodily fear could have deterred him; but he was
995: mastered by another sort of fear, which was fed by feelings stronger
996: even than his resentment. When he spoke again, it was in a
997: half-conciliatory tone.
998: 
999: “Well, you mean no nonsense about the horse, eh? You’ll sell him all
1000: fair, and hand over the money? If you don’t, you know, everything ’ull
1001: go to smash, for I’ve got nothing else to trust to. And you’ll have
1002: less pleasure in pulling the house over my head, when your own skull’s
1003: to be broken too.”
1004: 
1005: “Aye, aye,” said Dunstan, rising; “all right. I thought you’d come
1006: round. I’m the fellow to bring old Bryce up to the scratch. I’ll get
1007: you a hundred and twenty for him, if I get you a penny.”
1008: 
1009: “But it’ll perhaps rain cats and dogs to-morrow, as it did yesterday,
1010: and then you can’t go,” said Godfrey, hardly knowing whether he wished
1011: for that obstacle or not.
1012: 
1013: “Not _it_,” said Dunstan. “I’m always lucky in my weather. It might
1014: rain if you wanted to go yourself. You never hold trumps, you know—I
1015: always do. You’ve got the beauty, you see, and I’ve got the luck, so
1016: you must keep me by you for your crooked sixpence; you’ll _ne_-ver get
1017: along without me.”
1018: 
1019: “Confound you, hold your tongue!” said Godfrey, impetuously. “And take
1020: care to keep sober to-morrow, else you’ll get pitched on your head
1021: coming home, and Wildfire might be the worse for it.”
1022: 
1023: “Make your tender heart easy,” said Dunstan, opening the door. “You
1024: never knew me see double when I’d got a bargain to make; it ’ud spoil
1025: the fun. Besides, whenever I fall, I’m warranted to fall on my legs.”
1026: 
1027: With that, Dunstan slammed the door behind him, and left Godfrey to
1028: that bitter rumination on his personal circumstances which was now
1029: unbroken from day to day save by the excitement of sporting, drinking,
1030: card-playing, or the rarer and less oblivious pleasure of seeing Miss
1031: Nancy Lammeter. The subtle and varied pains springing from the higher
1032: sensibility that accompanies higher culture, are perhaps less pitiable
1033: than that dreary absence of impersonal enjoyment and consolation which
1034: leaves ruder minds to the perpetual urgent companionship of their own
1035: griefs and discontents. The lives of those rural forefathers, whom we
1036: are apt to think very prosaic figures—men whose only work was to ride
1037: round their land, getting heavier and heavier in their saddles, and who
1038: passed the rest of their days in the half-listless gratification of
1039: senses dulled by monotony—had a certain pathos in them nevertheless.
1040: Calamities came to _them_ too, and their early errors carried hard
1041: consequences: perhaps the love of some sweet maiden, the image of
1042: purity, order, and calm, had opened their eyes to the vision of a life
1043: in which the days would not seem too long, even without rioting; but
1044: the maiden was lost, and the vision passed away, and then what was left
1045: to them, especially when they had become too heavy for the hunt, or for
1046: carrying a gun over the furrows, but to drink and get merry, or to
1047: drink and get angry, so that they might be independent of variety, and
1048: say over again with eager emphasis the things they had said already any
1049: time that twelvemonth? Assuredly, among these flushed and dull-eyed men
1050: there were some whom—thanks to their native human-kindness—even riot
1051: could never drive into brutality; men who, when their cheeks were
1052: fresh, had felt the keen point of sorrow or remorse, had been pierced
1053: by the reeds they leaned on, or had lightly put their limbs in fetters
1054: from which no struggle could loose them; and under these sad
1055: circumstances, common to us all, their thoughts could find no
1056: resting-place outside the ever-trodden round of their own petty
1057: history.
1058: 
1059: That, at least, was the condition of Godfrey Cass in this
1060: six-and-twentieth year of his life. A movement of compunction, helped
1061: by those small indefinable influences which every personal relation
1062: exerts on a pliant nature, had urged him into a secret marriage, which
1063: was a blight on his life. It was an ugly story of low passion,
1064: delusion, and waking from delusion, which needs not to be dragged from
1065: the privacy of Godfrey’s bitter memory. He had long known that the
1066: delusion was partly due to a trap laid for him by Dunstan, who saw in
1067: his brother’s degrading marriage the means of gratifying at once his
1068: jealous hate and his cupidity. And if Godfrey could have felt himself
1069: simply a victim, the iron bit that destiny had put into his mouth would
1070: have chafed him less intolerably. If the curses he muttered half aloud
1071: when he was alone had had no other object than Dunstan’s diabolical
1072: cunning, he might have shrunk less from the consequences of avowal. But
1073: he had something else to curse—his own vicious folly, which now seemed
1074: as mad and unaccountable to him as almost all our follies and vices do
1075: when their promptings have long passed away. For four years he had
1076: thought of Nancy Lammeter, and wooed her with tacit patient worship, as
1077: the woman who made him think of the future with joy: she would be his
1078: wife, and would make home lovely to him, as his father’s home had never
1079: been; and it would be easy, when she was always near, to shake off
1080: those foolish habits that were no pleasures, but only a feverish way of
1081: annulling vacancy. Godfrey’s was an essentially domestic nature, bred
1082: up in a home where the hearth had no smiles, and where the daily habits
1083: were not chastised by the presence of household order. His easy
1084: disposition made him fall in unresistingly with the family courses, but
1085: the need of some tender permanent affection, the longing for some
1086: influence that would make the good he preferred easy to pursue, caused
1087: the neatness, purity, and liberal orderliness of the Lammeter
1088: household, sunned by the smile of Nancy, to seem like those fresh
1089: bright hours of the morning when temptations go to sleep and leave the
1090: ear open to the voice of the good angel, inviting to industry,
1091: sobriety, and peace. And yet the hope of this paradise had not been
1092: enough to save him from a course which shut him out of it for ever.
1093: Instead of keeping fast hold of the strong silken rope by which Nancy
1094: would have drawn him safe to the green banks where it was easy to step
1095: firmly, he had let himself be dragged back into mud and slime, in which
1096: it was useless to struggle. He had made ties for himself which robbed
1097: him of all wholesome motive, and were a constant exasperation.
1098: 
1099: Still, there was one position worse than the present: it was the
1100: position he would be in when the ugly secret was disclosed; and the
1101: desire that continually triumphed over every other was that of warding
1102: off the evil day, when he would have to bear the consequences of his
1103: father’s violent resentment for the wound inflicted on his family
1104: pride—would have, perhaps, to turn his back on that hereditary ease and
1105: dignity which, after all, was a sort of reason for living, and would
1106: carry with him the certainty that he was banished for ever from the
1107: sight and esteem of Nancy Lammeter. The longer the interval, the more
1108: chance there was of deliverance from some, at least, of the hateful
1109: consequences to which he had sold himself; the more opportunities
1110: remained for him to snatch the strange gratification of seeing Nancy,
1111: and gathering some faint indications of her lingering regard. Towards
1112: this gratification he was impelled, fitfully, every now and then, after
1113: having passed weeks in which he had avoided her as the far-off
1114: bright-winged prize that only made him spring forward and find his
1115: chain all the more galling. One of those fits of yearning was on him
1116: now, and it would have been strong enough to have persuaded him to
1117: trust Wildfire to Dunstan rather than disappoint the yearning, even if
1118: he had not had another reason for his disinclination towards the
1119: morrow’s hunt. That other reason was the fact that the morning’s meet
1120: was near Batherley, the market-town where the unhappy woman lived,
1121: whose image became more odious to him every day; and to his thought the
1122: whole vicinage was haunted by her. The yoke a man creates for himself
1123: by wrong-doing will breed hate in the kindliest nature; and the
1124: good-humoured, affectionate-hearted Godfrey Cass was fast becoming a
1125: bitter man, visited by cruel wishes, that seemed to enter, and depart,
1126: and enter again, like demons who had found in him a ready-garnished
1127: home.
1128: 
1129: What was he to do this evening to pass the time? He might as well go to
1130: the Rainbow, and hear the talk about the cock-fighting: everybody was
1131: there, and what else was there to be done? Though, for his own part, he
1132: did not care a button for cock-fighting. Snuff, the brown spaniel, who
1133: had placed herself in front of him, and had been watching him for some
1134: time, now jumped up in impatience for the expected caress. But Godfrey
1135: thrust her away without looking at her, and left the room, followed
1136: humbly by the unresenting Snuff—perhaps because she saw no other career
1137: open to her.
1138: 
1139: 
1140: 
1141: CHAPTER IV.
1142: 
1143: Dunstan Cass, setting off in the raw morning, at the judiciously quiet
1144: pace of a man who is obliged to ride to cover on his hunter, had to
1145: take his way along the lane which, at its farther extremity, passed by
1146: the piece of unenclosed ground called the Stone-pit, where stood the
1147: cottage, once a stone-cutter’s shed, now for fifteen years inhabited by
1148: Silas Marner. The spot looked very dreary at this season, with the
1149: moist trodden clay about it, and the red, muddy water high up in the
1150: deserted quarry. That was Dunstan’s first thought as he approached it;
1151: the second was, that the old fool of a weaver, whose loom he heard
1152: rattling already, had a great deal of money hidden somewhere. How was
1153: it that he, Dunstan Cass, who had often heard talk of Marner’s
1154: miserliness, had never thought of suggesting to Godfrey that he should
1155: frighten or persuade the old fellow into lending the money on the
1156: excellent security of the young Squire’s prospects? The resource
1157: occurred to him now as so easy and agreeable, especially as Marner’s
1158: hoard was likely to be large enough to leave Godfrey a handsome surplus
1159: beyond his immediate needs, and enable him to accommodate his faithful
1160: brother, that he had almost turned the horse’s head towards home again.
1161: Godfrey would be ready enough to accept the suggestion: he would snatch
1162: eagerly at a plan that might save him from parting with Wildfire. But
1163: when Dunstan’s meditation reached this point, the inclination to go on
1164: grew strong and prevailed. He didn’t want to give Godfrey that
1165: pleasure: he preferred that Master Godfrey should be vexed. Moreover,
1166: Dunstan enjoyed the self-important consciousness of having a horse to
1167: sell, and the opportunity of driving a bargain, swaggering, and
1168: possibly taking somebody in. He might have all the satisfaction
1169: attendant on selling his brother’s horse, and not the less have the
1170: further satisfaction of setting Godfrey to borrow Marner’s money. So he
1171: rode on to cover.
1172: 
1173: Bryce and Keating were there, as Dunstan was quite sure they would
1174: be—he was such a lucky fellow.
1175: 
1176: “Heyday!” said Bryce, who had long had his eye on Wildfire, “you’re on
1177: your brother’s horse to-day: how’s that?”
1178: 
1179: “Oh, I’ve swopped with him,” said Dunstan, whose delight in lying,
1180: grandly independent of utility, was not to be diminished by the
1181: likelihood that his hearer would not believe him—“Wildfire’s mine now.”
1182: 
1183: “What! has he swopped with you for that big-boned hack of yours?” said
1184: Bryce, quite aware that he should get another lie in answer.
1185: 
1186: “Oh, there was a little account between us,” said Dunsey, carelessly,
1187: “and Wildfire made it even. I accommodated him by taking the horse,
1188: though it was against my will, for I’d got an itch for a mare o’
1189: Jortin’s—as rare a bit o’ blood as ever you threw your leg across. But
1190: I shall keep Wildfire, now I’ve got him, though I’d a bid of a hundred
1191: and fifty for him the other day, from a man over at Flitton—he’s buying
1192: for Lord Cromleck—a fellow with a cast in his eye, and a green
1193: waistcoat. But I mean to stick to Wildfire: I shan’t get a better at a
1194: fence in a hurry. The mare’s got more blood, but she’s a bit too weak
1195: in the hind-quarters.”
1196: 
1197: Bryce of course divined that Dunstan wanted to sell the horse, and
1198: Dunstan knew that he divined it (horse-dealing is only one of many
1199: human transactions carried on in this ingenious manner); and they both
1200: considered that the bargain was in its first stage, when Bryce replied
1201: ironically—
1202: 
1203: “I wonder at that now; I wonder you mean to keep him; for I never heard
1204: of a man who didn’t want to sell his horse getting a bid of half as
1205: much again as the horse was worth. You’ll be lucky if you get a
1206: hundred.”
1207: 
1208: Keating rode up now, and the transaction became more complicated. It
1209: ended in the purchase of the horse by Bryce for a hundred and twenty,
1210: to be paid on the delivery of Wildfire, safe and sound, at the
1211: Batherley stables. It did occur to Dunsey that it might be wise for him
1212: to give up the day’s hunting, proceed at once to Batherley, and, having
1213: waited for Bryce’s return, hire a horse to carry him home with the
1214: money in his pocket. But the inclination for a run, encouraged by
1215: confidence in his luck, and by a draught of brandy from his
1216: pocket-pistol at the conclusion of the bargain, was not easy to
1217: overcome, especially with a horse under him that would take the fences
1218: to the admiration of the field. Dunstan, however, took one fence too
1219: many, and got his horse pierced with a hedge-stake. His own
1220: ill-favoured person, which was quite unmarketable, escaped without
1221: injury; but poor Wildfire, unconscious of his price, turned on his
1222: flank and painfully panted his last. It happened that Dunstan, a short
1223: time before, having had to get down to arrange his stirrup, had
1224: muttered a good many curses at this interruption, which had thrown him
1225: in the rear of the hunt near the moment of glory, and under this
1226: exasperation had taken the fences more blindly. He would soon have been
1227: up with the hounds again, when the fatal accident happened; and hence
1228: he was between eager riders in advance, not troubling themselves about
1229: what happened behind them, and far-off stragglers, who were as likely
1230: as not to pass quite aloof from the line of road in which Wildfire had
1231: fallen. Dunstan, whose nature it was to care more for immediate
1232: annoyances than for remote consequences, no sooner recovered his legs,
1233: and saw that it was all over with Wildfire, than he felt a satisfaction
1234: at the absence of witnesses to a position which no swaggering could
1235: make enviable. Reinforcing himself, after his shake, with a little
1236: brandy and much swearing, he walked as fast as he could to a coppice on
1237: his right hand, through which it occurred to him that he could make his
1238: way to Batherley without danger of encountering any member of the hunt.
1239: His first intention was to hire a horse there and ride home forthwith,
1240: for to walk many miles without a gun in his hand, and along an ordinary
1241: road, was as much out of the question to him as to other spirited young
1242: men of his kind. He did not much mind about taking the bad news to
1243: Godfrey, for he had to offer him at the same time the resource of
1244: Marner’s money; and if Godfrey kicked, as he always did, at the notion
1245: of making a fresh debt from which he himself got the smallest share of
1246: advantage, why, he wouldn’t kick long: Dunstan felt sure he could worry
1247: Godfrey into anything. The idea of Marner’s money kept growing in
1248: vividness, now the want of it had become immediate; the prospect of
1249: having to make his appearance with the muddy boots of a pedestrian at
1250: Batherley, and to encounter the grinning queries of stablemen, stood
1251: unpleasantly in the way of his impatience to be back at Raveloe and
1252: carry out his felicitous plan; and a casual visitation of his
1253: waistcoat-pocket, as he was ruminating, awakened his memory to the fact
1254: that the two or three small coins his forefinger encountered there were
1255: of too pale a colour to cover that small debt, without payment of which
1256: the stable-keeper had declared he would never do any more business with
1257: Dunsey Cass. After all, according to the direction in which the run had
1258: brought him, he was not so very much farther from home than he was from
1259: Batherley; but Dunsey, not being remarkable for clearness of head, was
1260: only led to this conclusion by the gradual perception that there were
1261: other reasons for choosing the unprecedented course of walking home. It
1262: was now nearly four o’clock, and a mist was gathering: the sooner he
1263: got into the road the better. He remembered having crossed the road and
1264: seen the finger-post only a little while before Wildfire broke down;
1265: so, buttoning his coat, twisting the lash of his hunting-whip compactly
1266: round the handle, and rapping the tops of his boots with a
1267: self-possessed air, as if to assure himself that he was not at all
1268: taken by surprise, he set off with the sense that he was undertaking a
1269: remarkable feat of bodily exertion, which somehow and at some time he
1270: should be able to dress up and magnify to the admiration of a select
1271: circle at the Rainbow. When a young gentleman like Dunsey is reduced to
1272: so exceptional a mode of locomotion as walking, a whip in his hand is a
1273: desirable corrective to a too bewildering dreamy sense of unwontedness
1274: in his position; and Dunstan, as he went along through the gathering
1275: mist, was always rapping his whip somewhere. It was Godfrey’s whip,
1276: which he had chosen to take without leave because it had a gold handle;
1277: of course no one could see, when Dunstan held it, that the name
1278: _Godfrey Cass_ was cut in deep letters on that gold handle—they could
1279: only see that it was a very handsome whip. Dunsey was not without fear
1280: that he might meet some acquaintance in whose eyes he would cut a
1281: pitiable figure, for mist is no screen when people get close to each
1282: other; but when he at last found himself in the well-known Raveloe
1283: lanes without having met a soul, he silently remarked that that was
1284: part of his usual good luck. But now the mist, helped by the evening
1285: darkness, was more of a screen than he desired, for it hid the ruts
1286: into which his feet were liable to slip—hid everything, so that he had
1287: to guide his steps by dragging his whip along the low bushes in advance
1288: of the hedgerow. He must soon, he thought, be getting near the opening
1289: at the Stone-pits: he should find it out by the break in the hedgerow.
1290: He found it out, however, by another circumstance which he had not
1291: expected—namely, by certain gleams of light, which he presently guessed
1292: to proceed from Silas Marner’s cottage. That cottage and the money
1293: hidden within it had been in his mind continually during his walk, and
1294: he had been imagining ways of cajoling and tempting the weaver to part
1295: with the immediate possession of his money for the sake of receiving
1296: interest. Dunstan felt as if there must be a little frightening added
1297: to the cajolery, for his own arithmetical convictions were not clear
1298: enough to afford him any forcible demonstration as to the advantages of
1299: interest; and as for security, he regarded it vaguely as a means of
1300: cheating a man by making him believe that he would be paid. Altogether,
1301: the operation on the miser’s mind was a task that Godfrey would be sure
1302: to hand over to his more daring and cunning brother: Dunstan had made
1303: up his mind to that; and by the time he saw the light gleaming through
1304: the chinks of Marner’s shutters, the idea of a dialogue with the weaver
1305: had become so familiar to him, that it occurred to him as quite a
1306: natural thing to make the acquaintance forthwith. There might be
1307: several conveniences attending this course: the weaver had possibly got
1308: a lantern, and Dunstan was tired of feeling his way. He was still
1309: nearly three-quarters of a mile from home, and the lane was becoming
1310: unpleasantly slippery, for the mist was passing into rain. He turned up
1311: the bank, not without some fear lest he might miss the right way, since
1312: he was not certain whether the light were in front or on the side of
1313: the cottage. But he felt the ground before him cautiously with his
1314: whip-handle, and at last arrived safely at the door. He knocked loudly,
1315: rather enjoying the idea that the old fellow would be frightened at the
1316: sudden noise. He heard no movement in reply: all was silence in the
1317: cottage. Was the weaver gone to bed, then? If so, why had he left a
1318: light? That was a strange forgetfulness in a miser. Dunstan knocked
1319: still more loudly, and, without pausing for a reply, pushed his fingers
1320: through the latch-hole, intending to shake the door and pull the
1321: latch-string up and down, not doubting that the door was fastened. But,
1322: to his surprise, at this double motion the door opened, and he found
1323: himself in front of a bright fire which lit up every corner of the
1324: cottage—the bed, the loom, the three chairs, and the table—and showed
1325: him that Marner was not there.
1326: 
1327: Nothing at that moment could be much more inviting to Dunsey than the
1328: bright fire on the brick hearth: he walked in and seated himself by it
1329: at once. There was something in front of the fire, too, that would have
1330: been inviting to a hungry man, if it had been in a different stage of
1331: cooking. It was a small bit of pork suspended from the kettle-hanger by
1332: a string passed through a large door-key, in a way known to primitive
1333: housekeepers unpossessed of jacks. But the pork had been hung at the
1334: farthest extremity of the hanger, apparently to prevent the roasting
1335: from proceeding too rapidly during the owner’s absence. The old staring
1336: simpleton had hot meat for his supper, then? thought Dunstan. People
1337: had always said he lived on mouldy bread, on purpose to check his
1338: appetite. But where could he be at this time, and on such an evening,
1339: leaving his supper in this stage of preparation, and his door
1340: unfastened? Dunstan’s own recent difficulty in making his way suggested
1341: to him that the weaver had perhaps gone outside his cottage to fetch in
1342: fuel, or for some such brief purpose, and had slipped into the
1343: Stone-pit. That was an interesting idea to Dunstan, carrying
1344: consequences of entire novelty. If the weaver was dead, who had a right
1345: to his money? Who would know where his money was hidden? _Who would
1346: know that anybody had come to take it away?_ He went no farther into
1347: the subtleties of evidence: the pressing question, “Where _is_ the
1348: money?” now took such entire possession of him as to make him quite
1349: forget that the weaver’s death was not a certainty. A dull mind, once
1350: arriving at an inference that flatters a desire, is rarely able to
1351: retain the impression that the notion from which the inference started
1352: was purely problematic. And Dunstan’s mind was as dull as the mind of a
1353: possible felon usually is. There were only three hiding-places where he
1354: had ever heard of cottagers’ hoards being found: the thatch, the bed,
1355: and a hole in the floor. Marner’s cottage had no thatch; and Dunstan’s
1356: first act, after a train of thought made rapid by the stimulus of
1357: cupidity, was to go up to the bed; but while he did so, his eyes
1358: travelled eagerly over the floor, where the bricks, distinct in the
1359: fire-light, were discernible under the sprinkling of sand. But not
1360: everywhere; for there was one spot, and one only, which was quite
1361: covered with sand, and sand showing the marks of fingers, which had
1362: apparently been careful to spread it over a given space. It was near
1363: the treddles of the loom. In an instant Dunstan darted to that spot,
1364: swept away the sand with his whip, and, inserting the thin end of the
1365: hook between the bricks, found that they were loose. In haste he lifted
1366: up two bricks, and saw what he had no doubt was the object of his
1367: search; for what could there be but money in those two leathern bags?
1368: And, from their weight, they must be filled with guineas. Dunstan felt
1369: round the hole, to be certain that it held no more; then hastily
1370: replaced the bricks, and spread the sand over them. Hardly more than
1371: five minutes had passed since he entered the cottage, but it seemed to
1372: Dunstan like a long while; and though he was without any distinct
1373: recognition of the possibility that Marner might be alive, and might
1374: re-enter the cottage at any moment, he felt an undefinable dread laying
1375: hold on him, as he rose to his feet with the bags in his hand. He would
1376: hasten out into the darkness, and then consider what he should do with
1377: the bags. He closed the door behind him immediately, that he might shut
1378: in the stream of light: a few steps would be enough to carry him beyond
1379: betrayal by the gleams from the shutter-chinks and the latch-hole. The
1380: rain and darkness had got thicker, and he was glad of it; though it was
1381: awkward walking with both hands filled, so that it was as much as he
1382: could do to grasp his whip along with one of the bags. But when he had
1383: gone a yard or two, he might take his time. So he stepped forward into
1384: the darkness.
1385: 
1386: 
1387: 
1388: CHAPTER V.
1389: 
1390: When Dunstan Cass turned his back on the cottage, Silas Marner was not
1391: more than a hundred yards away from it, plodding along from the village
1392: with a sack thrown round his shoulders as an overcoat, and with a horn
1393: lantern in his hand. His legs were weary, but his mind was at ease,
1394: free from the presentiment of change. The sense of security more
1395: frequently springs from habit than from conviction, and for this reason
1396: it often subsists after such a change in the conditions as might have
1397: been expected to suggest alarm. The lapse of time during which a given
1398: event has not happened, is, in this logic of habit, constantly alleged
1399: as a reason why the event should never happen, even when the lapse of
1400: time is precisely the added condition which makes the event imminent. A
1401: man will tell you that he has worked in a mine for forty years unhurt
1402: by an accident as a reason why he should apprehend no danger, though
1403: the roof is beginning to sink; and it is often observable, that the
1404: older a man gets, the more difficult it is to him to retain a believing
1405: conception of his own death. This influence of habit was necessarily
1406: strong in a man whose life was so monotonous as Marner’s—who saw no new
1407: people and heard of no new events to keep alive in him the idea of the
1408: unexpected and the changeful; and it explains simply enough, why his
1409: mind could be at ease, though he had left his house and his treasure
1410: more defenceless than usual. Silas was thinking with double complacency
1411: of his supper: first, because it would be hot and savoury; and
1412: secondly, because it would cost him nothing. For the little bit of pork
1413: was a present from that excellent housewife, Miss Priscilla Lammeter,
1414: to whom he had this day carried home a handsome piece of linen; and it
1415: was only on occasion of a present like this, that Silas indulged
1416: himself with roast-meat. Supper was his favourite meal, because it came
1417: at his time of revelry, when his heart warmed over his gold; whenever
1418: he had roast-meat, he always chose to have it for supper. But this
1419: evening, he had no sooner ingeniously knotted his string fast round his
1420: bit of pork, twisted the string according to rule over his door-key,
1421: passed it through the handle, and made it fast on the hanger, than he
1422: remembered that a piece of very fine twine was indispensable to his
1423: “setting up” a new piece of work in his loom early in the morning. It
1424: had slipped his memory, because, in coming from Mr. Lammeter’s, he had
1425: not had to pass through the village; but to lose time by going on
1426: errands in the morning was out of the question. It was a nasty fog to
1427: turn out into, but there were things Silas loved better than his own
1428: comfort; so, drawing his pork to the extremity of the hanger, and
1429: arming himself with his lantern and his old sack, he set out on what,
1430: in ordinary weather, would have been a twenty minutes’ errand. He could
1431: not have locked his door without undoing his well-knotted string and
1432: retarding his supper; it was not worth his while to make that
1433: sacrifice. What thief would find his way to the Stone-pits on such a
1434: night as this? and why should he come on this particular night, when he
1435: had never come through all the fifteen years before? These questions
1436: were not distinctly present in Silas’s mind; they merely serve to
1437: represent the vaguely-felt foundation of his freedom from anxiety.
1438: 
1439: He reached his door in much satisfaction that his errand was done: he
1440: opened it, and to his short-sighted eyes everything remained as he had
1441: left it, except that the fire sent out a welcome increase of heat. He
1442: trod about the floor while putting by his lantern and throwing aside
1443: his hat and sack, so as to merge the marks of Dunstan’s feet on the
1444: sand in the marks of his own nailed boots. Then he moved his pork
1445: nearer to the fire, and sat down to the agreeable business of tending
1446: the meat and warming himself at the same time.
1447: 
1448: Any one who had looked at him as the red light shone upon his pale
1449: face, strange straining eyes, and meagre form, would perhaps have
1450: understood the mixture of contemptuous pity, dread, and suspicion with
1451: which he was regarded by his neighbours in Raveloe. Yet few men could
1452: be more harmless than poor Marner. In his truthful simple soul, not
1453: even the growing greed and worship of gold could beget any vice
1454: directly injurious to others. The light of his faith quite put out, and
1455: his affections made desolate, he had clung with all the force of his
1456: nature to his work and his money; and like all objects to which a man
1457: devotes himself, they had fashioned him into correspondence with
1458: themselves. His loom, as he wrought in it without ceasing, had in its
1459: turn wrought on him, and confirmed more and more the monotonous craving
1460: for its monotonous response. His gold, as he hung over it and saw it
1461: grow, gathered his power of loving together into a hard isolation like
1462: its own.
1463: 
1464: As soon as he was warm he began to think it would be a long while to
1465: wait till after supper before he drew out his guineas, and it would be
1466: pleasant to see them on the table before him as he ate his unwonted
1467: feast. For joy is the best of wine, and Silas’s guineas were a golden
1468: wine of that sort.
1469: 
1470: He rose and placed his candle unsuspectingly on the floor near his
1471: loom, swept away the sand without noticing any change, and removed the
1472: bricks. The sight of the empty hole made his heart leap violently, but
1473: the belief that his gold was gone could not come at once—only terror,
1474: and the eager effort to put an end to the terror. He passed his
1475: trembling hand all about the hole, trying to think it possible that his
1476: eyes had deceived him; then he held the candle in the hole and examined
1477: it curiously, trembling more and more. At last he shook so violently
1478: that he let fall the candle, and lifted his hands to his head, trying
1479: to steady himself, that he might think. Had he put his gold somewhere
1480: else, by a sudden resolution last night, and then forgotten it? A man
1481: falling into dark waters seeks a momentary footing even on sliding
1482: stones; and Silas, by acting as if he believed in false hopes, warded
1483: off the moment of despair. He searched in every corner, he turned his
1484: bed over, and shook it, and kneaded it; he looked in his brick oven
1485: where he laid his sticks. When there was no other place to be searched,
1486: he kneeled down again and felt once more all round the hole. There was
1487: no untried refuge left for a moment’s shelter from the terrible truth.
1488: 
1489: Yes, there was a sort of refuge which always comes with the prostration
1490: of thought under an overpowering passion: it was that expectation of
1491: impossibilities, that belief in contradictory images, which is still
1492: distinct from madness, because it is capable of being dissipated by the
1493: external fact. Silas got up from his knees trembling, and looked round
1494: at the table: didn’t the gold lie there after all? The table was bare.
1495: Then he turned and looked behind him—looked all round his dwelling,
1496: seeming to strain his brown eyes after some possible appearance of the
1497: bags where he had already sought them in vain. He could see every
1498: object in his cottage—and his gold was not there.
1499: 
1500: Again he put his trembling hands to his head, and gave a wild ringing
1501: scream, the cry of desolation. For a few moments after, he stood
1502: motionless; but the cry had relieved him from the first maddening
1503: pressure of the truth. He turned, and tottered towards his loom, and
1504: got into the seat where he worked, instinctively seeking this as the
1505: strongest assurance of reality.
1506: 
1507: And now that all the false hopes had vanished, and the first shock of
1508: certainty was past, the idea of a thief began to present itself, and he
1509: entertained it eagerly, because a thief might be caught and made to
1510: restore the gold. The thought brought some new strength with it, and he
1511: started from his loom to the door. As he opened it the rain beat in
1512: upon him, for it was falling more and more heavily. There were no
1513: footsteps to be tracked on such a night—footsteps? When had the thief
1514: come? During Silas’s absence in the daytime the door had been locked,
1515: and there had been no marks of any inroad on his return by daylight.
1516: And in the evening, too, he said to himself, everything was the same as
1517: when he had left it. The sand and bricks looked as if they had not been
1518: moved. _Was_ it a thief who had taken the bags? or was it a cruel power
1519: that no hands could reach, which had delighted in making him a second
1520: time desolate? He shrank from this vaguer dread, and fixed his mind
1521: with struggling effort on the robber with hands, who could be reached
1522: by hands. His thoughts glanced at all the neighbours who had made any
1523: remarks, or asked any questions which he might now regard as a ground
1524: of suspicion. There was Jem Rodney, a known poacher, and otherwise
1525: disreputable: he had often met Marner in his journeys across the
1526: fields, and had said something jestingly about the weaver’s money; nay,
1527: he had once irritated Marner, by lingering at the fire when he called
1528: to light his pipe, instead of going about his business. Jem Rodney was
1529: the man—there was ease in the thought. Jem could be found and made to
1530: restore the money: Marner did not want to punish him, but only to get
1531: back his gold which had gone from him, and left his soul like a forlorn
1532: traveller on an unknown desert. The robber must be laid hold of.
1533: Marner’s ideas of legal authority were confused, but he felt that he
1534: must go and proclaim his loss; and the great people in the village—the
1535: clergyman, the constable, and Squire Cass—would make Jem Rodney, or
1536: somebody else, deliver up the stolen money. He rushed out in the rain,
1537: under the stimulus of this hope, forgetting to cover his head, not
1538: caring to fasten his door; for he felt as if he had nothing left to
1539: lose. He ran swiftly, till want of breath compelled him to slacken his
1540: pace as he was entering the village at the turning close to the
1541: Rainbow.
1542: 
1543: The Rainbow, in Marner’s view, was a place of luxurious resort for rich
1544: and stout husbands, whose wives had superfluous stores of linen; it was
1545: the place where he was likely to find the powers and dignities of
1546: Raveloe, and where he could most speedily make his loss public. He
1547: lifted the latch, and turned into the bright bar or kitchen on the
1548: right hand, where the less lofty customers of the house were in the
1549: habit of assembling, the parlour on the left being reserved for the
1550: more select society in which Squire Cass frequently enjoyed the double
1551: pleasure of conviviality and condescension. But the parlour was dark
1552: to-night, the chief personages who ornamented its circle being all at
1553: Mrs. Osgood’s birthday dance, as Godfrey Cass was. And in consequence
1554: of this, the party on the high-screened seats in the kitchen was more
1555: numerous than usual; several personages, who would otherwise have been
1556: admitted into the parlour and enlarged the opportunity of hectoring and
1557: condescension for their betters, being content this evening to vary
1558: their enjoyment by taking their spirits-and-water where they could
1559: themselves hector and condescend in company that called for beer.
1560: 
1561: 
1562: 
1563: CHAPTER VI.
1564: 
1565: The conversation, which was at a high pitch of animation when Silas
1566: approached the door of the Rainbow, had, as usual, been slow and
1567: intermittent when the company first assembled. The pipes began to be
1568: puffed in a silence which had an air of severity; the more important
1569: customers, who drank spirits and sat nearest the fire, staring at each
1570: other as if a bet were depending on the first man who winked; while the
1571: beer-drinkers, chiefly men in fustian jackets and smock-frocks, kept
1572: their eyelids down and rubbed their hands across their mouths, as if
1573: their draughts of beer were a funereal duty attended with embarrassing
1574: sadness. At last Mr. Snell, the landlord, a man of a neutral
1575: disposition, accustomed to stand aloof from human differences as those
1576: of beings who were all alike in need of liquor, broke silence, by
1577: saying in a doubtful tone to his cousin the butcher—
1578: 
1579: “Some folks ’ud say that was a fine beast you druv in yesterday, Bob?”
1580: 
1581: The butcher, a jolly, smiling, red-haired man, was not disposed to
1582: answer rashly. He gave a few puffs before he spat and replied, “And
1583: they wouldn’t be fur wrong, John.”
1584: 
1585: After this feeble delusive thaw, the silence set in as severely as
1586: before.
1587: 
1588: “Was it a red Durham?” said the farrier, taking up the thread of
1589: discourse after the lapse of a few minutes.
1590: 
1591: The farrier looked at the landlord, and the landlord looked at the
1592: butcher, as the person who must take the responsibility of answering.
1593: 
1594: “Red it was,” said the butcher, in his good-humoured husky treble—“and
1595: a Durham it was.”
1596: 
1597: “Then you needn’t tell _me_ who you bought it of,” said the farrier,
1598: looking round with some triumph; “I know who it is has got the red
1599: Durhams o’ this country-side. And she’d a white star on her brow, I’ll
1600: bet a penny?” The farrier leaned forward with his hands on his knees as
1601: he put this question, and his eyes twinkled knowingly.
1602: 
1603: “Well; yes—she might,” said the butcher, slowly, considering that he
1604: was giving a decided affirmative. “I don’t say contrairy.”
1605: 
1606: “I knew that very well,” said the farrier, throwing himself backward
1607: again, and speaking defiantly; “if _I_ don’t know Mr. Lammeter’s cows,
1608: I should like to know who does—that’s all. And as for the cow you’ve
1609: bought, bargain or no bargain, I’ve been at the drenching of
1610: her—contradick me who will.”
1611: 
1612: The farrier looked fierce, and the mild butcher’s conversational spirit
1613: was roused a little.
1614: 
1615: “I’m not for contradicking no man,” he said; “I’m for peace and
1616: quietness. Some are for cutting long ribs—I’m for cutting ’em short
1617: myself; but _I_ don’t quarrel with ’em. All I say is, it’s a lovely
1618: carkiss—and anybody as was reasonable, it ’ud bring tears into their
1619: eyes to look at it.”
1620: 
1621: “Well, it’s the cow as I drenched, whatever it is,” pursued the
1622: farrier, angrily; “and it was Mr. Lammeter’s cow, else you told a lie
1623: when you said it was a red Durham.”
1624: 
1625: “I tell no lies,” said the butcher, with the same mild huskiness as
1626: before, “and I contradick none—not if a man was to swear himself black:
1627: he’s no meat o’ mine, nor none o’ my bargains. All I say is, it’s a
1628: lovely carkiss. And what I say, I’ll stick to; but I’ll quarrel wi’ no
1629: man.”
1630: 
1631: “No,” said the farrier, with bitter sarcasm, looking at the company
1632: generally; “and p’rhaps you aren’t pig-headed; and p’rhaps you didn’t
1633: say the cow was a red Durham; and p’rhaps you didn’t say she’d got a
1634: star on her brow—stick to that, now you’re at it.”
1635: 
1636: “Come, come,” said the landlord; “let the cow alone. The truth lies
1637: atween you: you’re both right and both wrong, as I allays say. And as
1638: for the cow’s being Mr. Lammeter’s, I say nothing to that; but this I
1639: say, as the Rainbow’s the Rainbow. And for the matter o’ that, if the
1640: talk is to be o’ the Lammeters, _you_ know the most upo’ that head, eh,
1641: Mr. Macey? You remember when first Mr. Lammeter’s father come into
1642: these parts, and took the Warrens?”
1643: 
1644: Mr. Macey, tailor and parish-clerk, the latter of which functions
1645: rheumatism had of late obliged him to share with a small-featured young
1646: man who sat opposite him, held his white head on one side, and twirled
1647: his thumbs with an air of complacency, slightly seasoned with
1648: criticism. He smiled pityingly, in answer to the landlord’s appeal, and
1649: said—
1650: 
1651: “Aye, aye; I know, I know; but I let other folks talk. I’ve laid by
1652: now, and gev up to the young uns. Ask them as have been to school at
1653: Tarley: they’ve learnt pernouncing; that’s come up since my day.”
1654: 
1655: “If you’re pointing at me, Mr. Macey,” said the deputy clerk, with an
1656: air of anxious propriety, “I’m nowise a man to speak out of my place.
1657: As the psalm says—
1658: 
1659: “I know what’s right, nor only so,
1660: But also practise what I know.”
1661: 
1662: 
1663: “Well, then, I wish you’d keep hold o’ the tune, when it’s set for you;
1664: if you’re for prac_tis_ing, I wish you’d prac_tise_ that,” said a large
1665: jocose-looking man, an excellent wheelwright in his week-day capacity,
1666: but on Sundays leader of the choir. He winked, as he spoke, at two of
1667: the company, who were known officially as the “bassoon” and the
1668: “key-bugle”, in the confidence that he was expressing the sense of the
1669: musical profession in Raveloe.
1670: 
1671: Mr. Tookey, the deputy-clerk, who shared the unpopularity common to
1672: deputies, turned very red, but replied, with careful moderation—“Mr.
1673: Winthrop, if you’ll bring me any proof as I’m in the wrong, I’m not the
1674: man to say I won’t alter. But there’s people set up their own ears for
1675: a standard, and expect the whole choir to follow ’em. There may be two
1676: opinions, I hope.”
1677: 
1678: “Aye, aye,” said Mr. Macey, who felt very well satisfied with this
1679: attack on youthful presumption; “you’re right there, Tookey: there’s
1680: allays two ’pinions; there’s the ’pinion a man has of himsen, and
1681: there’s the ’pinion other folks have on him. There’d be two ’pinions
1682: about a cracked bell, if the bell could hear itself.”
1683: 
1684: “Well, Mr. Macey,” said poor Tookey, serious amidst the general
1685: laughter, “I undertook to partially fill up the office of parish-clerk
1686: by Mr. Crackenthorp’s desire, whenever your infirmities should make you
1687: unfitting; and it’s one of the rights thereof to sing in the choir—else
1688: why have you done the same yourself?”
1689: 
1690: “Ah! but the old gentleman and you are two folks,” said Ben Winthrop.
1691: “The old gentleman’s got a gift. Why, the Squire used to invite him to
1692: take a glass, only to hear him sing the “Red Rovier”; didn’t he, Mr.
1693: Macey? It’s a nat’ral gift. There’s my little lad Aaron, he’s got a
1694: gift—he can sing a tune off straight, like a throstle. But as for you,
1695: Master Tookey, you’d better stick to your “Amens”: your voice is well
1696: enough when you keep it up in your nose. It’s your inside as isn’t
1697: right made for music: it’s no better nor a hollow stalk.”
1698: 
1699: This kind of unflinching frankness was the most piquant form of joke to
1700: the company at the Rainbow, and Ben Winthrop’s insult was felt by
1701: everybody to have capped Mr. Macey’s epigram.
1702: 
1703: “I see what it is plain enough,” said Mr. Tookey, unable to keep cool
1704: any longer. “There’s a consperacy to turn me out o’ the choir, as I
1705: shouldn’t share the Christmas money—that’s where it is. But I shall
1706: speak to Mr. Crackenthorp; I’ll not be put upon by no man.”
1707: 
1708: “Nay, nay, Tookey,” said Ben Winthrop. “We’ll pay you your share to
1709: keep out of it—that’s what we’ll do. There’s things folks ’ud pay to be
1710: rid on, besides varmin.”
1711: 
1712: “Come, come,” said the landlord, who felt that paying people for their
1713: absence was a principle dangerous to society; “a joke’s a joke. We’re
1714: all good friends here, I hope. We must give and take. You’re both right
1715: and you’re both wrong, as I say. I agree wi’ Mr. Macey here, as there’s
1716: two opinions; and if mine was asked, I should say they’re both right.
1717: Tookey’s right and Winthrop’s right, and they’ve only got to split the
1718: difference and make themselves even.”
1719: 
1720: The farrier was puffing his pipe rather fiercely, in some contempt at
1721: this trivial discussion. He had no ear for music himself, and never
1722: went to church, as being of the medical profession, and likely to be in
1723: requisition for delicate cows. But the butcher, having music in his
1724: soul, had listened with a divided desire for Tookey’s defeat and for
1725: the preservation of the peace.
1726: 
1727: “To be sure,” he said, following up the landlord’s conciliatory view,
1728: “we’re fond of our old clerk; it’s nat’ral, and him used to be such a
1729: singer, and got a brother as is known for the first fiddler in this
1730: country-side. Eh, it’s a pity but what Solomon lived in our village,
1731: and could give us a tune when we liked; eh, Mr. Macey? I’d keep him in
1732: liver and lights for nothing—that I would.”
1733: 
1734: “Aye, aye,” said Mr. Macey, in the height of complacency; “our family’s
1735: been known for musicianers as far back as anybody can tell. But them
1736: things are dying out, as I tell Solomon every time he comes round;
1737: there’s no voices like what there used to be, and there’s nobody
1738: remembers what we remember, if it isn’t the old crows.”
1739: 
1740: “Aye, you remember when first Mr. Lammeter’s father come into these
1741: parts, don’t you, Mr. Macey?” said the landlord.
1742: 
1743: “I should think I did,” said the old man, who had now gone through that
1744: complimentary process necessary to bring him up to the point of
1745: narration; “and a fine old gentleman he was—as fine, and finer nor the
1746: Mr. Lammeter as now is. He came from a bit north’ard, so far as I could
1747: ever make out. But there’s nobody rightly knows about those parts: only
1748: it couldn’t be far north’ard, nor much different from this country, for
1749: he brought a fine breed o’ sheep with him, so there must be pastures
1750: there, and everything reasonable. We heared tell as he’d sold his own
1751: land to come and take the Warrens, and that seemed odd for a man as had
1752: land of his own, to come and rent a farm in a strange place. But they
1753: said it was along of his wife’s dying; though there’s reasons in things
1754: as nobody knows on—that’s pretty much what I’ve made out; yet some
1755: folks are so wise, they’ll find you fifty reasons straight off, and all
1756: the while the real reason’s winking at ’em in the corner, and they
1757: niver see’t. Howsomever, it was soon seen as we’d got a new parish’ner
1758: as know’d the rights and customs o’ things, and kep a good house, and
1759: was well looked on by everybody. And the young man—that’s the Mr.
1760: Lammeter as now is, for he’d niver a sister—soon begun to court Miss
1761: Osgood, that’s the sister o’ the Mr. Osgood as now is, and a fine
1762: handsome lass she was—eh, you can’t think—they pretend this young lass
1763: is like her, but that’s the way wi’ people as don’t know what come
1764: before ’em. _I_ should know, for I helped the old rector, Mr. Drumlow
1765: as was, I helped him marry ’em.”
1766: 
1767: Here Mr. Macey paused; he always gave his narrative in instalments,
1768: expecting to be questioned according to precedent.
1769: 
1770: “Aye, and a partic’lar thing happened, didn’t it, Mr. Macey, so as you
1771: were likely to remember that marriage?” said the landlord, in a
1772: congratulatory tone.
1773: 
1774: “I should think there did—a _very_ partic’lar thing,” said Mr. Macey,
1775: nodding sideways. “For Mr. Drumlow—poor old gentleman, I was fond on
1776: him, though he’d got a bit confused in his head, what wi’ age and wi’
1777: taking a drop o’ summat warm when the service come of a cold morning.
1778: And young Mr. Lammeter, he’d have no way but he must be married in
1779: Janiwary, which, to be sure, ’s a unreasonable time to be married in,
1780: for it isn’t like a christening or a burying, as you can’t help; and so
1781: Mr. Drumlow—poor old gentleman, I was fond on him—but when he come to
1782: put the questions, he put ’em by the rule o’ contrairy, like, and he
1783: says, “Wilt thou have this man to thy wedded wife?” says he, and then
1784: he says, “Wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded husband?” says he.
1785: But the partic’larest thing of all is, as nobody took any notice on it
1786: but me, and they answered straight off “yes”, like as if it had been me
1787: saying “Amen” i’ the right place, without listening to what went
1788: before.”
1789: 
1790: “But _you_ knew what was going on well enough, didn’t you, Mr. Macey?
1791: You were live enough, eh?” said the butcher.
1792: 
1793: “Lor bless you!” said Mr. Macey, pausing, and smiling in pity at the
1794: impotence of his hearer’s imagination—“why, I was all of a tremble: it
1795: was as if I’d been a coat pulled by the two tails, like; for I couldn’t
1796: stop the parson, I couldn’t take upon me to do that; and yet I said to
1797: myself, I says, “Suppose they shouldn’t be fast married, ’cause the
1798: words are contrairy?” and my head went working like a mill, for I was
1799: allays uncommon for turning things over and seeing all round ’em; and I
1800: says to myself, “Is’t the meanin’ or the words as makes folks fast i’
1801: wedlock?” For the parson meant right, and the bride and bridegroom
1802: meant right. But then, when I come to think on it, meanin’ goes but a
1803: little way i’ most things, for you may mean to stick things together
1804: and your glue may be bad, and then where are you? And so I says to
1805: mysen, “It isn’t the meanin’, it’s the glue.” And I was worreted as if
1806: I’d got three bells to pull at once, when we went into the vestry, and
1807: they begun to sign their names. But where’s the use o’ talking?—you
1808: can’t think what goes on in a ’cute man’s inside.”
1809: 
1810: “But you held in for all that, didn’t you, Mr. Macey?” said the
1811: landlord.
1812: 
1813: “Aye, I held in tight till I was by mysen wi’ Mr. Drumlow, and then I
1814: out wi’ everything, but respectful, as I allays did. And he made light
1815: on it, and he says, “Pooh, pooh, Macey, make yourself easy,” he says;
1816: “it’s neither the meaning nor the words—it’s the re_ges_ter does
1817: it—that’s the glue.” So you see he settled it easy; for parsons and
1818: doctors know everything by heart, like, so as they aren’t worreted wi’
1819: thinking what’s the rights and wrongs o’ things, as I’n been many and
1820: many’s the time. And sure enough the wedding turned out all right, on’y
1821: poor Mrs. Lammeter—that’s Miss Osgood as was—died afore the lasses was
1822: growed up; but for prosperity and everything respectable, there’s no
1823: family more looked on.”
1824: 
1825: Every one of Mr. Macey’s audience had heard this story many times, but
1826: it was listened to as if it had been a favourite tune, and at certain
1827: points the puffing of the pipes was momentarily suspended, that the
1828: listeners might give their whole minds to the expected words. But there
1829: was more to come; and Mr. Snell, the landlord, duly put the leading
1830: question.
1831: 
1832: “Why, old Mr. Lammeter had a pretty fortin, didn’t they say, when he
1833: come into these parts?”
1834: 
1835: “Well, yes,” said Mr. Macey; “but I daresay it’s as much as this Mr.
1836: Lammeter’s done to keep it whole. For there was allays a talk as nobody
1837: could get rich on the Warrens: though he holds it cheap, for it’s what
1838: they call Charity Land.”
1839: 
1840: “Aye, and there’s few folks know so well as you how it come to be
1841: Charity Land, eh, Mr. Macey?” said the butcher.
1842: 
1843: “How should they?” said the old clerk, with some contempt. “Why, my
1844: grandfather made the grooms’ livery for that Mr. Cliff as came and
1845: built the big stables at the Warrens. Why, they’re stables four times
1846: as big as Squire Cass’s, for he thought o’ nothing but hosses and
1847: hunting, Cliff didn’t—a Lunnon tailor, some folks said, as had gone mad
1848: wi’ cheating. For he couldn’t ride; lor bless you! they said he’d got
1849: no more grip o’ the hoss than if his legs had been cross-sticks: my
1850: grandfather heared old Squire Cass say so many and many a time. But
1851: ride he would, as if Old Harry had been a-driving him; and he’d a son,
1852: a lad o’ sixteen; and nothing would his father have him do, but he must
1853: ride and ride—though the lad was frighted, they said. And it was a
1854: common saying as the father wanted to ride the tailor out o’ the lad,
1855: and make a gentleman on him—not but what I’m a tailor myself, but in
1856: respect as God made me such, I’m proud on it, for “Macey, tailor”, ’s
1857: been wrote up over our door since afore the Queen’s heads went out on
1858: the shillings. But Cliff, he was ashamed o’ being called a tailor, and
1859: he was sore vexed as his riding was laughed at, and nobody o’ the
1860: gentlefolks hereabout could abide him. Howsomever, the poor lad got
1861: sickly and died, and the father didn’t live long after him, for he got
1862: queerer nor ever, and they said he used to go out i’ the dead o’ the
1863: night, wi’ a lantern in his hand, to the stables, and set a lot o’
1864: lights burning, for he got as he couldn’t sleep; and there he’d stand,
1865: cracking his whip and looking at his hosses; and they said it was a
1866: mercy as the stables didn’t get burnt down wi’ the poor dumb creaturs
1867: in ’em. But at last he died raving, and they found as he’d left all his
1868: property, Warrens and all, to a Lunnon Charity, and that’s how the
1869: Warrens come to be Charity Land; though, as for the stables, Mr.
1870: Lammeter never uses ’em—they’re out o’ all charicter—lor bless you! if
1871: you was to set the doors a-banging in ’em, it ’ud sound like thunder
1872: half o’er the parish.”
1873: 
1874: “Aye, but there’s more going on in the stables than what folks see by
1875: daylight, eh, Mr. Macey?” said the landlord.
1876: 
1877: “Aye, aye; go that way of a dark night, that’s all,” said Mr. Macey,
1878: winking mysteriously, “and then make believe, if you like, as you
1879: didn’t see lights i’ the stables, nor hear the stamping o’ the hosses,
1880: nor the cracking o’ the whips, and howling, too, if it’s tow’rt
1881: daybreak. “Cliff’s Holiday” has been the name of it ever sin’ I were a
1882: boy; that’s to say, some said as it was the holiday Old Harry gev him
1883: from roasting, like. That’s what my father told me, and he was a
1884: reasonable man, though there’s folks nowadays know what happened afore
1885: they were born better nor they know their own business.”
1886: 
1887: “What do you say to that, eh, Dowlas?” said the landlord, turning to
1888: the farrier, who was swelling with impatience for his cue. “There’s a
1889: nut for _you_ to crack.”
1890: 
1891: Mr. Dowlas was the negative spirit in the company, and was proud of his
1892: position.
1893: 
1894: “Say? I say what a man _should_ say as doesn’t shut his eyes to look at
1895: a finger-post. I say, as I’m ready to wager any man ten pound, if he’ll
1896: stand out wi’ me any dry night in the pasture before the Warren
1897: stables, as we shall neither see lights nor hear noises, if it isn’t
1898: the blowing of our own noses. That’s what I say, and I’ve said it many
1899: a time; but there’s nobody ’ull ventur a ten-pun’ note on their ghos’es
1900: as they make so sure of.”
1901: 
1902: “Why, Dowlas, that’s easy betting, that is,” said Ben Winthrop. “You
1903: might as well bet a man as he wouldn’t catch the rheumatise if he stood
1904: up to ’s neck in the pool of a frosty night. It ’ud be fine fun for a
1905: man to win his bet as he’d catch the rheumatise. Folks as believe in
1906: Cliff’s Holiday aren’t agoing to ventur near it for a matter o’ ten
1907: pound.”
1908: 
1909: “If Master Dowlas wants to know the truth on it,” said Mr. Macey, with
1910: a sarcastic smile, tapping his thumbs together, “he’s no call to lay
1911: any bet—let him go and stan’ by himself—there’s nobody ’ull hinder him;
1912: and then he can let the parish’ners know if they’re wrong.”
1913: 
1914: “Thank you! I’m obliged to you,” said the farrier, with a snort of
1915: scorn. “If folks are fools, it’s no business o’ mine. _I_ don’t want to
1916: make out the truth about ghos’es: I know it a’ready. But I’m not
1917: against a bet—everything fair and open. Let any man bet me ten pound as
1918: I shall see Cliff’s Holiday, and I’ll go and stand by myself. I want no
1919: company. I’d as lief do it as I’d fill this pipe.”
1920: 
1921: “Ah, but who’s to watch you, Dowlas, and see you do it? That’s no fair
1922: bet,” said the butcher.
1923: 
1924: “No fair bet?” replied Mr. Dowlas, angrily. “I should like to hear any
1925: man stand up and say I want to bet unfair. Come now, Master Lundy, I
1926: should like to hear you say it.”
1927: 
1928: “Very like you would,” said the butcher. “But it’s no business o’ mine.
1929: You’re none o’ my bargains, and I aren’t a-going to try and ’bate your
1930: price. If anybody ’ll bid for you at your own vallying, let him. I’m
1931: for peace and quietness, I am.”
1932: 
1933: “Yes, that’s what every yapping cur is, when you hold a stick up at
1934: him,” said the farrier. “But I’m afraid o’ neither man nor ghost, and
1935: I’m ready to lay a fair bet. _I_ aren’t a turn-tail cur.”
1936: 
1937: “Aye, but there’s this in it, Dowlas,” said the landlord, speaking in a
1938: tone of much candour and tolerance. “There’s folks, i’ my opinion, they
1939: can’t see ghos’es, not if they stood as plain as a pike-staff before
1940: ’em. And there’s reason i’ that. For there’s my wife, now, can’t smell,
1941: not if she’d the strongest o’ cheese under her nose. I never see’d a
1942: ghost myself; but then I says to myself, “Very like I haven’t got the
1943: smell for ’em.” I mean, putting a ghost for a smell, or else
1944: contrairiways. And so, I’m for holding with both sides; for, as I say,
1945: the truth lies between ’em. And if Dowlas was to go and stand, and say
1946: he’d never seen a wink o’ Cliff’s Holiday all the night through, I’d
1947: back him; and if anybody said as Cliff’s Holiday was certain sure, for
1948: all that, I’d back _him_ too. For the smell’s what I go by.”
1949: 
1950: The landlord’s analogical argument was not well received by the
1951: farrier—a man intensely opposed to compromise.
1952: 
1953: “Tut, tut,” he said, setting down his glass with refreshed irritation;
1954: “what’s the smell got to do with it? Did ever a ghost give a man a
1955: black eye? That’s what I should like to know. If ghos’es want me to
1956: believe in ’em, let ’em leave off skulking i’ the dark and i’ lone
1957: places—let ’em come where there’s company and candles.”
1958: 
1959: “As if ghos’es ’ud want to be believed in by anybody so ignirant!” said
1960: Mr. Macey, in deep disgust at the farrier’s crass incompetence to
1961: apprehend the conditions of ghostly phenomena.
1962: 
1963: 
1964: 
1965: CHAPTER VII.
1966: 
1967: Yet the next moment there seemed to be some evidence that ghosts had a
1968: more condescending disposition than Mr. Macey attributed to them; for
1969: the pale thin figure of Silas Marner was suddenly seen standing in the
1970: warm light, uttering no word, but looking round at the company with his
1971: strange unearthly eyes. The long pipes gave a simultaneous movement,
1972: like the antennae of startled insects, and every man present, not
1973: excepting even the sceptical farrier, had an impression that he saw,
1974: not Silas Marner in the flesh, but an apparition; for the door by which
1975: Silas had entered was hidden by the high-screened seats, and no one had
1976: noticed his approach. Mr. Macey, sitting a long way off the ghost,
1977: might be supposed to have felt an argumentative triumph, which would
1978: tend to neutralize his share of the general alarm. Had he not always
1979: said that when Silas Marner was in that strange trance of his, his soul
1980: went loose from his body? Here was the demonstration: nevertheless, on
1981: the whole, he would have been as well contented without it. For a few
1982: moments there was a dead silence, Marner’s want of breath and agitation
1983: not allowing him to speak. The landlord, under the habitual sense that
1984: he was bound to keep his house open to all company, and confident in
1985: the protection of his unbroken neutrality, at last took on himself the
1986: task of adjuring the ghost.
1987: 
1988: “Master Marner,” he said, in a conciliatory tone, “what’s lacking to
1989: you? What’s your business here?”
1990: 
1991: “Robbed!” said Silas, gaspingly. “I’ve been robbed! I want the
1992: constable—and the Justice—and Squire Cass—and Mr. Crackenthorp.”
1993: 
1994: “Lay hold on him, Jem Rodney,” said the landlord, the idea of a ghost
1995: subsiding; “he’s off his head, I doubt. He’s wet through.”
1996: 
1997: Jem Rodney was the outermost man, and sat conveniently near Marner’s
1998: standing-place; but he declined to give his services.
1999: 
2000: “Come and lay hold on him yourself, Mr. Snell, if you’ve a mind,” said
2001: Jem, rather sullenly. “He’s been robbed, and murdered too, for what I
2002: know,” he added, in a muttering tone.
2003: 
2004: “Jem Rodney!” said Silas, turning and fixing his strange eyes on the
2005: suspected man.
2006: 
2007: “Aye, Master Marner, what do you want wi’ me?” said Jem, trembling a
2008: little, and seizing his drinking-can as a defensive weapon.
2009: 
2010: “If it was you stole my money,” said Silas, clasping his hands
2011: entreatingly, and raising his voice to a cry, “give it me back—and I
2012: won’t meddle with you. I won’t set the constable on you. Give it me
2013: back, and I’ll let you—I’ll let you have a guinea.”
2014: 
2015: “Me stole your money!” said Jem, angrily. “I’ll pitch this can at your
2016: eye if you talk o’ _my_ stealing your money.”
2017: 
2018: “Come, come, Master Marner,” said the landlord, now rising resolutely,
2019: and seizing Marner by the shoulder, “if you’ve got any information to
2020: lay, speak it out sensible, and show as you’re in your right mind, if
2021: you expect anybody to listen to you. You’re as wet as a drownded rat.
2022: Sit down and dry yourself, and speak straight forrard.”
2023: 
2024: “Ah, to be sure, man,” said the farrier, who began to feel that he had
2025: not been quite on a par with himself and the occasion. “Let’s have no
2026: more staring and screaming, else we’ll have you strapped for a madman.
2027: That was why I didn’t speak at the first—thinks I, the man’s run mad.”
2028: 
2029: “Aye, aye, make him sit down,” said several voices at once, well
2030: pleased that the reality of ghosts remained still an open question.
2031: 
2032: The landlord forced Marner to take off his coat, and then to sit down
2033: on a chair aloof from every one else, in the centre of the circle and
2034: in the direct rays of the fire. The weaver, too feeble to have any
2035: distinct purpose beyond that of getting help to recover his money,
2036: submitted unresistingly. The transient fears of the company were now
2037: forgotten in their strong curiosity, and all faces were turned towards
2038: Silas, when the landlord, having seated himself again, said—
2039: 
2040: “Now then, Master Marner, what’s this you’ve got to say—as you’ve been
2041: robbed? Speak out.”
2042: 
2043: “He’d better not say again as it was me robbed him,” cried Jem Rodney,
2044: hastily. “What could I ha’ done with his money? I could as easy steal
2045: the parson’s surplice, and wear it.”
2046: 
2047: “Hold your tongue, Jem, and let’s hear what he’s got to say,” said the
2048: landlord. “Now then, Master Marner.”
2049: 
2050: Silas now told his story, under frequent questioning as the mysterious
2051: character of the robbery became evident.
2052: 
2053: This strangely novel situation of opening his trouble to his Raveloe
2054: neighbours, of sitting in the warmth of a hearth not his own, and
2055: feeling the presence of faces and voices which were his nearest promise
2056: of help, had doubtless its influence on Marner, in spite of his
2057: passionate preoccupation with his loss. Our consciousness rarely
2058: registers the beginning of a growth within us any more than without us:
2059: there have been many circulations of the sap before we detect the
2060: smallest sign of the bud.
2061: 
2062: The slight suspicion with which his hearers at first listened to him,
2063: gradually melted away before the convincing simplicity of his distress:
2064: it was impossible for the neighbours to doubt that Marner was telling
2065: the truth, not because they were capable of arguing at once from the
2066: nature of his statements to the absence of any motive for making them
2067: falsely, but because, as Mr. Macey observed, “Folks as had the devil to
2068: back ’em were not likely to be so mushed” as poor Silas was. Rather,
2069: from the strange fact that the robber had left no traces, and had
2070: happened to know the nick of time, utterly incalculable by mortal
2071: agents, when Silas would go away from home without locking his door,
2072: the more probable conclusion seemed to be, that his disreputable
2073: intimacy in that quarter, if it ever existed, had been broken up, and
2074: that, in consequence, this ill turn had been done to Marner by somebody
2075: it was quite in vain to set the constable after. Why this preternatural
2076: felon should be obliged to wait till the door was left unlocked, was a
2077: question which did not present itself.
2078: 
2079: “It isn’t Jem Rodney as has done this work, Master Marner,” said the
2080: landlord. “You mustn’t be a-casting your eye at poor Jem. There may be
2081: a bit of a reckoning against Jem for the matter of a hare or so, if
2082: anybody was bound to keep their eyes staring open, and niver to wink;
2083: but Jem’s been a-sitting here drinking his can, like the decentest man
2084: i’ the parish, since before you left your house, Master Marner, by your
2085: own account.”
2086: 
2087: “Aye, aye,” said Mr. Macey; “let’s have no accusing o’ the innicent.
2088: That isn’t the law. There must be folks to swear again’ a man before he
2089: can be ta’en up. Let’s have no accusing o’ the innicent, Master
2090: Marner.”
2091: 
2092: Memory was not so utterly torpid in Silas that it could not be awakened
2093: by these words. With a movement of compunction as new and strange to
2094: him as everything else within the last hour, he started from his chair
2095: and went close up to Jem, looking at him as if he wanted to assure
2096: himself of the expression in his face.
2097: 
2098: “I was wrong,” he said—“yes, yes—I ought to have thought. There’s
2099: nothing to witness against you, Jem. Only you’d been into my house
2100: oftener than anybody else, and so you came into my head. I don’t accuse
2101: you—I won’t accuse anybody—only,” he added, lifting up his hands to his
2102: head, and turning away with bewildered misery, “I try—I try to think
2103: where my guineas can be.”
2104: 
2105: “Aye, aye, they’re gone where it’s hot enough to melt ’em, I doubt,”
2106: said Mr. Macey.
2107: 
2108: “Tchuh!” said the farrier. And then he asked, with a cross-examining
2109: air, “How much money might there be in the bags, Master Marner?”
2110: 
2111: “Two hundred and seventy-two pounds, twelve and sixpence, last night
2112: when I counted it,” said Silas, seating himself again, with a groan.
2113: 
2114: “Pooh! why, they’d be none so heavy to carry. Some tramp’s been in,
2115: that’s all; and as for the no footmarks, and the bricks and the sand
2116: being all right—why, your eyes are pretty much like a insect’s, Master
2117: Marner; they’re obliged to look so close, you can’t see much at a time.
2118: It’s my opinion as, if I’d been you, or you’d been me—for it comes to
2119: the same thing—you wouldn’t have thought you’d found everything as you
2120: left it. But what I vote is, as two of the sensiblest o’ the company
2121: should go with you to Master Kench, the constable’s—he’s ill i’ bed, I
2122: know that much—and get him to appoint one of us his deppity; for that’s
2123: the law, and I don’t think anybody ’ull take upon him to contradick me
2124: there. It isn’t much of a walk to Kench’s; and then, if it’s me as is
2125: deppity, I’ll go back with you, Master Marner, and examine your
2126: premises; and if anybody’s got any fault to find with that, I’ll thank
2127: him to stand up and say it out like a man.”
2128: 
2129: By this pregnant speech the farrier had re-established his
2130: self-complacency, and waited with confidence to hear himself named as
2131: one of the superlatively sensible men.
2132: 
2133: “Let us see how the night is, though,” said the landlord, who also
2134: considered himself personally concerned in this proposition. “Why, it
2135: rains heavy still,” he said, returning from the door.
2136: 
2137: “Well, I’m not the man to be afraid o’ the rain,” said the farrier.
2138: “For it’ll look bad when Justice Malam hears as respectable men like us
2139: had a information laid before ’em and took no steps.”
2140: 
2141: The landlord agreed with this view, and after taking the sense of the
2142: company, and duly rehearsing a small ceremony known in high
2143: ecclesiastical life as the _nolo episcopari_, he consented to take on
2144: himself the chill dignity of going to Kench’s. But to the farrier’s
2145: strong disgust, Mr. Macey now started an objection to his proposing
2146: himself as a deputy-constable; for that oracular old gentleman,
2147: claiming to know the law, stated, as a fact delivered to him by his
2148: father, that no doctor could be a constable.
2149: 
2150: “And you’re a doctor, I reckon, though you’re only a cow-doctor—for a
2151: fly’s a fly, though it may be a hoss-fly,” concluded Mr. Macey,
2152: wondering a little at his own “’cuteness”.
2153: 
2154: There was a hot debate upon this, the farrier being of course
2155: indisposed to renounce the quality of doctor, but contending that a
2156: doctor could be a constable if he liked—the law meant, he needn’t be
2157: one if he didn’t like. Mr. Macey thought this was nonsense, since the
2158: law was not likely to be fonder of doctors than of other folks.
2159: Moreover, if it was in the nature of doctors more than of other men not
2160: to like being constables, how came Mr. Dowlas to be so eager to act in
2161: that capacity?
2162: 
2163: “_I_ don’t want to act the constable,” said the farrier, driven into a
2164: corner by this merciless reasoning; “and there’s no man can say it of
2165: me, if he’d tell the truth. But if there’s to be any jealousy and
2166: en_vy_ing about going to Kench’s in the rain, let them go as like
2167: it—you won’t get me to go, I can tell you.”
2168: 
2169: By the landlord’s intervention, however, the dispute was accommodated.
2170: Mr. Dowlas consented to go as a second person disinclined to act
2171: officially; and so poor Silas, furnished with some old coverings,
2172: turned out with his two companions into the rain again, thinking of the
2173: long night-hours before him, not as those do who long to rest, but as
2174: those who expect to “watch for the morning”.
2175: 
2176: 
2177: 
2178: CHAPTER VIII.
2179: 
2180: When Godfrey Cass returned from Mrs. Osgood’s party at midnight, he was
2181: not much surprised to learn that Dunsey had not come home. Perhaps he
2182: had not sold Wildfire, and was waiting for another chance—perhaps, on
2183: that foggy afternoon, he had preferred housing himself at the Red Lion
2184: at Batherley for the night, if the run had kept him in that
2185: neighbourhood; for he was not likely to feel much concern about leaving
2186: his brother in suspense. Godfrey’s mind was too full of Nancy
2187: Lammeter’s looks and behaviour, too full of the exasperation against
2188: himself and his lot, which the sight of her always produced in him, for
2189: him to give much thought to Wildfire, or to the probabilities of
2190: Dunstan’s conduct.
2191: 
2192: The next morning the whole village was excited by the story of the
2193: robbery, and Godfrey, like every one else, was occupied in gathering
2194: and discussing news about it, and in visiting the Stone-pits. The rain
2195: had washed away all possibility of distinguishing foot-marks, but a
2196: close investigation of the spot had disclosed, in the direction
2197: opposite to the village, a tinder-box, with a flint and steel, half
2198: sunk in the mud. It was not Silas’s tinder-box, for the only one he had
2199: ever had was still standing on his shelf; and the inference generally
2200: accepted was, that the tinder-box in the ditch was somehow connected
2201: with the robbery. A small minority shook their heads, and intimated
2202: their opinion that it was not a robbery to have much light thrown on it
2203: by tinder-boxes, that Master Marner’s tale had a queer look with it,
2204: and that such things had been known as a man’s doing himself a
2205: mischief, and then setting the justice to look for the doer. But when
2206: questioned closely as to their grounds for this opinion, and what
2207: Master Marner had to gain by such false pretences, they only shook
2208: their heads as before, and observed that there was no knowing what some
2209: folks counted gain; moreover, that everybody had a right to their own
2210: opinions, grounds or no grounds, and that the weaver, as everybody
2211: knew, was partly crazy. Mr. Macey, though he joined in the defence of
2212: Marner against all suspicions of deceit, also pooh-poohed the
2213: tinder-box; indeed, repudiated it as a rather impious suggestion,
2214: tending to imply that everything must be done by human hands, and that
2215: there was no power which could make away with the guineas without
2216: moving the bricks. Nevertheless, he turned round rather sharply on Mr.
2217: Tookey, when the zealous deputy, feeling that this was a view of the
2218: case peculiarly suited to a parish-clerk, carried it still farther, and
2219: doubted whether it was right to inquire into a robbery at all when the
2220: circumstances were so mysterious.
2221: 
2222: “As if,” concluded Mr. Tookey—“as if there was nothing but what could
2223: be made out by justices and constables.”
2224: 
2225: “Now, don’t you be for overshooting the mark, Tookey,” said Mr. Macey,
2226: nodding his head aside admonishingly. “That’s what you’re allays at; if
2227: I throw a stone and hit, you think there’s summat better than hitting,
2228: and you try to throw a stone beyond. What I said was against the
2229: tinder-box: I said nothing against justices and constables, for they’re
2230: o’ King George’s making, and it ’ud be ill-becoming a man in a parish
2231: office to fly out again’ King George.”
2232: 
2233: While these discussions were going on amongst the group outside the
2234: Rainbow, a higher consultation was being carried on within, under the
2235: presidency of Mr. Crackenthorp, the rector, assisted by Squire Cass and
2236: other substantial parishioners. It had just occurred to Mr. Snell, the
2237: landlord—he being, as he observed, a man accustomed to put two and two
2238: together—to connect with the tinder-box, which, as deputy-constable, he
2239: himself had had the honourable distinction of finding, certain
2240: recollections of a pedlar who had called to drink at the house about a
2241: month before, and had actually stated that he carried a tinder-box
2242: about with him to light his pipe. Here, surely, was a clue to be
2243: followed out. And as memory, when duly impregnated with ascertained
2244: facts, is sometimes surprisingly fertile, Mr. Snell gradually recovered
2245: a vivid impression of the effect produced on him by the pedlar’s
2246: countenance and conversation. He had a “look with his eye” which fell
2247: unpleasantly on Mr. Snell’s sensitive organism. To be sure, he didn’t
2248: say anything particular—no, except that about the tinder-box—but it
2249: isn’t what a man says, it’s the way he says it. Moreover, he had a
2250: swarthy foreignness of complexion which boded little honesty.
2251: 
2252: “Did he wear ear-rings?” Mr. Crackenthorp wished to know, having some
2253: acquaintance with foreign customs.
2254: 
2255: “Well—stay—let me see,” said Mr. Snell, like a docile clairvoyante, who
2256: would really not make a mistake if she could help it. After stretching
2257: the corners of his mouth and contracting his eyes, as if he were trying
2258: to see the ear-rings, he appeared to give up the effort, and said,
2259: “Well, he’d got ear-rings in his box to sell, so it’s nat’ral to
2260: suppose he might wear ’em. But he called at every house, a’most, in the
2261: village; there’s somebody else, mayhap, saw ’em in his ears, though I
2262: can’t take upon me rightly to say.”
2263: 
2264: Mr. Snell was correct in his surmise, that somebody else would remember
2265: the pedlar’s ear-rings. For on the spread of inquiry among the
2266: villagers it was stated with gathering emphasis, that the parson had
2267: wanted to know whether the pedlar wore ear-rings in his ears, and an
2268: impression was created that a great deal depended on the eliciting of
2269: this fact. Of course, every one who heard the question, not having any
2270: distinct image of the pedlar as _without_ ear-rings, immediately had an
2271: image of him _with_ ear-rings, larger or smaller, as the case might be;
2272: and the image was presently taken for a vivid recollection, so that the
2273: glazier’s wife, a well-intentioned woman, not given to lying, and whose
2274: house was among the cleanest in the village, was ready to declare, as
2275: sure as ever she meant to take the sacrament the very next Christmas
2276: that was ever coming, that she had seen big ear-rings, in the shape of
2277: the young moon, in the pedlar’s two ears; while Jinny Oates, the
2278: cobbler’s daughter, being a more imaginative person, stated not only
2279: that she had seen them too, but that they had made her blood creep, as
2280: it did at that very moment while there she stood.
2281: 
2282: Also, by way of throwing further light on this clue of the tinder-box,
2283: a collection was made of all the articles purchased from the pedlar at
2284: various houses, and carried to the Rainbow to be exhibited there. In
2285: fact, there was a general feeling in the village, that for the
2286: clearing-up of this robbery there must be a great deal done at the
2287: Rainbow, and that no man need offer his wife an excuse for going there
2288: while it was the scene of severe public duties.
2289: 
2290: Some disappointment was felt, and perhaps a little indignation also,
2291: when it became known that Silas Marner, on being questioned by the
2292: Squire and the parson, had retained no other recollection of the pedlar
2293: than that he had called at his door, but had not entered his house,
2294: having turned away at once when Silas, holding the door ajar, had said
2295: that he wanted nothing. This had been Silas’s testimony, though he
2296: clutched strongly at the idea of the pedlar’s being the culprit, if
2297: only because it gave him a definite image of a whereabout for his gold
2298: after it had been taken away from its hiding-place: he could see it now
2299: in the pedlar’s box. But it was observed with some irritation in the
2300: village, that anybody but a “blind creatur” like Marner would have seen
2301: the man prowling about, for how came he to leave his tinder-box in the
2302: ditch close by, if he hadn’t been lingering there? Doubtless, he had
2303: made his observations when he saw Marner at the door. Anybody might
2304: know—and only look at him—that the weaver was a half-crazy miser. It
2305: was a wonder the pedlar hadn’t murdered him; men of that sort, with
2306: rings in their ears, had been known for murderers often and often;
2307: there had been one tried at the ’sizes, not so long ago but what there
2308: were people living who remembered it.
2309: 
2310: Godfrey Cass, indeed, entering the Rainbow during one of Mr. Snell’s
2311: frequently repeated recitals of his testimony, had treated it lightly,
2312: stating that he himself had bought a pen-knife of the pedlar, and
2313: thought him a merry grinning fellow enough; it was all nonsense, he
2314: said, about the man’s evil looks. But this was spoken of in the village
2315: as the random talk of youth, “as if it was only Mr. Snell who had seen
2316: something odd about the pedlar!” On the contrary, there were at least
2317: half-a-dozen who were ready to go before Justice Malam, and give in
2318: much more striking testimony than any the landlord could furnish. It
2319: was to be hoped Mr. Godfrey would not go to Tarley and throw cold water
2320: on what Mr. Snell said there, and so prevent the justice from drawing
2321: up a warrant. He was suspected of intending this, when, after mid-day,
2322: he was seen setting off on horseback in the direction of Tarley.
2323: 
2324: But by this time Godfrey’s interest in the robbery had faded before his
2325: growing anxiety about Dunstan and Wildfire, and he was going, not to
2326: Tarley, but to Batherley, unable to rest in uncertainty about them any
2327: longer. The possibility that Dunstan had played him the ugly trick of
2328: riding away with Wildfire, to return at the end of a month, when he had
2329: gambled away or otherwise squandered the price of the horse, was a fear
2330: that urged itself upon him more, even, than the thought of an
2331: accidental injury; and now that the dance at Mrs. Osgood’s was past, he
2332: was irritated with himself that he had trusted his horse to Dunstan.
2333: Instead of trying to still his fears, he encouraged them, with that
2334: superstitious impression which clings to us all, that if we expect evil
2335: very strongly it is the less likely to come; and when he heard a horse
2336: approaching at a trot, and saw a hat rising above a hedge beyond an
2337: angle of the lane, he felt as if his conjuration had succeeded. But no
2338: sooner did the horse come within sight, than his heart sank again. It
2339: was not Wildfire; and in a few moments more he discerned that the rider
2340: was not Dunstan, but Bryce, who pulled up to speak, with a face that
2341: implied something disagreeable.
2342: 
2343: “Well, Mr. Godfrey, that’s a lucky brother of yours, that Master
2344: Dunsey, isn’t he?”
2345: 
2346: “What do you mean?” said Godfrey, hastily.
2347: 
2348: “Why, hasn’t he been home yet?” said Bryce.
2349: 
2350: “Home? no. What has happened? Be quick. What has he done with my
2351: horse?”
2352: 
2353: “Ah, I thought it was yours, though he pretended you had parted with it
2354: to him.”
2355: 
2356: “Has he thrown him down and broken his knees?” said Godfrey, flushed
2357: with exasperation.
2358: 
2359: “Worse than that,” said Bryce. “You see, I’d made a bargain with him to
2360: buy the horse for a hundred and twenty—a swinging price, but I always
2361: liked the horse. And what does he do but go and stake him—fly at a
2362: hedge with stakes in it, atop of a bank with a ditch before it. The
2363: horse had been dead a pretty good while when he was found. So he hasn’t
2364: been home since, has he?”
2365: 
2366: “Home? no,” said Godfrey, “and he’d better keep away. Confound me for a
2367: fool! I might have known this would be the end of it.”
2368: 
2369: “Well, to tell you the truth,” said Bryce, “after I’d bargained for the
2370: horse, it did come into my head that he might be riding and selling the
2371: horse without your knowledge, for I didn’t believe it was his own. I
2372: knew Master Dunsey was up to his tricks sometimes. But where can he be
2373: gone? He’s never been seen at Batherley. He couldn’t have been hurt,
2374: for he must have walked off.”
2375: 
2376: “Hurt?” said Godfrey, bitterly. “He’ll never be hurt—he’s made to hurt
2377: other people.”
2378: 
2379: “And so you _did_ give him leave to sell the horse, eh?” said Bryce.
2380: 
2381: “Yes; I wanted to part with the horse—he was always a little too hard
2382: in the mouth for me,” said Godfrey; his pride making him wince under
2383: the idea that Bryce guessed the sale to be a matter of necessity. “I
2384: was going to see after him—I thought some mischief had happened. I’ll
2385: go back now,” he added, turning the horse’s head, and wishing he could
2386: get rid of Bryce; for he felt that the long-dreaded crisis in his life
2387: was close upon him. “You’re coming on to Raveloe, aren’t you?”
2388: 
2389: “Well, no, not now,” said Bryce. “I _was_ coming round there, for I had
2390: to go to Flitton, and I thought I might as well take you in my way, and
2391: just let you know all I knew myself about the horse. I suppose Master
2392: Dunsey didn’t like to show himself till the ill news had blown over a
2393: bit. He’s perhaps gone to pay a visit at the Three Crowns, by
2394: Whitbridge—I know he’s fond of the house.”
2395: 
2396: “Perhaps he is,” said Godfrey, rather absently. Then rousing himself,
2397: he said, with an effort at carelessness, “We shall hear of him soon
2398: enough, I’ll be bound.”
2399: 
2400: “Well, here’s my turning,” said Bryce, not surprised to perceive that
2401: Godfrey was rather “down”; “so I’ll bid you good-day, and wish I may
2402: bring you better news another time.”
2403: 
2404: Godfrey rode along slowly, representing to himself the scene of
2405: confession to his father from which he felt that there was now no
2406: longer any escape. The revelation about the money must be made the very
2407: next morning; and if he withheld the rest, Dunstan would be sure to
2408: come back shortly, and, finding that he must bear the brunt of his
2409: father’s anger, would tell the whole story out of spite, even though he
2410: had nothing to gain by it. There was one step, perhaps, by which he
2411: might still win Dunstan’s silence and put off the evil day: he might
2412: tell his father that he had himself spent the money paid to him by
2413: Fowler; and as he had never been guilty of such an offence before, the
2414: affair would blow over after a little storming. But Godfrey could not
2415: bend himself to this. He felt that in letting Dunstan have the money,
2416: he had already been guilty of a breach of trust hardly less culpable
2417: than that of spending the money directly for his own behoof; and yet
2418: there was a distinction between the two acts which made him feel that
2419: the one was so much more blackening than the other as to be intolerable
2420: to him.
2421: 
2422: “I don’t pretend to be a good fellow,” he said to himself; “but I’m not
2423: a scoundrel—at least, I’ll stop short somewhere. I’ll bear the
2424: consequences of what I _have_ done sooner than make believe I’ve done
2425: what I never would have done. I’d never have spent the money for my own
2426: pleasure—I was tortured into it.”
2427: 
2428: Through the remainder of this day Godfrey, with only occasional
2429: fluctuations, kept his will bent in the direction of a complete avowal
2430: to his father, and he withheld the story of Wildfire’s loss till the
2431: next morning, that it might serve him as an introduction to heavier
2432: matter. The old Squire was accustomed to his son’s frequent absence
2433: from home, and thought neither Dunstan’s nor Wildfire’s non-appearance
2434: a matter calling for remark. Godfrey said to himself again and again,
2435: that if he let slip this one opportunity of confession, he might never
2436: have another; the revelation might be made even in a more odious way
2437: than by Dunstan’s malignity: _she_ might come as she had threatened to
2438: do. And then he tried to make the scene easier to himself by rehearsal:
2439: he made up his mind how he would pass from the admission of his
2440: weakness in letting Dunstan have the money to the fact that Dunstan had
2441: a hold on him which he had been unable to shake off, and how he would
2442: work up his father to expect something very bad before he told him the
2443: fact. The old Squire was an implacable man: he made resolutions in
2444: violent anger, and he was not to be moved from them after his anger had
2445: subsided—as fiery volcanic matters cool and harden into rock. Like many
2446: violent and implacable men, he allowed evils to grow under favour of
2447: his own heedlessness, till they pressed upon him with exasperating
2448: force, and then he turned round with fierce severity and became
2449: unrelentingly hard. This was his system with his tenants: he allowed
2450: them to get into arrears, neglect their fences, reduce their stock,
2451: sell their straw, and otherwise go the wrong way,—and then, when he
2452: became short of money in consequence of this indulgence, he took the
2453: hardest measures and would listen to no appeal. Godfrey knew all this,
2454: and felt it with the greater force because he had constantly suffered
2455: annoyance from witnessing his father’s sudden fits of unrelentingness,
2456: for which his own habitual irresolution deprived him of all sympathy.
2457: (He was not critical on the faulty indulgence which preceded these
2458: fits; _that_ seemed to him natural enough.) Still there was just the
2459: chance, Godfrey thought, that his father’s pride might see this
2460: marriage in a light that would induce him to hush it up, rather than
2461: turn his son out and make the family the talk of the country for ten
2462: miles round.
2463: 
2464: This was the view of the case that Godfrey managed to keep before him
2465: pretty closely till midnight, and he went to sleep thinking that he had
2466: done with inward debating. But when he awoke in the still morning
2467: darkness he found it impossible to reawaken his evening thoughts; it
2468: was as if they had been tired out and were not to be roused to further
2469: work. Instead of arguments for confession, he could now feel the
2470: presence of nothing but its evil consequences: the old dread of
2471: disgrace came back—the old shrinking from the thought of raising a
2472: hopeless barrier between himself and Nancy—the old disposition to rely
2473: on chances which might be favourable to him, and save him from
2474: betrayal. Why, after all, should he cut off the hope of them by his own
2475: act? He had seen the matter in a wrong light yesterday. He had been in
2476: a rage with Dunstan, and had thought of nothing but a thorough break-up
2477: of their mutual understanding; but what it would be really wisest for
2478: him to do, was to try and soften his father’s anger against Dunsey, and
2479: keep things as nearly as possible in their old condition. If Dunsey did
2480: not come back for a few days (and Godfrey did not know but that the
2481: rascal had enough money in his pocket to enable him to keep away still
2482: longer), everything might blow over.
2483: 
2484: 
2485: 
2486: CHAPTER IX.
2487: 
2488: Godfrey rose and took his own breakfast earlier than usual, but
2489: lingered in the wainscoted parlour till his younger brothers had
2490: finished their meal and gone out; awaiting his father, who always took
2491: a walk with his managing-man before breakfast. Every one breakfasted at
2492: a different hour in the Red House, and the Squire was always the
2493: latest, giving a long chance to a rather feeble morning appetite before
2494: he tried it. The table had been spread with substantial eatables nearly
2495: two hours before he presented himself—a tall, stout man of sixty, with
2496: a face in which the knit brow and rather hard glance seemed
2497: contradicted by the slack and feeble mouth. His person showed marks of
2498: habitual neglect, his dress was slovenly; and yet there was something
2499: in the presence of the old Squire distinguishable from that of the
2500: ordinary farmers in the parish, who were perhaps every whit as refined
2501: as he, but, having slouched their way through life with a consciousness
2502: of being in the vicinity of their “betters”, wanted that
2503: self-possession and authoritativeness of voice and carriage which
2504: belonged to a man who thought of superiors as remote existences with
2505: whom he had personally little more to do than with America or the
2506: stars. The Squire had been used to parish homage all his life, used to
2507: the presupposition that his family, his tankards, and everything that
2508: was his, were the oldest and best; and as he never associated with any
2509: gentry higher than himself, his opinion was not disturbed by
2510: comparison.
2511: 
2512: He glanced at his son as he entered the room, and said, “What, sir!
2513: haven’t _you_ had your breakfast yet?” but there was no pleasant
2514: morning greeting between them; not because of any unfriendliness, but
2515: because the sweet flower of courtesy is not a growth of such homes as
2516: the Red House.
2517: 
2518: “Yes, sir,” said Godfrey, “I’ve had my breakfast, but I was waiting to
2519: speak to you.”
2520: 
2521: “Ah! well,” said the Squire, throwing himself indifferently into his
2522: chair, and speaking in a ponderous coughing fashion, which was felt in
2523: Raveloe to be a sort of privilege of his rank, while he cut a piece of
2524: beef, and held it up before the deer-hound that had come in with him.
2525: “Ring the bell for my ale, will you? You youngsters’ business is your
2526: own pleasure, mostly. There’s no hurry about it for anybody but
2527: yourselves.”
2528: 
2529: The Squire’s life was quite as idle as his sons’, but it was a fiction
2530: kept up by himself and his contemporaries in Raveloe that youth was
2531: exclusively the period of folly, and that their aged wisdom was
2532: constantly in a state of endurance mitigated by sarcasm. Godfrey
2533: waited, before he spoke again, until the ale had been brought and the
2534: door closed—an interval during which Fleet, the deer-hound, had
2535: consumed enough bits of beef to make a poor man’s holiday dinner.
2536: 
2537: “There’s been a cursed piece of ill-luck with Wildfire,” he began;
2538: “happened the day before yesterday.”
2539: 
2540: “What! broke his knees?” said the Squire, after taking a draught of
2541: ale. “I thought you knew how to ride better than that, sir. I never
2542: threw a horse down in my life. If I had, I might ha’ whistled for
2543: another, for _my_ father wasn’t quite so ready to unstring as some
2544: other fathers I know of. But they must turn over a new leaf—_they_
2545: must. What with mortgages and arrears, I’m as short o’ cash as a
2546: roadside pauper. And that fool Kimble says the newspaper’s talking
2547: about peace. Why, the country wouldn’t have a leg to stand on. Prices
2548: ’ud run down like a jack, and I should never get my arrears, not if I
2549: sold all the fellows up. And there’s that damned Fowler, I won’t put up
2550: with him any longer; I’ve told Winthrop to go to Cox this very day. The
2551: lying scoundrel told me he’d be sure to pay me a hundred last month. He
2552: takes advantage because he’s on that outlying farm, and thinks I shall
2553: forget him.”
2554: 
2555: The Squire had delivered this speech in a coughing and interrupted
2556: manner, but with no pause long enough for Godfrey to make it a pretext
2557: for taking up the word again. He felt that his father meant to ward off
2558: any request for money on the ground of the misfortune with Wildfire,
2559: and that the emphasis he had thus been led to lay on his shortness of
2560: cash and his arrears was likely to produce an attitude of mind the
2561: utmost unfavourable for his own disclosure. But he must go on, now he
2562: had begun.
2563: 
2564: “It’s worse than breaking the horse’s knees—he’s been staked and
2565: killed,” he said, as soon as his father was silent, and had begun to
2566: cut his meat. “But I wasn’t thinking of asking you to buy me another
2567: horse; I was only thinking I’d lost the means of paying you with the
2568: price of Wildfire, as I’d meant to do. Dunsey took him to the hunt to
2569: sell him for me the other day, and after he’d made a bargain for a
2570: hundred and twenty with Bryce, he went after the hounds, and took some
2571: fool’s leap or other that did for the horse at once. If it hadn’t been
2572: for that, I should have paid you a hundred pounds this morning.”
2573: 
2574: The Squire had laid down his knife and fork, and was staring at his son
2575: in amazement, not being sufficiently quick of brain to form a probable
2576: guess as to what could have caused so strange an inversion of the
2577: paternal and filial relations as this proposition of his son to pay him
2578: a hundred pounds.
2579: 
2580: “The truth is, sir—I’m very sorry—I was quite to blame,” said Godfrey.
2581: “Fowler did pay that hundred pounds. He paid it to me, when I was over
2582: there one day last month. And Dunsey bothered me for the money, and I
2583: let him have it, because I hoped I should be able to pay it you before
2584: this.”
2585: 
2586: The Squire was purple with anger before his son had done speaking, and
2587: found utterance difficult. “You let Dunsey have it, sir? And how long
2588: have you been so thick with Dunsey that you must _collogue_ with him to
2589: embezzle my money? Are you turning out a scamp? I tell you I won’t have
2590: it. I’ll turn the whole pack of you out of the house together, and
2591: marry again. I’d have you to remember, sir, my property’s got no entail
2592: on it;—since my grandfather’s time the Casses can do as they like with
2593: their land. Remember that, sir. Let Dunsey have the money! Why should
2594: you let Dunsey have the money? There’s some lie at the bottom of it.”
2595: 
2596: “There’s no lie, sir,” said Godfrey. “I wouldn’t have spent the money
2597: myself, but Dunsey bothered me, and I was a fool, and let him have it.
2598: But I meant to pay it, whether he did or not. That’s the whole story. I
2599: never meant to embezzle money, and I’m not the man to do it. You never
2600: knew me do a dishonest trick, sir.”
2601: 
2602: “Where’s Dunsey, then? What do you stand talking there for? Go and
2603: fetch Dunsey, as I tell you, and let him give account of what he wanted
2604: the money for, and what he’s done with it. He shall repent it. I’ll
2605: turn him out. I said I would, and I’ll do it. He shan’t brave me. Go
2606: and fetch him.”
2607: 
2608: “Dunsey isn’t come back, sir.”
2609: 
2610: “What! did he break his own neck, then?” said the Squire, with some
2611: disgust at the idea that, in that case, he could not fulfil his threat.
2612: 
2613: “No, he wasn’t hurt, I believe, for the horse was found dead, and
2614: Dunsey must have walked off. I daresay we shall see him again
2615: by-and-by. I don’t know where he is.”
2616: 
2617: “And what must you be letting him have my money for? Answer me that,”
2618: said the Squire, attacking Godfrey again, since Dunsey was not within
2619: reach.
2620: 
2621: “Well, sir, I don’t know,” said Godfrey, hesitatingly. That was a
2622: feeble evasion, but Godfrey was not fond of lying, and, not being
2623: sufficiently aware that no sort of duplicity can long flourish without
2624: the help of vocal falsehoods, he was quite unprepared with invented
2625: motives.
2626: 
2627: “You don’t know? I tell you what it is, sir. You’ve been up to some
2628: trick, and you’ve been bribing him not to tell,” said the Squire, with
2629: a sudden acuteness which startled Godfrey, who felt his heart beat
2630: violently at the nearness of his father’s guess. The sudden alarm
2631: pushed him on to take the next step—a very slight impulse suffices for
2632: that on a downward road.
2633: 
2634: “Why, sir,” he said, trying to speak with careless ease, “it was a
2635: little affair between me and Dunsey; it’s no matter to anybody else.
2636: It’s hardly worth while to pry into young men’s fooleries: it wouldn’t
2637: have made any difference to you, sir, if I’d not had the bad luck to
2638: lose Wildfire. I should have paid you the money.”
2639: 
2640: “Fooleries! Pshaw! it’s time you’d done with fooleries. And I’d have
2641: you know, sir, you _must_ ha’ done with ’em,” said the Squire, frowning
2642: and casting an angry glance at his son. “Your goings-on are not what I
2643: shall find money for any longer. There’s my grandfather had his stables
2644: full o’ horses, and kept a good house, too, and in worse times, by what
2645: I can make out; and so might I, if I hadn’t four good-for-nothing
2646: fellows to hang on me like horse-leeches. I’ve been too good a father
2647: to you all—that’s what it is. But I shall pull up, sir.”
2648: 
2649: Godfrey was silent. He was not likely to be very penetrating in his
2650: judgments, but he had always had a sense that his father’s indulgence
2651: had not been kindness, and had had a vague longing for some discipline
2652: that would have checked his own errant weakness and helped his better
2653: will. The Squire ate his bread and meat hastily, took a deep draught of
2654: ale, then turned his chair from the table, and began to speak again.
2655: 
2656: “It’ll be all the worse for you, you know—you’d need try and help me
2657: keep things together.”
2658: 
2659: “Well, sir, I’ve often offered to take the management of things, but
2660: you know you’ve taken it ill always, and seemed to think I wanted to
2661: push you out of your place.”
2662: 
2663: “I know nothing o’ your offering or o’ my taking it ill,” said the
2664: Squire, whose memory consisted in certain strong impressions unmodified
2665: by detail; “but I know, one while you seemed to be thinking o’
2666: marrying, and I didn’t offer to put any obstacles in your way, as some
2667: fathers would. I’d as lieve you married Lammeter’s daughter as anybody.
2668: I suppose, if I’d said you nay, you’d ha’ kept on with it; but, for
2669: want o’ contradiction, you’ve changed your mind. You’re a shilly-shally
2670: fellow: you take after your poor mother. She never had a will of her
2671: own; a woman has no call for one, if she’s got a proper man for her
2672: husband. But _your_ wife had need have one, for you hardly know your
2673: own mind enough to make both your legs walk one way. The lass hasn’t
2674: said downright she won’t have you, has she?”
2675: 
2676: “No,” said Godfrey, feeling very hot and uncomfortable; “but I don’t
2677: think she will.”
2678: 
2679: “Think! why haven’t you the courage to ask her? Do you stick to it, you
2680: want to have _her_—that’s the thing?”
2681: 
2682: “There’s no other woman I want to marry,” said Godfrey, evasively.
2683: 
2684: “Well, then, let me make the offer for you, that’s all, if you haven’t
2685: the pluck to do it yourself. Lammeter isn’t likely to be loath for his
2686: daughter to marry into _my_ family, I should think. And as for the
2687: pretty lass, she wouldn’t have her cousin—and there’s nobody else, as I
2688: see, could ha’ stood in your way.”
2689: 
2690: “I’d rather let it be, please sir, at present,” said Godfrey, in alarm.
2691: “I think she’s a little offended with me just now, and I should like to
2692: speak for myself. A man must manage these things for himself.”
2693: 
2694: “Well, speak, then, and manage it, and see if you can’t turn over a new
2695: leaf. That’s what a man must do when he thinks o’ marrying.”
2696: 
2697: “I don’t see how I can think of it at present, sir. You wouldn’t like
2698: to settle me on one of the farms, I suppose, and I don’t think she’d
2699: come to live in this house with all my brothers. It’s a different sort
2700: of life to what she’s been used to.”
2701: 
2702: “Not come to live in this house? Don’t tell me. You ask her, that’s
2703: all,” said the Squire, with a short, scornful laugh.
2704: 
2705: “I’d rather let the thing be, at present, sir,” said Godfrey. “I hope
2706: you won’t try to hurry it on by saying anything.”
2707: 
2708: “I shall do what I choose,” said the Squire, “and I shall let you know
2709: I’m master; else you may turn out and find an estate to drop into
2710: somewhere else. Go out and tell Winthrop not to go to Cox’s, but wait
2711: for me. And tell ’em to get my horse saddled. And stop: look out and
2712: get that hack o’ Dunsey’s sold, and hand me the money, will you? He’ll
2713: keep no more hacks at my expense. And if you know where he’s sneaking—I
2714: daresay you do—you may tell him to spare himself the journey o’ coming
2715: back home. Let him turn ostler, and keep himself. He shan’t hang on me
2716: any more.”
2717: 
2718: “I don’t know where he is, sir; and if I did, it isn’t my place to tell
2719: him to keep away,” said Godfrey, moving towards the door.
2720: 
2721: “Confound it, sir, don’t stay arguing, but go and order my horse,” said
2722: the Squire, taking up a pipe.
2723: 
2724: Godfrey left the room, hardly knowing whether he were more relieved by
2725: the sense that the interview was ended without having made any change
2726: in his position, or more uneasy that he had entangled himself still
2727: further in prevarication and deceit. What had passed about his
2728: proposing to Nancy had raised a new alarm, lest by some after-dinner
2729: words of his father’s to Mr. Lammeter he should be thrown into the
2730: embarrassment of being obliged absolutely to decline her when she
2731: seemed to be within his reach. He fled to his usual refuge, that of
2732: hoping for some unforeseen turn of fortune, some favourable chance
2733: which would save him from unpleasant consequences—perhaps even justify
2734: his insincerity by manifesting its prudence. And in this point of
2735: trusting to some throw of fortune’s dice, Godfrey can hardly be called
2736: specially old-fashioned. Favourable Chance, I fancy, is the god of all
2737: men who follow their own devices instead of obeying a law they believe
2738: in. Let even a polished man of these days get into a position he is
2739: ashamed to avow, and his mind will be bent on all the possible issues
2740: that may deliver him from the calculable results of that position. Let
2741: him live outside his income, or shirk the resolute honest work that
2742: brings wages, and he will presently find himself dreaming of a possible
2743: benefactor, a possible simpleton who may be cajoled into using his
2744: interest, a possible state of mind in some possible person not yet
2745: forthcoming. Let him neglect the responsibilities of his office, and he
2746: will inevitably anchor himself on the chance that the thing left undone
2747: may turn out not to be of the supposed importance. Let him betray his
2748: friend’s confidence, and he will adore that same cunning complexity
2749: called Chance, which gives him the hope that his friend will never
2750: know. Let him forsake a decent craft that he may pursue the gentilities
2751: of a profession to which nature never called him, and his religion will
2752: infallibly be the worship of blessed Chance, which he will believe in
2753: as the mighty creator of success. The evil principle deprecated in that
2754: religion is the orderly sequence by which the seed brings forth a crop
2755: after its kind.
2756:

2758: 
2759: CHAPTER X.
2760: 
2761: Justice Malam was naturally regarded in Tarley and Raveloe as a man of
2762: capacious mind, seeing that he could draw much wider conclusions
2763: without evidence than could be expected of his neighbours who were not
2764: on the Commission of the Peace. Such a man was not likely to neglect
2765: the clue of the tinder-box, and an inquiry was set on foot concerning a
2766: pedlar, name unknown, with curly black hair and a foreign complexion,
2767: carrying a box of cutlery and jewellery, and wearing large rings in his
2768: ears. But either because inquiry was too slow-footed to overtake him,
2769: or because the description applied to so many pedlars that inquiry did
2770: not know how to choose among them, weeks passed away, and there was no
2771: other result concerning the robbery than a gradual cessation of the
2772: excitement it had caused in Raveloe. Dunstan Cass’s absence was hardly
2773: a subject of remark: he had once before had a quarrel with his father,
2774: and had gone off, nobody knew whither, to return at the end of six
2775: weeks, take up his old quarters unforbidden, and swagger as usual. His
2776: own family, who equally expected this issue, with the sole difference
2777: that the Squire was determined this time to forbid him the old
2778: quarters, never mentioned his absence; and when his uncle Kimble or Mr.
2779: Osgood noticed it, the story of his having killed Wildfire, and
2780: committed some offence against his father, was enough to prevent
2781: surprise. To connect the fact of Dunsey’s disappearance with that of
2782: the robbery occurring on the same day, lay quite away from the track of
2783: every one’s thought—even Godfrey’s, who had better reason than any one
2784: else to know what his brother was capable of. He remembered no mention
2785: of the weaver between them since the time, twelve years ago, when it
2786: was their boyish sport to deride him; and, besides, his imagination
2787: constantly created an _alibi_ for Dunstan: he saw him continually in
2788: some congenial haunt, to which he had walked off on leaving
2789: Wildfire—saw him sponging on chance acquaintances, and meditating a
2790: return home to the old amusement of tormenting his elder brother. Even
2791: if any brain in Raveloe had put the said two facts together, I doubt
2792: whether a combination so injurious to the prescriptive respectability
2793: of a family with a mural monument and venerable tankards, would not
2794: have been suppressed as of unsound tendency. But Christmas puddings,
2795: brawn, and abundance of spirituous liquors, throwing the mental
2796: originality into the channel of nightmare, are great preservatives
2797: against a dangerous spontaneity of waking thought.
2798: 
2799: When the robbery was talked of at the Rainbow and elsewhere, in good
2800: company, the balance continued to waver between the rational
2801: explanation founded on the tinder-box, and the theory of an
2802: impenetrable mystery that mocked investigation. The advocates of the
2803: tinder-box-and-pedlar view considered the other side a muddle-headed
2804: and credulous set, who, because they themselves were wall-eyed,
2805: supposed everybody else to have the same blank outlook; and the
2806: adherents of the inexplicable more than hinted that their antagonists
2807: were animals inclined to crow before they had found any corn—mere
2808: skimming-dishes in point of depth—whose clear-sightedness consisted in
2809: supposing there was nothing behind a barn-door because they couldn’t
2810: see through it; so that, though their controversy did not serve to
2811: elicit the fact concerning the robbery, it elicited some true opinions
2812: of collateral importance.
2813: 
2814: But while poor Silas’s loss served thus to brush the slow current of
2815: Raveloe conversation, Silas himself was feeling the withering
2816: desolation of that bereavement about which his neighbours were arguing
2817: at their ease. To any one who had observed him before he lost his gold,
2818: it might have seemed that so withered and shrunken a life as his could
2819: hardly be susceptible of a bruise, could hardly endure any subtraction
2820: but such as would put an end to it altogether. But in reality it had
2821: been an eager life, filled with immediate purpose which fenced him in
2822: from the wide, cheerless unknown. It had been a clinging life; and
2823: though the object round which its fibres had clung was a dead disrupted
2824: thing, it satisfied the need for clinging. But now the fence was broken
2825: down—the support was snatched away. Marner’s thoughts could no longer
2826: move in their old round, and were baffled by a blank like that which
2827: meets a plodding ant when the earth has broken away on its homeward
2828: path. The loom was there, and the weaving, and the growing pattern in
2829: the cloth; but the bright treasure in the hole under his feet was gone;
2830: the prospect of handling and counting it was gone: the evening had no
2831: phantasm of delight to still the poor soul’s craving. The thought of
2832: the money he would get by his actual work could bring no joy, for its
2833: meagre image was only a fresh reminder of his loss; and hope was too
2834: heavily crushed by the sudden blow for his imagination to dwell on the
2835: growth of a new hoard from that small beginning.
2836: 
2837: He filled up the blank with grief. As he sat weaving, he every now and
2838: then moaned low, like one in pain: it was the sign that his thoughts
2839: had come round again to the sudden chasm—to the empty evening-time. And
2840: all the evening, as he sat in his loneliness by his dull fire, he
2841: leaned his elbows on his knees, and clasped his head with his hands,
2842: and moaned very low—not as one who seeks to be heard.
2843: 
2844: And yet he was not utterly forsaken in his trouble. The repulsion
2845: Marner had always created in his neighbours was partly dissipated by
2846: the new light in which this misfortune had shown him. Instead of a man
2847: who had more cunning than honest folks could come by, and, what was
2848: worse, had not the inclination to use that cunning in a neighbourly
2849: way, it was now apparent that Silas had not cunning enough to keep his
2850: own. He was generally spoken of as a “poor mushed creatur”; and that
2851: avoidance of his neighbours, which had before been referred to his
2852: ill-will and to a probable addiction to worse company, was now
2853: considered mere craziness.
2854: 
2855: This change to a kindlier feeling was shown in various ways. The odour
2856: of Christmas cooking being on the wind, it was the season when
2857: superfluous pork and black puddings are suggestive of charity in
2858: well-to-do families; and Silas’s misfortune had brought him uppermost
2859: in the memory of housekeepers like Mrs. Osgood. Mr. Crackenthorp, too,
2860: while he admonished Silas that his money had probably been taken from
2861: him because he thought too much of it and never came to church,
2862: enforced the doctrine by a present of pigs’ pettitoes, well calculated
2863: to dissipate unfounded prejudices against the clerical character.
2864: Neighbours who had nothing but verbal consolation to give showed a
2865: disposition not only to greet Silas and discuss his misfortune at some
2866: length when they encountered him in the village, but also to take the
2867: trouble of calling at his cottage and getting him to repeat all the
2868: details on the very spot; and then they would try to cheer him by
2869: saying, “Well, Master Marner, you’re no worse off nor other poor folks,
2870: after all; and if you was to be crippled, the parish ’ud give you a
2871: ’lowance.”
2872: 
2873: I suppose one reason why we are seldom able to comfort our neighbours
2874: with our words is that our goodwill gets adulterated, in spite of
2875: ourselves, before it can pass our lips. We can send black puddings and
2876: pettitoes without giving them a flavour of our own egoism; but language
2877: is a stream that is almost sure to smack of a mingled soil. There was a
2878: fair proportion of kindness in Raveloe; but it was often of a beery and
2879: bungling sort, and took the shape least allied to the complimentary and
2880: hypocritical.
2881: 
2882: Mr. Macey, for example, coming one evening expressly to let Silas know
2883: that recent events had given him the advantage of standing more
2884: favourably in the opinion of a man whose judgment was not formed
2885: lightly, opened the conversation by saying, as soon as he had seated
2886: himself and adjusted his thumbs—
2887: 
2888: “Come, Master Marner, why, you’ve no call to sit a-moaning. You’re a
2889: deal better off to ha’ lost your money, nor to ha’ kep it by foul
2890: means. I used to think, when you first come into these parts, as you
2891: were no better nor you should be; you were younger a deal than what you
2892: are now; but you were allays a staring, white-faced creatur, partly
2893: like a bald-faced calf, as I may say. But there’s no knowing: it isn’t
2894: every queer-looksed thing as Old Harry’s had the making of—I mean,
2895: speaking o’ toads and such; for they’re often harmless, like, and
2896: useful against varmin. And it’s pretty much the same wi’ you, as fur as
2897: I can see. Though as to the yarbs and stuff to cure the breathing, if
2898: you brought that sort o’ knowledge from distant parts, you might ha’
2899: been a bit freer of it. And if the knowledge wasn’t well come by, why,
2900: you might ha’ made up for it by coming to church reg’lar; for, as for
2901: the children as the Wise Woman charmed, I’ve been at the christening of
2902: ’em again and again, and they took the water just as well. And that’s
2903: reasonable; for if Old Harry’s a mind to do a bit o’ kindness for a
2904: holiday, like, who’s got anything against it? That’s my thinking; and
2905: I’ve been clerk o’ this parish forty year, and I know, when the parson
2906: and me does the cussing of a Ash Wednesday, there’s no cussing o’ folks
2907: as have a mind to be cured without a doctor, let Kimble say what he
2908: will. And so, Master Marner, as I was saying—for there’s windings i’
2909: things as they may carry you to the fur end o’ the prayer-book afore
2910: you get back to ’em—my advice is, as you keep up your sperrits; for as
2911: for thinking you’re a deep un, and ha’ got more inside you nor ’ull
2912: bear daylight, I’m not o’ that opinion at all, and so I tell the
2913: neighbours. For, says I, you talk o’ Master Marner making out a
2914: tale—why, it’s nonsense, that is: it ’ud take a ’cute man to make a
2915: tale like that; and, says I, he looked as scared as a rabbit.”
2916: 
2917: During this discursive address Silas had continued motionless in his
2918: previous attitude, leaning his elbows on his knees, and pressing his
2919: hands against his head. Mr. Macey, not doubting that he had been
2920: listened to, paused, in the expectation of some appreciatory reply, but
2921: Marner remained silent. He had a sense that the old man meant to be
2922: good-natured and neighbourly; but the kindness fell on him as sunshine
2923: falls on the wretched—he had no heart to taste it, and felt that it was
2924: very far off him.
2925: 
2926: “Come, Master Marner, have you got nothing to say to that?” said Mr.
2927: Macey at last, with a slight accent of impatience.
2928: 
2929: “Oh,” said Marner, slowly, shaking his head between his hands, “I thank
2930: you—thank you—kindly.”
2931: 
2932: “Aye, aye, to be sure: I thought you would,” said Mr. Macey; “and my
2933: advice is—have you got a Sunday suit?”
2934: 
2935: “No,” said Marner.
2936: 
2937: “I doubted it was so,” said Mr. Macey. “Now, let me advise you to get a
2938: Sunday suit: there’s Tookey, he’s a poor creatur, but he’s got my
2939: tailoring business, and some o’ my money in it, and he shall make a
2940: suit at a low price, and give you trust, and then you can come to
2941: church, and be a bit neighbourly. Why, you’ve never heared me say
2942: “Amen” since you come into these parts, and I recommend you to lose no
2943: time, for it’ll be poor work when Tookey has it all to himself, for I
2944: mayn’t be equil to stand i’ the desk at all, come another winter.” Here
2945: Mr. Macey paused, perhaps expecting some sign of emotion in his hearer;
2946: but not observing any, he went on. “And as for the money for the suit
2947: o’ clothes, why, you get a matter of a pound a-week at your weaving,
2948: Master Marner, and you’re a young man, eh, for all you look so mushed.
2949: Why, you couldn’t ha’ been five-and-twenty when you come into these
2950: parts, eh?”
2951: 
2952: Silas started a little at the change to a questioning tone, and
2953: answered mildly, “I don’t know; I can’t rightly say—it’s a long while
2954: since.”
2955: 
2956: After receiving such an answer as this, it is not surprising that Mr.
2957: Macey observed, later on in the evening at the Rainbow, that Marner’s
2958: head was “all of a muddle”, and that it was to be doubted if he ever
2959: knew when Sunday came round, which showed him a worse heathen than many
2960: a dog.
2961: 
2962: Another of Silas’s comforters, besides Mr. Macey, came to him with a
2963: mind highly charged on the same topic. This was Mrs. Winthrop, the
2964: wheelwright’s wife. The inhabitants of Raveloe were not severely
2965: regular in their church-going, and perhaps there was hardly a person in
2966: the parish who would not have held that to go to church every Sunday in
2967: the calendar would have shown a greedy desire to stand well with
2968: Heaven, and get an undue advantage over their neighbours—a wish to be
2969: better than the “common run”, that would have implied a reflection on
2970: those who had had godfathers and godmothers as well as themselves, and
2971: had an equal right to the burying-service. At the same time, it was
2972: understood to be requisite for all who were not household servants, or
2973: young men, to take the sacrament at one of the great festivals: Squire
2974: Cass himself took it on Christmas-day; while those who were held to be
2975: “good livers” went to church with greater, though still with moderate,
2976: frequency.
2977: 
2978: Mrs. Winthrop was one of these: she was in all respects a woman of
2979: scrupulous conscience, so eager for duties that life seemed to offer
2980: them too scantily unless she rose at half-past four, though this threw
2981: a scarcity of work over the more advanced hours of the morning, which
2982: it was a constant problem with her to remove. Yet she had not the
2983: vixenish temper which is sometimes supposed to be a necessary condition
2984: of such habits: she was a very mild, patient woman, whose nature it was
2985: to seek out all the sadder and more serious elements of life, and
2986: pasture her mind upon them. She was the person always first thought of
2987: in Raveloe when there was illness or death in a family, when leeches
2988: were to be applied, or there was a sudden disappointment in a monthly
2989: nurse. She was a “comfortable woman”—good-looking, fresh-complexioned,
2990: having her lips always slightly screwed, as if she felt herself in a
2991: sick-room with the doctor or the clergyman present. But she was never
2992: whimpering; no one had seen her shed tears; she was simply grave and
2993: inclined to shake her head and sigh, almost imperceptibly, like a
2994: funereal mourner who is not a relation. It seemed surprising that Ben
2995: Winthrop, who loved his quart-pot and his joke, got along so well with
2996: Dolly; but she took her husband’s jokes and joviality as patiently as
2997: everything else, considering that “men _would_ be so”, and viewing the
2998: stronger sex in the light of animals whom it had pleased Heaven to make
2999: naturally troublesome, like bulls and turkey-cocks.
3000: 
3001: This good wholesome woman could hardly fail to have her mind drawn
3002: strongly towards Silas Marner, now that he appeared in the light of a
3003: sufferer; and one Sunday afternoon she took her little boy Aaron with
3004: her, and went to call on Silas, carrying in her hand some small
3005: lard-cakes, flat paste-like articles much esteemed in Raveloe. Aaron,
3006: an apple-cheeked youngster of seven, with a clean starched frill which
3007: looked like a plate for the apples, needed all his adventurous
3008: curiosity to embolden him against the possibility that the big-eyed
3009: weaver might do him some bodily injury; and his dubiety was much
3010: increased when, on arriving at the Stone-pits, they heard the
3011: mysterious sound of the loom.
3012: 
3013: “Ah, it is as I thought,” said Mrs. Winthrop, sadly.
3014: 
3015: They had to knock loudly before Silas heard them; but when he did come
3016: to the door he showed no impatience, as he would once have done, at a
3017: visit that had been unasked for and unexpected. Formerly, his heart had
3018: been as a locked casket with its treasure inside; but now the casket
3019: was empty, and the lock was broken. Left groping in darkness, with his
3020: prop utterly gone, Silas had inevitably a sense, though a dull and
3021: half-despairing one, that if any help came to him it must come from
3022: without; and there was a slight stirring of expectation at the sight of
3023: his fellow-men, a faint consciousness of dependence on their goodwill.
3024: He opened the door wide to admit Dolly, but without otherwise returning
3025: her greeting than by moving the armchair a few inches as a sign that
3026: she was to sit down in it. Dolly, as soon as she was seated, removed
3027: the white cloth that covered her lard-cakes, and said in her gravest
3028: way—
3029: 
3030: “I’d a baking yisterday, Master Marner, and the lard-cakes turned out
3031: better nor common, and I’d ha’ asked you to accept some, if you’d
3032: thought well. I don’t eat such things myself, for a bit o’ bread’s what
3033: I like from one year’s end to the other; but men’s stomichs are made so
3034: comical, they want a change—they do, I know, God help ’em.”
3035: 
3036: Dolly sighed gently as she held out the cakes to Silas, who thanked her
3037: kindly and looked very close at them, absently, being accustomed to
3038: look so at everything he took into his hand—eyed all the while by the
3039: wondering bright orbs of the small Aaron, who had made an outwork of
3040: his mother’s chair, and was peeping round from behind it.
3041: 
3042: “There’s letters pricked on ’em,” said Dolly. “I can’t read ’em myself,
3043: and there’s nobody, not Mr. Macey himself, rightly knows what they
3044: mean; but they’ve a good meaning, for they’re the same as is on the
3045: pulpit-cloth at church. What are they, Aaron, my dear?”
3046: 
3047: Aaron retreated completely behind his outwork.
3048: 
3049: “Oh, go, that’s naughty,” said his mother, mildly. “Well, whativer the
3050: letters are, they’ve a good meaning; and it’s a stamp as has been in
3051: our house, Ben says, ever since he was a little un, and his mother used
3052: to put it on the cakes, and I’ve allays put it on too; for if there’s
3053: any good, we’ve need of it i’ this world.”
3054: 
3055: “It’s I. H. S.,” said Silas, at which proof of learning Aaron peeped
3056: round the chair again.
3057: 
3058: “Well, to be sure, you can read ’em off,” said Dolly. “Ben’s read ’em
3059: to me many and many a time, but they slip out o’ my mind again; the
3060: more’s the pity, for they’re good letters, else they wouldn’t be in the
3061: church; and so I prick ’em on all the loaves and all the cakes, though
3062: sometimes they won’t hold, because o’ the rising—for, as I said, if
3063: there’s any good to be got we’ve need of it i’ this world—that we have;
3064: and I hope they’ll bring good to you, Master Marner, for it’s wi’ that
3065: will I brought you the cakes; and you see the letters have held better
3066: nor common.”
3067: 
3068: Silas was as unable to interpret the letters as Dolly, but there was no
3069: possibility of misunderstanding the desire to give comfort that made
3070: itself heard in her quiet tones. He said, with more feeling than
3071: before—“Thank you—thank you kindly.” But he laid down the cakes and
3072: seated himself absently—drearily unconscious of any distinct benefit
3073: towards which the cakes and the letters, or even Dolly’s kindness,
3074: could tend for him.
3075: 
3076: “Ah, if there’s good anywhere, we’ve need of it,” repeated Dolly, who
3077: did not lightly forsake a serviceable phrase. She looked at Silas
3078: pityingly as she went on. “But you didn’t hear the church-bells this
3079: morning, Master Marner? I doubt you didn’t know it was Sunday. Living
3080: so lone here, you lose your count, I daresay; and then, when your loom
3081: makes a noise, you can’t hear the bells, more partic’lar now the frost
3082: kills the sound.”
3083: 
3084: “Yes, I did; I heard ’em,” said Silas, to whom Sunday bells were a mere
3085: accident of the day, and not part of its sacredness. There had been no
3086: bells in Lantern Yard.
3087: 
3088: “Dear heart!” said Dolly, pausing before she spoke again. “But what a
3089: pity it is you should work of a Sunday, and not clean yourself—if you
3090: _didn’t_ go to church; for if you’d a roasting bit, it might be as you
3091: couldn’t leave it, being a lone man. But there’s the bakehus, if you
3092: could make up your mind to spend a twopence on the oven now and
3093: then,—not every week, in course—I shouldn’t like to do that myself,—you
3094: might carry your bit o’ dinner there, for it’s nothing but right to
3095: have a bit o’ summat hot of a Sunday, and not to make it as you can’t
3096: know your dinner from Saturday. But now, upo’ Christmas-day, this
3097: blessed Christmas as is ever coming, if you was to take your dinner to
3098: the bakehus, and go to church, and see the holly and the yew, and hear
3099: the anthim, and then take the sacramen’, you’d be a deal the better,
3100: and you’d know which end you stood on, and you could put your trust i’
3101: Them as knows better nor we do, seein’ you’d ha’ done what it lies on
3102: us all to do.”
3103: 
3104: Dolly’s exhortation, which was an unusually long effort of speech for
3105: her, was uttered in the soothing persuasive tone with which she would
3106: have tried to prevail on a sick man to take his medicine, or a basin of
3107: gruel for which he had no appetite. Silas had never before been closely
3108: urged on the point of his absence from church, which had only been
3109: thought of as a part of his general queerness; and he was too direct
3110: and simple to evade Dolly’s appeal.
3111: 
3112: “Nay, nay,” he said, “I know nothing o’ church. I’ve never been to
3113: church.”
3114: 
3115: “No!” said Dolly, in a low tone of wonderment. Then bethinking herself
3116: of Silas’s advent from an unknown country, she said, “Could it ha’ been
3117: as they’d no church where you was born?”
3118: 
3119: “Oh, yes,” said Silas, meditatively, sitting in his usual posture of
3120: leaning on his knees, and supporting his head. “There was churches—a
3121: many—it was a big town. But I knew nothing of ’em—I went to chapel.”
3122: 
3123: Dolly was much puzzled at this new word, but she was rather afraid of
3124: inquiring further, lest “chapel” might mean some haunt of wickedness.
3125: After a little thought, she said—
3126: 
3127: “Well, Master Marner, it’s niver too late to turn over a new leaf, and
3128: if you’ve niver had no church, there’s no telling the good it’ll do
3129: you. For I feel so set up and comfortable as niver was, when I’ve been
3130: and heard the prayers, and the singing to the praise and glory o’ God,
3131: as Mr. Macey gives out—and Mr. Crackenthorp saying good words, and more
3132: partic’lar on Sacramen’ Day; and if a bit o’ trouble comes, I feel as I
3133: can put up wi’ it, for I’ve looked for help i’ the right quarter, and
3134: gev myself up to Them as we must all give ourselves up to at the last;
3135: and if we’n done our part, it isn’t to be believed as Them as are above
3136: us ’ull be worse nor we are, and come short o’ Their’n.”
3137: 
3138: Poor Dolly’s exposition of her simple Raveloe theology fell rather
3139: unmeaningly on Silas’s ears, for there was no word in it that could
3140: rouse a memory of what he had known as religion, and his comprehension
3141: was quite baffled by the plural pronoun, which was no heresy of
3142: Dolly’s, but only her way of avoiding a presumptuous familiarity. He
3143: remained silent, not feeling inclined to assent to the part of Dolly’s
3144: speech which he fully understood—her recommendation that he should go
3145: to church. Indeed, Silas was so unaccustomed to talk beyond the brief
3146: questions and answers necessary for the transaction of his simple
3147: business, that words did not easily come to him without the urgency of
3148: a distinct purpose.
3149: 
3150: But now, little Aaron, having become used to the weaver’s awful
3151: presence, had advanced to his mother’s side, and Silas, seeming to
3152: notice him for the first time, tried to return Dolly’s signs of
3153: good-will by offering the lad a bit of lard-cake. Aaron shrank back a
3154: little, and rubbed his head against his mother’s shoulder, but still
3155: thought the piece of cake worth the risk of putting his hand out for
3156: it.
3157: 
3158: “Oh, for shame, Aaron,” said his mother, taking him on her lap,
3159: however; “why, you don’t want cake again yet awhile. He’s wonderful
3160: hearty,” she went on, with a little sigh—“that he is, God knows. He’s
3161: my youngest, and we spoil him sadly, for either me or the father must
3162: allays hev him in our sight—that we must.”
3163: 
3164: She stroked Aaron’s brown head, and thought it must do Master Marner
3165: good to see such a “pictur of a child”. But Marner, on the other side
3166: of the hearth, saw the neat-featured rosy face as a mere dim round,
3167: with two dark spots in it.
3168: 
3169: “And he’s got a voice like a bird—you wouldn’t think,” Dolly went on;
3170: “he can sing a Christmas carril as his father’s taught him; and I take
3171: it for a token as he’ll come to good, as he can learn the good tunes so
3172: quick. Come, Aaron, stan’ up and sing the carril to Master Marner,
3173: come.”
3174: 
3175: Aaron replied by rubbing his forehead against his mother’s shoulder.
3176: 
3177: “Oh, that’s naughty,” said Dolly, gently. “Stan’ up, when mother tells
3178: you, and let me hold the cake till you’ve done.”
3179: 
3180: Aaron was not indisposed to display his talents, even to an ogre, under
3181: protecting circumstances; and after a few more signs of coyness,
3182: consisting chiefly in rubbing the backs of his hands over his eyes, and
3183: then peeping between them at Master Marner, to see if he looked anxious
3184: for the “carril”, he at length allowed his head to be duly adjusted,
3185: and standing behind the table, which let him appear above it only as
3186: far as his broad frill, so that he looked like a cherubic head
3187: untroubled with a body, he began with a clear chirp, and in a melody
3188: that had the rhythm of an industrious hammer
3189: 
3190: “God rest you, merry gentlemen,
3191: Let nothing you dismay,
3192: For Jesus Christ our Savior
3193: Was born on Christmas-day.”
3194: 
3195: 
3196: Dolly listened with a devout look, glancing at Marner in some
3197: confidence that this strain would help to allure him to church.
3198: 
3199: “That’s Christmas music,” she said, when Aaron had ended, and had
3200: secured his piece of cake again. “There’s no other music equil to the
3201: Christmas music—“Hark the erol angils sing.” And you may judge what it
3202: is at church, Master Marner, with the bassoon and the voices, as you
3203: can’t help thinking you’ve got to a better place a’ready—for I wouldn’t
3204: speak ill o’ this world, seeing as Them put us in it as knows best—but
3205: what wi’ the drink, and the quarrelling, and the bad illnesses, and the
3206: hard dying, as I’ve seen times and times, one’s thankful to hear of a
3207: better. The boy sings pretty, don’t he, Master Marner?”
3208: 
3209: “Yes,” said Silas, absently, “very pretty.”
3210: 
3211: The Christmas carol, with its hammer-like rhythm, had fallen on his
3212: ears as strange music, quite unlike a hymn, and could have none of the
3213: effect Dolly contemplated. But he wanted to show her that he was
3214: grateful, and the only mode that occurred to him was to offer Aaron a
3215: bit more cake.
3216: 
3217: “Oh, no, thank you, Master Marner,” said Dolly, holding down Aaron’s
3218: willing hands. “We must be going home now. And so I wish you good-bye,
3219: Master Marner; and if you ever feel anyways bad in your inside, as you
3220: can’t fend for yourself, I’ll come and clean up for you, and get you a
3221: bit o’ victual, and willing. But I beg and pray of you to leave off
3222: weaving of a Sunday, for it’s bad for soul and body—and the money as
3223: comes i’ that way ’ull be a bad bed to lie down on at the last, if it
3224: doesn’t fly away, nobody knows where, like the white frost. And you’ll
3225: excuse me being that free with you, Master Marner, for I wish you
3226: well—I do. Make your bow, Aaron.”
3227: 
3228: Silas said “Good-bye, and thank you kindly,” as he opened the door for
3229: Dolly, but he couldn’t help feeling relieved when she was gone—relieved
3230: that he might weave again and moan at his ease. Her simple view of life
3231: and its comforts, by which she had tried to cheer him, was only like a
3232: report of unknown objects, which his imagination could not fashion. The
3233: fountains of human love and of faith in a divine love had not yet been
3234: unlocked, and his soul was still the shrunken rivulet, with only this
3235: difference, that its little groove of sand was blocked up, and it
3236: wandered confusedly against dark obstruction.
3237: 
3238: And so, notwithstanding the honest persuasions of Mr. Macey and Dolly
3239: Winthrop, Silas spent his Christmas-day in loneliness, eating his meat
3240: in sadness of heart, though the meat had come to him as a neighbourly
3241: present. In the morning he looked out on the black frost that seemed to
3242: press cruelly on every blade of grass, while the half-icy red pool
3243: shivered under the bitter wind; but towards evening the snow began to
3244: fall, and curtained from him even that dreary outlook, shutting him
3245: close up with his narrow grief. And he sat in his robbed home through
3246: the livelong evening, not caring to close his shutters or lock his
3247: door, pressing his head between his hands and moaning, till the cold
3248: grasped him and told him that his fire was grey.
3249: 
3250: Nobody in this world but himself knew that he was the same Silas Marner
3251: who had once loved his fellow with tender love, and trusted in an
3252: unseen goodness. Even to himself that past experience had become dim.
3253: 
3254: But in Raveloe village the bells rang merrily, and the church was
3255: fuller than all through the rest of the year, with red faces among the
3256: abundant dark-green boughs—faces prepared for a longer service than
3257: usual by an odorous breakfast of toast and ale. Those green boughs, the
3258: hymn and anthem never heard but at Christmas—even the Athanasian Creed,
3259: which was discriminated from the others only as being longer and of
3260: exceptional virtue, since it was only read on rare occasions—brought a
3261: vague exulting sense, for which the grown men could as little have
3262: found words as the children, that something great and mysterious had
3263: been done for them in heaven above and in earth below, which they were
3264: appropriating by their presence. And then the red faces made their way
3265: through the black biting frost to their own homes, feeling themselves
3266: free for the rest of the day to eat, drink, and be merry, and using
3267: that Christian freedom without diffidence.
3268: 
3269: At Squire Cass’s family party that day nobody mentioned Dunstan—nobody
3270: was sorry for his absence, or feared it would be too long. The doctor
3271: and his wife, uncle and aunt Kimble, were there, and the annual
3272: Christmas talk was carried through without any omissions, rising to the
3273: climax of Mr. Kimble’s experience when he walked the London hospitals
3274: thirty years back, together with striking professional anecdotes then
3275: gathered. Whereupon cards followed, with aunt Kimble’s annual failure
3276: to follow suit, and uncle Kimble’s irascibility concerning the odd
3277: trick which was rarely explicable to him, when it was not on his side,
3278: without a general visitation of tricks to see that they were formed on
3279: sound principles: the whole being accompanied by a strong steaming
3280: odour of spirits-and-water.
3281: 
3282: But the party on Christmas-day, being a strictly family party, was not
3283: the pre-eminently brilliant celebration of the season at the Red House.
3284: It was the great dance on New Year’s Eve that made the glory of Squire
3285: Cass’s hospitality, as of his forefathers’, time out of mind. This was
3286: the occasion when all the society of Raveloe and Tarley, whether old
3287: acquaintances separated by long rutty distances, or cooled
3288: acquaintances separated by misunderstandings concerning runaway calves,
3289: or acquaintances founded on intermittent condescension, counted on
3290: meeting and on comporting themselves with mutual appropriateness. This
3291: was the occasion on which fair dames who came on pillions sent their
3292: bandboxes before them, supplied with more than their evening costume;
3293: for the feast was not to end with a single evening, like a paltry town
3294: entertainment, where the whole supply of eatables is put on the table
3295: at once, and bedding is scanty. The Red House was provisioned as if for
3296: a siege; and as for the spare feather-beds ready to be laid on floors,
3297: they were as plentiful as might naturally be expected in a family that
3298: had killed its own geese for many generations.
3299: 
3300: Godfrey Cass was looking forward to this New Year’s Eve with a foolish
3301: reckless longing, that made him half deaf to his importunate companion,
3302: Anxiety.
3303: 
3304: “Dunsey will be coming home soon: there will be a great blow-up, and
3305: how will you bribe his spite to silence?” said Anxiety.
3306: 
3307: “Oh, he won’t come home before New Year’s Eve, perhaps,” said Godfrey;
3308: “and I shall sit by Nancy then, and dance with her, and get a kind look
3309: from her in spite of herself.”
3310: 
3311: “But money is wanted in another quarter,” said Anxiety, in a louder
3312: voice, “and how will you get it without selling your mother’s diamond
3313: pin? And if you don’t get it...?”
3314: 
3315: “Well, but something may happen to make things easier. At any rate,
3316: there’s one pleasure for me close at hand: Nancy is coming.”
3317: 
3318: “Yes, and suppose your father should bring matters to a pass that will
3319: oblige you to decline marrying her—and to give your reasons?”
3320: 
3321: “Hold your tongue, and don’t worry me. I can see Nancy’s eyes, just as
3322: they will look at me, and feel her hand in mine already.”
3323: 
3324: But Anxiety went on, though in noisy Christmas company; refusing to be
3325: utterly quieted even by much drinking.
3326: 
3327: 
3328: 
3329: CHAPTER XI.
3330: 
3331: Some women, I grant, would not appear to advantage seated on a pillion,
3332: and attired in a drab joseph and a drab beaver-bonnet, with a crown
3333: resembling a small stew-pan; for a garment suggesting a coachman’s
3334: greatcoat, cut out under an exiguity of cloth that would only allow of
3335: miniature capes, is not well adapted to conceal deficiencies of
3336: contour, nor is drab a colour that will throw sallow cheeks into lively
3337: contrast. It was all the greater triumph to Miss Nancy Lammeter’s
3338: beauty that she looked thoroughly bewitching in that costume, as,
3339: seated on the pillion behind her tall, erect father, she held one arm
3340: round him, and looked down, with open-eyed anxiety, at the treacherous
3341: snow-covered pools and puddles, which sent up formidable splashings of
3342: mud under the stamp of Dobbin’s foot. A painter would, perhaps, have
3343: preferred her in those moments when she was free from
3344: self-consciousness; but certainly the bloom on her cheeks was at its
3345: highest point of contrast with the surrounding drab when she arrived at
3346: the door of the Red House, and saw Mr. Godfrey Cass ready to lift her
3347: from the pillion. She wished her sister Priscilla had come up at the
3348: same time behind the servant, for then she would have contrived that
3349: Mr. Godfrey should have lifted off Priscilla first, and, in the
3350: meantime, she would have persuaded her father to go round to the
3351: horse-block instead of alighting at the door-steps. It was very
3352: painful, when you had made it quite clear to a young man that you were
3353: determined not to marry him, however much he might wish it, that he
3354: would still continue to pay you marked attentions; besides, why didn’t
3355: he always show the same attentions, if he meant them sincerely, instead
3356: of being so strange as Mr. Godfrey Cass was, sometimes behaving as if
3357: he didn’t want to speak to her, and taking no notice of her for weeks
3358: and weeks, and then, all on a sudden, almost making love again?
3359: Moreover, it was quite plain he had no real love for her, else he would
3360: not let people have _that_ to say of him which they did say. Did he
3361: suppose that Miss Nancy Lammeter was to be won by any man, squire or no
3362: squire, who led a bad life? That was not what she had been used to see
3363: in her own father, who was the soberest and best man in that
3364: country-side, only a little hot and hasty now and then, if things were
3365: not done to the minute.
3366: 
3367: All these thoughts rushed through Miss Nancy’s mind, in their habitual
3368: succession, in the moments between her first sight of Mr. Godfrey Cass
3369: standing at the door and her own arrival there. Happily, the Squire
3370: came out too and gave a loud greeting to her father, so that, somehow,
3371: under cover of this noise she seemed to find concealment for her
3372: confusion and neglect of any suitably formal behaviour, while she was
3373: being lifted from the pillion by strong arms which seemed to find her
3374: ridiculously small and light. And there was the best reason for
3375: hastening into the house at once, since the snow was beginning to fall
3376: again, threatening an unpleasant journey for such guests as were still
3377: on the road. These were a small minority; for already the afternoon was
3378: beginning to decline, and there would not be too much time for the
3379: ladies who came from a distance to attire themselves in readiness for
3380: the early tea which was to inspirit them for the dance.
3381: 
3382: There was a buzz of voices through the house, as Miss Nancy entered,
3383: mingled with the scrape of a fiddle preluding in the kitchen; but the
3384: Lammeters were guests whose arrival had evidently been thought of so
3385: much that it had been watched for from the windows, for Mrs. Kimble,
3386: who did the honours at the Red House on these great occasions, came
3387: forward to meet Miss Nancy in the hall, and conduct her up-stairs. Mrs.
3388: Kimble was the Squire’s sister, as well as the doctor’s wife—a double
3389: dignity, with which her diameter was in direct proportion; so that, a
3390: journey up-stairs being rather fatiguing to her, she did not oppose
3391: Miss Nancy’s request to be allowed to find her way alone to the Blue
3392: Room, where the Miss Lammeters’ bandboxes had been deposited on their
3393: arrival in the morning.
3394: 
3395: There was hardly a bedroom in the house where feminine compliments were
3396: not passing and feminine toilettes going forward, in various stages, in
3397: space made scanty by extra beds spread upon the floor; and Miss Nancy,
3398: as she entered the Blue Room, had to make her little formal curtsy to a
3399: group of six. On the one hand, there were ladies no less important than
3400: the two Miss Gunns, the wine merchant’s daughters from Lytherly,
3401: dressed in the height of fashion, with the tightest skirts and the
3402: shortest waists, and gazed at by Miss Ladbrook (of the Old Pastures)
3403: with a shyness not unsustained by inward criticism. Partly, Miss
3404: Ladbrook felt that her own skirt must be regarded as unduly lax by the
3405: Miss Gunns, and partly, that it was a pity the Miss Gunns did not show
3406: that judgment which she herself would show if she were in their place,
3407: by stopping a little on this side of the fashion. On the other hand,
3408: Mrs. Ladbrook was standing in skull-cap and front, with her turban in
3409: her hand, curtsying and smiling blandly and saying, “After you, ma’am,”
3410: to another lady in similar circumstances, who had politely offered the
3411: precedence at the looking-glass.
3412: 
3413: But Miss Nancy had no sooner made her curtsy than an elderly lady came
3414: forward, whose full white muslin kerchief, and mob-cap round her curls
3415: of smooth grey hair, were in daring contrast with the puffed yellow
3416: satins and top-knotted caps of her neighbours. She approached Miss
3417: Nancy with much primness, and said, with a slow, treble suavity—
3418: 
3419: “Niece, I hope I see you well in health.” Miss Nancy kissed her aunt’s
3420: cheek dutifully, and answered, with the same sort of amiable primness,
3421: “Quite well, I thank you, aunt; and I hope I see you the same.”
3422: 
3423: “Thank you, niece; I keep my health for the present. And how is my
3424: brother-in-law?”
3425: 
3426: These dutiful questions and answers were continued until it was
3427: ascertained in detail that the Lammeters were all as well as usual, and
3428: the Osgoods likewise, also that niece Priscilla must certainly arrive
3429: shortly, and that travelling on pillions in snowy weather was
3430: unpleasant, though a joseph was a great protection. Then Nancy was
3431: formally introduced to her aunt’s visitors, the Miss Gunns, as being
3432: the daughters of a mother known to _their_ mother, though now for the
3433: first time induced to make a journey into these parts; and these ladies
3434: were so taken by surprise at finding such a lovely face and figure in
3435: an out-of-the-way country place, that they began to feel some curiosity
3436: about the dress she would put on when she took off her joseph. Miss
3437: Nancy, whose thoughts were always conducted with the propriety and
3438: moderation conspicuous in her manners, remarked to herself that the
3439: Miss Gunns were rather hard-featured than otherwise, and that such very
3440: low dresses as they wore might have been attributed to vanity if their
3441: shoulders had been pretty, but that, being as they were, it was not
3442: reasonable to suppose that they showed their necks from a love of
3443: display, but rather from some obligation not inconsistent with sense
3444: and modesty. She felt convinced, as she opened her box, that this must
3445: be her aunt Osgood’s opinion, for Miss Nancy’s mind resembled her
3446: aunt’s to a degree that everybody said was surprising, considering the
3447: kinship was on Mr. Osgood’s side; and though you might not have
3448: supposed it from the formality of their greeting, there was a devoted
3449: attachment and mutual admiration between aunt and niece. Even Miss
3450: Nancy’s refusal of her cousin Gilbert Osgood (on the ground solely that
3451: he was her cousin), though it had grieved her aunt greatly, had not in
3452: the least cooled the preference which had determined her to leave Nancy
3453: several of her hereditary ornaments, let Gilbert’s future wife be whom
3454: she might.
3455: 
3456: Three of the ladies quickly retired, but the Miss Gunns were quite
3457: content that Mrs. Osgood’s inclination to remain with her niece gave
3458: them also a reason for staying to see the rustic beauty’s toilette. And
3459: it was really a pleasure—from the first opening of the bandbox, where
3460: everything smelt of lavender and rose-leaves, to the clasping of the
3461: small coral necklace that fitted closely round her little white neck.
3462: Everything belonging to Miss Nancy was of delicate purity and
3463: nattiness: not a crease was where it had no business to be, not a bit
3464: of her linen professed whiteness without fulfilling its profession; the
3465: very pins on her pincushion were stuck in after a pattern from which
3466: she was careful to allow no aberration; and as for her own person, it
3467: gave the same idea of perfect unvarying neatness as the body of a
3468: little bird. It is true that her light-brown hair was cropped behind
3469: like a boy’s, and was dressed in front in a number of flat rings, that
3470: lay quite away from her face; but there was no sort of coiffure that
3471: could make Miss Nancy’s cheek and neck look otherwise than pretty; and
3472: when at last she stood complete in her silvery twilled silk, her lace
3473: tucker, her coral necklace, and coral ear-drops, the Miss Gunns could
3474: see nothing to criticise except her hands, which bore the traces of
3475: butter-making, cheese-crushing, and even still coarser work. But Miss
3476: Nancy was not ashamed of that, for even while she was dressing she
3477: narrated to her aunt how she and Priscilla had packed their boxes
3478: yesterday, because this morning was baking morning, and since they were
3479: leaving home, it was desirable to make a good supply of meat-pies for
3480: the kitchen; and as she concluded this judicious remark, she turned to
3481: the Miss Gunns that she might not commit the rudeness of not including
3482: them in the conversation. The Miss Gunns smiled stiffly, and thought
3483: what a pity it was that these rich country people, who could afford to
3484: buy such good clothes (really Miss Nancy’s lace and silk were very
3485: costly), should be brought up in utter ignorance and vulgarity. She
3486: actually said “mate” for “meat”, “’appen” for “perhaps”, and “oss” for
3487: “horse”, which, to young ladies living in good Lytherly society, who
3488: habitually said ’orse, even in domestic privacy, and only said ’appen
3489: on the right occasions, was necessarily shocking. Miss Nancy, indeed,
3490: had never been to any school higher than Dame Tedman’s: her
3491: acquaintance with profane literature hardly went beyond the rhymes she
3492: had worked in her large sampler under the lamb and the shepherdess; and
3493: in order to balance an account, she was obliged to effect her
3494: subtraction by removing visible metallic shillings and sixpences from a
3495: visible metallic total. There is hardly a servant-maid in these days
3496: who is not better informed than Miss Nancy; yet she had the essential
3497: attributes of a lady—high veracity, delicate honour in her dealings,
3498: deference to others, and refined personal habits,—and lest these should
3499: not suffice to convince grammatical fair ones that her feelings can at
3500: all resemble theirs, I will add that she was slightly proud and
3501: exacting, and as constant in her affection towards a baseless opinion
3502: as towards an erring lover.
3503: 
3504: The anxiety about sister Priscilla, which had grown rather active by
3505: the time the coral necklace was clasped, was happily ended by the
3506: entrance of that cheerful-looking lady herself, with a face made blowsy
3507: by cold and damp. After the first questions and greetings, she turned
3508: to Nancy, and surveyed her from head to foot—then wheeled her round, to
3509: ascertain that the back view was equally faultless.
3510: 
3511: “What do you think o’ _these_ gowns, aunt Osgood?” said Priscilla,
3512: while Nancy helped her to unrobe.
3513: 
3514: “Very handsome indeed, niece,” said Mrs. Osgood, with a slight increase
3515: of formality. She always thought niece Priscilla too rough.
3516: 
3517: “I’m obliged to have the same as Nancy, you know, for all I’m five
3518: years older, and it makes me look yallow; for she never _will_ have
3519: anything without I have mine just like it, because she wants us to look
3520: like sisters. And I tell her, folks ’ull think it’s my weakness makes
3521: me fancy as I shall look pretty in what she looks pretty in. For I _am_
3522: ugly—there’s no denying that: I feature my father’s family. But, law! I
3523: don’t mind, do you?” Priscilla here turned to the Miss Gunns, rattling
3524: on in too much preoccupation with the delight of talking, to notice
3525: that her candour was not appreciated. “The pretty uns do for
3526: fly-catchers—they keep the men off us. I’ve no opinion o’ the men, Miss
3527: Gunn—I don’t know what _you_ have. And as for fretting and stewing
3528: about what _they_’ll think of you from morning till night, and making
3529: your life uneasy about what they’re doing when they’re out o’ your
3530: sight—as I tell Nancy, it’s a folly no woman need be guilty of, if
3531: she’s got a good father and a good home: let her leave it to them as
3532: have got no fortin, and can’t help themselves. As I say, Mr.
3533: Have-your-own-way is the best husband, and the only one I’d ever
3534: promise to obey. I know it isn’t pleasant, when you’ve been used to
3535: living in a big way, and managing hogsheads and all that, to go and put
3536: your nose in by somebody else’s fireside, or to sit down by yourself to
3537: a scrag or a knuckle; but, thank God! my father’s a sober man and
3538: likely to live; and if you’ve got a man by the chimney-corner, it
3539: doesn’t matter if he’s childish—the business needn’t be broke up.”
3540: 
3541: The delicate process of getting her narrow gown over her head without
3542: injury to her smooth curls, obliged Miss Priscilla to pause in this
3543: rapid survey of life, and Mrs. Osgood seized the opportunity of rising
3544: and saying—
3545: 
3546: “Well, niece, you’ll follow us. The Miss Gunns will like to go down.”
3547: 
3548: “Sister,” said Nancy, when they were alone, “you’ve offended the Miss
3549: Gunns, I’m sure.”
3550: 
3551: “What have I done, child?” said Priscilla, in some alarm.
3552: 
3553: “Why, you asked them if they minded about being ugly—you’re so very
3554: blunt.”
3555: 
3556: “Law, did I? Well, it popped out: it’s a mercy I said no more, for I’m
3557: a bad un to live with folks when they don’t like the truth. But as for
3558: being ugly, look at me, child, in this silver-coloured silk—I told you
3559: how it ’ud be—I look as yallow as a daffadil. Anybody ’ud say you
3560: wanted to make a mawkin of me.”
3561: 
3562: “No, Priscy, don’t say so. I begged and prayed of you not to let us
3563: have this silk if you’d like another better. I was willing to have
3564: _your_ choice, you know I was,” said Nancy, in anxious
3565: self-vindication.
3566: 
3567: “Nonsense, child! you know you’d set your heart on this; and reason
3568: good, for you’re the colour o’ cream. It ’ud be fine doings for you to
3569: dress yourself to suit _my_ skin. What I find fault with, is that
3570: notion o’ yours as I must dress myself just like you. But you do as you
3571: like with me—you always did, from when first you begun to walk. If you
3572: wanted to go the field’s length, the field’s length you’d go; and there
3573: was no whipping you, for you looked as prim and innicent as a daisy all
3574: the while.”
3575: 
3576: “Priscy,” said Nancy, gently, as she fastened a coral necklace, exactly
3577: like her own, round Priscilla’s neck, which was very far from being
3578: like her own, “I’m sure I’m willing to give way as far as is right, but
3579: who shouldn’t dress alike if it isn’t sisters? Would you have us go
3580: about looking as if we were no kin to one another—us that have got no
3581: mother and not another sister in the world? I’d do what was right, if I
3582: dressed in a gown dyed with cheese-colouring; and I’d rather you’d
3583: choose, and let me wear what pleases you.”
3584: 
3585: “There you go again! You’d come round to the same thing if one talked
3586: to you from Saturday night till Saturday morning. It’ll be fine fun to
3587: see how you’ll master your husband and never raise your voice above the
3588: singing o’ the kettle all the while. I like to see the men mastered!”
3589: 
3590: “Don’t talk _so_, Priscy,” said Nancy, blushing. “You know I don’t mean
3591: ever to be married.”
3592: 
3593: “Oh, you never mean a fiddlestick’s end!” said Priscilla, as she
3594: arranged her discarded dress, and closed her bandbox. “Who shall _I_
3595: have to work for when father’s gone, if you are to go and take notions
3596: in your head and be an old maid, because some folks are no better than
3597: they should be? I haven’t a bit o’ patience with you—sitting on an
3598: addled egg for ever, as if there was never a fresh un in the world. One
3599: old maid’s enough out o’ two sisters; and I shall do credit to a single
3600: life, for God A’mighty meant me for it. Come, we can go down now. I’m
3601: as ready as a mawkin _can_ be—there’s nothing awanting to frighten the
3602: crows, now I’ve got my ear-droppers in.”
3603: 
3604: As the two Miss Lammeters walked into the large parlour together, any
3605: one who did not know the character of both might certainly have
3606: supposed that the reason why the square-shouldered, clumsy,
3607: high-featured Priscilla wore a dress the facsimile of her pretty
3608: sister’s, was either the mistaken vanity of the one, or the malicious
3609: contrivance of the other in order to set off her own rare beauty. But
3610: the good-natured self-forgetful cheeriness and common-sense of
3611: Priscilla would soon have dissipated the one suspicion; and the modest
3612: calm of Nancy’s speech and manners told clearly of a mind free from all
3613: disavowed devices.
3614: 
3615: Places of honour had been kept for the Miss Lammeters near the head of
3616: the principal tea-table in the wainscoted parlour, now looking fresh
3617: and pleasant with handsome branches of holly, yew, and laurel, from the
3618: abundant growths of the old garden; and Nancy felt an inward flutter,
3619: that no firmness of purpose could prevent, when she saw Mr. Godfrey
3620: Cass advancing to lead her to a seat between himself and Mr.
3621: Crackenthorp, while Priscilla was called to the opposite side between
3622: her father and the Squire. It certainly did make some difference to
3623: Nancy that the lover she had given up was the young man of quite the
3624: highest consequence in the parish—at home in a venerable and unique
3625: parlour, which was the extremity of grandeur in her experience, a
3626: parlour where _she_ might one day have been mistress, with the
3627: consciousness that she was spoken of as “Madam Cass”, the Squire’s
3628: wife. These circumstances exalted her inward drama in her own eyes, and
3629: deepened the emphasis with which she declared to herself that not the
3630: most dazzling rank should induce her to marry a man whose conduct
3631: showed him careless of his character, but that, “love once, love
3632: always”, was the motto of a true and pure woman, and no man should ever
3633: have any right over her which would be a call on her to destroy the
3634: dried flowers that she treasured, and always would treasure, for
3635: Godfrey Cass’s sake. And Nancy was capable of keeping her word to
3636: herself under very trying conditions. Nothing but a becoming blush
3637: betrayed the moving thoughts that urged themselves upon her as she
3638: accepted the seat next to Mr. Crackenthorp; for she was so
3639: instinctively neat and adroit in all her actions, and her pretty lips
3640: met each other with such quiet firmness, that it would have been
3641: difficult for her to appear agitated.
3642: 
3643: It was not the rector’s practice to let a charming blush pass without
3644: an appropriate compliment. He was not in the least lofty or
3645: aristocratic, but simply a merry-eyed, small-featured, grey-haired man,
3646: with his chin propped by an ample, many-creased white neckcloth which
3647: seemed to predominate over every other point in his person, and somehow
3648: to impress its peculiar character on his remarks; so that to have
3649: considered his amenities apart from his cravat would have been a
3650: severe, and perhaps a dangerous, effort of abstraction.
3651: 
3652: “Ha, Miss Nancy,” he said, turning his head within his cravat and
3653: smiling down pleasantly upon her, “when anybody pretends this has been
3654: a severe winter, I shall tell them I saw the roses blooming on New
3655: Year’s Eve—eh, Godfrey, what do _you_ say?”
3656: 
3657: Godfrey made no reply, and avoided looking at Nancy very markedly; for
3658: though these complimentary personalities were held to be in excellent
3659: taste in old-fashioned Raveloe society, reverent love has a politeness
3660: of its own which it teaches to men otherwise of small schooling. But
3661: the Squire was rather impatient at Godfrey’s showing himself a dull
3662: spark in this way. By this advanced hour of the day, the Squire was
3663: always in higher spirits than we have seen him in at the
3664: breakfast-table, and felt it quite pleasant to fulfil the hereditary
3665: duty of being noisily jovial and patronizing: the large silver
3666: snuff-box was in active service and was offered without fail to all
3667: neighbours from time to time, however often they might have declined
3668: the favour. At present, the Squire had only given an express welcome to
3669: the heads of families as they appeared; but always as the evening
3670: deepened, his hospitality rayed out more widely, till he had tapped the
3671: youngest guests on the back and shown a peculiar fondness for their
3672: presence, in the full belief that they must feel their lives made happy
3673: by their belonging to a parish where there was such a hearty man as
3674: Squire Cass to invite them and wish them well. Even in this early stage
3675: of the jovial mood, it was natural that he should wish to supply his
3676: son’s deficiencies by looking and speaking for him.
3677: 
3678: “Aye, aye,” he began, offering his snuff-box to Mr. Lammeter, who for
3679: the second time bowed his head and waved his hand in stiff rejection of
3680: the offer, “us old fellows may wish ourselves young to-night, when we
3681: see the mistletoe-bough in the White Parlour. It’s true, most things
3682: are gone back’ard in these last thirty years—the country’s going down
3683: since the old king fell ill. But when I look at Miss Nancy here, I
3684: begin to think the lasses keep up their quality;—ding me if I remember
3685: a sample to match her, not when I was a fine young fellow, and thought
3686: a deal about my pigtail. No offence to you, madam,” he added, bending
3687: to Mrs. Crackenthorp, who sat by him, “I didn’t know _you_ when you
3688: were as young as Miss Nancy here.”
3689: 
3690: Mrs. Crackenthorp—a small blinking woman, who fidgeted incessantly with
3691: her lace, ribbons, and gold chain, turning her head about and making
3692: subdued noises, very much like a guinea-pig that twitches its nose and
3693: soliloquizes in all company indiscriminately—now blinked and fidgeted
3694: towards the Squire, and said, “Oh, no—no offence.”
3695: 
3696: This emphatic compliment of the Squire’s to Nancy was felt by others
3697: besides Godfrey to have a diplomatic significance; and her father gave
3698: a slight additional erectness to his back, as he looked across the
3699: table at her with complacent gravity. That grave and orderly senior was
3700: not going to bate a jot of his dignity by seeming elated at the notion
3701: of a match between his family and the Squire’s: he was gratified by any
3702: honour paid to his daughter; but he must see an alteration in several
3703: ways before his consent would be vouchsafed. His spare but healthy
3704: person, and high-featured firm face, that looked as if it had never
3705: been flushed by excess, was in strong contrast, not only with the
3706: Squire’s, but with the appearance of the Raveloe farmers generally—in
3707: accordance with a favourite saying of his own, that “breed was stronger
3708: than pasture”.
3709: 
3710: “Miss Nancy’s wonderful like what her mother was, though; isn’t she,
3711: Kimble?” said the stout lady of that name, looking round for her
3712: husband.
3713: 
3714: But Doctor Kimble (country apothecaries in old days enjoyed that title
3715: without authority of diploma), being a thin and agile man, was flitting
3716: about the room with his hands in his pockets, making himself agreeable
3717: to his feminine patients, with medical impartiality, and being welcomed
3718: everywhere as a doctor by hereditary right—not one of those miserable
3719: apothecaries who canvass for practice in strange neighbourhoods, and
3720: spend all their income in starving their one horse, but a man of
3721: substance, able to keep an extravagant table like the best of his
3722: patients. Time out of mind the Raveloe doctor had been a Kimble; Kimble
3723: was inherently a doctor’s name; and it was difficult to contemplate
3724: firmly the melancholy fact that the actual Kimble had no son, so that
3725: his practice might one day be handed over to a successor with the
3726: incongruous name of Taylor or Johnson. But in that case the wiser
3727: people in Raveloe would employ Dr. Blick of Flitton—as less unnatural.
3728: 
3729: “Did you speak to me, my dear?” said the authentic doctor, coming
3730: quickly to his wife’s side; but, as if foreseeing that she would be too
3731: much out of breath to repeat her remark, he went on immediately—“Ha,
3732: Miss Priscilla, the sight of you revives the taste of that
3733: super-excellent pork-pie. I hope the batch isn’t near an end.”
3734: 
3735: “Yes, indeed, it is, doctor,” said Priscilla; “but I’ll answer for it
3736: the next shall be as good. My pork-pies don’t turn out well by chance.”
3737: 
3738: “Not as your doctoring does, eh, Kimble?—because folks forget to take
3739: your physic, eh?” said the Squire, who regarded physic and doctors as
3740: many loyal churchmen regard the church and the clergy—tasting a joke
3741: against them when he was in health, but impatiently eager for their aid
3742: when anything was the matter with him. He tapped his box, and looked
3743: round with a triumphant laugh.
3744: 
3745: “Ah, she has a quick wit, my friend Priscilla has,” said the doctor,
3746: choosing to attribute the epigram to a lady rather than allow a
3747: brother-in-law that advantage over him. “She saves a little pepper to
3748: sprinkle over her talk—that’s the reason why she never puts too much
3749: into her pies. There’s my wife now, she never has an answer at her
3750: tongue’s end; but if I offend her, she’s sure to scarify my throat with
3751: black pepper the next day, or else give me the colic with watery
3752: greens. That’s an awful tit-for-tat.” Here the vivacious doctor made a
3753: pathetic grimace.
3754: 
3755: “Did you ever hear the like?” said Mrs. Kimble, laughing above her
3756: double chin with much good-humour, aside to Mrs. Crackenthorp, who
3757: blinked and nodded, and seemed to intend a smile, which, by the
3758: correlation of forces, went off in small twitchings and noises.
3759: 
3760: “I suppose that’s the sort of tit-for-tat adopted in your profession,
3761: Kimble, if you’ve a grudge against a patient,” said the rector.
3762: 
3763: “Never do have a grudge against our patients,” said Mr. Kimble, “except
3764: when they leave us: and then, you see, we haven’t the chance of
3765: prescribing for ’em. Ha, Miss Nancy,” he continued, suddenly skipping
3766: to Nancy’s side, “you won’t forget your promise? You’re to save a dance
3767: for me, you know.”
3768: 
3769: “Come, come, Kimble, don’t you be too for’ard,” said the Squire. “Give
3770: the young uns fair-play. There’s my son Godfrey’ll be wanting to have a
3771: round with you if you run off with Miss Nancy. He’s bespoke her for the
3772: first dance, I’ll be bound. Eh, sir! what do you say?” he continued,
3773: throwing himself backward, and looking at Godfrey. “Haven’t you asked
3774: Miss Nancy to open the dance with you?”
3775: 
3776: Godfrey, sorely uncomfortable under this significant insistence about
3777: Nancy, and afraid to think where it would end by the time his father
3778: had set his usual hospitable example of drinking before and after
3779: supper, saw no course open but to turn to Nancy and say, with as little
3780: awkwardness as possible—
3781: 
3782: “No; I’ve not asked her yet, but I hope she’ll consent—if somebody else
3783: hasn’t been before me.”
3784: 
3785: “No, I’ve not engaged myself,” said Nancy, quietly, though blushingly.
3786: (If Mr. Godfrey founded any hopes on her consenting to dance with him,
3787: he would soon be undeceived; but there was no need for her to be
3788: uncivil.)
3789: 
3790: “Then I hope you’ve no objections to dancing with me,” said Godfrey,
3791: beginning to lose the sense that there was anything uncomfortable in
3792: this arrangement.
3793: 
3794: “No, no objections,” said Nancy, in a cold tone.
3795: 
3796: “Ah, well, you’re a lucky fellow, Godfrey,” said uncle Kimble; “but
3797: you’re my godson, so I won’t stand in your way. Else I’m not so very
3798: old, eh, my dear?” he went on, skipping to his wife’s side again. “You
3799: wouldn’t mind my having a second after you were gone—not if I cried a
3800: good deal first?”
3801: 
3802: “Come, come, take a cup o’ tea and stop your tongue, do,” said
3803: good-humoured Mrs. Kimble, feeling some pride in a husband who must be
3804: regarded as so clever and amusing by the company generally. If he had
3805: only not been irritable at cards!
3806: 
3807: While safe, well-tested personalities were enlivening the tea in this
3808: way, the sound of the fiddle approaching within a distance at which it
3809: could be heard distinctly, made the young people look at each other
3810: with sympathetic impatience for the end of the meal.
3811: 
3812: “Why, there’s Solomon in the hall,” said the Squire, “and playing my
3813: fav’rite tune, _I_ believe—“The flaxen-headed ploughboy”—he’s for
3814: giving us a hint as we aren’t enough in a hurry to hear him play. Bob,”
3815: he called out to his third long-legged son, who was at the other end of
3816: the room, “open the door, and tell Solomon to come in. He shall give us
3817: a tune here.”
3818: 
3819: Bob obeyed, and Solomon walked in, fiddling as he walked, for he would
3820: on no account break off in the middle of a tune.
3821: 
3822: “Here, Solomon,” said the Squire, with loud patronage. “Round here, my
3823: man. Ah, I knew it was “The flaxen-headed ploughboy”: there’s no finer
3824: tune.”
3825: 
3826: Solomon Macey, a small hale old man with an abundant crop of long white
3827: hair reaching nearly to his shoulders, advanced to the indicated spot,
3828: bowing reverently while he fiddled, as much as to say that he respected
3829: the company, though he respected the key-note more. As soon as he had
3830: repeated the tune and lowered his fiddle, he bowed again to the Squire
3831: and the rector, and said, “I hope I see your honour and your reverence
3832: well, and wishing you health and long life and a happy New Year. And
3833: wishing the same to you, Mr. Lammeter, sir; and to the other gentlemen,
3834: and the madams, and the young lasses.”
3835: 
3836: As Solomon uttered the last words, he bowed in all directions
3837: solicitously, lest he should be wanting in due respect. But thereupon
3838: he immediately began to prelude, and fell into the tune which he knew
3839: would be taken as a special compliment by Mr. Lammeter.
3840: 
3841: “Thank ye, Solomon, thank ye,” said Mr. Lammeter when the fiddle paused
3842: again. “That’s “Over the hills and far away”, that is. My father used
3843: to say to me, whenever we heard that tune, “Ah, lad, _I_ come from over
3844: the hills and far away.” There’s a many tunes I don’t make head or tail
3845: of; but that speaks to me like the blackbird’s whistle. I suppose it’s
3846: the name: there’s a deal in the name of a tune.”
3847: 
3848: But Solomon was already impatient to prelude again, and presently broke
3849: with much spirit into “Sir Roger de Coverley”, at which there was a
3850: sound of chairs pushed back, and laughing voices.
3851: 
3852: “Aye, aye, Solomon, we know what that means,” said the Squire, rising.
3853: “It’s time to begin the dance, eh? Lead the way, then, and we’ll all
3854: follow you.”
3855: 
3856: So Solomon, holding his white head on one side, and playing vigorously,
3857: marched forward at the head of the gay procession into the White
3858: Parlour, where the mistletoe-bough was hung, and multitudinous tallow
3859: candles made rather a brilliant effect, gleaming from among the berried
3860: holly-boughs, and reflected in the old-fashioned oval mirrors fastened
3861: in the panels of the white wainscot. A quaint procession! Old Solomon,
3862: in his seedy clothes and long white locks, seemed to be luring that
3863: decent company by the magic scream of his fiddle—luring discreet
3864: matrons in turban-shaped caps, nay, Mrs. Crackenthorp herself, the
3865: summit of whose perpendicular feather was on a level with the Squire’s
3866: shoulder—luring fair lasses complacently conscious of very short waists
3867: and skirts blameless of front-folds—luring burly fathers in large
3868: variegated waistcoats, and ruddy sons, for the most part shy and
3869: sheepish, in short nether garments and very long coat-tails.
3870: 
3871: Already Mr. Macey and a few other privileged villagers, who were
3872: allowed to be spectators on these great occasions, were seated on
3873: benches placed for them near the door; and great was the admiration and
3874: satisfaction in that quarter when the couples had formed themselves for
3875: the dance, and the Squire led off with Mrs. Crackenthorp, joining hands
3876: with the rector and Mrs. Osgood. That was as it should be—that was what
3877: everybody had been used to—and the charter of Raveloe seemed to be
3878: renewed by the ceremony. It was not thought of as an unbecoming levity
3879: for the old and middle-aged people to dance a little before sitting
3880: down to cards, but rather as part of their social duties. For what were
3881: these if not to be merry at appropriate times, interchanging visits and
3882: poultry with due frequency, paying each other old-established
3883: compliments in sound traditional phrases, passing well-tried personal
3884: jokes, urging your guests to eat and drink too much out of hospitality,
3885: and eating and drinking too much in your neighbour’s house to show that
3886: you liked your cheer? And the parson naturally set an example in these
3887: social duties. For it would not have been possible for the Raveloe
3888: mind, without a peculiar revelation, to know that a clergyman should be
3889: a pale-faced memento of solemnities, instead of a reasonably faulty man
3890: whose exclusive authority to read prayers and preach, to christen,
3891: marry, and bury you, necessarily coexisted with the right to sell you
3892: the ground to be buried in and to take tithe in kind; on which last
3893: point, of course, there was a little grumbling, but not to the extent
3894: of irreligion—not of deeper significance than the grumbling at the
3895: rain, which was by no means accompanied with a spirit of impious
3896: defiance, but with a desire that the prayer for fine weather might be
3897: read forthwith.
3898: 
3899: There was no reason, then, why the rector’s dancing should not be
3900: received as part of the fitness of things quite as much as the
3901: Squire’s, or why, on the other hand, Mr. Macey’s official respect
3902: should restrain him from subjecting the parson’s performance to that
3903: criticism with which minds of extraordinary acuteness must necessarily
3904: contemplate the doings of their fallible fellow-men.
3905: 
3906: “The Squire’s pretty springe, considering his weight,” said Mr. Macey,
3907: “and he stamps uncommon well. But Mr. Lammeter beats ’em all for
3908: shapes: you see he holds his head like a sodger, and he isn’t so
3909: cushiony as most o’ the oldish gentlefolks—they run fat in general; and
3910: he’s got a fine leg. The parson’s nimble enough, but he hasn’t got much
3911: of a leg: it’s a bit too thick down’ard, and his knees might be a bit
3912: nearer wi’out damage; but he might do worse, he might do worse. Though
3913: he hasn’t that grand way o’ waving his hand as the Squire has.”
3914: 
3915: “Talk o’ nimbleness, look at Mrs. Osgood,” said Ben Winthrop, who was
3916: holding his son Aaron between his knees. “She trips along with her
3917: little steps, so as nobody can see how she goes—it’s like as if she had
3918: little wheels to her feet. She doesn’t look a day older nor last year:
3919: she’s the finest-made woman as is, let the next be where she will.”
3920: 
3921: “I don’t heed how the women are made,” said Mr. Macey, with some
3922: contempt. “They wear nayther coat nor breeches: you can’t make much out
3923: o’ their shapes.”
3924: 
3925: “Fayder,” said Aaron, whose feet were busy beating out the tune, “how
3926: does that big cock’s-feather stick in Mrs. Crackenthorp’s yead? Is
3927: there a little hole for it, like in my shuttle-cock?”
3928: 
3929: “Hush, lad, hush; that’s the way the ladies dress theirselves, that
3930: is,” said the father, adding, however, in an undertone to Mr. Macey,
3931: “It does make her look funny, though—partly like a short-necked bottle
3932: wi’ a long quill in it. Hey, by jingo, there’s the young Squire leading
3933: off now, wi’ Miss Nancy for partners! There’s a lass for you!—like a
3934: pink-and-white posy—there’s nobody ’ud think as anybody could be so
3935: pritty. I shouldn’t wonder if she’s Madam Cass some day, arter all—and
3936: nobody more rightfuller, for they’d make a fine match. You can find
3937: nothing against Master Godfrey’s shapes, Macey, _I_’ll bet a penny.”
3938: 
3939: Mr. Macey screwed up his mouth, leaned his head further on one side,
3940: and twirled his thumbs with a presto movement as his eyes followed
3941: Godfrey up the dance. At last he summed up his opinion.
3942: 
3943: “Pretty well down’ard, but a bit too round i’ the shoulder-blades. And
3944: as for them coats as he gets from the Flitton tailor, they’re a poor
3945: cut to pay double money for.”
3946: 
3947: “Ah, Mr. Macey, you and me are two folks,” said Ben, slightly indignant
3948: at this carping. “When I’ve got a pot o’ good ale, I like to swaller
3949: it, and do my inside good, i’stead o’ smelling and staring at it to see
3950: if I can’t find faut wi’ the brewing. I should like you to pick me out
3951: a finer-limbed young fellow nor Master Godfrey—one as ’ud knock you
3952: down easier, or ’s more pleasanter-looksed when he’s piert and merry.”
3953: 
3954: “Tchuh!” said Mr. Macey, provoked to increased severity, “he isn’t come
3955: to his right colour yet: he’s partly like a slack-baked pie. And I
3956: doubt he’s got a soft place in his head, else why should he be turned
3957: round the finger by that offal Dunsey as nobody’s seen o’ late, and let
3958: him kill that fine hunting hoss as was the talk o’ the country? And one
3959: while he was allays after Miss Nancy, and then it all went off again,
3960: like a smell o’ hot porridge, as I may say. That wasn’t my way when _I_
3961: went a-coorting.”
3962: 
3963: “Ah, but mayhap Miss Nancy hung off, like, and your lass didn’t,” said
3964: Ben.
3965: 
3966: “I should say she didn’t,” said Mr. Macey, significantly. “Before I
3967: said “sniff”, I took care to know as she’d say “snaff”, and pretty
3968: quick too. I wasn’t a-going to open _my_ mouth, like a dog at a fly,
3969: and snap it to again, wi’ nothing to swaller.”
3970: 
3971: “Well, I think Miss Nancy’s a-coming round again,” said Ben, “for
3972: Master Godfrey doesn’t look so down-hearted to-night. And I see he’s
3973: for taking her away to sit down, now they’re at the end o’ the dance:
3974: that looks like sweethearting, that does.”
3975: 
3976: The reason why Godfrey and Nancy had left the dance was not so tender
3977: as Ben imagined. In the close press of couples a slight accident had
3978: happened to Nancy’s dress, which, while it was short enough to show her
3979: neat ankle in front, was long enough behind to be caught under the
3980: stately stamp of the Squire’s foot, so as to rend certain stitches at
3981: the waist, and cause much sisterly agitation in Priscilla’s mind, as
3982: well as serious concern in Nancy’s. One’s thoughts may be much occupied
3983: with love-struggles, but hardly so as to be insensible to a disorder in
3984: the general framework of things. Nancy had no sooner completed her duty
3985: in the figure they were dancing than she said to Godfrey, with a deep
3986: blush, that she must go and sit down till Priscilla could come to her;
3987: for the sisters had already exchanged a short whisper and an open-eyed
3988: glance full of meaning. No reason less urgent than this could have
3989: prevailed on Nancy to give Godfrey this opportunity of sitting apart
3990: with her. As for Godfrey, he was feeling so happy and oblivious under
3991: the long charm of the country-dance with Nancy, that he got rather bold
3992: on the strength of her confusion, and was capable of leading her
3993: straight away, without leave asked, into the adjoining small parlour,
3994: where the card-tables were set.
3995: 
3996: “Oh no, thank you,” said Nancy, coldly, as soon as she perceived where
3997: he was going, “not in there. I’ll wait here till Priscilla’s ready to
3998: come to me. I’m sorry to bring you out of the dance and make myself
3999: troublesome.”
4000: 
4001: “Why, you’ll be more comfortable here by yourself,” said the artful
4002: Godfrey: “I’ll leave you here till your sister can come.” He spoke in
4003: an indifferent tone.
4004: 
4005: That was an agreeable proposition, and just what Nancy desired; why,
4006: then, was she a little hurt that Mr. Godfrey should make it? They
4007: entered, and she seated herself on a chair against one of the
4008: card-tables, as the stiffest and most unapproachable position she could
4009: choose.
4010: 
4011: “Thank you, sir,” she said immediately. “I needn’t give you any more
4012: trouble. I’m sorry you’ve had such an unlucky partner.”
4013: 
4014: “That’s very ill-natured of you,” said Godfrey, standing by her without
4015: any sign of intended departure, “to be sorry you’ve danced with me.”
4016: 
4017: “Oh, no, sir, I don’t mean to say what’s ill-natured at all,” said
4018: Nancy, looking distractingly prim and pretty. “When gentlemen have so
4019: many pleasures, one dance can matter but very little.”
4020: 
4021: “You know that isn’t true. You know one dance with you matters more to
4022: me than all the other pleasures in the world.”
4023: 
4024: It was a long, long while since Godfrey had said anything so direct as
4025: that, and Nancy was startled. But her instinctive dignity and
4026: repugnance to any show of emotion made her sit perfectly still, and
4027: only throw a little more decision into her voice, as she said—
4028: 
4029: “No, indeed, Mr. Godfrey, that’s not known to me, and I have very good
4030: reasons for thinking different. But if it’s true, I don’t wish to hear
4031: it.”
4032: 
4033: “Would you never forgive me, then, Nancy—never think well of me, let
4034: what would happen—would you never think the present made amends for the
4035: past? Not if I turned a good fellow, and gave up everything you didn’t
4036: like?”
4037: 
4038: Godfrey was half conscious that this sudden opportunity of speaking to
4039: Nancy alone had driven him beside himself; but blind feeling had got
4040: the mastery of his tongue. Nancy really felt much agitated by the
4041: possibility Godfrey’s words suggested, but this very pressure of
4042: emotion that she was in danger of finding too strong for her roused all
4043: her power of self-command.
4044: 
4045: “I should be glad to see a good change in anybody, Mr. Godfrey,” she
4046: answered, with the slightest discernible difference of tone, “but it
4047: ’ud be better if no change was wanted.”
4048: 
4049: “You’re very hard-hearted, Nancy,” said Godfrey, pettishly. “You might
4050: encourage me to be a better fellow. I’m very miserable—but you’ve no
4051: feeling.”
4052: 
4053: “I think those have the least feeling that act wrong to begin with,”
4054: said Nancy, sending out a flash in spite of herself. Godfrey was
4055: delighted with that little flash, and would have liked to go on and
4056: make her quarrel with him; Nancy was so exasperatingly quiet and firm.
4057: But she was not indifferent to him _yet_, though—
4058: 
4059: The entrance of Priscilla, bustling forward and saying, “Dear heart
4060: alive, child, let us look at this gown,” cut off Godfrey’s hopes of a
4061: quarrel.
4062: 
4063: “I suppose I must go now,” he said to Priscilla.
4064: 
4065: “It’s no matter to me whether you go or stay,” said that frank lady,
4066: searching for something in her pocket, with a preoccupied brow.
4067: 
4068: “Do _you_ want me to go?” said Godfrey, looking at Nancy, who was now
4069: standing up by Priscilla’s order.
4070: 
4071: “As you like,” said Nancy, trying to recover all her former coldness,
4072: and looking down carefully at the hem of her gown.
4073: 
4074: “Then I like to stay,” said Godfrey, with a reckless determination to
4075: get as much of this joy as he could to-night, and think nothing of the
4076: morrow.
4077: 
4078: 
4079: 
4080: CHAPTER XII.
4081: 
4082: While Godfrey Cass was taking draughts of forgetfulness from the sweet
4083: presence of Nancy, willingly losing all sense of that hidden bond which
4084: at other moments galled and fretted him so as to mingle irritation with
4085: the very sunshine, Godfrey’s wife was walking with slow uncertain steps
4086: through the snow-covered Raveloe lanes, carrying her child in her arms.
4087: 
4088: This journey on New Year’s Eve was a premeditated act of vengeance
4089: which she had kept in her heart ever since Godfrey, in a fit of
4090: passion, had told her he would sooner die than acknowledge her as his
4091: wife. There would be a great party at the Red House on New Year’s Eve,
4092: she knew: her husband would be smiling and smiled upon, hiding _her_
4093: existence in the darkest corner of his heart. But she would mar his
4094: pleasure: she would go in her dingy rags, with her faded face, once as
4095: handsome as the best, with her little child that had its father’s hair
4096: and eyes, and disclose herself to the Squire as his eldest son’s wife.
4097: It is seldom that the miserable can help regarding their misery as a
4098: wrong inflicted by those who are less miserable. Molly knew that the
4099: cause of her dingy rags was not her husband’s neglect, but the demon
4100: Opium to whom she was enslaved, body and soul, except in the lingering
4101: mother’s tenderness that refused to give him her hungry child. She knew
4102: this well; and yet, in the moments of wretched unbenumbed
4103: consciousness, the sense of her want and degradation transformed itself
4104: continually into bitterness towards Godfrey. _He_ was well off; and if
4105: she had her rights she would be well off too. The belief that he
4106: repented his marriage, and suffered from it, only aggravated her
4107: vindictiveness. Just and self-reproving thoughts do not come to us too
4108: thickly, even in the purest air, and with the best lessons of heaven
4109: and earth; how should those white-winged delicate messengers make their
4110: way to Molly’s poisoned chamber, inhabited by no higher memories than
4111: those of a barmaid’s paradise of pink ribbons and gentlemen’s jokes?
4112: 
4113: She had set out at an early hour, but had lingered on the road,
4114: inclined by her indolence to believe that if she waited under a warm
4115: shed the snow would cease to fall. She had waited longer than she knew,
4116: and now that she found herself belated in the snow-hidden ruggedness of
4117: the long lanes, even the animation of a vindictive purpose could not
4118: keep her spirit from failing. It was seven o’clock, and by this time
4119: she was not very far from Raveloe, but she was not familiar enough with
4120: those monotonous lanes to know how near she was to her journey’s end.
4121: She needed comfort, and she knew but one comforter—the familiar demon
4122: in her bosom; but she hesitated a moment, after drawing out the black
4123: remnant, before she raised it to her lips. In that moment the mother’s
4124: love pleaded for painful consciousness rather than oblivion—pleaded to
4125: be left in aching weariness, rather than to have the encircling arms
4126: benumbed so that they could not feel the dear burden. In another moment
4127: Molly had flung something away, but it was not the black remnant—it was
4128: an empty phial. And she walked on again under the breaking cloud, from
4129: which there came now and then the light of a quickly veiled star, for a
4130: freezing wind had sprung up since the snowing had ceased. But she
4131: walked always more and more drowsily, and clutched more and more
4132: automatically the sleeping child at her bosom.
4133: 
4134: Slowly the demon was working his will, and cold and weariness were his
4135: helpers. Soon she felt nothing but a supreme immediate longing that
4136: curtained off all futurity—the longing to lie down and sleep. She had
4137: arrived at a spot where her footsteps were no longer checked by a
4138: hedgerow, and she had wandered vaguely, unable to distinguish any
4139: objects, notwithstanding the wide whiteness around her, and the growing
4140: starlight. She sank down against a straggling furze bush, an easy
4141: pillow enough; and the bed of snow, too, was soft. She did not feel
4142: that the bed was cold, and did not heed whether the child would wake
4143: and cry for her. But her arms had not yet relaxed their instinctive
4144: clutch; and the little one slumbered on as gently as if it had been
4145: rocked in a lace-trimmed cradle.
4146: 
4147: But the complete torpor came at last: the fingers lost their tension,
4148: the arms unbent; then the little head fell away from the bosom, and the
4149: blue eyes opened wide on the cold starlight. At first there was a
4150: little peevish cry of “mammy”, and an effort to regain the pillowing
4151: arm and bosom; but mammy’s ear was deaf, and the pillow seemed to be
4152: slipping away backward. Suddenly, as the child rolled downward on its
4153: mother’s knees, all wet with snow, its eyes were caught by a bright
4154: glancing light on the white ground, and, with the ready transition of
4155: infancy, it was immediately absorbed in watching the bright living
4156: thing running towards it, yet never arriving. That bright living thing
4157: must be caught; and in an instant the child had slipped on all-fours,
4158: and held out one little hand to catch the gleam. But the gleam would
4159: not be caught in that way, and now the head was held up to see where
4160: the cunning gleam came from. It came from a very bright place; and the
4161: little one, rising on its legs, toddled through the snow, the old grimy
4162: shawl in which it was wrapped trailing behind it, and the queer little
4163: bonnet dangling at its back—toddled on to the open door of Silas
4164: Marner’s cottage, and right up to the warm hearth, where there was a
4165: bright fire of logs and sticks, which had thoroughly warmed the old
4166: sack (Silas’s greatcoat) spread out on the bricks to dry. The little
4167: one, accustomed to be left to itself for long hours without notice from
4168: its mother, squatted down on the sack, and spread its tiny hands
4169: towards the blaze, in perfect contentment, gurgling and making many
4170: inarticulate communications to the cheerful fire, like a new-hatched
4171: gosling beginning to find itself comfortable. But presently the warmth
4172: had a lulling effect, and the little golden head sank down on the old
4173: sack, and the blue eyes were veiled by their delicate half-transparent
4174: lids.
4175: 
4176: But where was Silas Marner while this strange visitor had come to his
4177: hearth? He was in the cottage, but he did not see the child. During the
4178: last few weeks, since he had lost his money, he had contracted the
4179: habit of opening his door and looking out from time to time, as if he
4180: thought that his money might be somehow coming back to him, or that
4181: some trace, some news of it, might be mysteriously on the road, and be
4182: caught by the listening ear or the straining eye. It was chiefly at
4183: night, when he was not occupied in his loom, that he fell into this
4184: repetition of an act for which he could have assigned no definite
4185: purpose, and which can hardly be understood except by those who have
4186: undergone a bewildering separation from a supremely loved object. In
4187: the evening twilight, and later whenever the night was not dark, Silas
4188: looked out on that narrow prospect round the Stone-pits, listening and
4189: gazing, not with hope, but with mere yearning and unrest.
4190: 
4191: This morning he had been told by some of his neighbours that it was New
4192: Year’s Eve, and that he must sit up and hear the old year rung out and
4193: the new rung in, because that was good luck, and might bring his money
4194: back again. This was only a friendly Raveloe-way of jesting with the
4195: half-crazy oddities of a miser, but it had perhaps helped to throw
4196: Silas into a more than usually excited state. Since the on-coming of
4197: twilight he had opened his door again and again, though only to shut it
4198: immediately at seeing all distance veiled by the falling snow. But the
4199: last time he opened it the snow had ceased, and the clouds were parting
4200: here and there. He stood and listened, and gazed for a long while—there
4201: was really something on the road coming towards him then, but he caught
4202: no sign of it; and the stillness and the wide trackless snow seemed to
4203: narrow his solitude, and touched his yearning with the chill of
4204: despair. He went in again, and put his right hand on the latch of the
4205: door to close it—but he did not close it: he was arrested, as he had
4206: been already since his loss, by the invisible wand of catalepsy, and
4207: stood like a graven image, with wide but sightless eyes, holding open
4208: his door, powerless to resist either the good or the evil that might
4209: enter there.
4210: 
4211: When Marner’s sensibility returned, he continued the action which had
4212: been arrested, and closed his door, unaware of the chasm in his
4213: consciousness, unaware of any intermediate change, except that the
4214: light had grown dim, and that he was chilled and faint. He thought he
4215: had been too long standing at the door and looking out. Turning towards
4216: the hearth, where the two logs had fallen apart, and sent forth only a
4217: red uncertain glimmer, he seated himself on his fireside chair, and was
4218: stooping to push his logs together, when, to his blurred vision, it
4219: seemed as if there were gold on the floor in front of the hearth.
4220: Gold!—his own gold—brought back to him as mysteriously as it had been
4221: taken away! He felt his heart begin to beat violently, and for a few
4222: moments he was unable to stretch out his hand and grasp the restored
4223: treasure. The heap of gold seemed to glow and get larger beneath his
4224: agitated gaze. He leaned forward at last, and stretched forth his hand;
4225: but instead of the hard coin with the familiar resisting outline, his
4226: fingers encountered soft warm curls. In utter amazement, Silas fell on
4227: his knees and bent his head low to examine the marvel: it was a
4228: sleeping child—a round, fair thing, with soft yellow rings all over its
4229: head. Could this be his little sister come back to him in a dream—his
4230: little sister whom he had carried about in his arms for a year before
4231: she died, when he was a small boy without shoes or stockings? That was
4232: the first thought that darted across Silas’s blank wonderment. _Was_ it
4233: a dream? He rose to his feet again, pushed his logs together, and,
4234: throwing on some dried leaves and sticks, raised a flame; but the flame
4235: did not disperse the vision—it only lit up more distinctly the little
4236: round form of the child, and its shabby clothing. It was very much like
4237: his little sister. Silas sank into his chair powerless, under the
4238: double presence of an inexplicable surprise and a hurrying influx of
4239: memories. How and when had the child come in without his knowledge? He
4240: had never been beyond the door. But along with that question, and
4241: almost thrusting it away, there was a vision of the old home and the
4242: old streets leading to Lantern Yard—and within that vision another, of
4243: the thoughts which had been present with him in those far-off scenes.
4244: The thoughts were strange to him now, like old friendships impossible
4245: to revive; and yet he had a dreamy feeling that this child was somehow
4246: a message come to him from that far-off life: it stirred fibres that
4247: had never been moved in Raveloe—old quiverings of tenderness—old
4248: impressions of awe at the presentiment of some Power presiding over his
4249: life; for his imagination had not yet extricated itself from the sense
4250: of mystery in the child’s sudden presence, and had formed no
4251: conjectures of ordinary natural means by which the event could have
4252: been brought about.
4253: 
4254: But there was a cry on the hearth: the child had awaked, and Marner
4255: stooped to lift it on his knee. It clung round his neck, and burst
4256: louder and louder into that mingling of inarticulate cries with “mammy”
4257: by which little children express the bewilderment of waking. Silas
4258: pressed it to him, and almost unconsciously uttered sounds of hushing
4259: tenderness, while he bethought himself that some of his porridge, which
4260: had got cool by the dying fire, would do to feed the child with if it
4261: were only warmed up a little.
4262: 
4263: He had plenty to do through the next hour. The porridge, sweetened with
4264: some dry brown sugar from an old store which he had refrained from
4265: using for himself, stopped the cries of the little one, and made her
4266: lift her blue eyes with a wide quiet gaze at Silas, as he put the spoon
4267: into her mouth. Presently she slipped from his knee and began to toddle
4268: about, but with a pretty stagger that made Silas jump up and follow her
4269: lest she should fall against anything that would hurt her. But she only
4270: fell in a sitting posture on the ground, and began to pull at her
4271: boots, looking up at him with a crying face as if the boots hurt her.
4272: He took her on his knee again, but it was some time before it occurred
4273: to Silas’s dull bachelor mind that the wet boots were the grievance,
4274: pressing on her warm ankles. He got them off with difficulty, and baby
4275: was at once happily occupied with the primary mystery of her own toes,
4276: inviting Silas, with much chuckling, to consider the mystery too. But
4277: the wet boots had at last suggested to Silas that the child had been
4278: walking on the snow, and this roused him from his entire oblivion of
4279: any ordinary means by which it could have entered or been brought into
4280: his house. Under the prompting of this new idea, and without waiting to
4281: form conjectures, he raised the child in his arms, and went to the
4282: door. As soon as he had opened it, there was the cry of “mammy” again,
4283: which Silas had not heard since the child’s first hungry waking.
4284: Bending forward, he could just discern the marks made by the little
4285: feet on the virgin snow, and he followed their track to the furze
4286: bushes. “Mammy!” the little one cried again and again, stretching
4287: itself forward so as almost to escape from Silas’s arms, before he
4288: himself was aware that there was something more than the bush before
4289: him—that there was a human body, with the head sunk low in the furze,
4290: and half-covered with the shaken snow.
4291: 
4292: 
4293: 
4294: CHAPTER XIII.
4295: 
4296: It was after the early supper-time at the Red House, and the
4297: entertainment was in that stage when bashfulness itself had passed into
4298: easy jollity, when gentlemen, conscious of unusual accomplishments,
4299: could at length be prevailed on to dance a hornpipe, and when the
4300: Squire preferred talking loudly, scattering snuff, and patting his
4301: visitors’ backs, to sitting longer at the whist-table—a choice
4302: exasperating to uncle Kimble, who, being always volatile in sober
4303: business hours, became intense and bitter over cards and brandy,
4304: shuffled before his adversary’s deal with a glare of suspicion, and
4305: turned up a mean trump-card with an air of inexpressible disgust, as if
4306: in a world where such things could happen one might as well enter on a
4307: course of reckless profligacy. When the evening had advanced to this
4308: pitch of freedom and enjoyment, it was usual for the servants, the
4309: heavy duties of supper being well over, to get their share of amusement
4310: by coming to look on at the dancing; so that the back regions of the
4311: house were left in solitude.
4312: 
4313: There were two doors by which the White Parlour was entered from the
4314: hall, and they were both standing open for the sake of air; but the
4315: lower one was crowded with the servants and villagers, and only the
4316: upper doorway was left free. Bob Cass was figuring in a hornpipe, and
4317: his father, very proud of this lithe son, whom he repeatedly declared
4318: to be just like himself in his young days in a tone that implied this
4319: to be the very highest stamp of juvenile merit, was the centre of a
4320: group who had placed themselves opposite the performer, not far from
4321: the upper door. Godfrey was standing a little way off, not to admire
4322: his brother’s dancing, but to keep sight of Nancy, who was seated in
4323: the group, near her father. He stood aloof, because he wished to avoid
4324: suggesting himself as a subject for the Squire’s fatherly jokes in
4325: connection with matrimony and Miss Nancy Lammeter’s beauty, which were
4326: likely to become more and more explicit. But he had the prospect of
4327: dancing with her again when the hornpipe was concluded, and in the
4328: meanwhile it was very pleasant to get long glances at her quite
4329: unobserved.
4330: 
4331: But when Godfrey was lifting his eyes from one of those long glances,
4332: they encountered an object as startling to him at that moment as if it
4333: had been an apparition from the dead. It _was_ an apparition from that
4334: hidden life which lies, like a dark by-street, behind the goodly
4335: ornamented facade that meets the sunlight and the gaze of respectable
4336: admirers. It was his own child, carried in Silas Marner’s arms. That
4337: was his instantaneous impression, unaccompanied by doubt, though he had
4338: not seen the child for months past; and when the hope was rising that
4339: he might possibly be mistaken, Mr. Crackenthorp and Mr. Lammeter had
4340: already advanced to Silas, in astonishment at this strange advent.
4341: Godfrey joined them immediately, unable to rest without hearing every
4342: word—trying to control himself, but conscious that if any one noticed
4343: him, they must see that he was white-lipped and trembling.
4344: 
4345: But now all eyes at that end of the room were bent on Silas Marner; the
4346: Squire himself had risen, and asked angrily, “How’s this?—what’s
4347: this?—what do you do coming in here in this way?”
4348: 
4349: “I’m come for the doctor—I want the doctor,” Silas had said, in the
4350: first moment, to Mr. Crackenthorp.
4351: 
4352: “Why, what’s the matter, Marner?” said the rector. “The doctor’s here;
4353: but say quietly what you want him for.”
4354: 
4355: “It’s a woman,” said Silas, speaking low, and half-breathlessly, just
4356: as Godfrey came up. “She’s dead, I think—dead in the snow at the
4357: Stone-pits—not far from my door.”
4358: 
4359: Godfrey felt a great throb: there was one terror in his mind at that
4360: moment: it was, that the woman might _not_ be dead. That was an evil
4361: terror—an ugly inmate to have found a nestling-place in Godfrey’s
4362: kindly disposition; but no disposition is a security from evil wishes
4363: to a man whose happiness hangs on duplicity.
4364: 
4365: “Hush, hush!” said Mr. Crackenthorp. “Go out into the hall there. I’ll
4366: fetch the doctor to you. Found a woman in the snow—and thinks she’s
4367: dead,” he added, speaking low to the Squire. “Better say as little
4368: about it as possible: it will shock the ladies. Just tell them a poor
4369: woman is ill from cold and hunger. I’ll go and fetch Kimble.”
4370: 
4371: By this time, however, the ladies had pressed forward, curious to know
4372: what could have brought the solitary linen-weaver there under such
4373: strange circumstances, and interested in the pretty child, who, half
4374: alarmed and half attracted by the brightness and the numerous company,
4375: now frowned and hid her face, now lifted up her head again and looked
4376: round placably, until a touch or a coaxing word brought back the frown,
4377: and made her bury her face with new determination.
4378: 
4379: “What child is it?” said several ladies at once, and, among the rest,
4380: Nancy Lammeter, addressing Godfrey.
4381: 
4382: “I don’t know—some poor woman’s who has been found in the snow, I
4383: believe,” was the answer Godfrey wrung from himself with a terrible
4384: effort. (“After all, _am_ I certain?” he hastened to add, silently, in
4385: anticipation of his own conscience.)
4386: 
4387: “Why, you’d better leave the child here, then, Master Marner,” said
4388: good-natured Mrs. Kimble, hesitating, however, to take those dingy
4389: clothes into contact with her own ornamented satin bodice. “I’ll tell
4390: one o’ the girls to fetch it.”
4391: 
4392: “No—no—I can’t part with it, I can’t let it go,” said Silas, abruptly.
4393: “It’s come to me—I’ve a right to keep it.”
4394: 
4395: The proposition to take the child from him had come to Silas quite
4396: unexpectedly, and his speech, uttered under a strong sudden impulse,
4397: was almost like a revelation to himself: a minute before, he had no
4398: distinct intention about the child.
4399: 
4400: “Did you ever hear the like?” said Mrs. Kimble, in mild surprise, to
4401: her neighbour.
4402: 
4403: “Now, ladies, I must trouble you to stand aside,” said Mr. Kimble,
4404: coming from the card-room, in some bitterness at the interruption, but
4405: drilled by the long habit of his profession into obedience to
4406: unpleasant calls, even when he was hardly sober.
4407: 
4408: “It’s a nasty business turning out now, eh, Kimble?” said the Squire.
4409: “He might ha’ gone for your young fellow—the ’prentice, there—what’s
4410: his name?”
4411: 
4412: “Might? aye—what’s the use of talking about might?” growled uncle
4413: Kimble, hastening out with Marner, and followed by Mr. Crackenthorp and
4414: Godfrey. “Get me a pair of thick boots, Godfrey, will you? And stay,
4415: let somebody run to Winthrop’s and fetch Dolly—she’s the best woman to
4416: get. Ben was here himself before supper; is he gone?”
4417: 
4418: “Yes, sir, I met him,” said Marner; “but I couldn’t stop to tell him
4419: anything, only I said I was going for the doctor, and he said the
4420: doctor was at the Squire’s. And I made haste and ran, and there was
4421: nobody to be seen at the back o’ the house, and so I went in to where
4422: the company was.”
4423: 
4424: The child, no longer distracted by the bright light and the smiling
4425: women’s faces, began to cry and call for “mammy”, though always
4426: clinging to Marner, who had apparently won her thorough confidence.
4427: Godfrey had come back with the boots, and felt the cry as if some fibre
4428: were drawn tight within him.
4429: 
4430: “I’ll go,” he said, hastily, eager for some movement; “I’ll go and
4431: fetch the woman—Mrs. Winthrop.”
4432: 
4433: “Oh, pooh—send somebody else,” said uncle Kimble, hurrying away with
4434: Marner.
4435: 
4436: “You’ll let me know if I can be of any use, Kimble,” said Mr.
4437: Crackenthorp. But the doctor was out of hearing.
4438: 
4439: Godfrey, too, had disappeared: he was gone to snatch his hat and coat,
4440: having just reflection enough to remember that he must not look like a
4441: madman; but he rushed out of the house into the snow without heeding
4442: his thin shoes.
4443: 
4444: In a few minutes he was on his rapid way to the Stone-pits by the side
4445: of Dolly, who, though feeling that she was entirely in her place in
4446: encountering cold and snow on an errand of mercy, was much concerned at
4447: a young gentleman’s getting his feet wet under a like impulse.
4448: 
4449: “You’d a deal better go back, sir,” said Dolly, with respectful
4450: compassion. “You’ve no call to catch cold; and I’d ask you if you’d be
4451: so good as tell my husband to come, on your way back—he’s at the
4452: Rainbow, I doubt—if you found him anyway sober enough to be o’ use. Or
4453: else, there’s Mrs. Snell ’ud happen send the boy up to fetch and carry,
4454: for there may be things wanted from the doctor’s.”
4455: 
4456: “No, I’ll stay, now I’m once out—I’ll stay outside here,” said Godfrey,
4457: when they came opposite Marner’s cottage. “You can come and tell me if
4458: I can do anything.”
4459: 
4460: “Well, sir, you’re very good: you’ve a tender heart,” said Dolly, going
4461: to the door.
4462: 
4463: Godfrey was too painfully preoccupied to feel a twinge of self-reproach
4464: at this undeserved praise. He walked up and down, unconscious that he
4465: was plunging ankle-deep in snow, unconscious of everything but
4466: trembling suspense about what was going on in the cottage, and the
4467: effect of each alternative on his future lot. No, not quite unconscious
4468: of everything else. Deeper down, and half-smothered by passionate
4469: desire and dread, there was the sense that he ought not to be waiting
4470: on these alternatives; that he ought to accept the consequences of his
4471: deeds, own the miserable wife, and fulfil the claims of the helpless
4472: child. But he had not moral courage enough to contemplate that active
4473: renunciation of Nancy as possible for him: he had only conscience and
4474: heart enough to make him for ever uneasy under the weakness that
4475: forbade the renunciation. And at this moment his mind leaped away from
4476: all restraint toward the sudden prospect of deliverance from his long
4477: bondage.
4478: 
4479: “Is she dead?” said the voice that predominated over every other within
4480: him. “If she is, I may marry Nancy; and then I shall be a good fellow
4481: in future, and have no secrets, and the child—shall be taken care of
4482: somehow.” But across that vision came the other possibility—“She may
4483: live, and then it’s all up with me.”
4484: 
4485: Godfrey never knew how long it was before the door of the cottage
4486: opened and Mr. Kimble came out. He went forward to meet his uncle,
4487: prepared to suppress the agitation he must feel, whatever news he was
4488: to hear.
4489: 
4490: “I waited for you, as I’d come so far,” he said, speaking first.
4491: 
4492: “Pooh, it was nonsense for you to come out: why didn’t you send one of
4493: the men? There’s nothing to be done. She’s dead—has been dead for
4494: hours, I should say.”
4495: 
4496: “What sort of woman is she?” said Godfrey, feeling the blood rush to
4497: his face.
4498: 
4499: “A young woman, but emaciated, with long black hair. Some vagrant—quite
4500: in rags. She’s got a wedding-ring on, however. They must fetch her away
4501: to the workhouse to-morrow. Come, come along.”
4502: 
4503: “I want to look at her,” said Godfrey. “I think I saw such a woman
4504: yesterday. I’ll overtake you in a minute or two.”
4505: 
4506: Mr. Kimble went on, and Godfrey turned back to the cottage. He cast
4507: only one glance at the dead face on the pillow, which Dolly had
4508: smoothed with decent care; but he remembered that last look at his
4509: unhappy hated wife so well, that at the end of sixteen years every line
4510: in the worn face was present to him when he told the full story of this
4511: night.
4512: 
4513: He turned immediately towards the hearth, where Silas Marner sat
4514: lulling the child. She was perfectly quiet now, but not asleep—only
4515: soothed by sweet porridge and warmth into that wide-gazing calm which
4516: makes us older human beings, with our inward turmoil, feel a certain
4517: awe in the presence of a little child, such as we feel before some
4518: quiet majesty or beauty in the earth or sky—before a steady glowing
4519: planet, or a full-flowered eglantine, or the bending trees over a
4520: silent pathway. The wide-open blue eyes looked up at Godfrey’s without
4521: any uneasiness or sign of recognition: the child could make no visible
4522: audible claim on its father; and the father felt a strange mixture of
4523: feelings, a conflict of regret and joy, that the pulse of that little
4524: heart had no response for the half-jealous yearning in his own, when
4525: the blue eyes turned away from him slowly, and fixed themselves on the
4526: weaver’s queer face, which was bent low down to look at them, while the
4527: small hand began to pull Marner’s withered cheek with loving
4528: disfiguration.
4529: 
4530: “You’ll take the child to the parish to-morrow?” asked Godfrey,
4531: speaking as indifferently as he could.
4532: 
4533: “Who says so?” said Marner, sharply. “Will they make me take her?”
4534: 
4535: “Why, you wouldn’t like to keep her, should you—an old bachelor like
4536: you?”
4537: 
4538: “Till anybody shows they’ve a right to take her away from me,” said
4539: Marner. “The mother’s dead, and I reckon it’s got no father: it’s a
4540: lone thing—and I’m a lone thing. My money’s gone, I don’t know
4541: where—and this is come from I don’t know where. I know nothing—I’m
4542: partly mazed.”
4543: 
4544: “Poor little thing!” said Godfrey. “Let me give something towards
4545: finding it clothes.”
4546: 
4547: He had put his hand in his pocket and found half-a-guinea, and,
4548: thrusting it into Silas’s hand, he hurried out of the cottage to
4549: overtake Mr. Kimble.
4550: 
4551: “Ah, I see it’s not the same woman I saw,” he said, as he came up.
4552: “It’s a pretty little child: the old fellow seems to want to keep it;
4553: that’s strange for a miser like him. But I gave him a trifle to help
4554: him out: the parish isn’t likely to quarrel with him for the right to
4555: keep the child.”
4556: 
4557: “No; but I’ve seen the time when I might have quarrelled with him for
4558: it myself. It’s too late now, though. If the child ran into the fire,
4559: your aunt’s too fat to overtake it: she could only sit and grunt like
4560: an alarmed sow. But what a fool you are, Godfrey, to come out in your
4561: dancing shoes and stockings in this way—and you one of the beaux of the
4562: evening, and at your own house! What do you mean by such freaks, young
4563: fellow? Has Miss Nancy been cruel, and do you want to spite her by
4564: spoiling your pumps?”
4565: 
4566: “Oh, everything has been disagreeable to-night. I was tired to death of
4567: jigging and gallanting, and that bother about the hornpipes. And I’d
4568: got to dance with the other Miss Gunn,” said Godfrey, glad of the
4569: subterfuge his uncle had suggested to him.
4570: 
4571: The prevarication and white lies which a mind that keeps itself
4572: ambitiously pure is as uneasy under as a great artist under the false
4573: touches that no eye detects but his own, are worn as lightly as mere
4574: trimmings when once the actions have become a lie.
4575: 
4576: Godfrey reappeared in the White Parlour with dry feet, and, since the
4577: truth must be told, with a sense of relief and gladness that was too
4578: strong for painful thoughts to struggle with. For could he not venture
4579: now, whenever opportunity offered, to say the tenderest things to Nancy
4580: Lammeter—to promise her and himself that he would always be just what
4581: she would desire to see him? There was no danger that his dead wife
4582: would be recognized: those were not days of active inquiry and wide
4583: report; and as for the registry of their marriage, that was a long way
4584: off, buried in unturned pages, away from every one’s interest but his
4585: own. Dunsey might betray him if he came back; but Dunsey might be won
4586: to silence.
4587: 
4588: And when events turn out so much better for a man than he has had
4589: reason to dread, is it not a proof that his conduct has been less
4590: foolish and blameworthy than it might otherwise have appeared? When we
4591: are treated well, we naturally begin to think that we are not
4592: altogether unmeritorious, and that it is only just we should treat
4593: ourselves well, and not mar our own good fortune. Where, after all,
4594: would be the use of his confessing the past to Nancy Lammeter, and
4595: throwing away his happiness?—nay, hers? for he felt some confidence
4596: that she loved him. As for the child, he would see that it was cared
4597: for: he would never forsake it; he would do everything but own it.
4598: Perhaps it would be just as happy in life without being owned by its
4599: father, seeing that nobody could tell how things would turn out, and
4600: that—is there any other reason wanted?—well, then, that the father
4601: would be much happier without owning the child.
4602: 
4603: 
4604: 
4605: CHAPTER XIV.
4606: 
4607: There was a pauper’s burial that week in Raveloe, and up Kench Yard at
4608: Batherley it was known that the dark-haired woman with the fair child,
4609: who had lately come to lodge there, was gone away again. That was all
4610: the express note taken that Molly had disappeared from the eyes of men.
4611: But the unwept death which, to the general lot, seemed as trivial as
4612: the summer-shed leaf, was charged with the force of destiny to certain
4613: human lives that we know of, shaping their joys and sorrows even to the
4614: end.
4615: 
4616: Silas Marner’s determination to keep the “tramp’s child” was matter of
4617: hardly less surprise and iterated talk in the village than the robbery
4618: of his money. That softening of feeling towards him which dated from
4619: his misfortune, that merging of suspicion and dislike in a rather
4620: contemptuous pity for him as lone and crazy, was now accompanied with a
4621: more active sympathy, especially amongst the women. Notable mothers,
4622: who knew what it was to keep children “whole and sweet”; lazy mothers,
4623: who knew what it was to be interrupted in folding their arms and
4624: scratching their elbows by the mischievous propensities of children
4625: just firm on their legs, were equally interested in conjecturing how a
4626: lone man would manage with a two-year-old child on his hands, and were
4627: equally ready with their suggestions: the notable chiefly telling him
4628: what he had better do, and the lazy ones being emphatic in telling him
4629: what he would never be able to do.
4630: 
4631: Among the notable mothers, Dolly Winthrop was the one whose neighbourly
4632: offices were the most acceptable to Marner, for they were rendered
4633: without any show of bustling instruction. Silas had shown her the
4634: half-guinea given to him by Godfrey, and had asked her what he should
4635: do about getting some clothes for the child.
4636: 
4637: “Eh, Master Marner,” said Dolly, “there’s no call to buy, no more nor a
4638: pair o’ shoes; for I’ve got the little petticoats as Aaron wore five
4639: years ago, and it’s ill spending the money on them baby-clothes, for
4640: the child ’ull grow like grass i’ May, bless it—that it will.”
4641: 
4642: And the same day Dolly brought her bundle, and displayed to Marner, one
4643: by one, the tiny garments in their due order of succession, most of
4644: them patched and darned, but clean and neat as fresh-sprung herbs. This
4645: was the introduction to a great ceremony with soap and water, from
4646: which Baby came out in new beauty, and sat on Dolly’s knee, handling
4647: her toes and chuckling and patting her palms together with an air of
4648: having made several discoveries about herself, which she communicated
4649: by alternate sounds of “gug-gug-gug”, and “mammy”. The “mammy” was not
4650: a cry of need or uneasiness: Baby had been used to utter it without
4651: expecting either tender sound or touch to follow.
4652: 
4653: “Anybody ’ud think the angils in heaven couldn’t be prettier,” said
4654: Dolly, rubbing the golden curls and kissing them. “And to think of its
4655: being covered wi’ them dirty rags—and the poor mother—froze to death;
4656: but there’s Them as took care of it, and brought it to your door,
4657: Master Marner. The door was open, and it walked in over the snow, like
4658: as if it had been a little starved robin. Didn’t you say the door was
4659: open?”
4660: 
4661: “Yes,” said Silas, meditatively. “Yes—the door was open. The money’s
4662: gone I don’t know where, and this is come from I don’t know where.”
4663: 
4664: He had not mentioned to any one his unconsciousness of the child’s
4665: entrance, shrinking from questions which might lead to the fact he
4666: himself suspected—namely, that he had been in one of his trances.
4667: 
4668: “Ah,” said Dolly, with soothing gravity, “it’s like the night and the
4669: morning, and the sleeping and the waking, and the rain and the
4670: harvest—one goes and the other comes, and we know nothing how nor
4671: where. We may strive and scrat and fend, but it’s little we can do
4672: arter all—the big things come and go wi’ no striving o’ our’n—they do,
4673: that they do; and I think you’re in the right on it to keep the little
4674: un, Master Marner, seeing as it’s been sent to you, though there’s
4675: folks as thinks different. You’ll happen be a bit moithered with it
4676: while it’s so little; but I’ll come, and welcome, and see to it for
4677: you: I’ve a bit o’ time to spare most days, for when one gets up
4678: betimes i’ the morning, the clock seems to stan’ still tow’rt ten,
4679: afore it’s time to go about the victual. So, as I say, I’ll come and
4680: see to the child for you, and welcome.”
4681: 
4682: “Thank you... kindly,” said Silas, hesitating a little. “I’ll be glad
4683: if you’ll tell me things. But,” he added, uneasily, leaning forward to
4684: look at Baby with some jealousy, as she was resting her head backward
4685: against Dolly’s arm, and eyeing him contentedly from a distance—“But I
4686: want to do things for it myself, else it may get fond o’ somebody else,
4687: and not fond o’ me. I’ve been used to fending for myself in the house—I
4688: can learn, I can learn.”
4689: 
4690: “Eh, to be sure,” said Dolly, gently. “I’ve seen men as are wonderful
4691: handy wi’ children. The men are awk’ard and contrairy mostly, God help
4692: ’em—but when the drink’s out of ’em, they aren’t unsensible, though
4693: they’re bad for leeching and bandaging—so fiery and unpatient. You see
4694: this goes first, next the skin,” proceeded Dolly, taking up the little
4695: shirt, and putting it on.
4696: 
4697: “Yes,” said Marner, docilely, bringing his eyes very close, that they
4698: might be initiated in the mysteries; whereupon Baby seized his head
4699: with both her small arms, and put her lips against his face with
4700: purring noises.
4701: 
4702: “See there,” said Dolly, with a woman’s tender tact, “she’s fondest o’
4703: you. She wants to go o’ your lap, I’ll be bound. Go, then: take her,
4704: Master Marner; you can put the things on, and then you can say as
4705: you’ve done for her from the first of her coming to you.”
4706: 
4707: Marner took her on his lap, trembling with an emotion mysterious to
4708: himself, at something unknown dawning on his life. Thought and feeling
4709: were so confused within him, that if he had tried to give them
4710: utterance, he could only have said that the child was come instead of
4711: the gold—that the gold had turned into the child. He took the garments
4712: from Dolly, and put them on under her teaching; interrupted, of course,
4713: by Baby’s gymnastics.
4714: 
4715: “There, then! why, you take to it quite easy, Master Marner,” said
4716: Dolly; “but what shall you do when you’re forced to sit in your loom?
4717: For she’ll get busier and mischievouser every day—she will, bless her.
4718: It’s lucky as you’ve got that high hearth i’stead of a grate, for that
4719: keeps the fire more out of her reach: but if you’ve got anything as can
4720: be spilt or broke, or as is fit to cut her fingers off, she’ll be at
4721: it—and it is but right you should know.”
4722: 
4723: Silas meditated a little while in some perplexity. “I’ll tie her to the
4724: leg o’ the loom,” he said at last—“tie her with a good long strip o’
4725: something.”
4726: 
4727: “Well, mayhap that’ll do, as it’s a little gell, for they’re easier
4728: persuaded to sit i’ one place nor the lads. I know what the lads are;
4729: for I’ve had four—four I’ve had, God knows—and if you was to take and
4730: tie ’em up, they’d make a fighting and a crying as if you was ringing
4731: the pigs. But I’ll bring you my little chair, and some bits o’ red rag
4732: and things for her to play wi’; an’ she’ll sit and chatter to ’em as if
4733: they was alive. Eh, if it wasn’t a sin to the lads to wish ’em made
4734: different, bless ’em, I should ha’ been glad for one of ’em to be a
4735: little gell; and to think as I could ha’ taught her to scour, and mend,
4736: and the knitting, and everything. But I can teach ’em this little un,
4737: Master Marner, when she gets old enough.”
4738: 
4739: “But she’ll be _my_ little un,” said Marner, rather hastily. “She’ll be
4740: nobody else’s.”
4741: 
4742: “No, to be sure; you’ll have a right to her, if you’re a father to her,
4743: and bring her up according. But,” added Dolly, coming to a point which
4744: she had determined beforehand to touch upon, “you must bring her up
4745: like christened folks’s children, and take her to church, and let her
4746: learn her catechise, as my little Aaron can say off—the “I believe”,
4747: and everything, and “hurt nobody by word or deed”,—as well as if he was
4748: the clerk. That’s what you must do, Master Marner, if you’d do the
4749: right thing by the orphin child.”
4750: 
4751: Marner’s pale face flushed suddenly under a new anxiety. His mind was
4752: too busy trying to give some definite bearing to Dolly’s words for him
4753: to think of answering her.
4754: 
4755: “And it’s my belief,” she went on, “as the poor little creatur has
4756: never been christened, and it’s nothing but right as the parson should
4757: be spoke to; and if you was noways unwilling, I’d talk to Mr. Macey
4758: about it this very day. For if the child ever went anyways wrong, and
4759: you hadn’t done your part by it, Master Marner—’noculation, and
4760: everything to save it from harm—it ’ud be a thorn i’ your bed for ever
4761: o’ this side the grave; and I can’t think as it ’ud be easy lying down
4762: for anybody when they’d got to another world, if they hadn’t done their
4763: part by the helpless children as come wi’out their own asking.”
4764: 
4765: Dolly herself was disposed to be silent for some time now, for she had
4766: spoken from the depths of her own simple belief, and was much concerned
4767: to know whether her words would produce the desired effect on Silas. He
4768: was puzzled and anxious, for Dolly’s word “christened” conveyed no
4769: distinct meaning to him. He had only heard of baptism, and had only
4770: seen the baptism of grown-up men and women.
4771: 
4772: “What is it as you mean by “christened”?” he said at last, timidly.
4773: “Won’t folks be good to her without it?”
4774: 
4775: “Dear, dear! Master Marner,” said Dolly, with gentle distress and
4776: compassion. “Had you never no father nor mother as taught you to say
4777: your prayers, and as there’s good words and good things to keep us from
4778: harm?”
4779: 
4780: “Yes,” said Silas, in a low voice; “I know a deal about that—used to,
4781: used to. But your ways are different: my country was a good way off.”
4782: He paused a few moments, and then added, more decidedly, “But I want to
4783: do everything as can be done for the child. And whatever’s right for it
4784: i’ this country, and you think ’ull do it good, I’ll act according, if
4785: you’ll tell me.”
4786: 
4787: “Well, then, Master Marner,” said Dolly, inwardly rejoiced, “I’ll ask
4788: Mr. Macey to speak to the parson about it; and you must fix on a name
4789: for it, because it must have a name giv’ it when it’s christened.”
4790: 
4791: “My mother’s name was Hephzibah,” said Silas, “and my little sister was
4792: named after her.”
4793: 
4794: “Eh, that’s a hard name,” said Dolly. “I partly think it isn’t a
4795: christened name.”
4796: 
4797: “It’s a Bible name,” said Silas, old ideas recurring.
4798: 
4799: “Then I’ve no call to speak again’ it,” said Dolly, rather startled by
4800: Silas’s knowledge on this head; “but you see I’m no scholard, and I’m
4801: slow at catching the words. My husband says I’m allays like as if I was
4802: putting the haft for the handle—that’s what he says—for he’s very
4803: sharp, God help him. But it was awk’ard calling your little sister by
4804: such a hard name, when you’d got nothing big to say, like—wasn’t it,
4805: Master Marner?”
4806: 
4807: “We called her Eppie,” said Silas.
4808: 
4809: “Well, if it was noways wrong to shorten the name, it ’ud be a deal
4810: handier. And so I’ll go now, Master Marner, and I’ll speak about the
4811: christening afore dark; and I wish you the best o’ luck, and it’s my
4812: belief as it’ll come to you, if you do what’s right by the orphin
4813: child;—and there’s the ’noculation to be seen to; and as to washing its
4814: bits o’ things, you need look to nobody but me, for I can do ’em wi’
4815: one hand when I’ve got my suds about. Eh, the blessed angil! You’ll let
4816: me bring my Aaron one o’ these days, and he’ll show her his little cart
4817: as his father’s made for him, and the black-and-white pup as he’s got
4818: a-rearing.”
4819: 
4820: Baby _was_ christened, the rector deciding that a double baptism was
4821: the lesser risk to incur; and on this occasion Silas, making himself as
4822: clean and tidy as he could, appeared for the first time within the
4823: church, and shared in the observances held sacred by his neighbours. He
4824: was quite unable, by means of anything he heard or saw, to identify the
4825: Raveloe religion with his old faith; if he could at any time in his
4826: previous life have done so, it must have been by the aid of a strong
4827: feeling ready to vibrate with sympathy, rather than by a comparison of
4828: phrases and ideas: and now for long years that feeling had been
4829: dormant. He had no distinct idea about the baptism and the
4830: church-going, except that Dolly had said it was for the good of the
4831: child; and in this way, as the weeks grew to months, the child created
4832: fresh and fresh links between his life and the lives from which he had
4833: hitherto shrunk continually into narrower isolation. Unlike the gold
4834: which needed nothing, and must be worshipped in close-locked
4835: solitude—which was hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song
4836: of birds, and started to no human tones—Eppie was a creature of endless
4837: claims and ever-growing desires, seeking and loving sunshine, and
4838: living sounds, and living movements; making trial of everything, with
4839: trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in all eyes that
4840: looked on her. The gold had kept his thoughts in an ever-repeated
4841: circle, leading to nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object
4842: compacted of changes and hopes that forced his thoughts onward, and
4843: carried them far away from their old eager pacing towards the same
4844: blank limit—carried them away to the new things that would come with
4845: the coming years, when Eppie would have learned to understand how her
4846: father Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of that time
4847: in the ties and charities that bound together the families of his
4848: neighbours. The gold had asked that he should sit weaving longer and
4849: longer, deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the
4850: monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web; but Eppie called
4851: him away from his weaving, and made him think all its pauses a holiday,
4852: reawakening his senses with her fresh life, even to the old
4853: winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early spring sunshine, and
4854: warming him into joy because _she_ had joy.
4855: 
4856: And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting, so that the buttercups
4857: were thick in the meadows, Silas might be seen in the sunny midday, or
4858: in the late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening under the
4859: hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered head to carry Eppie beyond the
4860: Stone-pits to where the flowers grew, till they reached some favourite
4861: bank where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to pluck the flowers,
4862: and make remarks to the winged things that murmured happily above the
4863: bright petals, calling “Dad-dad’s” attention continually by bringing
4864: him the flowers. Then she would turn her ear to some sudden bird-note,
4865: and Silas learned to please her by making signs of hushed stillness,
4866: that they might listen for the note to come again: so that when it
4867: came, she set up her small back and laughed with gurgling triumph.
4868: Sitting on the banks in this way, Silas began to look for the once
4869: familiar herbs again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline
4870: and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of crowding
4871: remembrances from which he turned away timidly, taking refuge in
4872: Eppie’s little world, that lay lightly on his enfeebled spirit.
4873: 
4874: As the child’s mind was growing into knowledge, his mind was growing
4875: into memory: as her life unfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold
4876: narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full
4877: consciousness.
4878: 
4879: It was an influence which must gather force with every new year: the
4880: tones that stirred Silas’s heart grew articulate, and called for more
4881: distinct answers; shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie’s eyes and
4882: ears, and there was more that “Dad-dad” was imperatively required to
4883: notice and account for. Also, by the time Eppie was three years old,
4884: she developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for devising ingenious
4885: ways of being troublesome, which found much exercise, not only for
4886: Silas’s patience, but for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was
4887: poor Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible demands of
4888: love. Dolly Winthrop told him that punishment was good for Eppie, and
4889: that, as for rearing a child without making it tingle a little in soft
4890: and safe places now and then, it was not to be done.
4891: 
4892: “To be sure, there’s another thing you might do, Master Marner,” added
4893: Dolly, meditatively: “you might shut her up once i’ the coal-hole. That
4894: was what I did wi’ Aaron; for I was that silly wi’ the youngest lad, as
4895: I could never bear to smack him. Not as I could find i’ my heart to let
4896: him stay i’ the coal-hole more nor a minute, but it was enough to colly
4897: him all over, so as he must be new washed and dressed, and it was as
4898: good as a rod to him—that was. But I put it upo’ your conscience,
4899: Master Marner, as there’s one of ’em you must choose—ayther smacking or
4900: the coal-hole—else she’ll get so masterful, there’ll be no holding
4901: her.”
4902: 
4903: Silas was impressed with the melancholy truth of this last remark; but
4904: his force of mind failed before the only two penal methods open to him,
4905: not only because it was painful to him to hurt Eppie, but because he
4906: trembled at a moment’s contention with her, lest she should love him
4907: the less for it. Let even an affectionate Goliath get himself tied to a
4908: small tender thing, dreading to hurt it by pulling, and dreading still
4909: more to snap the cord, and which of the two, pray, will be master? It
4910: was clear that Eppie, with her short toddling steps, must lead father
4911: Silas a pretty dance on any fine morning when circumstances favoured
4912: mischief.
4913: 
4914: For example. He had wisely chosen a broad strip of linen as a means of
4915: fastening her to his loom when he was busy: it made a broad belt round
4916: her waist, and was long enough to allow of her reaching the truckle-bed
4917: and sitting down on it, but not long enough for her to attempt any
4918: dangerous climbing. One bright summer’s morning Silas had been more
4919: engrossed than usual in “setting up” a new piece of work, an occasion
4920: on which his scissors were in requisition. These scissors, owing to an
4921: especial warning of Dolly’s, had been kept carefully out of Eppie’s
4922: reach; but the click of them had had a peculiar attraction for her ear,
4923: and watching the results of that click, she had derived the philosophic
4924: lesson that the same cause would produce the same effect. Silas had
4925: seated himself in his loom, and the noise of weaving had begun; but he
4926: had left his scissors on a ledge which Eppie’s arm was long enough to
4927: reach; and now, like a small mouse, watching her opportunity, she stole
4928: quietly from her corner, secured the scissors, and toddled to the bed
4929: again, setting up her back as a mode of concealing the fact. She had a
4930: distinct intention as to the use of the scissors; and having cut the
4931: linen strip in a jagged but effectual manner, in two moments she had
4932: run out at the open door where the sunshine was inviting her, while
4933: poor Silas believed her to be a better child than usual. It was not
4934: until he happened to need his scissors that the terrible fact burst
4935: upon him: Eppie had run out by herself—had perhaps fallen into the
4936: Stone-pit. Silas, shaken by the worst fear that could have befallen
4937: him, rushed out, calling “Eppie!” and ran eagerly about the unenclosed
4938: space, exploring the dry cavities into which she might have fallen, and
4939: then gazing with questioning dread at the smooth red surface of the
4940: water. The cold drops stood on his brow. How long had she been out?
4941: There was one hope—that she had crept through the stile and got into
4942: the fields, where he habitually took her to stroll. But the grass was
4943: high in the meadow, and there was no descrying her, if she were there,
4944: except by a close search that would be a trespass on Mr. Osgood’s crop.
4945: Still, that misdemeanour must be committed; and poor Silas, after
4946: peering all round the hedgerows, traversed the grass, beginning with
4947: perturbed vision to see Eppie behind every group of red sorrel, and to
4948: see her moving always farther off as he approached. The meadow was
4949: searched in vain; and he got over the stile into the next field,
4950: looking with dying hope towards a small pond which was now reduced to
4951: its summer shallowness, so as to leave a wide margin of good adhesive
4952: mud. Here, however, sat Eppie, discoursing cheerfully to her own small
4953: boot, which she was using as a bucket to convey the water into a deep
4954: hoof-mark, while her little naked foot was planted comfortably on a
4955: cushion of olive-green mud. A red-headed calf was observing her with
4956: alarmed doubt through the opposite hedge.
4957: 
4958: Here was clearly a case of aberration in a christened child which
4959: demanded severe treatment; but Silas, overcome with convulsive joy at
4960: finding his treasure again, could do nothing but snatch her up, and
4961: cover her with half-sobbing kisses. It was not until he had carried her
4962: home, and had begun to think of the necessary washing, that he
4963: recollected the need that he should punish Eppie, and “make her
4964: remember”. The idea that she might run away again and come to harm,
4965: gave him unusual resolution, and for the first time he determined to
4966: try the coal-hole—a small closet near the hearth.
4967: 
4968: “Naughty, naughty Eppie,” he suddenly began, holding her on his knee,
4969: and pointing to her muddy feet and clothes—“naughty to cut with the
4970: scissors and run away. Eppie must go into the coal-hole for being
4971: naughty. Daddy must put her in the coal-hole.”
4972: 
4973: He half-expected that this would be shock enough, and that Eppie would
4974: begin to cry. But instead of that, she began to shake herself on his
4975: knee, as if the proposition opened a pleasing novelty. Seeing that he
4976: must proceed to extremities, he put her into the coal-hole, and held
4977: the door closed, with a trembling sense that he was using a strong
4978: measure. For a moment there was silence, but then came a little cry,
4979: “Opy, opy!” and Silas let her out again, saying, “Now Eppie ’ull never
4980: be naughty again, else she must go in the coal-hole—a black naughty
4981: place.”
4982: 
4983: The weaving must stand still a long while this morning, for now Eppie
4984: must be washed, and have clean clothes on; but it was to be hoped that
4985: this punishment would have a lasting effect, and save time in
4986: future—though, perhaps, it would have been better if Eppie had cried
4987: more.
4988: 
4989: In half an hour she was clean again, and Silas having turned his back
4990: to see what he could do with the linen band, threw it down again, with
4991: the reflection that Eppie would be good without fastening for the rest
4992: of the morning. He turned round again, and was going to place her in
4993: her little chair near the loom, when she peeped out at him with black
4994: face and hands again, and said, “Eppie in de toal-hole!”
4995: 
4996: This total failure of the coal-hole discipline shook Silas’s belief in
4997: the efficacy of punishment. “She’d take it all for fun,” he observed to
4998: Dolly, “if I didn’t hurt her, and that I can’t do, Mrs. Winthrop. If
4999: she makes me a bit o’ trouble, I can bear it. And she’s got no tricks
5000: but what she’ll grow out of.”
5001: 
5002: “Well, that’s partly true, Master Marner,” said Dolly, sympathetically;
5003: “and if you can’t bring your mind to frighten her off touching things,
5004: you must do what you can to keep ’em out of her way. That’s what I do
5005: wi’ the pups as the lads are allays a-rearing. They _will_ worry and
5006: gnaw—worry and gnaw they will, if it was one’s Sunday cap as hung
5007: anywhere so as they could drag it. They know no difference, God help
5008: ’em: it’s the pushing o’ the teeth as sets ’em on, that’s what it is.”
5009: 
5010: So Eppie was reared without punishment, the burden of her misdeeds
5011: being borne vicariously by father Silas. The stone hut was made a soft
5012: nest for her, lined with downy patience: and also in the world that lay
5013: beyond the stone hut she knew nothing of frowns and denials.
5014: 
5015: Notwithstanding the difficulty of carrying her and his yarn or linen at
5016: the same time, Silas took her with him in most of his journeys to the
5017: farmhouses, unwilling to leave her behind at Dolly Winthrop’s, who was
5018: always ready to take care of her; and little curly-headed Eppie, the
5019: weaver’s child, became an object of interest at several outlying
5020: homesteads, as well as in the village. Hitherto he had been treated
5021: very much as if he had been a useful gnome or brownie—a queer and
5022: unaccountable creature, who must necessarily be looked at with
5023: wondering curiosity and repulsion, and with whom one would be glad to
5024: make all greetings and bargains as brief as possible, but who must be
5025: dealt with in a propitiatory way, and occasionally have a present of
5026: pork or garden stuff to carry home with him, seeing that without him
5027: there was no getting the yarn woven. But now Silas met with open
5028: smiling faces and cheerful questioning, as a person whose satisfactions
5029: and difficulties could be understood. Everywhere he must sit a little
5030: and talk about the child, and words of interest were always ready for
5031: him: “Ah, Master Marner, you’ll be lucky if she takes the measles soon
5032: and easy!”—or, “Why, there isn’t many lone men ’ud ha’ been wishing to
5033: take up with a little un like that: but I reckon the weaving makes you
5034: handier than men as do out-door work—you’re partly as handy as a woman,
5035: for weaving comes next to spinning.” Elderly masters and mistresses,
5036: seated observantly in large kitchen arm-chairs, shook their heads over
5037: the difficulties attendant on rearing children, felt Eppie’s round arms
5038: and legs, and pronounced them remarkably firm, and told Silas that, if
5039: she turned out well (which, however, there was no telling), it would be
5040: a fine thing for him to have a steady lass to do for him when he got
5041: helpless. Servant maidens were fond of carrying her out to look at the
5042: hens and chickens, or to see if any cherries could be shaken down in
5043: the orchard; and the small boys and girls approached her slowly, with
5044: cautious movement and steady gaze, like little dogs face to face with
5045: one of their own kind, till attraction had reached the point at which
5046: the soft lips were put out for a kiss. No child was afraid of
5047: approaching Silas when Eppie was near him: there was no repulsion
5048: around him now, either for young or old; for the little child had come
5049: to link him once more with the whole world. There was love between him
5050: and the child that blent them into one, and there was love between the
5051: child and the world—from men and women with parental looks and tones,
5052: to the red lady-birds and the round pebbles.
5053: 
5054: Silas began now to think of Raveloe life entirely in relation to Eppie:
5055: she must have everything that was a good in Raveloe; and he listened
5056: docilely, that he might come to understand better what this life was,
5057: from which, for fifteen years, he had stood aloof as from a strange
5058: thing, with which he could have no communion: as some man who has a
5059: precious plant to which he would give a nurturing home in a new soil,
5060: thinks of the rain, and the sunshine, and all influences, in relation
5061: to his nursling, and asks industriously for all knowledge that will
5062: help him to satisfy the wants of the searching roots, or to guard leaf
5063: and bud from invading harm. The disposition to hoard had been utterly
5064: crushed at the very first by the loss of his long-stored gold: the
5065: coins he earned afterwards seemed as irrelevant as stones brought to
5066: complete a house suddenly buried by an earthquake; the sense of
5067: bereavement was too heavy upon him for the old thrill of satisfaction
5068: to arise again at the touch of the newly-earned coin. And now something
5069: had come to replace his hoard which gave a growing purpose to the
5070: earnings, drawing his hope and joy continually onward beyond the money.
5071: 
5072: In old days there were angels who came and took men by the hand and led
5073: them away from the city of destruction. We see no white-winged angels
5074: now. But yet men are led away from threatening destruction: a hand is
5075: put into theirs, which leads them forth gently towards a calm and
5076: bright land, so that they look no more backward; and the hand may be a
5077: little child’s.
5078: 
5079: 
5080: 
5081: CHAPTER XV.
5082: 
5083: There was one person, as you will believe, who watched with keener
5084: though more hidden interest than any other, the prosperous growth of
5085: Eppie under the weaver’s care. He dared not do anything that would
5086: imply a stronger interest in a poor man’s adopted child than could be
5087: expected from the kindliness of the young Squire, when a chance meeting
5088: suggested a little present to a simple old fellow whom others noticed
5089: with goodwill; but he told himself that the time would come when he
5090: might do something towards furthering the welfare of his daughter
5091: without incurring suspicion. Was he very uneasy in the meantime at his
5092: inability to give his daughter her birthright? I cannot say that he
5093: was. The child was being taken care of, and would very likely be happy,
5094: as people in humble stations often were—happier, perhaps, than those
5095: brought up in luxury.
5096: 
5097: That famous ring that pricked its owner when he forgot duty and
5098: followed desire—I wonder if it pricked very hard when he set out on the
5099: chase, or whether it pricked but lightly then, and only pierced to the
5100: quick when the chase had long been ended, and hope, folding her wings,
5101: looked backward and became regret?
5102: 
5103: Godfrey Cass’s cheek and eye were brighter than ever now. He was so
5104: undivided in his aims, that he seemed like a man of firmness. No Dunsey
5105: had come back: people had made up their minds that he was gone for a
5106: soldier, or gone “out of the country”, and no one cared to be specific
5107: in their inquiries on a subject delicate to a respectable family.
5108: Godfrey had ceased to see the shadow of Dunsey across his path; and the
5109: path now lay straight forward to the accomplishment of his best,
5110: longest-cherished wishes. Everybody said Mr. Godfrey had taken the
5111: right turn; and it was pretty clear what would be the end of things,
5112: for there were not many days in the week that he was not seen riding to
5113: the Warrens. Godfrey himself, when he was asked jocosely if the day had
5114: been fixed, smiled with the pleasant consciousness of a lover who could
5115: say “yes”, if he liked. He felt a reformed man, delivered from
5116: temptation; and the vision of his future life seemed to him as a
5117: promised land for which he had no cause to fight. He saw himself with
5118: all his happiness centred on his own hearth, while Nancy would smile on
5119: him as he played with the children.
5120: 
5121: And that other child—not on the hearth—he would not forget it; he would
5122: see that it was well provided for. That was a father’s duty.
5123: 
5124: 
5125: 
5126: PART II.
5127: 
5128: 
5129: 
5130: CHAPTER XVI.
5131: 
5132: It was a bright autumn Sunday, sixteen years after Silas Marner had
5133: found his new treasure on the hearth. The bells of the old Raveloe
5134: church were ringing the cheerful peal which told that the morning
5135: service was ended; and out of the arched doorway in the tower came
5136: slowly, retarded by friendly greetings and questions, the richer
5137: parishioners who had chosen this bright Sunday morning as eligible for
5138: church-going. It was the rural fashion of that time for the more
5139: important members of the congregation to depart first, while their
5140: humbler neighbours waited and looked on, stroking their bent heads or
5141: dropping their curtsies to any large ratepayer who turned to notice
5142: them.
5143: 
5144: Foremost among these advancing groups of well-clad people, there are
5145: some whom we shall recognize, in spite of Time, who has laid his hand
5146: on them all. The tall blond man of forty is not much changed in feature
5147: from the Godfrey Cass of six-and-twenty: he is only fuller in flesh,
5148: and has only lost the indefinable look of youth—a loss which is marked
5149: even when the eye is undulled and the wrinkles are not yet come.
5150: Perhaps the pretty woman, not much younger than he, who is leaning on
5151: his arm, is more changed than her husband: the lovely bloom that used
5152: to be always on her cheek now comes but fitfully, with the fresh
5153: morning air or with some strong surprise; yet to all who love human
5154: faces best for what they tell of human experience, Nancy’s beauty has a
5155: heightened interest. Often the soul is ripened into fuller goodness
5156: while age has spread an ugly film, so that mere glances can never
5157: divine the preciousness of the fruit. But the years have not been so
5158: cruel to Nancy. The firm yet placid mouth, the clear veracious glance
5159: of the brown eyes, speak now of a nature that has been tested and has
5160: kept its highest qualities; and even the costume, with its dainty
5161: neatness and purity, has more significance now the coquetries of youth
5162: can have nothing to do with it.
5163: 
5164: Mr. and Mrs. Godfrey Cass (any higher title has died away from Raveloe
5165: lips since the old Squire was gathered to his fathers and his
5166: inheritance was divided) have turned round to look for the tall aged
5167: man and the plainly dressed woman who are a little behind—Nancy having
5168: observed that they must wait for “father and Priscilla”—and now they
5169: all turn into a narrower path leading across the churchyard to a small
5170: gate opposite the Red House. We will not follow them now; for may there
5171: not be some others in this departing congregation whom we should like
5172: to see again—some of those who are not likely to be handsomely clad,
5173: and whom we may not recognize so easily as the master and mistress of
5174: the Red House?
5175: 
5176: But it is impossible to mistake Silas Marner. His large brown eyes seem
5177: to have gathered a longer vision, as is the way with eyes that have
5178: been short-sighted in early life, and they have a less vague, a more
5179: answering gaze; but in everything else one sees signs of a frame much
5180: enfeebled by the lapse of the sixteen years. The weaver’s bent
5181: shoulders and white hair give him almost the look of advanced age,
5182: though he is not more than five-and-fifty; but there is the freshest
5183: blossom of youth close by his side—a blonde dimpled girl of eighteen,
5184: who has vainly tried to chastise her curly auburn hair into smoothness
5185: under her brown bonnet: the hair ripples as obstinately as a brooklet
5186: under the March breeze, and the little ringlets burst away from the
5187: restraining comb behind and show themselves below the bonnet-crown.
5188: Eppie cannot help being rather vexed about her hair, for there is no
5189: other girl in Raveloe who has hair at all like it, and she thinks hair
5190: ought to be smooth. She does not like to be blameworthy even in small
5191: things: you see how neatly her prayer-book is folded in her spotted
5192: handkerchief.
5193: 
5194: That good-looking young fellow, in a new fustian suit, who walks behind
5195: her, is not quite sure upon the question of hair in the abstract, when
5196: Eppie puts it to him, and thinks that perhaps straight hair is the best
5197: in general, but he doesn’t want Eppie’s hair to be different. She
5198: surely divines that there is some one behind her who is thinking about
5199: her very particularly, and mustering courage to come to her side as
5200: soon as they are out in the lane, else why should she look rather shy,
5201: and take care not to turn away her head from her father Silas, to whom
5202: she keeps murmuring little sentences as to who was at church and who
5203: was not at church, and how pretty the red mountain-ash is over the
5204: Rectory wall?
5205: 
5206: “I wish _we_ had a little garden, father, with double daisies in, like
5207: Mrs. Winthrop’s,” said Eppie, when they were out in the lane; “only
5208: they say it ’ud take a deal of digging and bringing fresh soil—and you
5209: couldn’t do that, could you, father? Anyhow, I shouldn’t like you to do
5210: it, for it ’ud be too hard work for you.”
5211: 
5212: “Yes, I could do it, child, if you want a bit o’ garden: these long
5213: evenings, I could work at taking in a little bit o’ the waste, just
5214: enough for a root or two o’ flowers for you; and again, i’ the morning,
5215: I could have a turn wi’ the spade before I sat down to the loom. Why
5216: didn’t you tell me before as you wanted a bit o’ garden?”
5217: 
5218: “_I_ can dig it for you, Master Marner,” said the young man in fustian,
5219: who was now by Eppie’s side, entering into the conversation without the
5220: trouble of formalities. “It’ll be play to me after I’ve done my day’s
5221: work, or any odd bits o’ time when the work’s slack. And I’ll bring you
5222: some soil from Mr. Cass’s garden—he’ll let me, and willing.”
5223: 
5224: “Eh, Aaron, my lad, are you there?” said Silas; “I wasn’t aware of you;
5225: for when Eppie’s talking o’ things, I see nothing but what she’s
5226: a-saying. Well, if you could help me with the digging, we might get her
5227: a bit o’ garden all the sooner.”
5228: 
5229: “Then, if you think well and good,” said Aaron, “I’ll come to the
5230: Stone-pits this afternoon, and we’ll settle what land’s to be taken in,
5231: and I’ll get up an hour earlier i’ the morning, and begin on it.”
5232: 
5233: “But not if you don’t promise me not to work at the hard digging,
5234: father,” said Eppie. “For I shouldn’t ha’ said anything about it,” she
5235: added, half-bashfully, half-roguishly, “only Mrs. Winthrop said as
5236: Aaron ’ud be so good, and—”
5237: 
5238: “And you might ha’ known it without mother telling you,” said Aaron.
5239: “And Master Marner knows too, I hope, as I’m able and willing to do a
5240: turn o’ work for him, and he won’t do me the unkindness to anyways take
5241: it out o’ my hands.”
5242: 
5243: “There, now, father, you won’t work in it till it’s all easy,” said
5244: Eppie, “and you and me can mark out the beds, and make holes and plant
5245: the roots. It’ll be a deal livelier at the Stone-pits when we’ve got
5246: some flowers, for I always think the flowers can see us and know what
5247: we’re talking about. And I’ll have a bit o’ rosemary, and bergamot, and
5248: thyme, because they’re so sweet-smelling; but there’s no lavender only
5249: in the gentlefolks’ gardens, I think.”
5250: 
5251: “That’s no reason why you shouldn’t have some,” said Aaron, “for I can
5252: bring you slips of anything; I’m forced to cut no end of ’em when I’m
5253: gardening, and throw ’em away mostly. There’s a big bed o’ lavender at
5254: the Red House: the missis is very fond of it.”
5255: 
5256: “Well,” said Silas, gravely, “so as you don’t make free for us, or ask
5257: for anything as is worth much at the Red House: for Mr. Cass’s been so
5258: good to us, and built us up the new end o’ the cottage, and given us
5259: beds and things, as I couldn’t abide to be imposin’ for garden-stuff or
5260: anything else.”
5261: 
5262: “No, no, there’s no imposin’,” said Aaron; “there’s never a garden in
5263: all the parish but what there’s endless waste in it for want o’
5264: somebody as could use everything up. It’s what I think to myself
5265: sometimes, as there need nobody run short o’ victuals if the land was
5266: made the most on, and there was never a morsel but what could find its
5267: way to a mouth. It sets one thinking o’ that—gardening does. But I must
5268: go back now, else mother ’ull be in trouble as I aren’t there.”
5269: 
5270: “Bring her with you this afternoon, Aaron,” said Eppie; “I shouldn’t
5271: like to fix about the garden, and her not know everything from the
5272: first—should _you_, father?”
5273: 
5274: “Aye, bring her if you can, Aaron,” said Silas; “she’s sure to have a
5275: word to say as’ll help us to set things on their right end.”
5276: 
5277: Aaron turned back up the village, while Silas and Eppie went on up the
5278: lonely sheltered lane.
5279: 
5280: “O daddy!” she began, when they were in privacy, clasping and squeezing
5281: Silas’s arm, and skipping round to give him an energetic kiss. “My
5282: little old daddy! I’m so glad. I don’t think I shall want anything else
5283: when we’ve got a little garden; and I knew Aaron would dig it for us,”
5284: she went on with roguish triumph—“I knew that very well.”
5285: 
5286: “You’re a deep little puss, you are,” said Silas, with the mild passive
5287: happiness of love-crowned age in his face; “but you’ll make yourself
5288: fine and beholden to Aaron.”
5289: 
5290: “Oh, no, I shan’t,” said Eppie, laughing and frisking; “he likes it.”
5291: 
5292: “Come, come, let me carry your prayer-book, else you’ll be dropping it,
5293: jumping i’ that way.”
5294: 
5295: Eppie was now aware that her behaviour was under observation, but it
5296: was only the observation of a friendly donkey, browsing with a log
5297: fastened to his foot—a meek donkey, not scornfully critical of human
5298: trivialities, but thankful to share in them, if possible, by getting
5299: his nose scratched; and Eppie did not fail to gratify him with her
5300: usual notice, though it was attended with the inconvenience of his
5301: following them, painfully, up to the very door of their home.
5302: 
5303: But the sound of a sharp bark inside, as Eppie put the key in the door,
5304: modified the donkey’s views, and he limped away again without bidding.
5305: The sharp bark was the sign of an excited welcome that was awaiting
5306: them from a knowing brown terrier, who, after dancing at their legs in
5307: a hysterical manner, rushed with a worrying noise at a tortoise-shell
5308: kitten under the loom, and then rushed back with a sharp bark again, as
5309: much as to say, “I have done my duty by this feeble creature, you
5310: perceive”; while the lady-mother of the kitten sat sunning her white
5311: bosom in the window, and looked round with a sleepy air of expecting
5312: caresses, though she was not going to take any trouble for them.
5313: 
5314: The presence of this happy animal life was not the only change which
5315: had come over the interior of the stone cottage. There was no bed now
5316: in the living-room, and the small space was well filled with decent
5317: furniture, all bright and clean enough to satisfy Dolly Winthrop’s eye.
5318: The oaken table and three-cornered oaken chair were hardly what was
5319: likely to be seen in so poor a cottage: they had come, with the beds
5320: and other things, from the Red House; for Mr. Godfrey Cass, as every
5321: one said in the village, did very kindly by the weaver; and it was
5322: nothing but right a man should be looked on and helped by those who
5323: could afford it, when he had brought up an orphan child, and been
5324: father and mother to her—and had lost his money too, so as he had
5325: nothing but what he worked for week by week, and when the weaving was
5326: going down too—for there was less and less flax spun—and Master Marner
5327: was none so young. Nobody was jealous of the weaver, for he was
5328: regarded as an exceptional person, whose claims on neighbourly help
5329: were not to be matched in Raveloe. Any superstition that remained
5330: concerning him had taken an entirely new colour; and Mr. Macey, now a
5331: very feeble old man of fourscore and six, never seen except in his
5332: chimney-corner or sitting in the sunshine at his door-sill, was of
5333: opinion that when a man had done what Silas had done by an orphan
5334: child, it was a sign that his money would come to light again, or
5335: leastwise that the robber would be made to answer for it—for, as Mr.
5336: Macey observed of himself, his faculties were as strong as ever.
5337: 
5338: Silas sat down now and watched Eppie with a satisfied gaze as she
5339: spread the clean cloth, and set on it the potato-pie, warmed up slowly
5340: in a safe Sunday fashion, by being put into a dry pot over a
5341: slowly-dying fire, as the best substitute for an oven. For Silas would
5342: not consent to have a grate and oven added to his conveniences: he
5343: loved the old brick hearth as he had loved his brown pot—and was it not
5344: there when he had found Eppie? The gods of the hearth exist for us
5345: still; and let all new faith be tolerant of that fetishism, lest it
5346: bruise its own roots.
5347: 
5348: Silas ate his dinner more silently than usual, soon laying down his
5349: knife and fork, and watching half-abstractedly Eppie’s play with Snap
5350: and the cat, by which her own dining was made rather a lengthy
5351: business. Yet it was a sight that might well arrest wandering thoughts:
5352: Eppie, with the rippling radiance of her hair and the whiteness of her
5353: rounded chin and throat set off by the dark-blue cotton gown, laughing
5354: merrily as the kitten held on with her four claws to one shoulder, like
5355: a design for a jug-handle, while Snap on the right hand and Puss on the
5356: other put up their paws towards a morsel which she held out of the
5357: reach of both—Snap occasionally desisting in order to remonstrate with
5358: the cat by a cogent worrying growl on the greediness and futility of
5359: her conduct; till Eppie relented, caressed them both, and divided the
5360: morsel between them.
5361: 
5362: But at last Eppie, glancing at the clock, checked the play, and said,
5363: “O daddy, you’re wanting to go into the sunshine to smoke your pipe.
5364: But I must clear away first, so as the house may be tidy when godmother
5365: comes. I’ll make haste—I won’t be long.”
5366: 
5367: Silas had taken to smoking a pipe daily during the last two years,
5368: having been strongly urged to it by the sages of Raveloe, as a practice
5369: “good for the fits”; and this advice was sanctioned by Dr. Kimble, on
5370: the ground that it was as well to try what could do no harm—a principle
5371: which was made to answer for a great deal of work in that gentleman’s
5372: medical practice. Silas did not highly enjoy smoking, and often
5373: wondered how his neighbours could be so fond of it; but a humble sort
5374: of acquiescence in what was held to be good, had become a strong habit
5375: of that new self which had been developed in him since he had found
5376: Eppie on his hearth: it had been the only clew his bewildered mind
5377: could hold by in cherishing this young life that had been sent to him
5378: out of the darkness into which his gold had departed. By seeking what
5379: was needful for Eppie, by sharing the effect that everything produced
5380: on her, he had himself come to appropriate the forms of custom and
5381: belief which were the mould of Raveloe life; and as, with reawakening
5382: sensibilities, memory also reawakened, he had begun to ponder over the
5383: elements of his old faith, and blend them with his new impressions,
5384: till he recovered a consciousness of unity between his past and
5385: present. The sense of presiding goodness and the human trust which come
5386: with all pure peace and joy, had given him a dim impression that there
5387: had been some error, some mistake, which had thrown that dark shadow
5388: over the days of his best years; and as it grew more and more easy to
5389: him to open his mind to Dolly Winthrop, he gradually communicated to
5390: her all he could describe of his early life. The communication was
5391: necessarily a slow and difficult process, for Silas’s meagre power of
5392: explanation was not aided by any readiness of interpretation in Dolly,
5393: whose narrow outward experience gave her no key to strange customs, and
5394: made every novelty a source of wonder that arrested them at every step
5395: of the narrative. It was only by fragments, and at intervals which left
5396: Dolly time to revolve what she had heard till it acquired some
5397: familiarity for her, that Silas at last arrived at the climax of the
5398: sad story—the drawing of lots, and its false testimony concerning him;
5399: and this had to be repeated in several interviews, under new questions
5400: on her part as to the nature of this plan for detecting the guilty and
5401: clearing the innocent.
5402: 
5403: “And yourn’s the same Bible, you’re sure o’ that, Master Marner—the
5404: Bible as you brought wi’ you from that country—it’s the same as what
5405: they’ve got at church, and what Eppie’s a-learning to read in?”
5406: 
5407: “Yes,” said Silas, “every bit the same; and there’s drawing o’ lots in
5408: the Bible, mind you,” he added in a lower tone.
5409: 
5410: “Oh, dear, dear,” said Dolly in a grieved voice, as if she were hearing
5411: an unfavourable report of a sick man’s case. She was silent for some
5412: minutes; at last she said—
5413: 
5414: “There’s wise folks, happen, as know how it all is; the parson knows,
5415: I’ll be bound; but it takes big words to tell them things, and such as
5416: poor folks can’t make much out on. I can never rightly know the meaning
5417: o’ what I hear at church, only a bit here and there, but I know it’s
5418: good words—I do. But what lies upo’ your mind—it’s this, Master Marner:
5419: as, if Them above had done the right thing by you, They’d never ha’ let
5420: you be turned out for a wicked thief when you was innicent.”
5421: 
5422: “Ah!” said Silas, who had now come to understand Dolly’s phraseology,
5423: “that was what fell on me like as if it had been red-hot iron; because,
5424: you see, there was nobody as cared for me or clave to me above nor
5425: below. And him as I’d gone out and in wi’ for ten year and more, since
5426: when we was lads and went halves—mine own familiar friend in whom I
5427: trusted, had lifted up his heel again’ me, and worked to ruin me.”
5428: 
5429: “Eh, but he was a bad un—I can’t think as there’s another such,” said
5430: Dolly. “But I’m o’ercome, Master Marner; I’m like as if I’d waked and
5431: didn’t know whether it was night or morning. I feel somehow as sure as
5432: I do when I’ve laid something up though I can’t justly put my hand on
5433: it, as there was a rights in what happened to you, if one could but
5434: make it out; and you’d no call to lose heart as you did. But we’ll talk
5435: on it again; for sometimes things come into my head when I’m leeching
5436: or poulticing, or such, as I could never think on when I was sitting
5437: still.”
5438: 
5439: Dolly was too useful a woman not to have many opportunities of
5440: illumination of the kind she alluded to, and she was not long before
5441: she recurred to the subject.
5442: 
5443: “Master Marner,” she said, one day that she came to bring home Eppie’s
5444: washing, “I’ve been sore puzzled for a good bit wi’ that trouble o’
5445: yourn and the drawing o’ lots; and it got twisted back’ards and
5446: for’ards, as I didn’t know which end to lay hold on. But it come to me
5447: all clear like, that night when I was sitting up wi’ poor Bessy Fawkes,
5448: as is dead and left her children behind, God help ’em—it come to me as
5449: clear as daylight; but whether I’ve got hold on it now, or can anyways
5450: bring it to my tongue’s end, that I don’t know. For I’ve often a deal
5451: inside me as’ll never come out; and for what you talk o’ your folks in
5452: your old country niver saying prayers by heart nor saying ’em out of a
5453: book, they must be wonderful cliver; for if I didn’t know “Our Father”,
5454: and little bits o’ good words as I can carry out o’ church wi’ me, I
5455: might down o’ my knees every night, but nothing could I say.”
5456: 
5457: “But you can mostly say something as I can make sense on, Mrs.
5458: Winthrop,” said Silas.
5459: 
5460: “Well, then, Master Marner, it come to me summat like this: I can make
5461: nothing o’ the drawing o’ lots and the answer coming wrong; it ’ud
5462: mayhap take the parson to tell that, and he could only tell us i’ big
5463: words. But what come to me as clear as the daylight, it was when I was
5464: troubling over poor Bessy Fawkes, and it allays comes into my head when
5465: I’m sorry for folks, and feel as I can’t do a power to help ’em, not if
5466: I was to get up i’ the middle o’ the night—it comes into my head as
5467: Them above has got a deal tenderer heart nor what I’ve got—for I can’t
5468: be anyways better nor Them as made me; and if anything looks hard to
5469: me, it’s because there’s things I don’t know on; and for the matter o’
5470: that, there may be plenty o’ things I don’t know on, for it’s little as
5471: I know—that it is. And so, while I was thinking o’ that, you come into
5472: my mind, Master Marner, and it all come pouring in:—if _I_ felt i’ my
5473: inside what was the right and just thing by you, and them as prayed and
5474: drawed the lots, all but that wicked un, if _they_’d ha’ done the right
5475: thing by you if they could, isn’t there Them as was at the making on
5476: us, and knows better and has a better will? And that’s all as ever I
5477: can be sure on, and everything else is a big puzzle to me when I think
5478: on it. For there was the fever come and took off them as were
5479: full-growed, and left the helpless children; and there’s the breaking
5480: o’ limbs; and them as ’ud do right and be sober have to suffer by them
5481: as are contrairy—eh, there’s trouble i’ this world, and there’s things
5482: as we can niver make out the rights on. And all as we’ve got to do is
5483: to trusten, Master Marner—to do the right thing as fur as we know, and
5484: to trusten. For if us as knows so little can see a bit o’ good and
5485: rights, we may be sure as there’s a good and a rights bigger nor what
5486: we can know—I feel it i’ my own inside as it must be so. And if you
5487: could but ha’ gone on trustening, Master Marner, you wouldn’t ha’ run
5488: away from your fellow-creaturs and been so lone.”
5489: 
5490: “Ah, but that ’ud ha’ been hard,” said Silas, in an under-tone; “it ’ud
5491: ha’ been hard to trusten then.”
5492: 
5493: “And so it would,” said Dolly, almost with compunction; “them things
5494: are easier said nor done; and I’m partly ashamed o’ talking.”
5495: 
5496: “Nay, nay,” said Silas, “you’re i’ the right, Mrs. Winthrop—you’re i’
5497: the right. There’s good i’ this world—I’ve a feeling o’ that now; and
5498: it makes a man feel as there’s a good more nor he can see, i’ spite o’
5499: the trouble and the wickedness. That drawing o’ the lots is dark; but
5500: the child was sent to me: there’s dealings with us—there’s dealings.”
5501: 
5502: This dialogue took place in Eppie’s earlier years, when Silas had to
5503: part with her for two hours every day, that she might learn to read at
5504: the dame school, after he had vainly tried himself to guide her in that
5505: first step to learning. Now that she was grown up, Silas had often been
5506: led, in those moments of quiet outpouring which come to people who live
5507: together in perfect love, to talk with _her_ too of the past, and how
5508: and why he had lived a lonely man until she had been sent to him. For
5509: it would have been impossible for him to hide from Eppie that she was
5510: not his own child: even if the most delicate reticence on the point
5511: could have been expected from Raveloe gossips in her presence, her own
5512: questions about her mother could not have been parried, as she grew up,
5513: without that complete shrouding of the past which would have made a
5514: painful barrier between their minds. So Eppie had long known how her
5515: mother had died on the snowy ground, and how she herself had been found
5516: on the hearth by father Silas, who had taken her golden curls for his
5517: lost guineas brought back to him. The tender and peculiar love with
5518: which Silas had reared her in almost inseparable companionship with
5519: himself, aided by the seclusion of their dwelling, had preserved her
5520: from the lowering influences of the village talk and habits, and had
5521: kept her mind in that freshness which is sometimes falsely supposed to
5522: be an invariable attribute of rusticity. Perfect love has a breath of
5523: poetry which can exalt the relations of the least-instructed human
5524: beings; and this breath of poetry had surrounded Eppie from the time
5525: when she had followed the bright gleam that beckoned her to Silas’s
5526: hearth; so that it is not surprising if, in other things besides her
5527: delicate prettiness, she was not quite a common village maiden, but had
5528: a touch of refinement and fervour which came from no other teaching
5529: than that of tenderly-nurtured unvitiated feeling. She was too childish
5530: and simple for her imagination to rove into questions about her unknown
5531: father; for a long while it did not even occur to her that she must
5532: have had a father; and the first time that the idea of her mother
5533: having had a husband presented itself to her, was when Silas showed her
5534: the wedding-ring which had been taken from the wasted finger, and had
5535: been carefully preserved by him in a little lackered box shaped like a
5536: shoe. He delivered this box into Eppie’s charge when she had grown up,
5537: and she often opened it to look at the ring: but still she thought
5538: hardly at all about the father of whom it was the symbol. Had she not a
5539: father very close to her, who loved her better than any real fathers in
5540: the village seemed to love their daughters? On the contrary, who her
5541: mother was, and how she came to die in that forlornness, were questions
5542: that often pressed on Eppie’s mind. Her knowledge of Mrs. Winthrop, who
5543: was her nearest friend next to Silas, made her feel that a mother must
5544: be very precious; and she had again and again asked Silas to tell her
5545: how her mother looked, whom she was like, and how he had found her
5546: against the furze bush, led towards it by the little footsteps and the
5547: outstretched arms. The furze bush was there still; and this afternoon,
5548: when Eppie came out with Silas into the sunshine, it was the first
5549: object that arrested her eyes and thoughts.
5550: 
5551: “Father,” she said, in a tone of gentle gravity, which sometimes came
5552: like a sadder, slower cadence across her playfulness, “we shall take
5553: the furze bush into the garden; it’ll come into the corner, and just
5554: against it I’ll put snowdrops and crocuses, ’cause Aaron says they
5555: won’t die out, but’ll always get more and more.”
5556: 
5557: “Ah, child,” said Silas, always ready to talk when he had his pipe in
5558: his hand, apparently enjoying the pauses more than the puffs, “it
5559: wouldn’t do to leave out the furze bush; and there’s nothing prettier,
5560: to my thinking, when it’s yallow with flowers. But it’s just come into
5561: my head what we’re to do for a fence—mayhap Aaron can help us to a
5562: thought; but a fence we must have, else the donkeys and things ’ull
5563: come and trample everything down. And fencing’s hard to be got at, by
5564: what I can make out.”
5565: 
5566: “Oh, I’ll tell you, daddy,” said Eppie, clasping her hands suddenly,
5567: after a minute’s thought. “There’s lots o’ loose stones about, some of
5568: ’em not big, and we might lay ’em atop of one another, and make a wall.
5569: You and me could carry the smallest, and Aaron ’ud carry the rest—I
5570: know he would.”
5571: 
5572: “Eh, my precious un,” said Silas, “there isn’t enough stones to go all
5573: round; and as for you carrying, why, wi’ your little arms you couldn’t
5574: carry a stone no bigger than a turnip. You’re dillicate made, my dear,”
5575: he added, with a tender intonation—“that’s what Mrs. Winthrop says.”
5576: 
5577: “Oh, I’m stronger than you think, daddy,” said Eppie; “and if there
5578: wasn’t stones enough to go all round, why they’ll go part o’ the way,
5579: and then it’ll be easier to get sticks and things for the rest. See
5580: here, round the big pit, what a many stones!”
5581: 
5582: She skipped forward to the pit, meaning to lift one of the stones and
5583: exhibit her strength, but she started back in surprise.
5584: 
5585: “Oh, father, just come and look here,” she exclaimed—“come and see how
5586: the water’s gone down since yesterday. Why, yesterday the pit was ever
5587: so full!”
5588: 
5589: “Well, to be sure,” said Silas, coming to her side. “Why, that’s the
5590: draining they’ve begun on, since harvest, i’ Mr. Osgood’s fields, I
5591: reckon. The foreman said to me the other day, when I passed by ’em,
5592: “Master Marner,” he said, “I shouldn’t wonder if we lay your bit o’
5593: waste as dry as a bone.” It was Mr. Godfrey Cass, he said, had gone
5594: into the draining: he’d been taking these fields o’ Mr. Osgood.”
5595: 
5596: “How odd it’ll seem to have the old pit dried up!” said Eppie, turning
5597: away, and stooping to lift rather a large stone. “See, daddy, I can
5598: carry this quite well,” she said, going along with much energy for a
5599: few steps, but presently letting it fall.
5600: 
5601: “Ah, you’re fine and strong, aren’t you?” said Silas, while Eppie shook
5602: her aching arms and laughed. “Come, come, let us go and sit down on the
5603: bank against the stile there, and have no more lifting. You might hurt
5604: yourself, child. You’d need have somebody to work for you—and my arm
5605: isn’t over strong.”
5606: 
5607: Silas uttered the last sentence slowly, as if it implied more than met
5608: the ear; and Eppie, when they sat down on the bank, nestled close to
5609: his side, and, taking hold caressingly of the arm that was not over
5610: strong, held it on her lap, while Silas puffed again dutifully at the
5611: pipe, which occupied his other arm. An ash in the hedgerow behind made
5612: a fretted screen from the sun, and threw happy playful shadows all
5613: about them.
5614: 
5615: “Father,” said Eppie, very gently, after they had been sitting in
5616: silence a little while, “if I was to be married, ought I to be married
5617: with my mother’s ring?”
5618: 
5619: Silas gave an almost imperceptible start, though the question fell in
5620: with the under-current of thought in his own mind, and then said, in a
5621: subdued tone, “Why, Eppie, have you been a-thinking on it?”
5622: 
5623: “Only this last week, father,” said Eppie, ingenuously, “since Aaron
5624: talked to me about it.”
5625: 
5626: “And what did he say?” said Silas, still in the same subdued way, as if
5627: he were anxious lest he should fall into the slightest tone that was
5628: not for Eppie’s good.
5629: 
5630: “He said he should like to be married, because he was a-going in
5631: four-and-twenty, and had got a deal of gardening work, now Mr. Mott’s
5632: given up; and he goes twice a-week regular to Mr. Cass’s, and once to
5633: Mr. Osgood’s, and they’re going to take him on at the Rectory.”
5634: 
5635: “And who is it as he’s wanting to marry?” said Silas, with rather a sad
5636: smile.
5637: 
5638: “Why, me, to be sure, daddy,” said Eppie, with dimpling laughter,
5639: kissing her father’s cheek; “as if he’d want to marry anybody else!”
5640: 
5641: “And you mean to have him, do you?” said Silas.
5642: 
5643: “Yes, some time,” said Eppie, “I don’t know when. Everybody’s married
5644: some time, Aaron says. But I told him that wasn’t true: for, I said,
5645: look at father—he’s never been married.”
5646: 
5647: “No, child,” said Silas, “your father was a lone man till you was sent
5648: to him.”
5649: 
5650: “But you’ll never be lone again, father,” said Eppie, tenderly. “That
5651: was what Aaron said—“I could never think o’ taking you away from Master
5652: Marner, Eppie.” And I said, “It ’ud be no use if you did, Aaron.” And
5653: he wants us all to live together, so as you needn’t work a bit, father,
5654: only what’s for your own pleasure; and he’d be as good as a son to
5655: you—that was what he said.”
5656: 
5657: “And should you like that, Eppie?” said Silas, looking at her.
5658: 
5659: “I shouldn’t mind it, father,” said Eppie, quite simply. “And I should
5660: like things to be so as you needn’t work much. But if it wasn’t for
5661: that, I’d sooner things didn’t change. I’m very happy: I like Aaron to
5662: be fond of me, and come and see us often, and behave pretty to you—he
5663: always _does_ behave pretty to you, doesn’t he, father?”
5664: 
5665: “Yes, child, nobody could behave better,” said Silas, emphatically.
5666: “He’s his mother’s lad.”
5667: 
5668: “But I don’t want any change,” said Eppie. “I should like to go on a
5669: long, long while, just as we are. Only Aaron does want a change; and he
5670: made me cry a bit—only a bit—because he said I didn’t care for him, for
5671: if I cared for him I should want us to be married, as he did.”
5672: 
5673: “Eh, my blessed child,” said Silas, laying down his pipe as if it were
5674: useless to pretend to smoke any longer, “you’re o’er young to be
5675: married. We’ll ask Mrs. Winthrop—we’ll ask Aaron’s mother what _she_
5676: thinks: if there’s a right thing to do, she’ll come at it. But there’s
5677: this to be thought on, Eppie: things _will_ change, whether we like it
5678: or no; things won’t go on for a long while just as they are and no
5679: difference. I shall get older and helplesser, and be a burden on you,
5680: belike, if I don’t go away from you altogether. Not as I mean you’d
5681: think me a burden—I know you wouldn’t—but it ’ud be hard upon you; and
5682: when I look for’ard to that, I like to think as you’d have somebody
5683: else besides me—somebody young and strong, as’ll outlast your own life,
5684: and take care on you to the end.” Silas paused, and, resting his wrists
5685: on his knees, lifted his hands up and down meditatively as he looked on
5686: the ground.
5687: 
5688: “Then, would you like me to be married, father?” said Eppie, with a
5689: little trembling in her voice.
5690: 
5691: “I’ll not be the man to say no, Eppie,” said Silas, emphatically; “but
5692: we’ll ask your godmother. She’ll wish the right thing by you and her
5693: son too.”
5694: 
5695: “There they come, then,” said Eppie. “Let us go and meet ’em. Oh, the
5696: pipe! won’t you have it lit again, father?” said Eppie, lifting that
5697: medicinal appliance from the ground.
5698: 
5699: “Nay, child,” said Silas, “I’ve done enough for to-day. I think,
5700: mayhap, a little of it does me more good than so much at once.”
5701: 
5702: 
5703: 
5704: CHAPTER XVII.
5705: 
5706: While Silas and Eppie were seated on the bank discoursing in the
5707: fleckered shade of the ash tree, Miss Priscilla Lammeter was resisting
5708: her sister’s arguments, that it would be better to take tea at the Red
5709: House, and let her father have a long nap, than drive home to the
5710: Warrens so soon after dinner. The family party (of four only) were
5711: seated round the table in the dark wainscoted parlour, with the Sunday
5712: dessert before them, of fresh filberts, apples, and pears, duly
5713: ornamented with leaves by Nancy’s own hand before the bells had rung
5714: for church.
5715: 
5716: A great change has come over the dark wainscoted parlour since we saw
5717: it in Godfrey’s bachelor days, and under the wifeless reign of the old
5718: Squire. Now all is polish, on which no yesterday’s dust is ever allowed
5719: to rest, from the yard’s width of oaken boards round the carpet, to the
5720: old Squire’s gun and whips and walking-sticks, ranged on the stag’s
5721: antlers above the mantelpiece. All other signs of sporting and outdoor
5722: occupation Nancy has removed to another room; but she has brought into
5723: the Red House the habit of filial reverence, and preserves sacredly in
5724: a place of honour these relics of her husband’s departed father. The
5725: tankards are on the side-table still, but the bossed silver is undimmed
5726: by handling, and there are no dregs to send forth unpleasant
5727: suggestions: the only prevailing scent is of the lavender and
5728: rose-leaves that fill the vases of Derbyshire spar. All is purity and
5729: order in this once dreary room, for, fifteen years ago, it was entered
5730: by a new presiding spirit.
5731: 
5732: “Now, father,” said Nancy, “_is_ there any call for you to go home to
5733: tea? Mayn’t you just as well stay with us?—such a beautiful evening as
5734: it’s likely to be.”
5735: 
5736: The old gentleman had been talking with Godfrey about the increasing
5737: poor-rate and the ruinous times, and had not heard the dialogue between
5738: his daughters.
5739: 
5740: “My dear, you must ask Priscilla,” he said, in the once firm voice, now
5741: become rather broken. “She manages me and the farm too.”
5742: 
5743: “And reason good as I should manage you, father,” said Priscilla, “else
5744: you’d be giving yourself your death with rheumatism. And as for the
5745: farm, if anything turns out wrong, as it can’t but do in these times,
5746: there’s nothing kills a man so soon as having nobody to find fault with
5747: but himself. It’s a deal the best way o’ being master, to let somebody
5748: else do the ordering, and keep the blaming in your own hands. It ’ud
5749: save many a man a stroke, _I_ believe.”
5750: 
5751: “Well, well, my dear,” said her father, with a quiet laugh, “I didn’t
5752: say you don’t manage for everybody’s good.”
5753: 
5754: “Then manage so as you may stay tea, Priscilla,” said Nancy, putting
5755: her hand on her sister’s arm affectionately. “Come now; and we’ll go
5756: round the garden while father has his nap.”
5757: 
5758: “My dear child, he’ll have a beautiful nap in the gig, for I shall
5759: drive. And as for staying tea, I can’t hear of it; for there’s this
5760: dairymaid, now she knows she’s to be married, turned Michaelmas, she’d
5761: as lief pour the new milk into the pig-trough as into the pans. That’s
5762: the way with ’em all: it’s as if they thought the world ’ud be new-made
5763: because they’re to be married. So come and let me put my bonnet on, and
5764: there’ll be time for us to walk round the garden while the horse is
5765: being put in.”
5766: 
5767: When the sisters were treading the neatly-swept garden-walks, between
5768: the bright turf that contrasted pleasantly with the dark cones and
5769: arches and wall-like hedges of yew, Priscilla said—
5770: 
5771: “I’m as glad as anything at your husband’s making that exchange o’ land
5772: with cousin Osgood, and beginning the dairying. It’s a thousand pities
5773: you didn’t do it before; for it’ll give you something to fill your
5774: mind. There’s nothing like a dairy if folks want a bit o’ worrit to
5775: make the days pass. For as for rubbing furniture, when you can once see
5776: your face in a table there’s nothing else to look for; but there’s
5777: always something fresh with the dairy; for even in the depths o’ winter
5778: there’s some pleasure in conquering the butter, and making it come
5779: whether or no. My dear,” added Priscilla, pressing her sister’s hand
5780: affectionately as they walked side by side, “you’ll never be low when
5781: you’ve got a dairy.”
5782: 
5783: “Ah, Priscilla,” said Nancy, returning the pressure with a grateful
5784: glance of her clear eyes, “but it won’t make up to Godfrey: a dairy’s
5785: not so much to a man. And it’s only what he cares for that ever makes
5786: me low. I’m contented with the blessings we have, if he could be
5787: contented.”
5788: 
5789: “It drives me past patience,” said Priscilla, impetuously, “that way o’
5790: the men—always wanting and wanting, and never easy with what they’ve
5791: got: they can’t sit comfortable in their chairs when they’ve neither
5792: ache nor pain, but either they must stick a pipe in their mouths, to
5793: make ’em better than well, or else they must be swallowing something
5794: strong, though they’re forced to make haste before the next meal comes
5795: in. But joyful be it spoken, our father was never that sort o’ man. And
5796: if it had pleased God to make you ugly, like me, so as the men wouldn’t
5797: ha’ run after you, we might have kept to our own family, and had
5798: nothing to do with folks as have got uneasy blood in their veins.”
5799: 
5800: “Oh, don’t say so, Priscilla,” said Nancy, repenting that she had
5801: called forth this outburst; “nobody has any occasion to find fault with
5802: Godfrey. It’s natural he should be disappointed at not having any
5803: children: every man likes to have somebody to work for and lay by for,
5804: and he always counted so on making a fuss with ’em when they were
5805: little. There’s many another man ’ud hanker more than he does. He’s the
5806: best of husbands.”
5807: 
5808: “Oh, I know,” said Priscilla, smiling sarcastically, “I know the way o’
5809: wives; they set one on to abuse their husbands, and then they turn
5810: round on one and praise ’em as if they wanted to sell ’em. But
5811: father’ll be waiting for me; we must turn now.”
5812: 
5813: The large gig with the steady old grey was at the front door, and Mr.
5814: Lammeter was already on the stone steps, passing the time in recalling
5815: to Godfrey what very fine points Speckle had when his master used to
5816: ride him.
5817: 
5818: “I always _would_ have a good horse, you know,” said the old gentleman,
5819: not liking that spirited time to be quite effaced from the memory of
5820: his juniors.
5821: 
5822: “Mind you bring Nancy to the Warrens before the week’s out, Mr. Cass,”
5823: was Priscilla’s parting injunction, as she took the reins, and shook
5824: them gently, by way of friendly incitement to Speckle.
5825: 
5826: “I shall just take a turn to the fields against the Stone-pits, Nancy,
5827: and look at the draining,” said Godfrey.
5828: 
5829: “You’ll be in again by tea-time, dear?”
5830: 
5831: “Oh, yes, I shall be back in an hour.”
5832: 
5833: It was Godfrey’s custom on a Sunday afternoon to do a little
5834: contemplative farming in a leisurely walk. Nancy seldom accompanied
5835: him; for the women of her generation—unless, like Priscilla, they took
5836: to outdoor management—were not given to much walking beyond their own
5837: house and garden, finding sufficient exercise in domestic duties. So,
5838: when Priscilla was not with her, she usually sat with Mant’s Bible
5839: before her, and after following the text with her eyes for a little
5840: while, she would gradually permit them to wander as her thoughts had
5841: already insisted on wandering.
5842: 
5843: But Nancy’s Sunday thoughts were rarely quite out of keeping with the
5844: devout and reverential intention implied by the book spread open before
5845: her. She was not theologically instructed enough to discern very
5846: clearly the relation between the sacred documents of the past which she
5847: opened without method, and her own obscure, simple life; but the spirit
5848: of rectitude, and the sense of responsibility for the effect of her
5849: conduct on others, which were strong elements in Nancy’s character, had
5850: made it a habit with her to scrutinize her past feelings and actions
5851: with self-questioning solicitude. Her mind not being courted by a great
5852: variety of subjects, she filled the vacant moments by living inwardly,
5853: again and again, through all her remembered experience, especially
5854: through the fifteen years of her married time, in which her life and
5855: its significance had been doubled. She recalled the small details, the
5856: words, tones, and looks, in the critical scenes which had opened a new
5857: epoch for her by giving her a deeper insight into the relations and
5858: trials of life, or which had called on her for some little effort of
5859: forbearance, or of painful adherence to an imagined or real duty—asking
5860: herself continually whether she had been in any respect blamable. This
5861: excessive rumination and self-questioning is perhaps a morbid habit
5862: inevitable to a mind of much moral sensibility when shut out from its
5863: due share of outward activity and of practical claims on its
5864: affections—inevitable to a noble-hearted, childless woman, when her lot
5865: is narrow. “I can do so little—have I done it all well?” is the
5866: perpetually recurring thought; and there are no voices calling her away
5867: from that soliloquy, no peremptory demands to divert energy from vain
5868: regret or superfluous scruple.
5869: 
5870: There was one main thread of painful experience in Nancy’s married
5871: life, and on it hung certain deeply-felt scenes, which were the
5872: oftenest revived in retrospect. The short dialogue with Priscilla in
5873: the garden had determined the current of retrospect in that frequent
5874: direction this particular Sunday afternoon. The first wandering of her
5875: thought from the text, which she still attempted dutifully to follow
5876: with her eyes and silent lips, was into an imaginary enlargement of the
5877: defence she had set up for her husband against Priscilla’s implied
5878: blame. The vindication of the loved object is the best balm affection
5879: can find for its wounds:—“A man must have so much on his mind,” is the
5880: belief by which a wife often supports a cheerful face under rough
5881: answers and unfeeling words. And Nancy’s deepest wounds had all come
5882: from the perception that the absence of children from their hearth was
5883: dwelt on in her husband’s mind as a privation to which he could not
5884: reconcile himself.
5885: 
5886: Yet sweet Nancy might have been expected to feel still more keenly the
5887: denial of a blessing to which she had looked forward with all the
5888: varied expectations and preparations, solemn and prettily trivial,
5889: which fill the mind of a loving woman when she expects to become a
5890: mother. Was there not a drawer filled with the neat work of her hands,
5891: all unworn and untouched, just as she had arranged it there fourteen
5892: years ago—just, but for one little dress, which had been made the
5893: burial-dress? But under this immediate personal trial Nancy was so
5894: firmly unmurmuring, that years ago she had suddenly renounced the habit
5895: of visiting this drawer, lest she should in this way be cherishing a
5896: longing for what was not given.
5897: 
5898: Perhaps it was this very severity towards any indulgence of what she
5899: held to be sinful regret in herself, that made her shrink from applying
5900: her own standard to her husband. “It is very different—it is much worse
5901: for a man to be disappointed in that way: a woman can always be
5902: satisfied with devoting herself to her husband, but a man wants
5903: something that will make him look forward more—and sitting by the fire
5904: is so much duller to him than to a woman.” And always, when Nancy
5905: reached this point in her meditations—trying, with predetermined
5906: sympathy, to see everything as Godfrey saw it—there came a renewal of
5907: self-questioning. _Had_ she done everything in her power to lighten
5908: Godfrey’s privation? Had she really been right in the resistance which
5909: had cost her so much pain six years ago, and again four years ago—the
5910: resistance to her husband’s wish that they should adopt a child?
5911: Adoption was more remote from the ideas and habits of that time than of
5912: our own; still Nancy had her opinion on it. It was as necessary to her
5913: mind to have an opinion on all topics, not exclusively masculine, that
5914: had come under her notice, as for her to have a precisely marked place
5915: for every article of her personal property: and her opinions were
5916: always principles to be unwaveringly acted on. They were firm, not
5917: because of their basis, but because she held them with a tenacity
5918: inseparable from her mental action. On all the duties and proprieties
5919: of life, from filial behaviour to the arrangements of the evening
5920: toilette, pretty Nancy Lammeter, by the time she was three-and-twenty,
5921: had her unalterable little code, and had formed every one of her habits
5922: in strict accordance with that code. She carried these decided
5923: judgments within her in the most unobtrusive way: they rooted
5924: themselves in her mind, and grew there as quietly as grass. Years ago,
5925: we know, she insisted on dressing like Priscilla, because “it was right
5926: for sisters to dress alike”, and because “she would do what was right
5927: if she wore a gown dyed with cheese-colouring”. That was a trivial but
5928: typical instance of the mode in which Nancy’s life was regulated.
5929: 
5930: It was one of those rigid principles, and no petty egoistic feeling,
5931: which had been the ground of Nancy’s difficult resistance to her
5932: husband’s wish. To adopt a child, because children of your own had been
5933: denied you, was to try and choose your lot in spite of Providence: the
5934: adopted child, she was convinced, would never turn out well, and would
5935: be a curse to those who had wilfully and rebelliously sought what it
5936: was clear that, for some high reason, they were better without. When
5937: you saw a thing was not meant to be, said Nancy, it was a bounden duty
5938: to leave off so much as wishing for it. And so far, perhaps, the wisest
5939: of men could scarcely make more than a verbal improvement in her
5940: principle. But the conditions under which she held it apparent that a
5941: thing was not meant to be, depended on a more peculiar mode of
5942: thinking. She would have given up making a purchase at a particular
5943: place if, on three successive times, rain, or some other cause of
5944: Heaven’s sending, had formed an obstacle; and she would have
5945: anticipated a broken limb or other heavy misfortune to any one who
5946: persisted in spite of such indications.
5947: 
5948: “But why should you think the child would turn out ill?” said Godfrey,
5949: in his remonstrances. “She has thriven as well as child can do with the
5950: weaver; and _he_ adopted her. There isn’t such a pretty little girl
5951: anywhere else in the parish, or one fitter for the station we could
5952: give her. Where can be the likelihood of her being a curse to anybody?”
5953: 
5954: “Yes, my dear Godfrey,” said Nancy, who was sitting with her hands
5955: tightly clasped together, and with yearning, regretful affection in her
5956: eyes. “The child may not turn out ill with the weaver. But, then, he
5957: didn’t go to seek her, as we should be doing. It will be wrong: I feel
5958: sure it will. Don’t you remember what that lady we met at the Royston
5959: Baths told us about the child her sister adopted? That was the only
5960: adopting I ever heard of: and the child was transported when it was
5961: twenty-three. Dear Godfrey, don’t ask me to do what I know is wrong: I
5962: should never be happy again. I know it’s very hard for _you_—it’s
5963: easier for me—but it’s the will of Providence.”
5964: 
5965: It might seem singular that Nancy—with her religious theory pieced
5966: together out of narrow social traditions, fragments of church doctrine
5967: imperfectly understood, and girlish reasonings on her small
5968: experience—should have arrived by herself at a way of thinking so
5969: nearly akin to that of many devout people, whose beliefs are held in
5970: the shape of a system quite remote from her knowledge—singular, if we
5971: did not know that human beliefs, like all other natural growths, elude
5972: the barriers of system.
5973: 
5974: Godfrey had from the first specified Eppie, then about twelve years
5975: old, as a child suitable for them to adopt. It had never occurred to
5976: him that Silas would rather part with his life than with Eppie. Surely
5977: the weaver would wish the best to the child he had taken so much
5978: trouble with, and would be glad that such good fortune should happen to
5979: her: she would always be very grateful to him, and he would be well
5980: provided for to the end of his life—provided for as the excellent part
5981: he had done by the child deserved. Was it not an appropriate thing for
5982: people in a higher station to take a charge off the hands of a man in a
5983: lower? It seemed an eminently appropriate thing to Godfrey, for reasons
5984: that were known only to himself; and by a common fallacy, he imagined
5985: the measure would be easy because he had private motives for desiring
5986: it. This was rather a coarse mode of estimating Silas’s relation to
5987: Eppie; but we must remember that many of the impressions which Godfrey
5988: was likely to gather concerning the labouring people around him would
5989: favour the idea that deep affections can hardly go along with callous
5990: palms and scant means; and he had not had the opportunity, even if he
5991: had had the power, of entering intimately into all that was exceptional
5992: in the weaver’s experience. It was only the want of adequate knowledge
5993: that could have made it possible for Godfrey deliberately to entertain
5994: an unfeeling project: his natural kindness had outlived that blighting
5995: time of cruel wishes, and Nancy’s praise of him as a husband was not
5996: founded entirely on a wilful illusion.
5997: 
5998: “I was right,” she said to herself, when she had recalled all their
5999: scenes of discussion—“I feel I was right to say him nay, though it hurt
6000: me more than anything; but how good Godfrey has been about it! Many men
6001: would have been very angry with me for standing out against their
6002: wishes; and they might have thrown out that they’d had ill-luck in
6003: marrying me; but Godfrey has never been the man to say me an unkind
6004: word. It’s only what he can’t hide: everything seems so blank to him, I
6005: know; and the land—what a difference it ’ud make to him, when he goes
6006: to see after things, if he’d children growing up that he was doing it
6007: all for! But I won’t murmur; and perhaps if he’d married a woman who’d
6008: have had children, she’d have vexed him in other ways.”
6009: 
6010: This possibility was Nancy’s chief comfort; and to give it greater
6011: strength, she laboured to make it impossible that any other wife should
6012: have had more perfect tenderness. She had been _forced_ to vex him by
6013: that one denial. Godfrey was not insensible to her loving effort, and
6014: did Nancy no injustice as to the motives of her obstinacy. It was
6015: impossible to have lived with her fifteen years and not be aware that
6016: an unselfish clinging to the right, and a sincerity clear as the
6017: flower-born dew, were her main characteristics; indeed, Godfrey felt
6018: this so strongly, that his own more wavering nature, too averse to
6019: facing difficulty to be unvaryingly simple and truthful, was kept in a
6020: certain awe of this gentle wife who watched his looks with a yearning
6021: to obey them. It seemed to him impossible that he should ever confess
6022: to her the truth about Eppie: she would never recover from the
6023: repulsion the story of his earlier marriage would create, told to her
6024: now, after that long concealment. And the child, too, he thought, must
6025: become an object of repulsion: the very sight of her would be painful.
6026: The shock to Nancy’s mingled pride and ignorance of the world’s evil
6027: might even be too much for her delicate frame. Since he had married her
6028: with that secret on his heart, he must keep it there to the last.
6029: Whatever else he did, he could not make an irreparable breach between
6030: himself and this long-loved wife.
6031: 
6032: Meanwhile, why could he not make up his mind to the absence of children
6033: from a hearth brightened by such a wife? Why did his mind fly uneasily
6034: to that void, as if it were the sole reason why life was not thoroughly
6035: joyous to him? I suppose it is the way with all men and women who reach
6036: middle age without the clear perception that life never _can_ be
6037: thoroughly joyous: under the vague dullness of the grey hours,
6038: dissatisfaction seeks a definite object, and finds it in the privation
6039: of an untried good. Dissatisfaction seated musingly on a childless
6040: hearth, thinks with envy of the father whose return is greeted by young
6041: voices—seated at the meal where the little heads rise one above another
6042: like nursery plants, it sees a black care hovering behind every one of
6043: them, and thinks the impulses by which men abandon freedom, and seek
6044: for ties, are surely nothing but a brief madness. In Godfrey’s case
6045: there were further reasons why his thoughts should be continually
6046: solicited by this one point in his lot: his conscience, never
6047: thoroughly easy about Eppie, now gave his childless home the aspect of
6048: a retribution; and as the time passed on, under Nancy’s refusal to
6049: adopt her, any retrieval of his error became more and more difficult.
6050: 
6051: On this Sunday afternoon it was already four years since there had been
6052: any allusion to the subject between them, and Nancy supposed that it
6053: was for ever buried.
6054: 
6055: “I wonder if he’ll mind it less or more as he gets older,” she thought;
6056: “I’m afraid more. Aged people feel the miss of children: what would
6057: father do without Priscilla? And if I die, Godfrey will be very
6058: lonely—not holding together with his brothers much. But I won’t be
6059: over-anxious, and trying to make things out beforehand: I must do my
6060: best for the present.”
6061: 
6062: With that last thought Nancy roused herself from her reverie, and
6063: turned her eyes again towards the forsaken page. It had been forsaken
6064: longer than she imagined, for she was presently surprised by the
6065: appearance of the servant with the tea-things. It was, in fact, a
6066: little before the usual time for tea; but Jane had her reasons.
6067: 
6068: “Is your master come into the yard, Jane?”
6069: 
6070: “No ’m, he isn’t,” said Jane, with a slight emphasis, of which,
6071: however, her mistress took no notice.
6072: 
6073: “I don’t know whether you’ve seen ’em, ’m,” continued Jane, after a
6074: pause, “but there’s folks making haste all one way, afore the front
6075: window. I doubt something’s happened. There’s niver a man to be seen i’
6076: the yard, else I’d send and see. I’ve been up into the top attic, but
6077: there’s no seeing anything for trees. I hope nobody’s hurt, that’s
6078: all.”
6079: 
6080: “Oh, no, I daresay there’s nothing much the matter,” said Nancy. “It’s
6081: perhaps Mr. Snell’s bull got out again, as he did before.”
6082: 
6083: “I wish he mayn’t gore anybody then, that’s all,” said Jane, not
6084: altogether despising a hypothesis which covered a few imaginary
6085: calamities.
6086: 
6087: “That girl is always terrifying me,” thought Nancy; “I wish Godfrey
6088: would come in.”
6089: 
6090: She went to the front window and looked as far as she could see along
6091: the road, with an uneasiness which she felt to be childish, for there
6092: were now no such signs of excitement as Jane had spoken of, and Godfrey
6093: would not be likely to return by the village road, but by the fields.
6094: She continued to stand, however, looking at the placid churchyard with
6095: the long shadows of the gravestones across the bright green hillocks,
6096: and at the glowing autumn colours of the Rectory trees beyond. Before
6097: such calm external beauty the presence of a vague fear is more
6098: distinctly felt—like a raven flapping its slow wing across the sunny
6099: air. Nancy wished more and more that Godfrey would come in.
6100: 
6101: 
6102: 
6103: CHAPTER XVIII.
6104: 
6105: Some one opened the door at the other end of the room, and Nancy felt
6106: that it was her husband. She turned from the window with gladness in
6107: her eyes, for the wife’s chief dread was stilled.
6108: 
6109: “Dear, I’m so thankful you’re come,” she said, going towards him. “I
6110: began to get—”
6111: 
6112: She paused abruptly, for Godfrey was laying down his hat with trembling
6113: hands, and turned towards her with a pale face and a strange
6114: unanswering glance, as if he saw her indeed, but saw her as part of a
6115: scene invisible to herself. She laid her hand on his arm, not daring to
6116: speak again; but he left the touch unnoticed, and threw himself into
6117: his chair.
6118: 
6119: Jane was already at the door with the hissing urn. “Tell her to keep
6120: away, will you?” said Godfrey; and when the door was closed again he
6121: exerted himself to speak more distinctly.
6122: 
6123: “Sit down, Nancy—there,” he said, pointing to a chair opposite him. “I
6124: came back as soon as I could, to hinder anybody’s telling you but me.
6125: I’ve had a great shock—but I care most about the shock it’ll be to
6126: you.”
6127: 
6128: “It isn’t father and Priscilla?” said Nancy, with quivering lips,
6129: clasping her hands together tightly on her lap.
6130: 
6131: “No, it’s nobody living,” said Godfrey, unequal to the considerate
6132: skill with which he would have wished to make his revelation. “It’s
6133: Dunstan—my brother Dunstan, that we lost sight of sixteen years ago.
6134: We’ve found him—found his body—his skeleton.”
6135: 
6136: The deep dread Godfrey’s look had created in Nancy made her feel these
6137: words a relief. She sat in comparative calmness to hear what else he
6138: had to tell. He went on:
6139: 
6140: “The Stone-pit has gone dry suddenly—from the draining, I suppose; and
6141: there he lies—has lain for sixteen years, wedged between two great
6142: stones. There’s his watch and seals, and there’s my gold-handled
6143: hunting-whip, with my name on: he took it away, without my knowing, the
6144: day he went hunting on Wildfire, the last time he was seen.”
6145: 
6146: Godfrey paused: it was not so easy to say what came next. “Do you think
6147: he drowned himself?” said Nancy, almost wondering that her husband
6148: should be so deeply shaken by what had happened all those years ago to
6149: an unloved brother, of whom worse things had been augured.
6150: 
6151: “No, he fell in,” said Godfrey, in a low but distinct voice, as if he
6152: felt some deep meaning in the fact. Presently he added: “Dunstan was
6153: the man that robbed Silas Marner.”
6154: 
6155: The blood rushed to Nancy’s face and neck at this surprise and shame,
6156: for she had been bred up to regard even a distant kinship with crime as
6157: a dishonour.
6158: 
6159: “O Godfrey!” she said, with compassion in her tone, for she had
6160: immediately reflected that the dishonour must be felt still more keenly
6161: by her husband.
6162: 
6163: “There was the money in the pit,” he continued—“all the weaver’s money.
6164: Everything’s been gathered up, and they’re taking the skeleton to the
6165: Rainbow. But I came back to tell you: there was no hindering it; you
6166: must know.”
6167: 
6168: He was silent, looking on the ground for two long minutes. Nancy would
6169: have said some words of comfort under this disgrace, but she refrained,
6170: from an instinctive sense that there was something behind—that Godfrey
6171: had something else to tell her. Presently he lifted his eyes to her
6172: face, and kept them fixed on her, as he said—
6173: 
6174: “Everything comes to light, Nancy, sooner or later. When God Almighty
6175: wills it, our secrets are found out. I’ve lived with a secret on my
6176: mind, but I’ll keep it from you no longer. I wouldn’t have you know it
6177: by somebody else, and not by me—I wouldn’t have you find it out after
6178: I’m dead. I’ll tell you now. It’s been “I will” and “I won’t” with me
6179: all my life—I’ll make sure of myself now.”
6180: 
6181: Nancy’s utmost dread had returned. The eyes of the husband and wife met
6182: with awe in them, as at a crisis which suspended affection.
6183: 
6184: “Nancy,” said Godfrey, slowly, “when I married you, I hid something
6185: from you—something I ought to have told you. That woman Marner found
6186: dead in the snow—Eppie’s mother—that wretched woman—was my wife: Eppie
6187: is my child.”
6188: 
6189: He paused, dreading the effect of his confession. But Nancy sat quite
6190: still, only that her eyes dropped and ceased to meet his. She was pale
6191: and quiet as a meditative statue, clasping her hands on her lap.
6192: 
6193: “You’ll never think the same of me again,” said Godfrey, after a little
6194: while, with some tremor in his voice.
6195: 
6196: She was silent.
6197: 
6198: “I oughtn’t to have left the child unowned: I oughtn’t to have kept it
6199: from you. But I couldn’t bear to give you up, Nancy. I was led away
6200: into marrying her—I suffered for it.”
6201: 
6202: Still Nancy was silent, looking down; and he almost expected that she
6203: would presently get up and say she would go to her father’s. How could
6204: she have any mercy for faults that must seem so black to her, with her
6205: simple, severe notions?
6206: 
6207: But at last she lifted up her eyes to his again and spoke. There was no
6208: indignation in her voice—only deep regret.
6209: 
6210: “Godfrey, if you had but told me this six years ago, we could have done
6211: some of our duty by the child. Do you think I’d have refused to take
6212: her in, if I’d known she was yours?”
6213: 
6214: At that moment Godfrey felt all the bitterness of an error that was not
6215: simply futile, but had defeated its own end. He had not measured this
6216: wife with whom he had lived so long. But she spoke again, with more
6217: agitation.
6218: 
6219: “And—Oh, Godfrey—if we’d had her from the first, if you’d taken to her
6220: as you ought, she’d have loved me for her mother—and you’d have been
6221: happier with me: I could better have bore my little baby dying, and our
6222: life might have been more like what we used to think it ’ud be.”
6223: 
6224: The tears fell, and Nancy ceased to speak.
6225: 
6226: “But you wouldn’t have married me then, Nancy, if I’d told you,” said
6227: Godfrey, urged, in the bitterness of his self-reproach, to prove to
6228: himself that his conduct had not been utter folly. “You may think you
6229: would now, but you wouldn’t then. With your pride and your father’s,
6230: you’d have hated having anything to do with me after the talk there’d
6231: have been.”
6232: 
6233: “I can’t say what I should have done about that, Godfrey. I should
6234: never have married anybody else. But I wasn’t worth doing wrong
6235: for—nothing is in this world. Nothing is so good as it seems
6236: beforehand—not even our marrying wasn’t, you see.” There was a faint
6237: sad smile on Nancy’s face as she said the last words.
6238: 
6239: “I’m a worse man than you thought I was, Nancy,” said Godfrey, rather
6240: tremulously. “Can you forgive me ever?”
6241: 
6242: “The wrong to me is but little, Godfrey: you’ve made it up to me—you’ve
6243: been good to me for fifteen years. It’s another you did the wrong to;
6244: and I doubt it can never be all made up for.”
6245: 
6246: “But we can take Eppie now,” said Godfrey. “I won’t mind the world
6247: knowing at last. I’ll be plain and open for the rest o’ my life.”
6248: 
6249: “It’ll be different coming to us, now she’s grown up,” said Nancy,
6250: shaking her head sadly. “But it’s your duty to acknowledge her and
6251: provide for her; and I’ll do my part by her, and pray to God Almighty
6252: to make her love me.”
6253: 
6254: “Then we’ll go together to Silas Marner’s this very night, as soon as
6255: everything’s quiet at the Stone-pits.”
6256: 
6257: 
6258: 
6259: CHAPTER XIX.
6260: 
6261: Between eight and nine o’clock that evening, Eppie and Silas were
6262: seated alone in the cottage. After the great excitement the weaver had
6263: undergone from the events of the afternoon, he had felt a longing for
6264: this quietude, and had even begged Mrs. Winthrop and Aaron, who had
6265: naturally lingered behind every one else, to leave him alone with his
6266: child. The excitement had not passed away: it had only reached that
6267: stage when the keenness of the susceptibility makes external stimulus
6268: intolerable—when there is no sense of weariness, but rather an
6269: intensity of inward life, under which sleep is an impossibility. Any
6270: one who has watched such moments in other men remembers the brightness
6271: of the eyes and the strange definiteness that comes over coarse
6272: features from that transient influence. It is as if a new fineness of
6273: ear for all spiritual voices had sent wonder-working vibrations through
6274: the heavy mortal frame—as if “beauty born of murmuring sound” had
6275: passed into the face of the listener.
6276: 
6277: Silas’s face showed that sort of transfiguration, as he sat in his
6278: arm-chair and looked at Eppie. She had drawn her own chair towards his
6279: knees, and leaned forward, holding both his hands, while she looked up
6280: at him. On the table near them, lit by a candle, lay the recovered
6281: gold—the old long-loved gold, ranged in orderly heaps, as Silas used to
6282: range it in the days when it was his only joy. He had been telling her
6283: how he used to count it every night, and how his soul was utterly
6284: desolate till she was sent to him.
6285: 
6286: “At first, I’d a sort o’ feeling come across me now and then,” he was
6287: saying in a subdued tone, “as if you might be changed into the gold
6288: again; for sometimes, turn my head which way I would, I seemed to see
6289: the gold; and I thought I should be glad if I could feel it, and find
6290: it was come back. But that didn’t last long. After a bit, I should have
6291: thought it was a curse come again, if it had drove you from me, for I’d
6292: got to feel the need o’ your looks and your voice and the touch o’ your
6293: little fingers. You didn’t know then, Eppie, when you were such a
6294: little un—you didn’t know what your old father Silas felt for you.”
6295: 
6296: “But I know now, father,” said Eppie. “If it hadn’t been for you,
6297: they’d have taken me to the workhouse, and there’d have been nobody to
6298: love me.”
6299: 
6300: “Eh, my precious child, the blessing was mine. If you hadn’t been sent
6301: to save me, I should ha’ gone to the grave in my misery. The money was
6302: taken away from me in time; and you see it’s been kept—kept till it was
6303: wanted for you. It’s wonderful—our life is wonderful.”
6304: 
6305: Silas sat in silence a few minutes, looking at the money. “It takes no
6306: hold of me now,” he said, ponderingly—“the money doesn’t. I wonder if
6307: it ever could again—I doubt it might, if I lost you, Eppie. I might
6308: come to think I was forsaken again, and lose the feeling that God was
6309: good to me.”
6310: 
6311: At that moment there was a knocking at the door; and Eppie was obliged
6312: to rise without answering Silas. Beautiful she looked, with the
6313: tenderness of gathering tears in her eyes and a slight flush on her
6314: cheeks, as she stepped to open the door. The flush deepened when she
6315: saw Mr. and Mrs. Godfrey Cass. She made her little rustic curtsy, and
6316: held the door wide for them to enter.
6317: 
6318: “We’re disturbing you very late, my dear,” said Mrs. Cass, taking
6319: Eppie’s hand, and looking in her face with an expression of anxious
6320: interest and admiration. Nancy herself was pale and tremulous.
6321: 
6322: Eppie, after placing chairs for Mr. and Mrs. Cass, went to stand
6323: against Silas, opposite to them.
6324: 
6325: “Well, Marner,” said Godfrey, trying to speak with perfect firmness,
6326: “it’s a great comfort to me to see you with your money again, that
6327: you’ve been deprived of so many years. It was one of my family did you
6328: the wrong—the more grief to me—and I feel bound to make up to you for
6329: it in every way. Whatever I can do for you will be nothing but paying a
6330: debt, even if I looked no further than the robbery. But there are other
6331: things I’m beholden—shall be beholden to you for, Marner.”
6332: 
6333: Godfrey checked himself. It had been agreed between him and his wife
6334: that the subject of his fatherhood should be approached very carefully,
6335: and that, if possible, the disclosure should be reserved for the
6336: future, so that it might be made to Eppie gradually. Nancy had urged
6337: this, because she felt strongly the painful light in which Eppie must
6338: inevitably see the relation between her father and mother.
6339: 
6340: Silas, always ill at ease when he was being spoken to by “betters”,
6341: such as Mr. Cass—tall, powerful, florid men, seen chiefly on
6342: horseback—answered with some constraint—
6343: 
6344: “Sir, I’ve a deal to thank you for a’ready. As for the robbery, I count
6345: it no loss to me. And if I did, you couldn’t help it: you aren’t
6346: answerable for it.”
6347: 
6348: “You may look at it in that way, Marner, but I never can; and I hope
6349: you’ll let me act according to my own feeling of what’s just. I know
6350: you’re easily contented: you’ve been a hard-working man all your life.”
6351: 
6352: “Yes, sir, yes,” said Marner, meditatively. “I should ha’ been bad off
6353: without my work: it was what I held by when everything else was gone
6354: from me.”
6355: 
6356: “Ah,” said Godfrey, applying Marner’s words simply to his bodily wants,
6357: “it was a good trade for you in this country, because there’s been a
6358: great deal of linen-weaving to be done. But you’re getting rather past
6359: such close work, Marner: it’s time you laid by and had some rest. You
6360: look a good deal pulled down, though you’re not an old man, _are_ you?”
6361: 
6362: “Fifty-five, as near as I can say, sir,” said Silas.
6363: 
6364: “Oh, why, you may live thirty years longer—look at old Macey! And that
6365: money on the table, after all, is but little. It won’t go far either
6366: way—whether it’s put out to interest, or you were to live on it as long
6367: as it would last: it wouldn’t go far if you’d nobody to keep but
6368: yourself, and you’ve had two to keep for a good many years now.”
6369: 
6370: “Eh, sir,” said Silas, unaffected by anything Godfrey was saying, “I’m
6371: in no fear o’ want. We shall do very well—Eppie and me ’ull do well
6372: enough. There’s few working-folks have got so much laid by as that. I
6373: don’t know what it is to gentlefolks, but I look upon it as a
6374: deal—almost too much. And as for us, it’s little we want.”
6375: 
6376: “Only the garden, father,” said Eppie, blushing up to the ears the
6377: moment after.
6378: 
6379: “You love a garden, do you, my dear?” said Nancy, thinking that this
6380: turn in the point of view might help her husband. “We should agree in
6381: that: I give a deal of time to the garden.”
6382: 
6383: “Ah, there’s plenty of gardening at the Red House,” said Godfrey,
6384: surprised at the difficulty he found in approaching a proposition which
6385: had seemed so easy to him in the distance. “You’ve done a good part by
6386: Eppie, Marner, for sixteen years. It ’ud be a great comfort to you to
6387: see her well provided for, wouldn’t it? She looks blooming and healthy,
6388: but not fit for any hardships: she doesn’t look like a strapping girl
6389: come of working parents. You’d like to see her taken care of by those
6390: who can leave her well off, and make a lady of her; she’s more fit for
6391: it than for a rough life, such as she might come to have in a few
6392: years’ time.”
6393: 
6394: A slight flush came over Marner’s face, and disappeared, like a passing
6395: gleam. Eppie was simply wondering Mr. Cass should talk so about things
6396: that seemed to have nothing to do with reality; but Silas was hurt and
6397: uneasy.
6398: 
6399: “I don’t take your meaning, sir,” he answered, not having words at
6400: command to express the mingled feelings with which he had heard Mr.
6401: Cass’s words.
6402: 
6403: “Well, my meaning is this, Marner,” said Godfrey, determined to come to
6404: the point. “Mrs. Cass and I, you know, have no children—nobody to
6405: benefit by our good home and everything else we have—more than enough
6406: for ourselves. And we should like to have somebody in the place of a
6407: daughter to us—we should like to have Eppie, and treat her in every way
6408: as our own child. It ’ud be a great comfort to you in your old age, I
6409: hope, to see her fortune made in that way, after you’ve been at the
6410: trouble of bringing her up so well. And it’s right you should have
6411: every reward for that. And Eppie, I’m sure, will always love you and be
6412: grateful to you: she’d come and see you very often, and we should all
6413: be on the look-out to do everything we could towards making you
6414: comfortable.”
6415: 
6416: A plain man like Godfrey Cass, speaking under some embarrassment,
6417: necessarily blunders on words that are coarser than his intentions, and
6418: that are likely to fall gratingly on susceptible feelings. While he had
6419: been speaking, Eppie had quietly passed her arm behind Silas’s head,
6420: and let her hand rest against it caressingly: she felt him trembling
6421: violently. He was silent for some moments when Mr. Cass had
6422: ended—powerless under the conflict of emotions, all alike painful.
6423: Eppie’s heart was swelling at the sense that her father was in
6424: distress; and she was just going to lean down and speak to him, when
6425: one struggling dread at last gained the mastery over every other in
6426: Silas, and he said, faintly—
6427: 
6428: “Eppie, my child, speak. I won’t stand in your way. Thank Mr. and Mrs.
6429: Cass.”
6430: 
6431: Eppie took her hand from her father’s head, and came forward a step.
6432: Her cheeks were flushed, but not with shyness this time: the sense that
6433: her father was in doubt and suffering banished that sort of
6434: self-consciousness. She dropped a low curtsy, first to Mrs. Cass and
6435: then to Mr. Cass, and said—
6436: 
6437: “Thank you, ma’am—thank you, sir. But I can’t leave my father, nor own
6438: anybody nearer than him. And I don’t want to be a lady—thank you all
6439: the same” (here Eppie dropped another curtsy). “I couldn’t give up the
6440: folks I’ve been used to.”
6441: 
6442: Eppie’s lips began to tremble a little at the last words. She retreated
6443: to her father’s chair again, and held him round the neck: while Silas,
6444: with a subdued sob, put up his hand to grasp hers.
6445: 
6446: The tears were in Nancy’s eyes, but her sympathy with Eppie was,
6447: naturally, divided with distress on her husband’s account. She dared
6448: not speak, wondering what was going on in her husband’s mind.
6449: 
6450: Godfrey felt an irritation inevitable to almost all of us when we
6451: encounter an unexpected obstacle. He had been full of his own penitence
6452: and resolution to retrieve his error as far as the time was left to
6453: him; he was possessed with all-important feelings, that were to lead to
6454: a predetermined course of action which he had fixed on as the right,
6455: and he was not prepared to enter with lively appreciation into other
6456: people’s feelings counteracting his virtuous resolves. The agitation
6457: with which he spoke again was not quite unmixed with anger.
6458: 
6459: “But I’ve a claim on you, Eppie—the strongest of all claims. It’s my
6460: duty, Marner, to own Eppie as my child, and provide for her. She is my
6461: own child—her mother was my wife. I’ve a natural claim on her that must
6462: stand before every other.”
6463: 
6464: Eppie had given a violent start, and turned quite pale. Silas, on the
6465: contrary, who had been relieved, by Eppie’s answer, from the dread lest
6466: his mind should be in opposition to hers, felt the spirit of resistance
6467: in him set free, not without a touch of parental fierceness. “Then,
6468: sir,” he answered, with an accent of bitterness that had been silent in
6469: him since the memorable day when his youthful hope had perished—“then,
6470: sir, why didn’t you say so sixteen year ago, and claim her before I’d
6471: come to love her, i’stead o’ coming to take her from me now, when you
6472: might as well take the heart out o’ my body? God gave her to me because
6473: you turned your back upon her, and He looks upon her as mine: you’ve no
6474: right to her! When a man turns a blessing from his door, it falls to
6475: them as take it in.”
6476: 
6477: “I know that, Marner. I was wrong. I’ve repented of my conduct in that
6478: matter,” said Godfrey, who could not help feeling the edge of Silas’s
6479: words.
6480: 
6481: “I’m glad to hear it, sir,” said Marner, with gathering excitement;
6482: “but repentance doesn’t alter what’s been going on for sixteen year.
6483: Your coming now and saying “I’m her father” doesn’t alter the feelings
6484: inside us. It’s me she’s been calling her father ever since she could
6485: say the word.”
6486: 
6487: “But I think you might look at the thing more reasonably, Marner,” said
6488: Godfrey, unexpectedly awed by the weaver’s direct truth-speaking. “It
6489: isn’t as if she was to be taken quite away from you, so that you’d
6490: never see her again. She’ll be very near you, and come to see you very
6491: often. She’ll feel just the same towards you.”
6492: 
6493: “Just the same?” said Marner, more bitterly than ever. “How’ll she feel
6494: just the same for me as she does now, when we eat o’ the same bit, and
6495: drink o’ the same cup, and think o’ the same things from one day’s end
6496: to another? Just the same? that’s idle talk. You’d cut us i’ two.”
6497: 
6498: Godfrey, unqualified by experience to discern the pregnancy of Marner’s
6499: simple words, felt rather angry again. It seemed to him that the weaver
6500: was very selfish (a judgment readily passed by those who have never
6501: tested their own power of sacrifice) to oppose what was undoubtedly for
6502: Eppie’s welfare; and he felt himself called upon, for her sake, to
6503: assert his authority.
6504: 
6505: “I should have thought, Marner,” he said, severely—“I should have
6506: thought your affection for Eppie would make you rejoice in what was for
6507: her good, even if it did call upon you to give up something. You ought
6508: to remember your own life’s uncertain, and she’s at an age now when her
6509: lot may soon be fixed in a way very different from what it would be in
6510: her father’s home: she may marry some low working-man, and then,
6511: whatever I might do for her, I couldn’t make her well-off. You’re
6512: putting yourself in the way of her welfare; and though I’m sorry to
6513: hurt you after what you’ve done, and what I’ve left undone, I feel now
6514: it’s my duty to insist on taking care of my own daughter. I want to do
6515: my duty.”
6516: 
6517: It would be difficult to say whether it were Silas or Eppie that was
6518: more deeply stirred by this last speech of Godfrey’s. Thought had been
6519: very busy in Eppie as she listened to the contest between her old
6520: long-loved father and this new unfamiliar father who had suddenly come
6521: to fill the place of that black featureless shadow which had held the
6522: ring and placed it on her mother’s finger. Her imagination had darted
6523: backward in conjectures, and forward in previsions, of what this
6524: revealed fatherhood implied; and there were words in Godfrey’s last
6525: speech which helped to make the previsions especially definite. Not
6526: that these thoughts, either of past or future, determined her
6527: resolution—_that_ was determined by the feelings which vibrated to
6528: every word Silas had uttered; but they raised, even apart from these
6529: feelings, a repulsion towards the offered lot and the newly-revealed
6530: father.
6531: 
6532: Silas, on the other hand, was again stricken in conscience, and alarmed
6533: lest Godfrey’s accusation should be true—lest he should be raising his
6534: own will as an obstacle to Eppie’s good. For many moments he was mute,
6535: struggling for the self-conquest necessary to the uttering of the
6536: difficult words. They came out tremulously.
6537: 
6538: “I’ll say no more. Let it be as you will. Speak to the child. I’ll
6539: hinder nothing.”
6540: 
6541: Even Nancy, with all the acute sensibility of her own affections,
6542: shared her husband’s view, that Marner was not justifiable in his wish
6543: to retain Eppie, after her real father had avowed himself. She felt
6544: that it was a very hard trial for the poor weaver, but her code allowed
6545: no question that a father by blood must have a claim above that of any
6546: foster-father. Besides, Nancy, used all her life to plenteous
6547: circumstances and the privileges of “respectability”, could not enter
6548: into the pleasures which early nurture and habit connect with all the
6549: little aims and efforts of the poor who are born poor: to her mind,
6550: Eppie, in being restored to her birthright, was entering on a too long
6551: withheld but unquestionable good. Hence she heard Silas’s last words
6552: with relief, and thought, as Godfrey did, that their wish was achieved.
6553: 
6554: “Eppie, my dear,” said Godfrey, looking at his daughter, not without
6555: some embarrassment, under the sense that she was old enough to judge
6556: him, “it’ll always be our wish that you should show your love and
6557: gratitude to one who’s been a father to you so many years, and we shall
6558: want to help you to make him comfortable in every way. But we hope
6559: you’ll come to love us as well; and though I haven’t been what a father
6560: should ha’ been to you all these years, I wish to do the utmost in my
6561: power for you for the rest of my life, and provide for you as my only
6562: child. And you’ll have the best of mothers in my wife—that’ll be a
6563: blessing you haven’t known since you were old enough to know it.”
6564: 
6565: “My dear, you’ll be a treasure to me,” said Nancy, in her gentle voice.
6566: “We shall want for nothing when we have our daughter.”
6567: 
6568: Eppie did not come forward and curtsy, as she had done before. She held
6569: Silas’s hand in hers, and grasped it firmly—it was a weaver’s hand,
6570: with a palm and finger-tips that were sensitive to such pressure—while
6571: she spoke with colder decision than before.
6572: 
6573: “Thank you, ma’am—thank you, sir, for your offers—they’re very great,
6574: and far above my wish. For I should have no delight i’ life any more if
6575: I was forced to go away from my father, and knew he was sitting at
6576: home, a-thinking of me and feeling lone. We’ve been used to be happy
6577: together every day, and I can’t think o’ no happiness without him. And
6578: he says he’d nobody i’ the world till I was sent to him, and he’d have
6579: nothing when I was gone. And he’s took care of me and loved me from the
6580: first, and I’ll cleave to him as long as he lives, and nobody shall
6581: ever come between him and me.”
6582: 
6583: “But you must make sure, Eppie,” said Silas, in a low voice—“you must
6584: make sure as you won’t ever be sorry, because you’ve made your choice
6585: to stay among poor folks, and with poor clothes and things, when you
6586: might ha’ had everything o’ the best.”
6587: 
6588: His sensitiveness on this point had increased as he listened to Eppie’s
6589: words of faithful affection.
6590: 
6591: “I can never be sorry, father,” said Eppie. “I shouldn’t know what to
6592: think on or to wish for with fine things about me, as I haven’t been
6593: used to. And it ’ud be poor work for me to put on things, and ride in a
6594: gig, and sit in a place at church, as ’ud make them as I’m fond of
6595: think me unfitting company for ’em. What could _I_ care for then?”
6596: 
6597: Nancy looked at Godfrey with a pained questioning glance. But his eyes
6598: were fixed on the floor, where he was moving the end of his stick, as
6599: if he were pondering on something absently. She thought there was a
6600: word which might perhaps come better from her lips than from his.
6601: 
6602: “What you say is natural, my dear child—it’s natural you should cling
6603: to those who’ve brought you up,” she said, mildly; “but there’s a duty
6604: you owe to your lawful father. There’s perhaps something to be given up
6605: on more sides than one. When your father opens his home to you, I think
6606: it’s right you shouldn’t turn your back on it.”
6607: 
6608: “I can’t feel as I’ve got any father but one,” said Eppie, impetuously,
6609: while the tears gathered. “I’ve always thought of a little home where
6610: he’d sit i’ the corner, and I should fend and do everything for him: I
6611: can’t think o’ no other home. I wasn’t brought up to be a lady, and I
6612: can’t turn my mind to it. I like the working-folks, and their victuals,
6613: and their ways. And,” she ended passionately, while the tears fell,
6614: “I’m promised to marry a working-man, as’ll live with father, and help
6615: me to take care of him.”
6616: 
6617: Godfrey looked up at Nancy with a flushed face and smarting dilated
6618: eyes. This frustration of a purpose towards which he had set out under
6619: the exalted consciousness that he was about to compensate in some
6620: degree for the greatest demerit of his life, made him feel the air of
6621: the room stifling.
6622: 
6623: “Let us go,” he said, in an under-tone.
6624: 
6625: “We won’t talk of this any longer now,” said Nancy, rising. “We’re your
6626: well-wishers, my dear—and yours too, Marner. We shall come and see you
6627: again. It’s getting late now.”
6628: 
6629: In this way she covered her husband’s abrupt departure, for Godfrey had
6630: gone straight to the door, unable to say more.
6631: 
6632: 
6633: 
6634: CHAPTER XX.
6635: 
6636: Nancy and Godfrey walked home under the starlight in silence. When they
6637: entered the oaken parlour, Godfrey threw himself into his chair, while
6638: Nancy laid down her bonnet and shawl, and stood on the hearth near her
6639: husband, unwilling to leave him even for a few minutes, and yet fearing
6640: to utter any word lest it might jar on his feeling. At last Godfrey
6641: turned his head towards her, and their eyes met, dwelling in that
6642: meeting without any movement on either side. That quiet mutual gaze of
6643: a trusting husband and wife is like the first moment of rest or refuge
6644: from a great weariness or a great danger—not to be interfered with by
6645: speech or action which would distract the sensations from the fresh
6646: enjoyment of repose.
6647: 
6648: But presently he put out his hand, and as Nancy placed hers within it,
6649: he drew her towards him, and said—
6650: 
6651: “That’s ended!”
6652: 
6653: She bent to kiss him, and then said, as she stood by his side, “Yes,
6654: I’m afraid we must give up the hope of having her for a daughter. It
6655: wouldn’t be right to want to force her to come to us against her will.
6656: We can’t alter her bringing up and what’s come of it.”
6657: 
6658: “No,” said Godfrey, with a keen decisiveness of tone, in contrast with
6659: his usually careless and unemphatic speech—“there’s debts we can’t pay
6660: like money debts, by paying extra for the years that have slipped by.
6661: While I’ve been putting off and putting off, the trees have been
6662: growing—it’s too late now. Marner was in the right in what he said
6663: about a man’s turning away a blessing from his door: it falls to
6664: somebody else. I wanted to pass for childless once, Nancy—I shall pass
6665: for childless now against my wish.”
6666: 
6667: Nancy did not speak immediately, but after a little while she
6668: asked—“You won’t make it known, then, about Eppie’s being your
6669: daughter?”
6670: 
6671: “No: where would be the good to anybody?—only harm. I must do what I
6672: can for her in the state of life she chooses. I must see who it is
6673: she’s thinking of marrying.”
6674: 
6675: “If it won’t do any good to make the thing known,” said Nancy, who
6676: thought she might now allow herself the relief of entertaining a
6677: feeling which she had tried to silence before, “I should be very
6678: thankful for father and Priscilla never to be troubled with knowing
6679: what was done in the past, more than about Dunsey: it can’t be helped,
6680: their knowing that.”
6681: 
6682: “I shall put it in my will—I think I shall put it in my will. I
6683: shouldn’t like to leave anything to be found out, like this of Dunsey,”
6684: said Godfrey, meditatively. “But I can’t see anything but difficulties
6685: that ’ud come from telling it now. I must do what I can to make her
6686: happy in her own way. I’ve a notion,” he added, after a moment’s pause,
6687: “it’s Aaron Winthrop she meant she was engaged to. I remember seeing
6688: him with her and Marner going away from church.”
6689: 
6690: “Well, he’s very sober and industrious,” said Nancy, trying to view the
6691: matter as cheerfully as possible.
6692: 
6693: Godfrey fell into thoughtfulness again. Presently he looked up at Nancy
6694: sorrowfully, and said—
6695: 
6696: “She’s a very pretty, nice girl, isn’t she, Nancy?”
6697: 
6698: “Yes, dear; and with just your hair and eyes: I wondered it had never
6699: struck me before.”
6700: 
6701: “I think she took a dislike to me at the thought of my being her
6702: father: I could see a change in her manner after that.”
6703: 
6704: “She couldn’t bear to think of not looking on Marner as her father,”
6705: said Nancy, not wishing to confirm her husband’s painful impression.
6706: 
6707: “She thinks I did wrong by her mother as well as by her. She thinks me
6708: worse than I am. But she _must_ think it: she can never know all. It’s
6709: part of my punishment, Nancy, for my daughter to dislike me. I should
6710: never have got into that trouble if I’d been true to you—if I hadn’t
6711: been a fool. I’d no right to expect anything but evil could come of
6712: that marriage—and when I shirked doing a father’s part too.”
6713: 
6714: Nancy was silent: her spirit of rectitude would not let her try to
6715: soften the edge of what she felt to be a just compunction. He spoke
6716: again after a little while, but the tone was rather changed: there was
6717: tenderness mingled with the previous self-reproach.
6718: 
6719: “And I got _you_, Nancy, in spite of all; and yet I’ve been grumbling
6720: and uneasy because I hadn’t something else—as if I deserved it.”
6721: 
6722: “You’ve never been wanting to me, Godfrey,” said Nancy, with quiet
6723: sincerity. “My only trouble would be gone if you resigned yourself to
6724: the lot that’s been given us.”
6725: 
6726: “Well, perhaps it isn’t too late to mend a bit there. Though it _is_
6727: too late to mend some things, say what they will.”
6728: 
6729: 
6730: 
6731: CHAPTER XXI.
6732: 
6733: The next morning, when Silas and Eppie were seated at their breakfast,
6734: he said to her—
6735: 
6736: “Eppie, there’s a thing I’ve had on my mind to do this two year, and
6737: now the money’s been brought back to us, we can do it. I’ve been
6738: turning it over and over in the night, and I think we’ll set out
6739: to-morrow, while the fine days last. We’ll leave the house and
6740: everything for your godmother to take care on, and we’ll make a little
6741: bundle o’ things and set out.”
6742: 
6743: “Where to go, daddy?” said Eppie, in much surprise.
6744: 
6745: “To my old country—to the town where I was born—up Lantern Yard. I want
6746: to see Mr. Paston, the minister: something may ha’ come out to make ’em
6747: know I was innicent o’ the robbery. And Mr. Paston was a man with a
6748: deal o’ light—I want to speak to him about the drawing o’ the lots. And
6749: I should like to talk to him about the religion o’ this country-side,
6750: for I partly think he doesn’t know on it.”
6751: 
6752: Eppie was very joyful, for there was the prospect not only of wonder
6753: and delight at seeing a strange country, but also of coming back to
6754: tell Aaron all about it. Aaron was so much wiser than she was about
6755: most things—it would be rather pleasant to have this little advantage
6756: over him. Mrs. Winthrop, though possessed with a dim fear of dangers
6757: attendant on so long a journey, and requiring many assurances that it
6758: would not take them out of the region of carriers’ carts and slow
6759: waggons, was nevertheless well pleased that Silas should revisit his
6760: own country, and find out if he had been cleared from that false
6761: accusation.
6762: 
6763: “You’d be easier in your mind for the rest o’ your life, Master
6764: Marner,” said Dolly—“that you would. And if there’s any light to be got
6765: up the yard as you talk on, we’ve need of it i’ this world, and I’d be
6766: glad on it myself, if you could bring it back.”
6767: 
6768: So on the fourth day from that time, Silas and Eppie, in their Sunday
6769: clothes, with a small bundle tied in a blue linen handkerchief, were
6770: making their way through the streets of a great manufacturing town.
6771: Silas, bewildered by the changes thirty years had brought over his
6772: native place, had stopped several persons in succession to ask them the
6773: name of this town, that he might be sure he was not under a mistake
6774: about it.
6775: 
6776: “Ask for Lantern Yard, father—ask this gentleman with the tassels on
6777: his shoulders a-standing at the shop door; he isn’t in a hurry like the
6778: rest,” said Eppie, in some distress at her father’s bewilderment, and
6779: ill at ease, besides, amidst the noise, the movement, and the multitude
6780: of strange indifferent faces.
6781: 
6782: “Eh, my child, he won’t know anything about it,” said Silas;
6783: “gentlefolks didn’t ever go up the Yard. But happen somebody can tell
6784: me which is the way to Prison Street, where the jail is. I know the way
6785: out o’ that as if I’d seen it yesterday.”
6786: 
6787: With some difficulty, after many turnings and new inquiries, they
6788: reached Prison Street; and the grim walls of the jail, the first object
6789: that answered to any image in Silas’s memory, cheered him with the
6790: certitude, which no assurance of the town’s name had hitherto given
6791: him, that he was in his native place.
6792: 
6793: “Ah,” he said, drawing a long breath, “there’s the jail, Eppie; that’s
6794: just the same: I aren’t afraid now. It’s the third turning on the left
6795: hand from the jail doors—that’s the way we must go.”
6796: 
6797: “Oh, what a dark ugly place!” said Eppie. “How it hides the sky! It’s
6798: worse than the Workhouse. I’m glad you don’t live in this town now,
6799: father. Is Lantern Yard like this street?”
6800: 
6801: “My precious child,” said Silas, smiling, “it isn’t a big street like
6802: this. I never was easy i’ this street myself, but I was fond o’ Lantern
6803: Yard. The shops here are all altered, I think—I can’t make ’em out; but
6804: I shall know the turning, because it’s the third.”
6805: 
6806: “Here it is,” he said, in a tone of satisfaction, as they came to a
6807: narrow alley. “And then we must go to the left again, and then straight
6808: for’ard for a bit, up Shoe Lane: and then we shall be at the entry next
6809: to the o’erhanging window, where there’s the nick in the road for the
6810: water to run. Eh, I can see it all.”
6811: 
6812: “O father, I’m like as if I was stifled,” said Eppie. “I couldn’t ha’
6813: thought as any folks lived i’ this way, so close together. How pretty
6814: the Stone-pits ’ull look when we get back!”
6815: 
6816: “It looks comical to _me_, child, now—and smells bad. I can’t think as
6817: it usened to smell so.”
6818: 
6819: Here and there a sallow, begrimed face looked out from a gloomy doorway
6820: at the strangers, and increased Eppie’s uneasiness, so that it was a
6821: longed-for relief when they issued from the alleys into Shoe Lane,
6822: where there was a broader strip of sky.
6823: 
6824: “Dear heart!” said Silas, “why, there’s people coming out o’ the Yard
6825: as if they’d been to chapel at this time o’ day—a weekday noon!”
6826: 
6827: Suddenly he started and stood still with a look of distressed
6828: amazement, that alarmed Eppie. They were before an opening in front of
6829: a large factory, from which men and women were streaming for their
6830: midday meal.
6831: 
6832: “Father,” said Eppie, clasping his arm, “what’s the matter?”
6833: 
6834: But she had to speak again and again before Silas could answer her.
6835: 
6836: “It’s gone, child,” he said, at last, in strong agitation—“Lantern
6837: Yard’s gone. It must ha’ been here, because here’s the house with the
6838: o’erhanging window—I know that—it’s just the same; but they’ve made
6839: this new opening; and see that big factory! It’s all gone—chapel and
6840: all.”
6841: 
6842: “Come into that little brush-shop and sit down, father—they’ll let you
6843: sit down,” said Eppie, always on the watch lest one of her father’s
6844: strange attacks should come on. “Perhaps the people can tell you all
6845: about it.”
6846: 
6847: But neither from the brush-maker, who had come to Shoe Lane only ten
6848: years ago, when the factory was already built, nor from any other
6849: source within his reach, could Silas learn anything of the old Lantern
6850: Yard friends, or of Mr. Paston the minister.
6851: 
6852: “The old place is all swep’ away,” Silas said to Dolly Winthrop on the
6853: night of his return—“the little graveyard and everything. The old
6854: home’s gone; I’ve no home but this now. I shall never know whether they
6855: got at the truth o’ the robbery, nor whether Mr. Paston could ha’ given
6856: me any light about the drawing o’ the lots. It’s dark to me, Mrs.
6857: Winthrop, that is; I doubt it’ll be dark to the last.”
6858: 
6859: “Well, yes, Master Marner,” said Dolly, who sat with a placid listening
6860: face, now bordered by grey hairs; “I doubt it may. It’s the will o’
6861: Them above as a many things should be dark to us; but there’s some
6862: things as I’ve never felt i’ the dark about, and they’re mostly what
6863: comes i’ the day’s work. You were hard done by that once, Master
6864: Marner, and it seems as you’ll never know the rights of it; but that
6865: doesn’t hinder there _being_ a rights, Master Marner, for all it’s dark
6866: to you and me.”
6867: 
6868: “No,” said Silas, “no; that doesn’t hinder. Since the time the child
6869: was sent to me and I’ve come to love her as myself, I’ve had light
6870: enough to trusten by; and now she says she’ll never leave me, I think I
6871: shall trusten till I die.”
6872: 
6873: 
6874: 
6875: CONCLUSION
6876: 
6877: There was one time of the year which was held in Raveloe to be
6878: especially suitable for a wedding. It was when the great lilacs and
6879: laburnums in the old-fashioned gardens showed their golden and purple
6880: wealth above the lichen-tinted walls, and when there were calves still
6881: young enough to want bucketfuls of fragrant milk. People were not so
6882: busy then as they must become when the full cheese-making and the
6883: mowing had set in; and besides, it was a time when a light bridal dress
6884: could be worn with comfort and seen to advantage.
6885: 
6886: Happily the sunshine fell more warmly than usual on the lilac tufts the
6887: morning that Eppie was married, for her dress was a very light one. She
6888: had often thought, though with a feeling of renunciation, that the
6889: perfection of a wedding-dress would be a white cotton, with the tiniest
6890: pink sprig at wide intervals; so that when Mrs. Godfrey Cass begged to
6891: provide one, and asked Eppie to choose what it should be, previous
6892: meditation had enabled her to give a decided answer at once.
6893: 
6894: Seen at a little distance as she walked across the churchyard and down
6895: the village, she seemed to be attired in pure white, and her hair
6896: looked like the dash of gold on a lily. One hand was on her husband’s
6897: arm, and with the other she clasped the hand of her father Silas.
6898: 
6899: “You won’t be giving me away, father,” she had said before they went to
6900: church; “you’ll only be taking Aaron to be a son to you.”
6901: 
6902: Dolly Winthrop walked behind with her husband; and there ended the
6903: little bridal procession.
6904: 
6905: There were many eyes to look at it, and Miss Priscilla Lammeter was
6906: glad that she and her father had happened to drive up to the door of
6907: the Red House just in time to see this pretty sight. They had come to
6908: keep Nancy company to-day, because Mr. Cass had had to go away to
6909: Lytherley, for special reasons. That seemed to be a pity, for otherwise
6910: he might have gone, as Mr. Crackenthorp and Mr. Osgood certainly would,
6911: to look on at the wedding-feast which he had ordered at the Rainbow,
6912: naturally feeling a great interest in the weaver who had been wronged
6913: by one of his own family.
6914: 
6915: “I could ha’ wished Nancy had had the luck to find a child like that
6916: and bring her up,” said Priscilla to her father, as they sat in the
6917: gig; “I should ha’ had something young to think of then, besides the
6918: lambs and the calves.”
6919: 
6920: “Yes, my dear, yes,” said Mr. Lammeter; “one feels that as one gets
6921: older. Things look dim to old folks: they’d need have some young eyes
6922: about ’em, to let ’em know the world’s the same as it used to be.”
6923: 
6924: Nancy came out now to welcome her father and sister; and the wedding
6925: group had passed on beyond the Red House to the humbler part of the
6926: village.
6927: 
6928: Dolly Winthrop was the first to divine that old Mr. Macey, who had been
6929: set in his arm-chair outside his own door, would expect some special
6930: notice as they passed, since he was too old to be at the wedding-feast.
6931: 
6932: “Mr. Macey’s looking for a word from us,” said Dolly; “he’ll be hurt if
6933: we pass him and say nothing—and him so racked with rheumatiz.”
6934: 
6935: So they turned aside to shake hands with the old man. He had looked
6936: forward to the occasion, and had his premeditated speech.
6937: 
6938: “Well, Master Marner,” he said, in a voice that quavered a good deal,
6939: “I’ve lived to see my words come true. I was the first to say there was
6940: no harm in you, though your looks might be again’ you; and I was the
6941: first to say you’d get your money back. And it’s nothing but rightful
6942: as you should. And I’d ha’ said the “Amens”, and willing, at the holy
6943: matrimony; but Tookey’s done it a good while now, and I hope you’ll
6944: have none the worse luck.”

6946: In the open yard before the Rainbow the party of guests were already
6947: assembled, though it was still nearly an hour before the appointed
6948: feast time. But by this means they could not only enjoy the slow advent
6949: of their pleasure; they had also ample leisure to talk of Silas
6950: Marner’s strange history, and arrive by due degrees at the conclusion
6951: that he had brought a blessing on himself by acting like a father to a
6952: lone motherless child. Even the farrier did not negative this
6953: sentiment: on the contrary, he took it up as peculiarly his own, and
6954: invited any hardy person present to contradict him. But he met with no
6955: contradiction; and all differences among the company were merged in a
6956: general agreement with Mr. Snell’s sentiment, that when a man had
6957: deserved his good luck, it was the part of his neighbours to wish him
6958: joy.
6959: 
6960: As the bridal group approached, a hearty cheer was raised in the
6961: Rainbow yard; and Ben Winthrop, whose jokes had retained their
6962: acceptable flavour, found it agreeable to turn in there and receive
6963: congratulations; not requiring the proposed interval of quiet at the
6964: Stone-pits before joining the company.
6965: 
6966: Eppie had a larger garden than she had ever expected there now; and in
6967: other ways there had been alterations at the expense of Mr. Cass, the
6968: landlord, to suit Silas’s larger family. For he and Eppie had declared
6969: that they would rather stay at the Stone-pits than go to any new home.
6970: The garden was fenced with stones on two sides, but in front there was
6971: an open fence, through which the flowers shone with answering gladness,
6972: as the four united people came within sight of them.
6973: 
6974: “O father,” said Eppie, “what a pretty home ours is! I think nobody
6975: could be happier than we are.”
