8:   There, ’mid the throng of hurrying desires
9:   That trample on the dead to seize their spoil,
10:   Lurks vengeance, footless, irresistible
11:   As exhalations laden with slow death,
12:   And o’er the fairest troop of captured joys
13:   Breathes pallid pestilence.

41: CHAPTER I.
42: 
43:     Men can do nothing without the make-believe of a beginning. Even
44:     science, the strict measurer, is obliged to start with a make-believe
45:     unit, and must fix on a point in the stars’ unceasing journey when his
46:     sidereal clock shall pretend that time is at Nought. His less accurate
47:     grandmother Poetry has always been understood to start in the middle;
48:     but on reflection it appears that her proceeding is not very different
49:     from his; since Science, too, reckons backward as well as forward,
50:     divides his unit into billions, and with his clock-finger at Nought
51:     really sets off _in medias res_. No retrospect will take us to
52:     the true beginning; and whether our prologue be in heaven or on earth,
53:     it is but a fraction of that all-presupposing fact with which our
54:     story sets out.
55: 
56: 
57: Was she beautiful or not beautiful? and what was the secret of form or
58: expression which gave the dynamic quality to her glance? Was the good
59: or the evil genius dominant in those beams? Probably the evil; else why
60: was the effect that of unrest rather than of undisturbed charm? Why was
61: the wish to look again felt as coercion and not as a longing in which
62: the whole being consents?
63: 
64: She who raised these questions in Daniel Deronda’s mind was occupied in
65: gambling: not in the open air under a southern sky, tossing coppers on
66: a ruined wall, with rags about her limbs; but in one of those splendid
67: resorts which the enlightenment of ages has prepared for the same
68: species of pleasure at a heavy cost of gilt mouldings, dark-toned
69: color and chubby nudities, all correspondingly heavy—forming a
70: suitable condenser for human breath belonging, in great part, to the
71: highest fashion, and not easily procurable to be breathed in elsewhere
72: in the like proportion, at least by persons of little fashion.
73: 
74: It was near four o’clock on a September day, so that the atmosphere was
75: well-brewed to a visible haze. There was deep stillness, broken only by
76: a light rattle, a light chink, a small sweeping sound, and an
77: occasional monotone in French, such as might be expected to issue from
78: an ingeniously constructed automaton. Round two long tables were
79: gathered two serried crowds of human beings, all save one having their
80: faces and attention bent on the tables. The one exception was a
81: melancholy little boy, with his knees and calves simply in their
82: natural clothing of epidermis, but for the rest of his person in a
83: fancy dress. He alone had his face turned toward the doorway, and
84: fixing on it the blank gaze of a bedizened child stationed as a
85: masquerading advertisement on the platform of an itinerant show, stood
86: close behind a lady deeply engaged at the roulette-table.
87: 
88: About this table fifty or sixty persons were assembled, many in the
89: outer rows, where there was occasionally a deposit of new-comers, being
90: mere spectators, only that one of them, usually a woman, might now and
91: then be observed putting down a five-franc with a simpering air, just
92: to see what the passion of gambling really was. Those who were taking
93: their pleasure at a higher strength, and were absorbed in play, showed
94: very distant varieties of European type: Livonian and Spanish,
95: Graeco-Italian and miscellaneous German, English aristocratic and
96: English plebeian. Here certainly was a striking admission of human
97: equality. The white bejewelled fingers of an English countess were very
98: near touching a bony, yellow, crab-like hand stretching a bared wrist
99: to clutch a heap of coin—a hand easy to sort with the square, gaunt
100: face, deep-set eyes, grizzled eyebrows, and ill-combed scanty hair
101: which seemed a slight metamorphosis of the vulture. And where else
102: would her ladyship have graciously consented to sit by that dry-lipped
103: feminine figure prematurely old, withered after short bloom like her
104: artificial flowers, holding a shabby velvet reticule before her, and
105: occasionally putting in her mouth the point with which she pricked her
106: card? There too, very near the fair countess, was a respectable London
107: tradesman, blonde and soft-handed, his sleek hair scrupulously parted
108: behind and before, conscious of circulars addressed to the nobility and
109: gentry, whose distinguished patronage enabled him to take his holidays
110: fashionably, and to a certain extent in their distinguished company.
111: Not his the gambler’s passion that nullifies appetite, but a well-fed
112: leisure, which, in the intervals of winning money in business and
113: spending it showily, sees no better resource than winning money in play
114: and spending it yet more showily—reflecting always that Providence had
115: never manifested any disapprobation of his amusement, and dispassionate
116: enough to leave off if the sweetness of winning much and seeing others
117: lose had turned to the sourness of losing much and seeing others win.
118: For the vice of gambling lay in losing money at it. In his bearing
119: there might be something of the tradesman, but in his pleasures he was
120: fit to rank with the owners of the oldest titles. Standing close to his
121: chair was a handsome Italian, calm, statuesque, reaching across him to
122: place the first pile of napoleons from a new bagful just brought him by
123: an envoy with a scrolled mustache. The pile was in half a minute pushed
124: over to an old bewigged woman with eye-glasses pinching her nose. There
125: was a slight gleam, a faint mumbling smile about the lips of the old
126: woman; but the statuesque Italian remained impassive, and—probably
127: secure in an infallible system which placed his foot on the neck of
128: chance—immediately prepared a new pile. So did a man with the air of
129: an emaciated beau or worn-out libertine, who looked at life through one
130: eye-glass, and held out his hand tremulously when he asked for change.
131: It could surely be no severity of system, but rather some dream of
132: white crows, or the induction that the eighth of the month was lucky,
133: which inspired the fierce yet tottering impulsiveness of his play.
134: 
135: But, while every single player differed markedly from every other,
136: there was a certain uniform negativeness of expression which had the
137: effect of a mask—as if they had all eaten of some root that for the
138: time compelled the brains of each to the same narrow monotony of action.
139: 
140: Deronda’s first thought when his eyes fell on this scene of dull,
141: gas-poisoned absorption, was that the gambling of Spanish shepherd-boys
142: had seemed to him more enviable:—so far Rousseau might be justified in
143: maintaining that art and science had done a poor service to mankind.
144: But suddenly he felt the moment become dramatic. His attention was
145: arrested by a young lady who, standing at an angle not far from him,
146: was the last to whom his eyes traveled. She was bending and speaking
147: English to a middle-aged lady seated at play beside her: but the next
148: instant she returned to her play, and showed the full height of a
149: graceful figure, with a face which might possibly be looked at without
150: admiration, but could hardly be passed with indifference.
151: 
152: The inward debate which she raised in Deronda gave to his eyes a
153: growing expression of scrutiny, tending farther and farther away from
154: the glow of mingled undefined sensibilities forming admiration. At one
155: moment they followed the movements of the figure, of the arms and
156: hands, as this problematic sylph bent forward to deposit her stake with
157: an air of firm choice; and the next they returned to the face which, at
158: present unaffected by beholders, was directed steadily toward the game.
159: The sylph was a winner; and as her taper fingers, delicately gloved in
160: pale-gray, were adjusting the coins which had been pushed toward her in
161: order to pass them back again to the winning point, she looked round
162: her with a survey too markedly cold and neutral not to have in it a
163: little of that nature which we call art concealing an inward exultation.
164: 
165: But in the course of that survey her eyes met Deronda’s, and instead of
166: averting them as she would have desired to do, she was unpleasantly
167: conscious that they were arrested—how long? The darting sense that he
168: was measuring her and looking down on her as an inferior, that he was of
169: different quality from the human dross around her, that he felt himself
170: in a region outside and above her, and was examining her as a specimen
171: of a lower order, roused a tingling resentment which stretched the
172: moment with conflict. It did not bring the blood to her cheeks, but it
173: sent it away from her lips. She controlled herself by the help of an
174: inward defiance, and without other sign of emotion than this
175: lip-paleness turned to her play. But Deronda’s gaze seemed to have acted
176: as an evil eye. Her stake was gone. No matter; she had been winning ever
177: since she took to roulette with a few napoleons at command, and had a
178: considerable reserve. She had begun to believe in her luck, others had
179: begun to believe in it: she had visions of being followed by a _cortège_
180: who would worship her as a goddess of luck and watch her play as a
181: directing augury. Such things had been known of male gamblers; why
182: should not a woman have a like supremacy? Her friend and chaperon who
183: had not wished her to play at first was beginning to approve, only
184: administering the prudent advice to stop at the right moment and carry
185: money back to England—advice to which Gwendolen had replied that she
186: cared for the excitement of play, not the winnings. On that supposition
187: the present moment ought to have made the flood-tide in her eager
188: experience of gambling. Yet, when her next stake was swept away, she
189: felt the orbits of her eyes getting hot, and the certainty she had
190: (without looking) of that man still watching her was something like a
191: pressure which begins to be torturing. The more reason to her why she
192: should not flinch, but go on playing as if she were indifferent to loss
193: or gain. Her friend touched her elbow and proposed that they should quit
194: the table. For reply Gwendolen put ten louis on the same spot: she was
195: in that mood of defiance in which the mind loses sight of any end beyond
196: the satisfaction of enraged resistance; and with the puerile stupidity
197: of a dominant impulse includes luck among its objects of defiance. Since
198: she was not winning strikingly, the next best thing was to lose
199: strikingly. She controlled her muscles, and showed no tremor of mouth or
200: hands. Each time her stake was swept off she doubled it. Many were now
201: watching her, but the sole observation she was conscious of was
202: Deronda’s, who, though she never looked toward him, she was sure had not
203: moved away. Such a drama takes no long while to play out: development
204: and catastrophe can often be measured by nothing clumsier than the
205: moment-hand. “Faites votre jeu, mesdames et messieurs,” said the
206: automatic voice of destiny from between the mustache and imperial of the
207: croupier: and Gwendolen’s arm was stretched to deposit her last poor
208: heap of napoleons. “Le jeu ne va plus,” said destiny. And in five
209: seconds Gwendolen turned from the table, but turned resolutely with her
210: face toward Deronda and looked at him. There was a smile of irony in his
211: eyes as their glances met; but it was at least better that he should
212: have kept his attention fixed on her than that he disregarded her as one
213: of an insect swarm who had no individual physiognomy. Besides, in spite
214: of his superciliousness and irony, it was difficult to believe that he
215: did not admire her spirit as well as her person: he was young, handsome,
216: distinguished in appearance—not one of these ridiculous and dowdy
217: Philistines who thought it incumbent on them to blight the gaming-table
218: with a sour look of protest as they passed by it. The general conviction
219: that we are admirable does not easily give way before a single negative;
220: rather when any of Vanity’s large family, male or female, find their
221: performance received coldly, they are apt to believe that a little more
222: of it will win over the unaccountable dissident. In Gwendolen’s habits
223: of mind it had been taken for granted that she knew what was admirable
224: and that she herself was admired. This basis of her thinking had
225: received a disagreeable concussion, and reeled a little, but was not
226: easily to be overthrown.
227: 
228: In the evening the same room was more stiflingly heated, was brilliant
229: with gas and with the costumes of ladies who floated their trains along
230: it or were seated on the ottomans.
231: 
232: The Nereid in sea-green robes and silver ornaments, with a pale
233: sea-green feather fastened in silver falling backward over her green
234: hat and light brown hair, was Gwendolen Harleth. She was under the
235: wing, or rather soared by the shoulder, of the lady who had sat by her
236: at the roulette-table; and with them was a gentleman with a white
237: mustache and clipped hair: solid-browed, stiff and German. They were
238: walking about or standing to chat with acquaintances, and Gwendolen was
239: much observed by the seated groups.
240: 
241: “A striking girl—that Miss Harleth—unlike others.”
242: 
243: “Yes, she has got herself up as a sort of serpent now—all green and
244: silver, and winds her neck about a little more than usual.”
245: 
246: “Oh, she must always be doing something extraordinary. She is that kind
247: of girl, I fancy. Do you think her pretty, Mr. Vandernoodt?”
248: 
249: “Very. A man might risk hanging for her—I mean a fool might.”
250: 
251: “You like a _nez retroussé_, then, and long narrow eyes?”
252: 
253: “When they go with such an _ensemble_.”
254: 
255: “The _ensemble du serpent_?”
256: 
257: “If you will. Woman was tempted by a serpent; why not man?”
258: 
259: “She is certainly very graceful; but she wants a tinge of color in her
260: cheeks. It is a sort of Lamia beauty she has.”
261: 
262: “On the contrary, I think her complexion one of her chief charms. It is
263: a warm paleness; it looks thoroughly healthy. And that delicate nose
264: with its gradual little upward curve is distracting. And then her
265: mouth—there never was a prettier mouth, the lips curled backward so
266: finely, eh, Mackworth?”
267: 
268: “Think so? I cannot endure that sort of mouth. It looks so
269: self-complacent, as if it knew its own beauty—the curves are too
270: immovable. I like a mouth that trembles more.”
271: 
272: “For my part, I think her odious,” said a dowager. “It is wonderful
273: what unpleasant girls get into vogue. Who are these Langens? Does
274: anybody know them?”
275: 
276: “They are quite _comme il faut_. I have dined with them several times
277: at the _Russie_. The baroness is English. Miss Harleth calls her
278: cousin. The girl herself is thoroughly well-bred, and as clever as
279: possible.”
280: 
281: “Dear me! and the baron?”.
282: 
283: “A very good furniture picture.”
284: 
285: “Your baroness is always at the roulette-table,” said Mackworth. “I
286: fancy she has taught the girl to gamble.”
287: 
288: “Oh, the old woman plays a very sober game; drops a ten-franc piece
289: here and there. The girl is more headlong. But it is only a freak.”
290: 
291: “I hear she has lost all her winnings to-day. Are they rich? Who knows?”
292: 
293: “Ah, who knows? Who knows that about anybody?” said Mr. Vandernoodt,
294: moving off to join the Langens.
295: 
296: The remark that Gwendolen wound her neck about more than usual this
297: evening was true. But it was not that she might carry out the serpent
298: idea more completely: it was that she watched for any chance of seeing
299: Deronda, so that she might inquire about this stranger, under whose
300: measuring gaze she was still wincing. At last her opportunity came.
301: 
302: “Mr. Vandernoodt, you know everybody,” said Gwendolen, not too eagerly,
303: rather with a certain languor of utterance which she sometimes gave to
304: her clear soprano. “Who is that near the door?”
305: 
306: “There are half a dozen near the door. Do you mean that old Adonis in
307: the George the Fourth wig?”
308: 
309: “No, no; the dark-haired young man on the right with the dreadful
310: expression.”
311: 
312: “Dreadful, do you call it? I think he is an uncommonly fine fellow.”
313: 
314: “But who is he?”
315: 
316: “He is lately come to our hotel with Sir Hugo Mallinger.”
317: 
318: “Sir Hugo Mallinger?”
319: 
320: “Yes. Do you know him?”
321: 
322: “No.” (Gwendolen colored slightly.) “He has a place near us, but he
323: never comes to it. What did you say was the name of that gentleman near
324: the door?”
325: 
326: “Deronda—Mr. Deronda.”
327: 
328: “What a delightful name! Is he an Englishman?”
329: 
330: “Yes. He is reported to be rather closely related to the baronet. You
331: are interested in him?”
332: 
333: “Yes. I think he is not like young men in general.”
334: 
335: “And you don’t admire young men in general?”
336: 
337: “Not in the least. I always know what they will say. I can’t at all
338: guess what this Mr. Deronda would say. What _does_ he say?”
339: 
340: “Nothing, chiefly. I sat with his party for a good hour last night on
341: the terrace, and he never spoke—and was not smoking either. He looked
342: bored.”
343: 
344: “Another reason why I should like to know him. I am always bored.”
345: 
346: “I should think he would be charmed to have an introduction. Shall I
347: bring it about? Will you allow it, baroness?”
348: 
349: “Why not?—since he is related to Sir Hugo Mallinger. It is a new
350: _rôle_ of yours, Gwendolen, to be always bored,” continued Madame von
351: Langen, when Mr. Vandernoodt had moved away. “Until now you have always
352: seemed eager about something from morning till night.”
353: 
354: “That is just because I am bored to death. If I am to leave off play I
355: must break my arm or my collar-bone. I must make something happen;
356: unless you will go into Switzerland and take me up the Matterhorn.”
357: 
358: “Perhaps this Mr. Deronda’s acquaintance will do instead of the
359: Matterhorn.”
360: 
361: “Perhaps.”
362: 
363: But Gwendolen did not make Deronda’s acquaintance on this occasion. Mr.
364: Vandernoodt did not succeed in bringing him up to her that evening, and
365: when she re-entered her own room she found a letter recalling her home.
366: 
367: 
368: 
369: 
370: CHAPTER II.
371: 
372:   This man contrives a secret ’twixt us two,
373:   That he may quell me with his meeting eyes
374:   Like one who quells a lioness at bay.
375: 
376: 
377: This was the letter Gwendolen found on her table:
378: 
379:     DEAREST CHILD.—I have been expecting to hear from you for a week. In
380:     your last you said the Langens thought of leaving Leubronn and going
381:     to Baden. How could you be so thoughtless as to leave me in
382:     uncertainty about your address? I am in the greatest anxiety lest this
383:     should not reach you. In any case, you were to come home at the end of
384:     September, and I must now entreat you to return as quickly as
385:     possible, for if you spent all your money it would be out of my power
386:     to send you any more, and you must not borrow of the Langens, for I
387:     could not repay them. This is the sad truth, my child—I wish I could
388:     prepare you for it better—but a dreadful calamity has befallen us
389:     all. You know nothing about business and will not understand it; but
390:     Grapnell & Co. have failed for a million, and we are totally
391:     ruined—your aunt Gascoigne as well as I, only that your uncle has his
392:     benefice, so that by putting down their carriage and getting interest
393:     for the boys, the family can go on. All the property our poor father
394:     saved for us goes to pay the liabilities. There is nothing I can call
395:     my own. It is better you should know this at once, though it rends my
396:     heart to have to tell it you. Of course we cannot help thinking what a
397:     pity it was that you went away just when you did. But I shall never
398:     reproach you, my dear child; I would save you from all trouble if I
399:     could. On your way home you will have time to prepare yourself for the
400:     change you will find. We shall perhaps leave Offendene at once, for we
401:     hope that Mr. Haynes, who wanted it before, may be ready to take it
402:     off my hands. Of course we cannot go to the rectory—there is not a
403:     corner there to spare. We must get some hut or other to shelter us,
404:     and we must live on your uncle Gascoigne’s charity, until I see what
405:     else can be done. I shall not be able to pay the debts to the
406:     tradesmen besides the servants’ wages. Summon up your fortitude, my
407:     dear child; we must resign ourselves to God’s will. But it is hard to
408:     resign one’s self to Mr. Lassman’s wicked recklessness, which they say
409:     was the cause of the failure. Your poor sisters can only cry with me
410:     and give me no help. If you were once here, there might be a break in
411:     the cloud—I always feel it impossible that you can have been meant
412:     for poverty. If the Langens wish to remain abroad, perhaps you can put
413:     yourself under some one else’s care for the journey. But come as soon
414:     as you can to your afflicted and loving mamma,
415: 
416:     FANNY DAVILOW.
417: 
418: The first effect of this letter on Gwendolen was half-stupefying. The
419: implicit confidence that her destiny must be one of luxurious ease,
420: where any trouble that occurred would be well clad and provided for,
421: had been stronger in her own mind than in her mamma’s, being fed there
422: by her youthful blood and that sense of superior claims which made a
423: large part of her consciousness. It was almost as difficult for her to
424: believe suddenly that her position had become one of poverty and of
425: humiliating dependence, as it would have been to get into the strong
426: current of her blooming life the chill sense that her death would
427: really come. She stood motionless for a few minutes, then tossed off
428: her hat and automatically looked in the glass. The coils of her smooth
429: light-brown hair were still in order perfect enough for a ball-room;
430: and as on other nights, Gwendolen might have looked lingeringly at
431: herself for pleasure (surely an allowable indulgence); but now she took
432: no conscious note of her reflected beauty, and simply stared right
433: before her as if she had been jarred by a hateful sound and was waiting
434: for any sign of its cause. By-and-by she threw herself in the corner of
435: the red velvet sofa, took up the letter again and read it twice
436: deliberately, letting it at last fall on the ground, while she rested
437: her clasped hands on her lap and sat perfectly still, shedding no
438: tears. Her impulse was to survey and resist the situation rather than
439: to wail over it. There was no inward exclamation of “Poor mamma!” Her
440: mamma had never seemed to get much enjoyment out of life, and if
441: Gwendolen had been at this moment disposed to feel pity she would have
442: bestowed it on herself—for was she not naturally and rightfully the
443: chief object of her mamma’s anxiety too? But it was anger, it was
444: resistance that possessed her; it was bitter vexation that she had lost
445: her gains at roulette, whereas if her luck had continued through this
446: one day she would have had a handsome sum to carry home, or she might
447: have gone on playing and won enough to support them all. Even now was
448: it not possible? She had only four napoleons left in her purse, but she
449: possessed some ornaments which she could sell: a practice so common in
450: stylish society at German baths that there was no need to be ashamed of
451: it; and even if she had not received her mamma’s letter, she would
452: probably have decided to get money for an Etruscan necklace which she
453: happened not to have been wearing since her arrival; nay, she might
454: have done so with an agreeable sense that she was living with some
455: intensity and escaping humdrum. With ten louis at her disposal and a
456: return of her former luck, which seemed probable, what could she do
457: better than go on playing for a few days? If her friends at home
458: disapproved of the way in which she got the money, as they certainly
459: would, still the money would be there. Gwendolen’s imagination dwelt on
460: this course and created agreeable consequences, but not with unbroken
461: confidence and rising certainty as it would have done if she had been
462: touched with the gambler’s mania. She had gone to the roulette-table
463: not because of passion, but in search of it: her mind was still sanely
464: capable of picturing balanced probabilities, and while the chance of
465: winning allured her, the chance of losing thrust itself on her with
466: alternate strength and made a vision from which her pride sank
467: sensitively. For she was resolved not to tell the Langens that any
468: misfortune had befallen her family, or to make herself in any way
469: indebted to their compassion; and if she were to part with her jewelry
470: to any observable extent, they would interfere by inquiries and
471: remonstrances. The course that held the least risk of intolerable
472: annoyance was to raise money on her necklace early in the morning, tell
473: the Langens that her mother desired her immediate return without giving
474: a reason, and take the train for Brussels that evening. She had no maid
475: with her, and the Langens might make difficulties about her returning
476: home, but her will was peremptory.
477: 
478: Instead of going to bed she made as brilliant a light as she could and
479: began to pack, working diligently, though all the while visited by the
480: scenes that might take place on the coming day—now by the tiresome
481: explanations and farewells, and the whirling journey toward a changed
482: home, now by the alternative of staying just another day and standing
483: again at the roulette-table. But always in this latter scene there was
484: the presence of that Deronda, watching her with exasperating irony,
485: and—the two keen experiences were inevitably revived
486: together—beholding her again forsaken by luck. This importunate image
487: certainly helped to sway her resolve on the side of immediate
488: departure, and to urge her packing to the point which would make a
489: change of mind inconvenient. It had struck twelve when she came into
490: her room, and by the time she was assuring herself that she had left
491: out only what was necessary, the faint dawn was stealing through the
492: white blinds and dulling her candles. What was the use of going to bed?
493: Her cold bath was refreshment enough, and she saw that a slight trace
494: of fatigue about the eyes only made her look the more interesting.
495: Before six o’clock she was completely equipped in her gray traveling
496: dress even to her felt hat, for she meant to walk out as soon as she
497: could count on seeing other ladies on their way to the springs. And
498: happening to be seated sideways before the long strip of mirror between
499: her two windows she turned to look at herself, leaning her elbow on the
500: back of the chair in an attitude that might have been chosen for her
501: portrait. It is possible to have a strong self-love without any
502: self-satisfaction, rather with a self-discontent which is the more
503: intense because one’s own little core of egoistic sensibility is a
504: supreme care; but Gwendolen knew nothing of such inward strife. She had
505: a _naïve_ delight in her fortunate self, which any but the harshest
506: saintliness will have some indulgence for in a girl who had every day
507: seen a pleasant reflection of that self in her friends’ flattery as
508: well as in the looking-glass. And even in this beginning of troubles,
509: while for lack of anything else to do she sat gazing at her image in
510: the growing light, her face gathered a complacency gradual as the
511: cheerfulness of the morning. Her beautiful lips curled into a more and
512: more decided smile, till at last she took off her hat, leaned forward
513: and kissed the cold glass which had looked so warm. How could she
514: believe in sorrow? If it attacked her, she felt the force to crush it,
515: to defy it, or run away from it, as she had done already. Anything
516: seemed more possible than that she could go on bearing miseries, great
517: or small.
518: 
519: Madame von Langen never went out before breakfast, so that Gwendolen
520: could safely end her early walk by taking her way homeward through the
521: Obere Strasse in which was the needed shop, sure to be open after
522: seven. At that hour any observers whom she minded would be either on
523: their walks in the region of the springs, or would be still in their
524: bedrooms; but certainly there was one grand hotel, the _Czarina_ from
525: which eyes might follow her up to Mr. Wiener’s door. This was a chance
526: to be risked: might she not be going in to buy something which had
527: struck her fancy? This implicit falsehood passed through her mind as
528: she remembered that the _Czarina_ was Deronda’s hotel; but she was then
529: already far up the Obere Strasse, and she walked on with her usual
530: floating movement, every line in her figure and drapery falling in
531: gentle curves attractive to all eyes except those which discerned in
532: them too close a resemblance to the serpent, and objected to the
533: revival of serpent-worship. She looked neither to the right hand nor to
534: the left, and transacted her business in the shop with a coolness which
535: gave little Mr. Wiener nothing to remark except her proud grace of
536: manner, and the superior size and quality of the three central
537: turquoises in the necklace she offered him. They had belonged to a
538: chain once her father’s: but she had never known her father; and the
539: necklace was in all respects the ornament she could most conveniently
540: part with. Who supposes that it is an impossible contradiction to be
541: superstitious and rationalizing at the same time? Roulette encourages a
542: romantic superstition as to the chances of the game, and the most
543: prosaic rationalism as to human sentiments which stand in the way of
544: raising needful money. Gwendolen’s dominant regret was that after all
545: she had only nine louis to add to the four in her purse: these Jew
546: dealers were so unscrupulous in taking advantage of Christians
547: unfortunate at play! But she was the Langens’ guest in their hired
548: apartment, and had nothing to pay there: thirteen louis would do more
549: than take her home; even if she determined on risking three, the
550: remaining ten would more than suffice, since she meant to travel right
551: on, day and night. As she turned homeward, nay, entered and seated
552: herself in the _salon_ to await her friends and breakfast, she still
553: wavered as to her immediate departure, or rather she had concluded to
554: tell the Langens simply that she had had a letter from her mamma
555: desiring her return, and to leave it still undecided when she should
556: start. It was already the usual breakfast-time, and hearing some one
557: enter as she was leaning back rather tired and hungry with her eyes
558: shut, she rose expecting to see one or other of the Langens—the words
559: which might determine her lingering at least another day, ready-formed
560: to pass her lips. But it was the servant bringing in a small packet for
561: Miss Harleth, which had at that moment been left at the door. Gwendolen
562: took it in her hand and immediately hurried into her own room. She
563: looked paler and more agitated than when she had first read her mamma’s
564: letter. Something—she never quite knew what—revealed to her before
565: she opened the packet that it contained the necklace she had just
566: parted with. Underneath the paper it was wrapped in a cambric
567: handkerchief, and within this was a scrap of torn-off note-paper, on
568: which was written with a pencil, in clear but rapid handwriting—“_A
569: stranger who has found Miss Harleth’s necklace returns it to her with
570: the hope that she will not again risk the loss of it._”
571: 
572: Gwendolen reddened with the vexation of wounded pride. A large corner
573: of the handkerchief seemed to have been recklessly torn off to get rid
574: of a mark; but she at once believed in the first image of “the
575: stranger” that presented itself to her mind. It was Deronda; he must
576: have seen her go into the shop; he must have gone in immediately after
577: and repurchased the necklace. He had taken an unpardonable liberty, and
578: had dared to place her in a thoroughly hateful position. What could she
579: do?—Not, assuredly, act on her conviction that it was he who had sent
580: her the necklace and straightway send it back to him: that would be to
581: face the possibility that she had been mistaken; nay, even if the
582: “stranger” were he and no other, it would be something too gross for
583: her to let him know that she had divined this, and to meet him again
584: with that recognition in their minds. He knew very well that he was
585: entangling her in helpless humiliation: it was another way of smiling
586: at her ironically, and taking the air of a supercilious mentor.
587: Gwendolen felt the bitter tears of mortification rising and rolling
588: down her cheeks. No one had ever before dared to treat her with irony
589: and contempt. One thing was clear: she must carry out her resolution to
590: quit this place at once; it was impossible for her to reappear in the
591: public _salon_, still less stand at the gaming-table with the risk of
592: seeing Deronda. Now came an importunate knock at the door: breakfast
593: was ready. Gwendolen with a passionate movement thrust necklace,
594: cambric, scrap of paper, and all into her _nécessaire_, pressed her
595: handkerchief against her face, and after pausing a minute or two to
596: summon back her proud self-control, went to join her friends. Such
597: signs of tears and fatigue as were left seemed accordant enough with
598: the account she at once gave of her having sat up to do her packing,
599: instead of waiting for help from her friend’s maid. There was much
600: protestation, as she had expected, against her traveling alone, but she
601: persisted in refusing any arrangements for companionship. She would be
602: put into the ladies’ compartment and go right on. She could rest
603: exceedingly well in the train, and was afraid of nothing.
604: 
605: In this way it happened that Gwendolen never reappeared at the
606: roulette-table, but that Thursday evening left Leubronn for Brussels,
607: and on Saturday morning arrived at Offendene, the home to which she and
608: her family were soon to say a last good-bye.

613: CHAPTER III.
614: 
615:     “Let no flower of the spring pass by us; let us crown ourselves with
616:     rosebuds before they be withered.”—BOOK OF WISDOM.
617: 
618: 
619: Pity that Offendene was not the home of Miss Harleth’s childhood, or
620: endeared to her by family memories! A human life, I think, should be
621: well rooted in some spot of a native land, where it may get the love of
622: tender kinship for the face of earth, for the labors men go forth to,
623: for the sounds and accents that haunt it, for whatever will give that
624: early home a familiar unmistakable difference amid the future widening
625: of knowledge: a spot where the definiteness of early memories may be
626: inwrought with affection, and—kindly acquaintance with all neighbors,
627: even to the dogs and donkeys, may spread not by sentimental effort and
628: reflection, but as a sweet habit of the blood. At five years old,
629: mortals are not prepared to be citizens of the world, to be stimulated
630: by abstract nouns, to soar above preference into impartiality; and that
631: prejudice in favor of milk with which we blindly begin, is a type of
632: the way body and soul must get nourished at least for a time. The best
633: introduction to astronomy is to think of the nightly heavens as a
634: little lot of stars belonging to one’s own homestead.
635: 
636: But this blessed persistence in which affection can take root had been
637: wanting in Gwendolen’s life. It was only a year before her recall from
638: Leubronn that Offendene had been chosen as her mamma’s home, simply for
639: its nearness to Pennicote Rectory, and that Mrs. Davilow, Gwendolen,
640: and her four half-sisters (the governess and the maid following in
641: another vehicle) had been driven along the avenue for the first time,
642: on a late October afternoon when the rooks were crawing loudly above
643: them, and the yellow elm-leaves were whirling.
644: 
645: The season suited the aspect of the old oblong red-brick house, rather
646: too anxiously ornamented with stone at every line, not excepting the
647: double row of narrow windows and the large square portico. The stone
648: encouraged a greenish lichen, the brick a powdery gray, so that though
649: the building was rigidly rectangular there was no harshness in the
650: physiognomy which it turned to the three avenues cut east, west and
651: south in the hundred yards’ breadth of old plantation encircling the
652: immediate grounds. One would have liked the house to have been lifted
653: on a knoll, so as to look beyond its own little domain to the long
654: thatched roofs of the distant villages, the church towers, the
655: scattered homesteads, the gradual rise of surging woods, and the green
656: breadths of undulating park which made the beautiful face of the earth
657: in that part of Wessex. But though standing thus behind a screen amid
658: flat pastures, it had on one side a glimpse of the wider world in the
659: lofty curves of the chalk downs, grand steadfast forms played over by
660: the changing days.
661: 
662: The house was but just large enough to be called a mansion, and was
663: moderately rented, having no manor attached to it, and being rather
664: difficult to let with its sombre furniture and faded upholstery. But
665: inside and outside it was what no beholder could suppose to be
666: inhabited by retired trades-people: a certainty which was worth many
667: conveniences to tenants who not only had the taste that shrinks from
668: new finery, but also were in that border-territory of rank where
669: annexation is a burning topic: and to take up her abode in a house
670: which had once sufficed for dowager countesses gave a perceptible tinge
671: to Mrs. Davilow’s satisfaction in having an establishment of her own.
672: This, rather mysteriously to Gwendolen, appeared suddenly possible on
673: the death of her step-father, Captain Davilow, who had for the last
674: nine years joined his family only in a brief and fitful manner, enough
675: to reconcile them to his long absences; but she cared much more for the
676: fact than for the explanation. All her prospects had become more
677: agreeable in consequence. She had disliked their former way of life,
678: roving from one foreign watering-place or Parisian apartment to
679: another, always feeling new antipathies to new suites of hired
680: furniture, and meeting new people under conditions which made her
681: appear of little importance; and the variation of having passed two
682: years at a showy school, where, on all occasions of display, she had
683: been put foremost, had only deepened her sense that so exceptional a
684: person as herself could hardly remain in ordinary circumstances or in a
685: social position less than advantageous. Any fear of this latter evil
686: was banished now that her mamma was to have an establishment; for on
687: the point of birth Gwendolen was quite easy. She had no notion how her
688: maternal grandfather got the fortune inherited by his two daughters;
689: but he had been a West Indian—which seemed to exclude further
690: question; and she knew that her father’s family was so high as to take
691: no notice of her mamma, who nevertheless preserved with much pride the
692: miniature of a Lady Molly in that connection. She would probably have
693: known much more about her father but for a little incident which
694: happened when she was twelve years old. Mrs. Davilow had brought out,
695: as she did only at wide intervals, various memorials of her first
696: husband, and while showing his miniature to Gwendolen recalled with a
697: fervor which seemed to count on a peculiar filial sympathy, the fact
698: that dear papa had died when his little daughter was in long clothes.
699: Gwendolen, immediately thinking of the unlovable step-father whom she
700: had been acquainted with the greater part of her life while her frocks
701: were short, said,
702: 
703: “Why did you marry again, mamma? It would have been nicer if you had
704: not.”
705: 
706: Mrs. Davilow colored deeply, a slight convulsive movement passed over
707: her face, and straightway shutting up the memorials she said, with a
708: violence quite unusual in her,
709: 
710: “You have no feeling, child!”
711: 
712: Gwendolen, who was fond of her mamma, felt hurt and ashamed, and had
713: never since dared to ask a question about her father.
714: 
715: This was not the only instance in which she had brought on herself the
716: pain of some filial compunction. It was always arranged, when possible,
717: that she should have a small bed in her mamma’s room; for Mrs.
718: Davilow’s motherly tenderness clung chiefly to her eldest girl, who had
719: been born in her happier time. One night under an attack of pain she
720: found that the specific regularly placed by her bedside had been
721: forgotten, and begged Gwendolen to get out of bed and reach it for her.
722: That healthy young lady, snug and warm as a rosy infant in her little
723: couch, objected to step out into the cold, and lying perfectly still,
724: grumbling a refusal. Mrs. Davilow went without the medicine and never
725: reproached her daughter; but the next day Gwendolen was keenly
726: conscious of what must be in her mamma’s mind, and tried to make amends
727: by caresses which cost her no effort. Having always been the pet and
728: pride of the household, waited on by mother, sisters, governess and
729: maids, as if she had been a princess in exile, she naturally found it
730: difficult to think her own pleasure less important than others made it,
731: and when it was positively thwarted felt an astonished resentment apt,
732: in her cruder days, to vent itself in one of those passionate acts
733: which look like a contradiction of habitual tendencies. Though never
734: even as a child thoughtlessly cruel, nay delighting to rescue drowning
735: insects and watch their recovery, there was a disagreeable silent
736: remembrance of her having strangled her sister’s canary-bird in a final
737: fit of exasperation at its shrill singing which had again and again
738: jarringly interrupted her own. She had taken pains to buy a white mouse
739: for her sister in retribution, and though inwardly excusing herself on
740: the ground of a peculiar sensitiveness which was a mark of her general
741: superiority, the thought of that infelonious murder had always made her
742: wince. Gwendolen’s nature was not remorseless, but she liked to make
743: her penances easy, and now that she was twenty and more, some of her
744: native force had turned into a self-control by which she guarded
745: herself from penitential humiliation. There was more show of fire and
746: will in her than ever, but there was more calculation underneath it.
747: 
748: On this day of arrival at Offendene, which not even Mrs. Davilow had
749: seen before—the place having been taken for her by her brother-in-law,
750: Mr. Gascoigne—when all had got down from the carriage, and were
751: standing under the porch in front of the open door, so that they could
752: have a general view of the place and a glimpse of the stone hall and
753: staircase hung with sombre pictures, but enlivened by a bright wood
754: fire, no one spoke; mamma, the four sisters and the governess all
755: looked at Gwendolen, as if their feelings depended entirely on her
756: decision. Of the girls, from Alice in her sixteenth year to Isabel in
757: her tenth, hardly anything could be said on a first view, but that they
758: were girlish, and that their black dresses were getting shabby. Miss
759: Merry was elderly and altogether neutral in expression. Mrs. Davilow’s
760: worn beauty seemed the more pathetic for the look of entire appeal
761: which she cast at Gwendolen, who was glancing round at the house, the
762: landscape and the entrance hall with an air of rapid judgment. Imagine
763: a young race-horse in the paddock among untrimmed ponies and patient
764: hacks.
765: 
766: “Well, dear, what do you think of the place,” said Mrs. Davilow at
767: last, in a gentle, deprecatory tone.
768: 
769: “I think it is charming,” said Gwendolen, quickly. “A romantic place;
770: anything delightful may happen in it; it would be a good background for
771: anything. No one need be ashamed of living here.”
772: 
773: “There is certainly nothing common about it.”
774: 
775: “Oh, it would do for fallen royalty or any sort of grand poverty. We
776: ought properly to have been living in splendor, and have come down to
777: this. It would have been as romantic as could be. But I thought my
778: uncle and aunt Gascoigne would be here to meet us, and my cousin Anna,”
779: added Gwendolen, her tone changed to sharp surprise.
780: 
781: “We are early,” said Mrs. Davilow, and entering the hall, she said to
782: the housekeeper who came forward, “You expect Mr. and Mrs. Gascoigne?”
783: 
784: “Yes, madam; they were here yesterday to give particular orders about
785: the fires and the dinner. But as to fires, I’ve had ’em in all the
786: rooms for the last week, and everything is well aired. I could wish
787: some of the furniture paid better for all the cleaning it’s had, but I
788: _think_ you’ll see the brasses have been done justice to. I _think_
789: when Mr. and Mrs. Gascoigne come, they’ll tell you nothing has been
790: neglected. They’ll be here at five, for certain.”
791: 
792: This satisfied Gwendolen, who was not prepared to have their arrival
793: treated with indifference; and after tripping a little way up the
794: matted stone staircase to take a survey there, she tripped down again,
795: and followed by all the girls looked into each of the rooms opening
796: from the hall—the dining-room all dark oak and worn red satin damask,
797: with a copy of snarling, worrying dogs from Snyders over the
798: side-board, and a Christ breaking bread over the mantel-piece; the
799: library with a general aspect and smell of old brown-leather; and
800: lastly, the drawing-room, which was entered through a small antechamber
801: crowded with venerable knick-knacks.
802: 
803: “Mamma, mamma, pray come here!” said Gwendolen, Mrs. Davilow having
804: followed slowly in talk with the housekeeper. “Here is an organ. I will
805: be Saint Cecilia: some one shall paint me as Saint Cecilia. Jocosa
806: (this was her name for Miss Merry), let down my hair. See, mamma?”
807: 
808: She had thrown off her hat and gloves, and seated herself before the
809: organ in an admirable pose, looking upward; while the submissive and
810: sad Jocosa took out the one comb which fastened the coil of hair, and
811: then shook out the mass till it fell in a smooth light-brown stream far
812: below its owner’s slim waist.
813: 
814: Mrs. Davilow smiled and said, “A charming picture, my dear!” not
815: indifferent to the display of her pet, even in the presence of a
816: housekeeper. Gwendolen rose and laughed with delight. All this seemed
817: quite to the purpose on entering a new house which was so excellent a
818: background.
819: 
820: “What a queer, quaint, picturesque room!” she went on, looking about
821: her. “I like these old embroidered chairs, and the garlands on the
822: wainscot, and the pictures that may be anything. That one with the
823: ribs—nothing but ribs and darkness—I should think that is Spanish,
824: mamma.”
825: 
826: “Oh, Gwendolen!” said the small Isabel, in a tone of astonishment,
827: while she held open a hinged panel of the wainscot at the other end of
828: the room.
829: 
830: Every one, Gwendolen first, went to look. The opened panel had
831: disclosed the picture of an upturned dead face, from which an obscure
832: figure seemed to be fleeing with outstretched arms. “How horrible!”
833: said Mrs. Davilow, with a look of mere disgust; but Gwendolen shuddered
834: silently, and Isabel, a plain and altogether inconvenient child with an
835: alarming memory, said,
836: 
837: “You will never stay in this room by yourself, Gwendolen.”
838: 
839: “How dare you open things which were meant to be shut up, you perverse
840: little creature?” said Gwendolen, in her angriest tone. Then snatching
841: the panel out of the hand of the culprit, she closed it hastily,
842: saying, “There is a lock—where is the key? Let the key be found, or
843: else let one be made, and let nobody open it again; or rather, let the
844: key be brought to me.”
845: 
846: At this command to everybody in general Gwendolen turned with a face
847: which was flushed in reaction from her chill shudder, and said, “Let us
848: go up to our own room, mamma.”
849: 
850: The housekeeper on searching found the key in the drawer of the cabinet
851: close by the panel, and presently handed it to Bugle, the lady’s-maid,
852: telling her significantly to give it to her Royal Highness.
853: 
854: “I don’t know what you mean, Mrs. Startin,” said Bugle, who had been
855: busy up-stairs during the scene in the drawing-room, and was rather
856: offended at this irony in a new servant.
857: 
858: “I mean the young lady that’s to command us all—and well worthy for
859: looks and figure,” replied Mrs. Startin in propitiation. “She’ll know
860: what key it is.”
861: 
862: “If you have laid out what we want, go and see to the others, Bugle,”
863: Gwendolen had said, when she and Mrs. Davilow entered their black and
864: yellow bedroom, where a pretty little white couch was prepared by the
865: side of the black and yellow catafalque known as the best bed. “I will
866: help mamma.”
867: 
868: But her first movement was to go to the tall mirror between the
869: windows, which reflected herself and the room completely, while her
870: mamma sat down and also looked at the reflection.
871: 
872: “That is a becoming glass, Gwendolen; or is it the black and gold color
873: that sets you off?” said Mrs. Davilow, as Gwendolen stood obliquely
874: with her three-quarter face turned toward the mirror, and her left hand
875: brushing back the stream of hair.
876: 
877: “I should make a tolerable St. Cecilia with some white roses on my
878: head,” said Gwendolen,—“only how about my nose, mamma? I think saint’s
879: noses never in the least turn up. I wish you had given me your
880: perfectly straight nose; it would have done for any sort of
881: character—a nose of all work. Mine is only a happy nose; it would not
882: do so well for tragedy.”
883: 
884: “Oh, my dear, any nose will do to be miserable with in this world,”
885: said Mrs. Davilow, with a deep, weary sigh, throwing her black bonnet
886: on the table, and resting her elbow near it.
887: 
888: “Now, mamma,” said Gwendolen, in a strongly remonstrant tone, turning
889: away from the glass with an air of vexation, “don’t begin to be dull
890: here. It spoils all my pleasure, and everything may be so happy now.
891: What have you to be gloomy about _now_?”
892: 
893: “Nothing, dear,” said Mrs. Davilow, seeming to rouse herself, and
894: beginning to take off her dress. “It is always enough for me to see you
895: happy.”
896: 
897: “But you should be happy yourself,” said Gwendolen, still
898: discontentedly, though going to help her mamma with caressing touches.
899: “Can nobody be happy after they are quite young? You have made me feel
900: sometimes as if nothing were of any use. With the girls so troublesome,
901: and Jocosa so dreadfully wooden and ugly, and everything make-shift
902: about us, and you looking so dull—what was the use of my being
903: anything? But now you _might_ be happy.”
904: 
905: “So I shall, dear,” said Mrs. Davilow, patting the cheek that was
906: bending near her.
907: 
908: “Yes, but really. Not with a sort of make-believe,” said Gwendolen,
909: with resolute perseverance. “See what a hand and arm!—much more
910: beautiful than mine. Any one can see you were altogether more
911: beautiful.”
912: 
913: “No, no, dear; I was always heavier. Never half so charming as you are.”
914: 
915: “Well, but what is the use of my being charming, if it is to end in my
916: being dull and not minding anything? Is that what marriage always comes
917: to?”
918: 
919: “No, child, certainly not. Marriage is the only happy state for a
920: woman, as I trust you will prove.”
921: 
922: “I will not put up with it if it is not a happy state. I am determined
923: to be happy—at least not to go on muddling away my life as other
924: people do, being and doing nothing remarkable. I have made up my mind
925: not to let other people interfere with me as they have done. Here is
926: some warm water ready for you, mamma,” Gwendolen ended, proceeding to
927: take off her own dress and then waiting to have her hair wound up by
928: her mamma.
929: 
930: There was silence for a minute or two, till Mrs. Davilow said, while
931: coiling the daughter’s hair, “I am sure I have never crossed you,
932: Gwendolen.”
933: 
934: “You often want me to do what I don’t like.”
935: 
936: “You mean, to give Alice lessons?”
937: 
938: “Yes. And I have done it because you asked me. But I don’t see why I
939: should, else. It bores me to death, she is so slow. She has no ear for
940: music, or language, or anything else. It would be much better for her
941: to be ignorant, mamma: it is her _rôle_, she would do it well.”
942: 
943: “That is a hard thing to say of your poor sister, Gwendolen, who is so
944: good to you, and waits on you hand and foot.”
945: 
946: “I don’t see why it is hard to call things by their right names, and
947: put them in their proper places. The hardship is for me to have to
948: waste my time on her. Now let me fasten up your hair, mamma.”
949: 
950: “We must make haste; your uncle and aunt will be here soon. For
951: heaven’s sake, don’t be scornful to _them_, my dear child! or to your
952: cousin Anna, whom you will always be going out with. Do promise me,
953: Gwendolen. You know, you can’t expect Anna to be equal to you.”
954: 
955: “I don’t want her to be equal,” said Gwendolen, with a toss of her head
956: and a smile, and the discussion ended there.
957: 
958: When Mr. and Mrs. Gascoigne and their daughter came, Gwendolen, far
959: from being scornful, behaved as prettily as possible to them. She was
960: introducing herself anew to relatives who had not seen her since the
961: comparatively unfinished age of sixteen, and she was anxious—no, not
962: anxious, but resolved that they should admire her.
963: 
964: Mrs. Gascoigne bore a family likeness to her sister. But she was darker
965: and slighter, her face was unworn by grief, her movements were less
966: languid, her expression more alert and critical as that of a rector’s
967: wife bound to exert a beneficent authority. Their closest resemblance
968: lay in a non-resistant disposition, inclined to imitation and
969: obedience; but this, owing to the difference in their circumstances,
970: had led them to very different issues. The younger sister had been
971: indiscreet, or at least unfortunate in her marriages; the elder
972: believed herself the most enviable of wives, and her pliancy had ended
973: in her sometimes taking shapes of surprising definiteness. Many of her
974: opinions, such as those on church government and the character of
975: Archbishop Laud, seemed too decided under every alteration to have been
976: arrived at otherwise than by a wifely receptiveness. And there was much
977: to encourage trust in her husband’s authority. He had some agreeable
978: virtues, some striking advantages, and the failings that were imputed
979: to him all leaned toward the side of success.
980: 
981: One of his advantages was a fine person, which perhaps was even more
982: impressive at fifty-seven than it had been earlier in life. There were
983: no distinctively clerical lines in the face, no tricks of starchiness
984: or of affected ease: in his Inverness cape he could not have been
985: identified except as a gentleman with handsome dark features, a nose
986: which began with an intention to be aquiline but suddenly became
987: straight, and iron-gray hair. Perhaps he owed this freedom from the
988: sort of professional make-up which penetrates skin, tones and gestures
989: and defies all drapery, to the fact that he had once been Captain
990: Gaskin, having taken orders and a diphthong but shortly before his
991: engagement to Miss Armyn. If any one had objected that his preparation
992: for the clerical function was inadequate, his friends might have asked
993: who made a better figure in it, who preached better or had more
994: authority in his parish? He had a native gift for administration, being
995: tolerant both of opinions and conduct, because he felt himself able to
996: overrule them, and was free from the irritations of conscious
997: feebleness. He smiled pleasantly at the foible of a taste which he did
998: not share—at floriculture or antiquarianism for example, which were
999: much in vogue among his fellow-clergyman in the diocese: for himself,
1000: he preferred following the history of a campaign, or divining from his
1001: knowledge of Nesselrode’s motives what would have been his conduct if
1002: our cabinet had taken a different course. Mr. Gascoigne’s tone of
1003: thinking after some long-quieted fluctuations had become ecclesiastical
1004: rather than theological; not the modern Anglican, but what he would
1005: have called sound English, free from nonsense; such as became a man who
1006: looked at a national religion by daylight, and saw it in its relation
1007: to other things. No clerical magistrate had greater weight at sessions,
1008: or less of mischievous impracticableness in relation to worldly
1009: affairs. Indeed, the worst imputation thrown out against him was
1010: worldliness: it could not be proved that he forsook the less fortunate,
1011: but it was not to be denied that the friendships he cultivated were of
1012: a kind likely to be useful to the father of six sons and two daughters;
1013: and bitter observers—for in Wessex, say ten years ago, there were
1014: persons whose bitterness may now seem incredible—remarked that the
1015: color of his opinions had changed in consistency with this principle of
1016: action. But cheerful, successful worldliness has a false air of being
1017: more selfish than the acrid, unsuccessful kind, whose secret history is
1018: summed up in the terrible words, “Sold, but not paid for.”
1019: 
1020: Gwendolen wondered that she had not better remembered how very fine a
1021: man her uncle was; but at the age of sixteen she was a less capable and
1022: more indifferent judge. At present it was a matter of extreme interest
1023: to her that she was to have the near countenance of a dignified male
1024: relative, and that the family life would cease to be entirely,
1025: insipidly feminine. She did not intend that her uncle should control
1026: her, but she saw at once that it would be altogether agreeable to her
1027: that he should be proud of introducing her as his niece. And there was
1028: every sign of his being likely to feel that pride. He certainly looked
1029: at her with admiration as he said,
1030: 
1031: “You have outgrown Anna, my dear,” putting his arm tenderly round his
1032: daughter, whose shy face was a tiny copy of his own, and drawing her
1033: forward. “She is not so old as you by a year, but her growing days are
1034: certainly over. I hope you will be excellent companions.”
1035: 
1036: He did give a comparing glance at his daughter, but if he saw her
1037: inferiority, he might also see that Anna’s timid appearance and
1038: miniature figure must appeal to a different taste from that which was
1039: attracted by Gwendolen, and that the girls could hardly be rivals.
1040: Gwendolen at least, was aware of this, and kissed her cousin with real
1041: cordiality as well as grace, saying, “A companion is just what I want.
1042: I am so glad we are come to live here. And mamma will be much happier
1043: now she is near you, aunt.”
1044: 
1045: The aunt trusted indeed that it would be so, and felt it a blessing
1046: that a suitable home had been vacant in their uncle’s parish. Then, of
1047: course, notice had to be taken of the four other girls, whom Gwendolen
1048: had always felt to be superfluous: all of a girlish average that made
1049: four units utterly unimportant, and yet from her earliest days an
1050: obtrusive influential fact in her life. She was conscious of having
1051: been much kinder to them than could have been expected. And it was
1052: evident to her that her uncle and aunt also felt it a pity there were
1053: so many girls:—what rational person could feel otherwise, except poor
1054: mamma, who never would see how Alice set up her shoulders and lifted
1055: her eyebrows till she had no forehead left, how Bertha and Fanny
1056: whispered and tittered together about everything, or how Isabel was
1057: always listening and staring and forgetting where she was, and treading
1058: on the toes of her suffering elders?
1059: 
1060: “You have brothers, Anna,” said Gwendolen, while the sisters were being
1061: noticed. “I think you are enviable there.”
1062: 
1063: “Yes,” said Anna, simply. “I am very fond of them; but of course their
1064: education is a great anxiety to papa. He used to say they made me a
1065: tomboy. I really was a great romp with Rex. I think you will like Rex.
1066: He will come home before Christmas.”
1067: 
1068: “I remember I used to think you rather wild and shy; but it is
1069: difficult now to imagine you a romp,” said Gwendolen, smiling.
1070: 
1071: “Of course, I am altered now; I am come out, and all that. But in
1072: reality I like to go blackberrying with Edwy and Lotta as well as ever.
1073: I am not very fond of going out; but I dare say I shall like it better
1074: now you will be often with me. I am not at all clever, and I never know
1075: what to say. It seems so useless to say what everybody knows, and I can
1076: think of nothing else, except what papa says.”
1077: 
1078: “I shall like going out with you very much,” said Gwendolen, well
1079: disposed toward this _naïve_ cousin. “Are you fond of riding?”
1080: 
1081: “Yes, but we have only one Shetland pony amongst us. Papa says he can’t
1082: afford more, besides the carriage-horses and his own nag; he has so
1083: many expenses.”
1084: 
1085: “I intend to have a horse and ride a great deal now,” said Gwendolen,
1086: in a tone of decision. “Is the society pleasant in this neighborhood?”
1087: 
1088: “Papa says it is, very. There are the clergymen all about, you know;
1089: and the Quallons, and the Arrowpoints, and Lord Brackenshaw, and Sir
1090: Hugo Mallinger’s place, where there is nobody—that’s very nice,
1091: because we make picnics there—and two or three families at Wanchester:
1092: oh, and old Mrs. Vulcany, at Nuttingwood, and—”
1093: 
1094: But Anna was relieved of this tax on her descriptive powers by the
1095: announcement of dinner, and Gwendolen’s question was soon indirectly
1096: answered by her uncle, who dwelt much on the advantages he had secured
1097: for them in getting a place like Offendene. Except the rent, it
1098: involved no more expense than an ordinary house at Wanchester would
1099: have done.
1100: 
1101: “And it is always worth while to make a little sacrifice for a good
1102: style of house,” said Mr. Gascoigne, in his easy, pleasantly confident
1103: tone, which made the world in general seem a very manageable place of
1104: residence: “especially where there is only a lady at the head. All the
1105: best people will call upon you; and you need give no expensive dinners.
1106: Of course, I have to spend a good deal in that way; it is a large item.
1107: But then I get my house for nothing. If I had to pay three hundred a
1108: year for my house I could not keep a table. My boys are too great a
1109: drain on me. You are better off than we are, in proportion; there is no
1110: great drain on you now, after your house and carriage.”
1111: 
1112: “I assure you, Fanny, now that the children are growing up, I am
1113: obliged to cut and contrive,” said Mrs. Gascoigne. “I am not a good
1114: manager by nature, but Henry has taught me. He is wonderful for making
1115: the best of everything; he allows himself no extras, and gets his
1116: curates for nothing. It is rather hard that he has not been made a
1117: prebendary or something, as others have been, considering the friends
1118: he has made and the need there is for men of moderate opinions in all
1119: respects. If the Church is to keep its position, ability and character
1120: ought to tell.”
1121: 
1122: “Oh, my dear Nancy, you forget the old story—thank Heaven, there are
1123: three hundred as good as I. And ultimately, we shall have no reason to
1124: complain, I am pretty sure. There could hardly be a more thorough
1125: friend than Lord Brackenshaw—your landlord, you know, Fanny. Lady
1126: Brackenshaw will call upon you. And I have spoken for Gwendolen to be a
1127: member of our Archery Club—the Brackenshaw Archery Club—the most
1128: select thing anywhere. That is, if she has no objection,” added Mr.
1129: Gascoigne, looking at Gwendolen with pleasant irony.
1130: 
1131: “I should like it of all things,” said Gwendolen. “There is nothing I
1132: enjoy more than taking aim—and hitting,” she ended, with a pretty nod
1133: and smile.
1134: 
1135: “Our Anna, poor child, is too short-sighted for archery. But I consider
1136: myself a first-rate shot, and you shall practice with me. I must make
1137: you an accomplished archer before our great meeting in July. In fact,
1138: as to neighborhood, you could hardly be better placed. There are the
1139: Arrowpoints—they are some of our best people. Miss Arrowpoint is a
1140: delightful girl—she has been presented at Court. They have a
1141: magnificent place—Quetcham Hall—worth seeing in point of art; and
1142: their parties, to which you are sure to be invited, are the best things
1143: of the sort we have. The archdeacon is intimate there, and they have
1144: always a good kind of people staying in the house. Mrs. Arrowpoint is
1145: peculiar, certainly; something of a caricature, in fact; but
1146: well-meaning. And Miss Arrowpoint is as nice as possible. It is not all
1147: young ladies who have mothers as handsome and graceful as yours and
1148: Anna’s.”
1149: 
1150: Mrs. Davilow smiled faintly at this little compliment, but the husband
1151: and wife looked affectionately at each other, and Gwendolen thought,
1152: “My uncle and aunt, at least, are happy: they are not dull and dismal.”
1153: Altogether, she felt satisfied with her prospects at Offendene, as a
1154: great improvement on anything she had known. Even the cheap curates,
1155: she incidentally learned, were almost always young men of family, and
1156: Mr. Middleton, the actual curate, was said to be quite an acquisition:
1157: it was only a pity he was so soon to leave.
1158: 
1159: But there was one point which she was so anxious to gain that she could
1160: not allow the evening to pass without taking her measures toward
1161: securing it. Her mamma, she knew, intended to submit entirely to her
1162: uncle’s judgment with regard to expenditure; and the submission was not
1163: merely prudential, for Mrs. Davilow, conscious that she had always been
1164: seen under a cloud as poor dear Fanny, who had made a sad blunder with
1165: her second marriage, felt a hearty satisfaction in being frankly and
1166: cordially identified with her sister’s family, and in having her
1167: affairs canvassed and managed with an authority which presupposed a
1168: genuine interest. Thus the question of a suitable saddle-horse, which
1169: had been sufficiently discussed with mamma, had to be referred to Mr.
1170: Gascoigne; and after Gwendolen had played on the piano, which had been
1171: provided from Wanchester, had sung to her hearers’ admiration, and had
1172: induced her uncle to join her in a duet—what more softening influence
1173: than this on any uncle who would have sung finely if his time had not
1174: been too much taken up by graver matters?—she seized the opportune
1175: moment for saying, “Mamma, you have not spoken to my uncle about my
1176: riding.”
1177: 
1178: “Gwendolen desires above all things to have a horse to ride—a pretty,
1179: light, lady’s horse,” said Mrs. Davilow, looking at Mr. Gascoigne. “Do
1180: you think we can manage it?”
1181: 
1182: Mr. Gascoigne projected his lower lip and lifted his handsome eyebrows
1183: sarcastically at Gwendolen, who had seated herself with much grace on
1184: the elbow of her mamma’s chair.
1185: 
1186: “We could lend her the pony sometimes,” said Mrs. Gascoigne, watching
1187: her husband’s face, and feeling quite ready to disapprove if he did.
1188: 
1189: “That might be inconveniencing others, aunt, and would be no pleasure
1190: to me. I cannot endure ponies,” said Gwendolen. “I would rather give up
1191: some other indulgence and have a horse.” (Was there ever a young lady
1192: or gentleman not ready to give up an unspecified indulgence for the
1193: sake of the favorite one specified?)
1194: 
1195: “She rides so well. She has had lessons, and the riding-master said she
1196: had so good a seat and hand she might be trusted with any mount,” said
1197: Mrs. Davilow, who, even if she had not wished her darling to have the
1198: horse, would not have dared to be lukewarm in trying to get it for her.
1199: 
1200: “There is the price of the horse—a good sixty with the best chance,
1201: and then his keep,” said Mr. Gascoigne, in a tone which, though
1202: demurring, betrayed the inward presence of something that favored the
1203: demand. “There are the carriage-horses—already a heavy item. And
1204: remember what you ladies cost in toilet now.”
1205: 
1206: “I really wear nothing but two black dresses,” said Mrs. Davilow,
1207: hastily. “And the younger girls, of course, require no toilet at
1208: present. Besides, Gwendolen will save me so much by giving her sisters
1209: lessons.” Here Mrs. Davilow’s delicate cheek showed a rapid blush. “If
1210: it were not for that, I must really have a more expensive governess,
1211: and masters besides.”
1212: 
1213: Gwendolen felt some anger with her mamma, but carefully concealed it.
1214: 
1215: “That is good—that is decidedly good,” said Mr. Gascoigne, heartily,
1216: looking at his wife. And Gwendolen, who, it must be owned, was a deep
1217: young lady, suddenly moved away to the other end of the long
1218: drawing-room, and busied herself with arranging pieces of music.
1219: 
1220: “The dear child has had no indulgences, no pleasures,” said Mrs.
1221: Davilow, in a pleading undertone. “I feel the expense is rather
1222: imprudent in this first year of our settling. But she really needs the
1223: exercise—she needs cheering. And if you were to see her on horseback,
1224: it is something splendid.”
1225: 
1226: “It is what we could not afford for Anna,” said Mrs. Gascoigne. “But
1227: she, dear child, would ride Lotta’s donkey and think it good enough.”
1228: (Anna was absorbed in a game with Isabel, who had hunted out an old
1229: back-gammon-board, and had begged to sit up an extra hour.)
1230: 
1231: “Certainly, a fine woman never looks better than on horseback,” said
1232: Mr. Gascoigne. “And Gwendolen has the figure for it. I don’t say the
1233: thing should not be considered.”
1234: 
1235: “We might try it for a time, at all events. It can be given up, if
1236: necessary,” said Mrs. Davilow.
1237: 
1238: “Well, I will consult Lord Brackenshaw’s head groom. He is my _fidus
1239: Achates_ in the horsey way.”
1240: 
1241: “Thanks,” said Mrs. Davilow, much relieved. “You are very kind.”
1242: 
1243: “That he always is,” said Mrs. Gascoigne. And later that night, when
1244: she and her husband were in private, she said,
1245: 
1246: “I thought you were almost too indulgent about the horse for Gwendolen.
1247: She ought not to claim so much more than your own daughter would think
1248: of. Especially before we see how Fanny manages on her income. And you
1249: really have enough to do without taking all this trouble on yourself.”
1250: 
1251: “My dear Nancy, one must look at things from every point of view. This
1252: girl is really worth some expense: you don’t often see her equal. She
1253: ought to make a first-rate marriage, and I should not be doing my duty
1254: if I spared my trouble in helping her forward. You know yourself she
1255: has been under a disadvantage with such a father-in-law, and a second
1256: family, keeping her always in the shade. I feel for the girl, And I
1257: should like your sister and her family now to have the benefit of your
1258: having married rather a better specimen of our kind than she did.”
1259: 
1260: “Rather better! I should think so. However, it is for me to be grateful
1261: that you will take so much on your shoulders for the sake of my sister
1262: and her children. I am sure I would not grudge anything to poor Fanny.
1263: But there is one thing I have been thinking of, though you have never
1264: mentioned it.”
1265: 
1266: “What is that?”
1267: 
1268: “The boys. I hope they will not be falling in love with Gwendolen.”
1269: 
1270: “Don’t presuppose anything of the kind, my dear, and there will be no
1271: danger. Rex will never be at home for long together, and Warham is
1272: going to India. It is the wiser plan to take it for granted that
1273: cousins will not fall in love. If you begin with precautions, the
1274: affair will come in spite of them. One must not undertake to act for
1275: Providence in these matters, which can no more be held under the hand
1276: than a brood of chickens. The boys will have nothing, and Gwendolen
1277: will have nothing. They can’t marry. At the worst there would only be a
1278: little crying, and you can’t save boys and girls from that.”
1279: 
1280: Mrs. Gascoigne’s mind was satisfied: if anything did happen, there was
1281: the comfort of feeling that her husband would know what was to be done,
1282: and would have the energy to do it.

1287: CHAPTER IV.
1288: 
1289:     “_Gorgibus._— * * * Je te dis que le mariage est une chose sainte
1290:     et sacrée: et que c’est faire en honnêtes gens, que de débuter par là.
1291: 
1292:     “_Madelon._—Mon Dieu! que si tout le monde vous ressemblait, un
1293:     roman serait bientôt fini! La belle chose que ce serait, si d’abord
1294:     Cyrus épousait Mandane, et qu’Aronce de plain-pied fût marié à Clélie!
1295:     * * * Laissez-nous faire à loisir le tissu de notre roman, et n’en
1296:     pressez pas tant la conclusion.”
1297:                                MOLIÈRE. _Les Précieuses Ridicules._
1298: 
1299: 
1300: It would be a little hard to blame the rector of Pennicote that in the
1301: course of looking at things from every point of view, he looked at
1302: Gwendolen as a girl likely to make a brilliant marriage. Why should he
1303: be expected to differ from his contemporaries in this matter, and wish
1304: his niece a worse end of her charming maidenhood than they would
1305: approve as the best possible? It is rather to be set down to his credit
1306: that his feelings on the subject were entirely good-natured. And in
1307: considering the relation of means to ends, it would have been mere
1308: folly to have been guided by the exceptional and idyllic—to have
1309: recommended that Gwendolen should wear a gown as shabby as Griselda’s
1310: in order that a marquis might fall in love with her, or to have
1311: insisted that since a fair maiden was to be sought, she should keep
1312: herself out of the way. Mr. Gascoigne’s calculations were of the kind
1313: called rational, and he did not even think of getting a too frisky
1314: horse in order that Gwendolen might be threatened with an accident and
1315: be rescued by a man of property. He wished his niece well, and he meant
1316: her to be seen to advantage in the best society of the neighborhood.
1317: 
1318: Her uncle’s intention fell in perfectly with Gwendolen’s own wishes.
1319: But let no one suppose that she also contemplated a brilliant marriage
1320: as the direct end of her witching the world with her grace on
1321: horseback, or with any other accomplishment. That she was to be married
1322: some time or other she would have felt obliged to admit; and that her
1323: marriage would not be of a middling kind, such as most girls were
1324: contented with, she felt quietly, unargumentatively sure. But her
1325: thoughts never dwelt on marriage as the fulfillment of her ambition;
1326: the dramas in which she imagined herself a heroine were not wrought up
1327: to that close. To be very much sued or hopelessly sighed for as a bride
1328: was indeed an indispensable and agreeable guarantee of womanly power;
1329: but to become a wife and wear all the domestic fetters of that
1330: condition, was on the whole a vexatious necessity. Her observation of
1331: matrimony had inclined her to think it rather a dreary state in which a
1332: woman could not do what she liked, had more children than were
1333: desirable, was consequently dull, and became irrevocably immersed in
1334: humdrum. Of course marriage was social promotion; she could not look
1335: forward to a single life; but promotions have sometimes to be taken
1336: with bitter herbs—a peerage will not quite do instead of leadership to
1337: the man who meant to lead; and this delicate-limbed sylph of twenty
1338: meant to lead. For such passions dwell in feminine breasts also. In
1339: Gwendolen’s, however, they dwelt among strictly feminine furniture, and
1340: had no disturbing reference to the advancement of learning or the
1341: balance of the constitution; her knowledge being such as with no sort
1342: of standing-room or length of lever could have been expected to move
1343: the world. She meant to do what was pleasant to herself in a striking
1344: manner; or rather, whatever she could do so as to strike others with
1345: admiration and get in that reflected way a more ardent sense of living,
1346: seemed pleasant to her fancy.
1347: 
1348: “Gwendolen will not rest without having the world at her feet,” said
1349: Miss Merry, the meek governess: hyperbolical words which have long come
1350: to carry the most moderate meanings; for who has not heard of private
1351: persons having the world at their feet in the shape of some half-dozen
1352: items of flattering regard generally known in a genteel suburb? And
1353: words could hardly be too wide or vague to indicate the prospect that
1354: made a hazy largeness about poor Gwendolen on the heights of her young
1355: self-exultation. Other people allowed themselves to be made slaves of,
1356: and to have their lives blown hither and thither like empty ships in
1357: which no will was present. It was not to be so with her; she would no
1358: longer be sacrificed to creatures worth less than herself, but would
1359: make the very best of the chances that life offered her, and conquer
1360: circumstances by her exceptional cleverness. Certainly, to be settled
1361: at Offendene, with the notice of Lady Brackenshaw, the archery club,
1362: and invitations to dine with the Arrowpoints, as the highest lights in
1363: her scenery, was not a position that seemed to offer remarkable
1364: chances; but Gwendolen’s confidence lay chiefly in herself. She felt
1365: well equipped for the mastery of life. With regard to much in her lot
1366: hitherto, she held herself rather hardly dealt with, but as to her
1367: “education,” she would have admitted that it had left her under no
1368: disadvantages. In the school-room her quick mind had taken readily that
1369: strong starch of unexplained rules and disconnected facts which saves
1370: ignorance from any painful sense of limpness; and what remained of all
1371: things knowable, she was conscious of being sufficiently acquainted
1372: with through novels, plays and poems. About her French and music, the
1373: two justifying accomplishments of a young lady, she felt no ground for
1374: uneasiness; and when to all these qualifications, negative and
1375: positive, we add the spontaneous sense of capability some happy persons
1376: are born with, so that any subject they turn their attention to
1377: impresses them with their own power of forming a correct judgment on
1378: it, who can wonder if Gwendolen felt ready to manage her own destiny?
1379: 
1380: There were many subjects in the world—perhaps the majority—in which
1381: she felt no interest, because they were stupid; for subjects are apt to
1382: appear stupid to the young as light seems dull to the old; but she
1383: would not have felt at all helpless in relation to them if they had
1384: turned up in conversation. It must be remembered that no one had
1385: disputed her power or her general superiority. As on the arrival at
1386: Offendene, so always, the first thought of those about her had been,
1387: what will Gwendolen think?—if the footman trod heavily in creaking
1388: boots, or if the laundress’s work was unsatisfactory, the maid said,
1389: “This will never do for Miss Harleth”; if the wood smoked in the
1390: bedroom fire-place, Mrs. Davilow, whose own weak eyes suffered much from
1391: this inconvenience, spoke apologetically of it to Gwendolen. If, when
1392: they were under the stress of traveling, she did not appear at the
1393: breakfast table till every one else had finished, the only question
1394: was, how Gwendolen’s coffee and toast should still be of the hottest
1395: and crispest; and when she appeared with her freshly-brushed
1396: light-brown hair streaming backward and awaiting her mamma’s hand to
1397: coil it up, her large brown eyes glancing bright as a wave-washed onyx
1398: from under their long lashes, it was always she herself who had to be
1399: tolerant—to beg that Alice who sat waiting on her would not stick up
1400: her shoulders in that frightful manner, and that Isabel, instead of
1401: pushing up to her and asking questions, would go away to Miss Merry.
1402: 
1403: Always she was the princess in exile, who in time of famine was to have
1404: her breakfast-roll made of the finest-bolted flour from the seven thin
1405: ears of wheat, and in a general decampment was to have her silver fork
1406: kept out of the baggage. How was this to be accounted for? The answer
1407: may seem to lie quite on the surface:—in her beauty, a certain
1408: unusualness about her, a decision of will which made itself felt in her
1409: graceful movements and clear unhesitating tones, so that if she came
1410: into the room on a rainy day when everybody else was flaccid and the
1411: use of things in general was not apparent to them, there seemed to be a
1412: sudden, sufficient reason for keeping up the forms of life; and even
1413: the waiters at hotels showed the more alacrity in doing away with
1414: crumbs and creases and dregs with struggling flies in them. This potent
1415: charm, added to the fact that she was the eldest daughter, toward whom
1416: her mamma had always been in an apologetic state of mind for the evils
1417: brought on her by a step-father, may seem so full a reason for
1418: Gwendolen’s domestic empire, that to look for any other would be to ask
1419: the reason of daylight when the sun is shining. But beware of arriving
1420: at conclusions without comparison. I remember having seen the same
1421: assiduous, apologetic attention awarded to persons who were not at all
1422: beautiful or unusual, whose firmness showed itself in no very graceful
1423: or euphonious way, and who were not eldest daughters with a tender,
1424: timid mother, compunctious at having subjected them to inconveniences.
1425: Some of them were a very common sort of men. And the only point of
1426: resemblance among them all was a strong determination to have what was
1427: pleasant, with a total fearlessness in making themselves disagreeable
1428: or dangerous when they did not get it. Who is so much cajoled and
1429: served with trembling by the weak females of a household as the
1430: unscrupulous male—capable, if he has not free way at home, of going
1431: and doing worse elsewhere? Hence I am forced to doubt whether even
1432: without her potent charm and peculiar filial position Gwendolen might
1433: not still have played the queen in exile, if only she had kept her
1434: inborn energy of egoistic desire, and her power of inspiring fear as to
1435: what she might say or do. However, she had the charm, and those who
1436: feared her were also fond of her; the fear and the fondness being
1437: perhaps both heightened by what may be called the iridescence of her
1438: character—the play of various, nay, contrary tendencies. For Macbeth’s
1439: rhetoric about the impossibility of being many opposite things in the
1440: same moment, referred to the clumsy necessities of action and not to
1441: the subtler possibilities of feeling. We cannot speak a loyal word and
1442: be meanly silent; we cannot kill and not kill in the same moment; but a
1443: moment is wide enough for the loyal and mean desire, for the outlash of
1444: a murderous thought and the sharp backward stroke of repentance.
1445: 
1446: 
1447: 
1448: 
1449: CHAPTER V.
1450: 
1451:                               “Her wit
1452:   Values itself so highly, that to her
1453:   All matter else seems weak.”
1454:            —_Much Ado About Nothing._
1455: 
1456: 
1457: Gwendolen’s reception in the neighborhood fulfilled her uncle’s
1458: expectations. From Brackenshaw Castle to the Firs at Wanchester, where
1459: Mr. Quallon the banker kept a generous house, she was welcomed with
1460: manifest admiration, and even those ladies who did not quite like her,
1461: felt a comfort in having a new, striking girl to invite; for hostesses
1462: who entertain much must make up their parties as ministers make up
1463: their cabinets, on grounds other than personal liking. Then, in order
1464: to have Gwendolen as a guest, it was not necessary to ask any one who
1465: was disagreeable, for Mrs. Davilow always made a quiet, picturesque
1466: figure as a chaperon, and Mr. Gascoigne was everywhere in request for
1467: his own sake.
1468: 
1469: Among the houses where Gwendolen was not quite liked, and yet invited,
1470: was Quetcham Hall. One of her first invitations was to a large
1471: dinner-party there, which made a sort of general introduction for her
1472: to the society of the neighborhood; for in a select party of thirty and
1473: of well-composed proportions as to age, few visitable families could be
1474: entirely left out. No youthful figure there was comparable to
1475: Gwendolen’s as she passed through the long suite of rooms adorned with
1476: light and flowers, and, visible at first as a slim figure floating
1477: along in white drapery, approached through one wide doorway after
1478: another into fuller illumination and definiteness. She had never had
1479: that sort of promenade before, and she felt exultingly that it befitted
1480: her: any one looking at her for the first time might have supposed that
1481: long galleries and lackeys had always been a matter of course in her
1482: life; while her cousin Anna, who was really more familiar with these
1483: things, felt almost as much embarrassed as a rabbit suddenly deposited
1484: in that well-lit-space.
1485: 
1486: “Who is that with Gascoigne?” said the archdeacon, neglecting a
1487: discussion of military manoeuvres on which, as a clergyman, he was
1488: naturally appealed to. And his son, on the other side of the room—a
1489: hopeful young scholar, who had already suggested some “not less elegant
1490: than ingenious,” emendations of Greek texts—said nearly at the same
1491: time, “By George! who is that girl with the awfully well-set head and
1492: jolly figure?”
1493: 
1494: But to a mind of general benevolence, wishing everybody to look well,
1495: it was rather exasperating to see how Gwendolen eclipsed others: how
1496: even the handsome Miss Lawe, explained to be the daughter of Lady Lawe,
1497: looked suddenly broad, heavy and inanimate; and how Miss Arrowpoint,
1498: unfortunately also dressed in white, immediately resembled a
1499: _carte-de-visite_ in which one would fancy the skirt alone to have been
1500: charged for. Since Miss Arrowpoint was generally liked for the amiable
1501: unpretending way in which she wore her fortunes, and made a softening
1502: screen for the oddities of her mother, there seemed to be some
1503: unfitness in Gwendolen’s looking so much more like a person of social
1504: importance.
1505: 
1506: “She is not really so handsome if you come to examine her features,”
1507: said Mrs. Arrowpoint, later in the evening, confidentially to Mrs.
1508: Vulcany. “It is a certain style she has, which produces a great effect
1509: at first, but afterward she is less agreeable.”
1510: 
1511: In fact, Gwendolen, not intending it, but intending the contrary, had
1512: offended her hostess, who, though not a splenetic or vindictive woman,
1513: had her susceptibilities. Several conditions had met in the Lady of
1514: Quetcham which to the reasoners in that neighborhood seemed to have an
1515: essential connection with each other. It was occasionally recalled that
1516: she had been the heiress of a fortune gained by some moist or dry
1517: business in the city, in order fully to account for her having a squat
1518: figure, a harsh parrot-like voice, and a systematically high
1519: head-dress; and since these points made her externally rather
1520: ridiculous, it appeared to many only natural that she should have what
1521: are called literary tendencies. A little comparison would have shown
1522: that all these points are to be found apart; daughters of aldermen
1523: being often well-grown and well-featured, pretty women having sometimes
1524: harsh or husky voices, and the production of feeble literature being
1525: found compatible with the most diverse forms of _physique_, masculine
1526: as well as feminine.
1527: 
1528: Gwendolen, who had a keen sense of absurdity in others, but was kindly
1529: disposed toward any one who could make life agreeable to her, meant to
1530: win Mrs. Arrowpoint by giving her an interest and attention beyond what
1531: others were probably inclined to show. But self-confidence is apt to
1532: address itself to an imaginary dullness in others; as people who are
1533: well off speak in a cajoling tone to the poor, and those who are in the
1534: prime of life raise their voice and talk artificially to seniors,
1535: hastily conceiving them to be deaf and rather imbecile. Gwendolen, with
1536: all her cleverness and purpose to be agreeable, could not escape that
1537: form of stupidity: it followed in her mind, unreflectingly, that
1538: because Mrs. Arrowpoint was ridiculous she was also likely to be
1539: wanting in penetration, and she went through her little scenes without
1540: suspicion that the various shades of her behavior were all noted.
1541: 
1542: “You are fond of books as well as of music, riding, and archery, I
1543: hear,” Mrs. Arrowpoint said, going to her for a _tête-à-tête_ in the
1544: drawing-room after dinner. “Catherine will be very glad to have so
1545: sympathetic a neighbor.” This little speech might have seemed the most
1546: graceful politeness, spoken in a low, melodious tone; but with a twang,
1547: fatally loud, it gave Gwendolen a sense of exercising patronage when
1548: she answered, gracefully:
1549: 
1550: “It is I who am fortunate. Miss Arrowpoint will teach me what good
1551: music is. I shall be entirely a learner. I hear that she is a thorough
1552: musician.”
1553: 
1554: “Catherine has certainly had every advantage. We have a first-rate
1555: musician in the house now—Herr Klesmer; perhaps you know all his
1556: compositions. You must allow me to introduce him to you. You sing, I
1557: believe. Catherine plays three instruments, but she does not sing. I
1558: hope you will let us hear you. I understand you are an accomplished
1559: singer.”
1560: 
1561: “Oh, no!—‘die Kraft ist schwach, allein die Lust ist gross,’ as
1562: Mephistopheles says.”
1563: 
1564: “Ah, you are a student of Goethe. Young ladies are so advanced now. I
1565: suppose you have read everything.”
1566: 
1567: “No, really. I shall be so glad if you will tell me what to read. I
1568: have been looking into all the books in the library at Offendene, but
1569: there is nothing readable. The leaves all stick together and smell
1570: musty. I wish I could write books to amuse myself, as you can! How
1571: delightful it must be to write books after one’s own taste instead of
1572: reading other people’s! Home-made books must be so nice.”
1573: 
1574: For an instant Mrs. Arrowpoint’s glance was a little sharper, but the
1575: perilous resemblance to satire in the last sentence took the hue of
1576: girlish simplicity when Gwendolen added,
1577: 
1578: “I would give anything to write a book!”
1579: 
1580: “And why should you not?” said Mrs. Arrowpoint, encouragingly. “You
1581: have but to begin as I did. Pen, ink, and paper are at everybody’s
1582: command. But I will send you all I have written with pleasure.”
1583: 
1584: “Thanks. I shall be so glad to read your writings. Being acquainted
1585: with authors must give a peculiar understanding of their books: one
1586: would be able to tell then which parts were funny and which serious. I
1587: am sure I often laugh in the wrong place.” Here Gwendolen herself
1588: became aware of danger, and added quickly, “In Shakespeare, you know,
1589: and other great writers that we can never see. But I always want to
1590: know more than there is in the books.”
1591: 
1592: “If you are interested in any of my subjects I can lend you many extra
1593: sheets in manuscript,” said Mrs. Arrowpoint—while Gwendolen felt
1594: herself painfully in the position of the young lady who professed to
1595: like potted sprats.
1596: 
1597: “These are things I dare say I shall publish eventually: several
1598: friends have urged me to do so, and one doesn’t like to be obstinate.
1599: My Tasso, for example—I could have made it twice the size.”
1600: 
1601: “I dote on Tasso,” said Gwendolen.
1602: 
1603: “Well, you shall have all my papers, if you like. So many, you know,
1604: have written about Tasso; but they are all wrong. As to the particular
1605: nature of his madness, and his feelings for Leonora, and the real cause
1606: of his imprisonment, and the character of Leonora, who, in my opinion,
1607: was a cold-hearted woman, else she would have married him in spite of
1608: her brother—they are all wrong. I differ from everybody.”
1609: 
1610: “How very interesting!” said Gwendolen. “I like to differ from
1611: everybody. I think it is so stupid to agree. That is the worst of
1612: writing your opinions; you make people agree with you.” This speech
1613: renewed a slight suspicion in Mrs. Arrowpoint, and again her glance
1614: became for a moment examining. But Gwendolen looked very innocent, and
1615: continued with a docile air:
1616: 
1617: “I know nothing of Tasso except the _Gerusalemme Liberata_, which we
1618: read and learned by heart at school.”
1619: 
1620: “Ah, his life is more interesting than his poetry, I have constructed
1621: the early part of his life as a sort of romance. When one thinks of his
1622: father Bernardo, and so on, there is much that must be true.”
1623: 
1624: “Imagination is often truer than fact,” said Gwendolen, decisively,
1625: though she could no more have explained these glib words than if they
1626: had been Coptic or Etruscan. “I shall be so glad to learn all about
1627: Tasso—and his madness especially. I suppose poets are always a little
1628: mad.”
1629: 
1630: “To be sure—‘the poet’s eye in a fine frenzy rolling’; and somebody
1631: says of Marlowe,
1632: 
1633:   ‘For that fine madness still he did maintain,
1634:   Which always should possess the poet’s brain.’”
1635: 
1636: “But it was not always found out, was it?” said Gwendolen innocently.
1637: “I suppose some of them rolled their eyes in private. Mad people are
1638: often very cunning.”
1639: 
1640: Again a shade flitted over Mrs. Arrowpoint’s face; but the entrance of
1641: the gentlemen prevented any immediate mischief between her and this too
1642: quick young lady, who had over-acted her _naïveté_.
1643: 
1644: “Ah, here comes Herr Klesmer,” said Mrs. Arrowpoint, rising; and
1645: presently bringing him to Gwendolen, she left them to a dialogue which
1646: was agreeable on both sides, Herr Klesmer being a felicitous
1647: combination of the German, the Sclave and the Semite, with grand
1648: features, brown hair floating in artistic fashion, and brown eyes in
1649: spectacles. His English had little foreignness except its fluency; and
1650: his alarming cleverness was made less formidable just then by a certain
1651: softening air of silliness which will sometimes befall even Genius in
1652: the desire of being agreeable to Beauty.
1653: 
1654: Music was soon begun. Miss Arrowpoint and Herr Klesmer played a
1655: four-handed piece on two pianos, which convinced the company in general
1656: that it was long, and Gwendolen in particular that the neutral,
1657: placid-faced Miss Arrowpoint had a mastery of the instrument which put
1658: her own execution out of question—though she was not discouraged as to
1659: her often-praised touch and style. After this every one became anxious
1660: to hear Gwendolen sing; especially Mr. Arrowpoint; as was natural in a
1661: host and a perfect gentleman, of whom no one had anything to say but
1662: that he married Miss Cuttler and imported the best cigars; and he led
1663: her to the piano with easy politeness. Herr Klesmer closed the
1664: instrument in readiness for her, and smiled with pleasure at her
1665: approach; then placed himself at a distance of a few feet so that he
1666: could see her as she sang.
1667: 
1668: Gwendolen was not nervous; what she undertook to do she did without
1669: trembling, and singing was an enjoyment to her. Her voice was a
1670: moderately powerful soprano (some one had told her it was like Jenny
1671: Lind’s), her ear good, and she was able to keep in tune, so that her
1672: singing gave pleasure to ordinary hearers, and she had been used to
1673: unmingled applause. She had the rare advantage of looking almost
1674: prettier when she was singing than at other times, and that Herr
1675: Klesmer was in front of her seemed not disagreeable. Her song,
1676: determined on beforehand, was a favorite aria of Belini’s, in which she
1677: felt quite sure of herself.
1678: 
1679: “Charming!” said Mr. Arrowpoint, who had remained near, and the word
1680: was echoed around without more insincerity than we recognize in a
1681: brotherly way as human. But Herr Klesmer stood like a statue—if a
1682: statue can be imagined in spectacles; at least, he was as mute as a
1683: statue. Gwendolen was pressed to keep her seat and double the general
1684: pleasure, and she did not wish to refuse; but before resolving to do
1685: so, she moved a little toward Herr Klesmer, saying with a look of
1686: smiling appeal, “It would be too cruel to a great musician. You cannot
1687: like to hear poor amateur singing.”
1688: 
1689: “No, truly; but that makes nothing,” said Herr Klesmer, suddenly
1690: speaking in an odious German fashion with staccato endings, quite
1691: unobservable in him before, and apparently depending on a change of
1692: mood, as Irishmen resume their strongest brogue when they are fervid or
1693: quarrelsome. “That makes nothing. It is always acceptable to see you
1694: sing.”
1695: 
1696: Was there ever so unexpected an assertion of superiority—at least
1697: before the late Teutonic conquest? Gwendolen colored deeply, but, with
1698: her usual presence of mind, did not show an ungraceful resentment by
1699: moving away immediately; and Miss Arrowpoint, who had been near enough
1700: to overhear (and also to observe that Herr Klesmer’s mode of looking at
1701: Gwendolen was more conspicuously admiring than was quite consistent
1702: with good taste), now with the utmost tact and kindness came close to
1703: her and said,
1704: 
1705: “Imagine what I have to go through with this professor! He can hardly
1706: tolerate anything we English do in music. We can only put up with his
1707: severity, and make use of it to find out the worst that can be said of
1708: us. It is a little comfort to know that; and one can bear it when every
1709: one else is admiring.”
1710: 
1711: “I should be very much obliged to him for telling me the worst,” said
1712: Gwendolen, recovering herself. “I dare say I have been extremely ill
1713: taught, in addition to having no talent—only liking for music.” This
1714: was very well expressed considering that it had never entered her mind
1715: before.
1716: 
1717: “Yes, it is true: you have not been well taught,” said Herr Klesmer,
1718: quietly. Woman was dear to him, but music was dearer. “Still, you are
1719: not quite without gifts. You sing in tune, and you have a pretty fair
1720: organ. But you produce your notes badly; and that music which you sing
1721: is beneath you. It is a form of melody which expresses a puerile state
1722: of culture—a dawdling, canting, see-saw kind of stuff—the passion and
1723: thought of people without any breadth of horizon. There is a sort of
1724: self-satisfied folly about every phrase of such melody; no cries of
1725: deep, mysterious passion—no conflict—no sense of the universal. It
1726: makes men small as they listen to it. Sing now something larger. And I
1727: shall see.”
1728: 
1729: “Oh, not now—by-and-by,” said Gwendolen, with a sinking of heart at
1730: the sudden width of horizon opened round her small musical performance.
1731: For a lady desiring to lead, this first encounter in her campaign was
1732: startling. But she was bent on not behaving foolishly, and Miss
1733: Arrowpoint helped her by saying, “Yes, by-and-by. I always require half
1734: an hour to get up my courage after being criticised by Herr Klesmer. We
1735: will ask him to play to us now: he is bound to show us what is good
1736: music.”
1737: 
1738: To be quite safe on this point Herr Klesmer played a composition of his
1739: own, a fantasia called _Freudvoll, Leidvoll, Gedankenvoll_—an
1740: extensive commentary on some melodic ideas not too grossly evident; and
1741: he certainly fetched as much variety and depth of passion out of the
1742: piano as that moderately responsive instrument lends itself to, having
1743: an imperious magic in his fingers that seem to send a nerve-thrill
1744: through ivory key and wooden hammer, and compel the strings to make a
1745: quivering lingering speech for him. Gwendolen, in spite of her wounded
1746: egoism, had fullness of nature enough to feel the power of this
1747: playing, and it gradually turned her inward sob of mortification into
1748: an excitement which lifted her for the moment into a desperate
1749: indifference about her own doings, or at least a determination to get a
1750: superiority over them by laughing at them as if they belonged to
1751: somebody else. Her eyes had become brighter, her cheeks slightly
1752: flushed, and her tongue ready for any mischievous remarks.
1753: 
1754: “I wish you would sing to us again, Miss Harleth,” said young Clintock,
1755: the archdeacon’s classical son, who had been so fortunate as to take
1756: her to dinner, and came up to renew conversation as soon as Herr
1757: Klesmer’s performance was ended, “That is the style of music for me. I
1758: never can make anything of this tip-top playing. It is like a jar of
1759: leeches, where you can never tell either beginnings or endings. I could
1760: listen to your singing all day.”
1761: 
1762: “Yes, we should be glad of something popular now—another song from you
1763: would be a relaxation,” said Mrs. Arrowpoint, who had also come near
1764: with polite intentions.
1765: 
1766: “That must be because you are in a puerile state of culture, and have
1767: no breadth of horizon. I have just learned that. I have been taught how
1768: bad my taste is, and am feeling growing pains. They are never
1769: pleasant,” said Gwendolen, not taking any notice of Mrs. Arrowpoint,
1770: and looking up with a bright smile at young Clintock.
1771: 
1772: Mrs. Arrowpoint was not insensible to this rudeness, but merely said,
1773: “Well, we will not press anything disagreeably,” and as there was a
1774: perceptible outburst of imprisoned conversation just then, and a
1775: movement of guests seeking each other, she remained seated where she
1776: was, and looked around her with the relief of a hostess at finding she
1777: is not needed.
1778: 
1779: “I am glad you like this neighborhood,” said young Clintock,
1780: well-pleased with his station in front of Gwendolen.
1781: 
1782: “Exceedingly. There seems to be a little of everything and not much of
1783: anything.”
1784: 
1785: “That is rather equivocal praise.”
1786: 
1787: “Not with me. I like a little of everything; a little absurdity, for
1788: example, is very amusing. I am thankful for a few queer people; but
1789: much of them is a bore.”
1790: 
1791: (Mrs. Arrowpoint, who was hearing this dialogue, perceived quite a new
1792: tone in Gwendolen’s speech, and felt a revival of doubt as to her
1793: interest in Tasso’s madness.)
1794: 
1795: “I think there should be more croquet, for one thing,” said young Clintock;
1796: “I am usually away, but if I were more here I should go in for a
1797: croquet club. You are one of the archers, I think. But depend upon it
1798: croquet is the game of the future. It wants writing up, though. One of
1799: our best men has written a poem on it, in four cantos;—as good as
1800: Pope. I want him to publish it—You never read anything better.”
1801: 
1802: “I shall study croquet to-morrow. I shall take to it instead of
1803: singing.”
1804: 
1805: “No, no, not that; but do take to croquet. I will send you Jenning’s
1806: poem if you like. I have a manuscript copy.”
1807: 
1808: “Is he a great friend of yours?”
1809: 
1810: “Well, rather.”
1811: 
1812: “Oh, if he is only rather, I think I will decline. Or, if you send it
1813: to me, will you promise not to catechise me upon it and ask me which
1814: part I like best? Because it is not so easy to know a poem without
1815: reading it as to know a sermon without listening.”
1816: 
1817: “Decidedly,” Mrs. Arrowpoint thought, “this girl is double and
1818: satirical. I shall be on my guard against her.”
1819: 
1820: But Gwendolen, nevertheless, continued to receive polite attentions
1821: from the family at Quetcham, not merely because invitations have larger
1822: grounds than those of personal liking, but because the trying little
1823: scene at the piano had awakened a kindly solicitude toward her in the
1824: gentle mind of Miss Arrowpoint, who managed all the invitations and
1825: visits, her mother being otherwise occupied.
1826: 
1827: 
1828: 
1829: 
1830: CHAPTER VI.
1831: 
1832:     “Croyez-vous m’avoir humiliée pour m’avoir appris que la terre tourne
1833:     autour du soleil? Je vous jure que je ne m’en estime pas moins.”
1834:                                 —FONTENELLE: _Pluralité des Mondes_.
1835: 
1836: 
1837: That lofty criticism had caused Gwendolen a new sort of pain. She would
1838: not have chosen to confess how unfortunate she thought herself in not
1839: having had Miss Arrowpoint’s musical advantages, so as to be able to
1840: question Herr Klesmer’s taste with the confidence of thorough
1841: knowledge; still less, to admit even to herself that Miss Arrowpoint
1842: each time they met raised an unwonted feeling of jealousy in her: not
1843: in the least because she was an heiress, but because it was really
1844: provoking that a girl whose appearance you could not characterize
1845: except by saying that her figure was slight and of middle stature, her
1846: features small, her eyes tolerable, and her complexion sallow, had
1847: nevertheless a certain mental superiority which could not be explained
1848: away—an exasperating thoroughness in her musical accomplishment, a
1849: fastidious discrimination in her general tastes, which made it
1850: impossible to force her admiration and kept you in awe of her standard.
1851: This insignificant-looking young lady of four-and-twenty, whom any
1852: one’s eyes would have passed over negligently if she had not been Miss
1853: Arrowpoint, might be suspected of a secret opinion that Miss Harleth’s
1854: acquirements were rather of a common order, and such an opinion was not
1855: made agreeable to think of by being always veiled under a perfect
1856: kindness of manner.
1857: 
1858: But Gwendolen did not like to dwell on facts which threw an unfavorable
1859: light on itself. The musical Magus who had so suddenly widened her
1860: horizon was not always on the scene; and his being constantly backward
1861: and forward between London and Quetcham soon began to be thought of as
1862: offering opportunities for converting him to a more admiring state of
1863: mind. Meanwhile, in the manifest pleasure her singing gave at
1864: Brackenshaw Castle, the Firs, and elsewhere, she recovered her
1865: equanimity, being disposed to think approval more trustworthy than
1866: objection, and not being one of the exceptional persons who have a
1867: parching thirst for a perfection undemanded by their neighbors. Perhaps
1868: it would have been rash to say then that she was at all exceptional
1869: inwardly, or that the unusual in her was more than her rare grace of
1870: movement and bearing, and a certain daring which gave piquancy to a
1871: very common egoistic ambition, such as exists under many clumsy
1872: exteriors and is taken no notice of. For I suppose that the set of the
1873: head does not really determine the hunger of the inner self for
1874: supremacy: it only makes a difference sometimes as to the way in which
1875: the supremacy is held attainable, and a little also to the degree in
1876: which it can be attained; especially when the hungry one is a girl,
1877: whose passion for doing what is remarkable has an ideal limit in
1878: consistency with the highest breeding and perfect freedom from the
1879: sordid need of income. Gwendolen was as inwardly rebellious against the
1880: restraints of family conditions, and as ready to look through
1881: obligations into her own fundamental want of feeling for them, as if
1882: she had been sustained by the boldest speculations; but she really had
1883: no such speculations, and would at once have marked herself off from
1884: any sort of theoretical or practically reforming women by satirizing
1885: them. She rejoiced to feel herself exceptional; but her horizon was
1886: that of the genteel romance where the heroine’s soul poured out in her
1887: journal is full of vague power, originality, and general rebellion,
1888: while her life moves strictly in the sphere of fashion; and if she
1889: wanders into a swamp, the pathos lies partly, so to speak, in her
1890: having on her satin shoes. Here is a restraint which nature and society
1891: have provided on the pursuit of striking adventure; so that a soul
1892: burning with a sense of what the universe is not, and ready to take all
1893: existence as fuel, is nevertheless held captive by the ordinary
1894: wirework of social forms and does nothing particular.
1895: 
1896: This commonplace result was what Gwendolen found herself threatened
1897: with even in the novelty of the first winter at Offendene. What she was
1898: clear upon was, that she did not wish to lead the same sort of life as
1899: ordinary young ladies did; but what she was not clear upon was, how she
1900: should set about leading any other, and what were the particular acts
1901: which she would assert her freedom by doing. Offendene remained a good
1902: background, if anything would happen there; but on the whole the
1903: neighborhood was in fault.
1904: 
1905: Beyond the effect of her beauty on a first presentation, there was not
1906: much excitement to be got out of her earliest invitations, and she came
1907: home after little sallies of satire and knowingness, such as had
1908: offended Mrs. Arrowpoint, to fill the intervening days with the most
1909: girlish devices. The strongest assertion she was able to make of her
1910: individual claims was to leave out Alice’s lessons (on the principle
1911: that Alice was more likely to excel in ignorance), and to employ her
1912: with Miss Merry, and the maid who was understood to wait on all the
1913: ladies, in helping to arrange various dramatic costumes which Gwendolen
1914: pleased herself with having in readiness for some future occasions of
1915: acting in charades or theatrical pieces, occasions which she meant to
1916: bring about by force of will or contrivance. She had never acted—only
1917: made a figure in _tableaux vivans_ at school; but she felt assured that
1918: she could act well, and having been once or twice to the Théâtre
1919: Français, and also heard her mamma speak of Rachel, her waking dreams
1920: and cogitations as to how she would manage her destiny sometimes turned
1921: on the question whether she would become an actress like Rachel, since
1922: she was more beautiful than that thin Jewess. Meanwhile the wet days
1923: before Christmas were passed pleasantly in the preparation of costumes,
1924: Greek, Oriental, and Composite, in which Gwendolen attitudinized and
1925: speechified before a domestic audience, including even the housekeeper,
1926: who was once pressed into it that she might swell the notes of
1927: applause; but having shown herself unworthy by observing that Miss
1928: Harleth looked far more like a queen in her own dress than in that
1929: baggy thing with her arms all bare, she was not invited a second time.
1930: 
1931: “Do I look as well as Rachel, mamma?” said Gwendolen, one day when she
1932: had been showing herself in her Greek dress to Anna, and going through
1933: scraps of scenes with much tragic intention.
1934: 
1935: “You have better arms than Rachel,” said Mrs. Davilow, “your arms would
1936: do for anything, Gwen. But your voice is not so tragic as hers; it is
1937: not so deep.”
1938: 
1939: “I can make it deeper, if I like,” said Gwendolen, provisionally; then
1940: she added, with decision, “I think a higher voice is more tragic: it is
1941: more feminine; and the more feminine a woman is, the more tragic it
1942: seems when she does desperate actions.”
1943: 
1944: “There may be something in that,” said Mrs. Davilow, languidly. “But I
1945: don’t know what good there is in making one’s blood creep. And if there
1946: is anything horrible to be done, I should like it to be left to the
1947: men.”
1948: 
1949: “Oh, mamma, you are so dreadfully prosaic! As if all the great poetic
1950: criminals were not women! I think the men are poor cautious creatures.”
1951: 
1952: “Well, dear, and you—who are afraid to be alone in the night—I don’t
1953: think you would be very bold in crime, thank God.”
1954: 
1955: “I am not talking about reality, mamma,” said Gwendolen, impatiently.
1956: Then her mamma being called out of the room, she turned quickly to her
1957: cousin, as if taking an opportunity, and said, “Anna, do ask my uncle
1958: to let us get up some charades at the rectory. Mr. Middleton and Warham
1959: could act with us—just for practice. Mamma says it will not do to have
1960: Mr. Middleton consulting and rehearsing here. He is a stick, but we
1961: could give him suitable parts. Do ask, or else I will.”
1962: 
1963: “Oh, not till Rex comes. He is so clever, and such a dear old thing,
1964: and he will act Napoleon looking over the sea. He looks just like
1965: Napoleon. Rex can do anything.”
1966: 
1967: “I don’t in the least believe in your Rex, Anna,” said Gwendolen,
1968: laughing at her. “He will turn out to be like those wretched blue and
1969: yellow water-colors of his which you hang up in your bedroom and
1970: worship.”
1971: 
1972: “Very well, you will see,” said Anna. “It is not that I know what is
1973: clever, but he has got a scholarship already, and papa says he will get
1974: a fellowship, and nobody is better at games. He is cleverer than Mr.
1975: Middleton, and everybody but you call Mr. Middleton clever.”
1976: 
1977: “So he may be in a dark-lantern sort of way. But he _is_ a stick. If he
1978: had to say, ‘Perdition catch my soul, but I do love her,’ he would say
1979: it in just the same tone as, ‘Here endeth the second lesson.’”
1980: 
1981: “Oh, Gwendolen!” said Anna, shocked at these promiscuous allusions.
1982: “And it is very unkind of you to speak so of him, for he admires you
1983: very much. I heard Warham say one day to mamma, ‘Middleton is regularly
1984: spooney upon Gwendolen.’ She was very angry with him; but I know what
1985: it means. It is what they say at college for being in love.”
1986: 
1987: “How can I help it?” said Gwendolen, rather contemptuously. “Perdition
1988: catch my soul if I love _him_.”
1989: 
1990: “No, of course; papa, I think, would not wish it. And he is to go away
1991: soon. But it makes me sorry when you ridicule him.”
1992: 
1993: “What shall you do to me when I ridicule Rex?” said Gwendolen, wickedly.
1994: 
1995: “Now, Gwendolen, dear, you _will not_?” said Anna, her eyes filling
1996: with tears. “I could not bear it. But there really is nothing in him to
1997: ridicule. Only you may find out things. For no one ever thought of
1998: laughing at Mr. Middleton before you. Every one said he was
1999: nice-looking, and his manners perfect. I am sure I have always been
2000: frightened at him because of his learning and his square-cut coat, and
2001: his being a nephew of the bishop’s, and all that. But you will not
2002: ridicule Rex—promise me.” Anna ended with a beseeching look which
2003: touched Gwendolen.
2004: 
2005: “You are a dear little coz,” she said, just touching the tip of Anna’s
2006: chin with her thumb and forefinger. “I don’t ever want to do anything
2007: that will vex you. Especially if Rex is to make everything come
2008: off—charades and everything.”
2009: 
2010: And when at last Rex was there, the animation he brought into the life
2011: of Offendene and the rectory, and his ready partnership in Gwendolen’s
2012: plans, left her no inclination for any ridicule that was not of an open
2013: and flattering kind, such as he himself enjoyed. He was a fine
2014: open-hearted youth, with a handsome face strongly resembling his
2015: father’s and Anna’s, but softer in expression than the one, and larger
2016: in scale than the other: a bright, healthy, loving nature, enjoying
2017: ordinary innocent things so much that vice had no temptation for him,
2018: and what he knew of it lay too entirely in the outer courts and
2019: little-visited chambers of his mind for him to think of it with great
2020: repulsion. Vicious habits were with him “what some fellows
2021: did”—“stupid stuff” which he liked to keep aloof from. He returned
2022: Anna’s affection as fully as could be expected of a brother whose
2023: pleasures apart from her were more than the sum total of hers; and he
2024: had never known a stronger love.
2025: 
2026: The cousins were continually together at the one house or the
2027: other—chiefly at Offendene, where there was more freedom, or rather
2028: where there was a more complete sway for Gwendolen; and whatever she
2029: wished became a ruling purpose for Rex. The charades came off according
2030: to her plans; and also some other little scenes not contemplated by her
2031: in which her acting was more impromptu. It was at Offendene that the
2032: charades and _tableaux_ were rehearsed and presented, Mrs. Davilow
2033: seeing no objection even to Mr. Middleton’s being invited to share in
2034: them, now that Rex too was there—especially as his services were
2035: indispensable: Warham, who was studying for India with a Wanchester
2036: “coach,” having no time to spare, and being generally dismal under a
2037: cram of everything except the answers needed at the forthcoming
2038: examination, which might disclose the welfare of our Indian Empire to
2039: be somehow connected with a quotable knowledge of Browne’s Pastorals.
2040: 
2041: Mr. Middleton was persuaded to play various grave parts, Gwendolen
2042: having flattered him on his enviable immobility of countenance; and at
2043: first a little pained and jealous at her comradeship with Rex, he
2044: presently drew encouragement from the thought that this sort of
2045: cousinly familiarity excluded any serious passion. Indeed, he
2046: occasionally felt that her more formal treatment of himself was such a
2047: sign of favor as to warrant his making advances before he left
2048: Pennicote, though he had intended to keep his feelings in reserve until
2049: his position should be more assured. Miss Gwendolen, quite aware that
2050: she was adored by this unexceptionable young clergyman with pale
2051: whiskers and square-cut collar, felt nothing more on the subject than
2052: that she had no objection to being adored: she turned her eyes on him
2053: with calm mercilessness and caused him many mildly agitating hopes by
2054: seeming always to avoid dramatic contact with him—for all meanings, we
2055: know, depend on the key of interpretation.
2056: 
2057: Some persons might have thought beforehand that a young man of Anglican
2058: leanings, having a sense of sacredness much exercised on small things
2059: as well as great, rarely laughing save from politeness, and in general
2060: regarding the mention of spades by their naked names as rather coarse,
2061: would not have seen a fitting bride for himself in a girl who was
2062: daring in ridicule, and showed none of the special grace required in
2063: the clergyman’s wife; or, that a young man informed by theological
2064: reading would have reflected that he was not likely to meet the taste
2065: of a lively, restless young lady like Miss Harleth. But are we always
2066: obliged to explain why the facts are not what some persons thought
2067: beforehand? The apology lies on their side, who had that erroneous way
2068: of thinking.
2069: 
2070: As for Rex, who would possibly have been sorry for poor Middleton if he
2071: had been aware of the excellent curate’s inward conflict, he was too
2072: completely absorbed in a first passion to have observation for any
2073: person or thing. He did not observe Gwendolen; he only felt what she
2074: said or did, and the back of his head seemed to be a good organ of
2075: information as to whether she was in the room or out. Before the end of
2076: the first fortnight he was so deeply in love that it was impossible for
2077: him to think of his life except as bound up with Gwendolen’s. He could
2078: see no obstacles, poor boy; his own love seemed a guarantee of hers,
2079: since it was one with the unperturbed delight in her image, so that he
2080: could no more dream of her giving him pain than an Egyptian could dream
2081: of snow. She sang and played to him whenever he liked, was always glad
2082: of his companionship in riding, though his borrowed steeds were often
2083: comic, was ready to join in any fun of his, and showed a right
2084: appreciation of Anna. No mark of sympathy seemed absent. That because
2085: Gwendolen was the most perfect creature in the world she was to make a
2086: grand match, had not occurred to him. He had no conceit—at least not
2087: more than goes to make up the necessary gum and consistence of a
2088: substantial personality: it was only that in the young bliss of loving
2089: he took Gwendolen’s perfection as part of that good which had seemed
2090: one with life to him, being the outcome of a happy, well-embodied
2091: nature.
2092: 
2093: One incident which happened in the course of their dramatic attempts
2094: impressed Rex as a sign of her unusual sensibility. It showed an aspect
2095: of her nature which could not have been preconceived by any one who,
2096: like him, had only seen her habitual fearlessness in active exercises
2097: and her high spirits in society.
2098: 
2099: After a good deal of rehearsing it was resolved that a select party
2100: should be invited to Offendene to witness the performances which went
2101: with so much satisfaction to the actors. Anna had caused a pleasant
2102: surprise; nothing could be neater than the way in which she played her
2103: little parts; one would even have suspected her of hiding much sly
2104: observation under her simplicity. And Mr. Middleton answered very well
2105: by not trying to be comic. The main source of doubt and retardation had
2106: been Gwendolen’s desire to appear in her Greek dress. No word for a
2107: charade would occur to her either waking or dreaming that suited her
2108: purpose of getting a statuesque pose in this favorite costume. To
2109: choose a motive from Racine was of no use, since Rex and the others
2110: could not declaim French verse, and improvised speeches would turn the
2111: scene into burlesque. Besides, Mr. Gascoigne prohibited the acting of
2112: scenes from plays: he usually protested against the notion that an
2113: amusement which was fitting for every one else was unfitting for a
2114: clergyman; but he would not in this matter overstep the line of decorum
2115: as drawn in that part of Wessex, which did not exclude his sanction of
2116: the young people’s acting charades in his sister-in-law’s house—a very
2117: different affair from private theatricals in the full sense of the word.
2118: 
2119: Everybody of course was concerned to satisfy this wish of Gwendolen’s,
2120: and Rex proposed that they should wind up with a tableau in which the
2121: effect of her majesty would not be marred by any one’s speech. This
2122: pleased her thoroughly, and the only question was the choice of the
2123: tableau.
2124: 
2125: “Something pleasant, children, I beseech you,” said Mrs. Davilow; “I
2126: can’t have any Greek wickedness.”
2127: 
2128: “It is no worse than Christian wickedness, mamma,” said Gwendolen,
2129: whose mention of Rachelesque heroines had called forth that remark.
2130: 
2131: “And less scandalous,” said Rex. “Besides, one thinks of it as all gone
2132: by and done with. What do you say to Briseis being led away? I would be
2133: Achilles, and you would be looking round at me—after the print we have
2134: at the rectory.”
2135: 
2136: “That would be a good attitude for me,” said Gwendolen, in a tone of
2137: acceptance. But afterward she said with decision, “No. It will not do.
2138: There must be three men in proper costume, else it will be ridiculous.”
2139: 
2140: “I have it,” said Rex, after a little reflection. “Hermione as the
2141: statue in Winter’s Tale? I will be Leontes, and Miss Merry, Paulina,
2142: one on each side. Our dress won’t signify,” he went on laughingly; “it
2143: will be more Shakespearian and romantic if Leontes looks like Napoleon,
2144: and Paulina like a modern spinster.”
2145: 
2146: And Hermione was chosen; all agreeing that age was of no consequence,
2147: but Gwendolen urged that instead of the mere tableau there should be
2148: just enough acting of the scene to introduce the striking up of the
2149: music as a signal for her to step down and advance; when Leontes,
2150: instead of embracing her, was to kneel and kiss the hem of her garment,
2151: and so the curtain was to fall. The antechamber with folding doors lent
2152: itself admirably to the purpose of a stage, and the whole of the
2153: establishment, with the addition of Jarrett the village carpenter, was
2154: absorbed in the preparations for an entertainment, which, considering
2155: that it was an imitation of acting, was likely to be successful, since
2156: we know from ancient fable that an imitation may have more chance of
2157: success than the original.
2158: 
2159: Gwendolen was not without a special exultation in the prospect of this
2160: occasion, for she knew that Herr Klesmer was again at Quetcham, and she
2161: had taken care to include him among the invited.
2162: 
2163: Klesmer came. He was in one of his placid, silent moods, and sat in
2164: serene contemplation, replying to all appeals in benignant-sounding
2165: syllables more or less articulate—as taking up his cross meekly in a
2166: world overgrown with amateurs, or as careful how he moved his lion paws
2167: lest he should crush a rampant and vociferous mouse.
2168: 
2169: Everything indeed went off smoothly and according to expectation—all
2170: that was improvised and accidental being of a probable sort—until the
2171: incident occurred which showed Gwendolen in an unforeseen phase of
2172: emotion. How it came about was at first a mystery.
2173: 
2174: The tableau of Hermione was doubly striking from its dissimilarity with
2175: what had gone before: it was answering perfectly, and a murmur of
2176: applause had been gradually suppressed while Leontes gave his
2177: permission that Paulina should exercise her utmost art and make the
2178: statue move.
2179: 
2180: Hermione, her arm resting on a pillar, was elevated by about six
2181: inches, which she counted on as a means of showing her pretty foot and
2182: instep, when at the given signal she should advance and descend.
2183: 
2184: “Music, awake her, strike!” said Paulina (Mrs. Davilow, who, by special
2185: entreaty, had consented to take the part in a white burnous and hood).
2186: 
2187: Herr Klesmer, who had been good-natured enough to seat himself at the
2188: piano, struck a thunderous chord—but in the same instant, and before
2189: Hermione had put forth her foot, the movable panel, which was on a line
2190: with the piano, flew open on the right opposite the stage and disclosed
2191: the picture of the dead face and the fleeing figure, brought out in
2192: pale definiteness by the position of the wax-lights. Everyone was
2193: startled, but all eyes in the act of turning toward the open panel were
2194: recalled by a piercing cry from Gwendolen, who stood without change of
2195: attitude, but with a change of expression that was terrifying in its
2196: terror. She looked like a statue into which a soul of Fear had entered:
2197: her pallid lips were parted; her eyes, usually narrowed under their
2198: long lashes, were dilated and fixed. Her mother, less surprised than
2199: alarmed, rushed toward her, and Rex, too, could not help going to her
2200: side. But the touch of her mother’s arm had the effect of an electric
2201: charge; Gwendolen fell on her knees and put her hands before her face.
2202: She was still trembling, but mute, and it seemed that she had
2203: self-consciousness enough to aim at controlling her signs of terror,
2204: for she presently allowed herself to be raised from her kneeling
2205: posture and led away, while the company were relieving their minds by
2206: explanation.
2207: 
2208: “A magnificent bit of _plastik_ that!” said Klesmer to Miss Arrowpoint.
2209: And a quick fire of undertoned question and answer went round.
2210: 
2211: “Was it part of the play?”
2212: 
2213: “Oh, no, surely not. Miss Harleth was too much affected. A sensitive
2214: creature!”
2215: 
2216: “Dear me! I was not aware that there was a painting behind that panel;
2217: were you?”
2218: 
2219: “No; how should I? Some eccentricity in one of the Earl’s family long
2220: ago, I suppose.”
2221: 
2222: “How very painful! Pray shut it up.”
2223: 
2224: “Was the door locked? It is very mysterious. It must be the spirits.”
2225: 
2226: “But there is no medium present.”
2227: 
2228: “How do you know that? We must conclude that there is, when such things
2229: happen.”
2230: 
2231: “Oh, the door was not locked; it was probably the sudden vibration from
2232: the piano that sent it open.”
2233: 
2234: This conclusion came from Mr. Gascoigne, who begged Miss Merry if
2235: possible to get the key. But this readiness to explain the mystery was
2236: thought by Mrs. Vulcany unbecoming in a clergyman, and she observed in
2237: an undertone that Mr. Gascoigne was always a little too worldly for her
2238: taste. However, the key was produced, and the rector turned it in the
2239: lock with an emphasis rather offensively rationalizing—as who should
2240: say, “it will not start open again”—putting the key in his pocket as a
2241: security.
2242: 
2243: However, Gwendolen soon reappeared, showing her usual spirits, and
2244: evidently determined to ignore as far as she could the striking change
2245: she had made in the part of Hermione.
2246: 
2247: But when Klesmer said to her, “We have to thank you for devising a
2248: perfect climax: you could not have chosen a finer bit of _plastik_,”
2249: there was a flush of pleasure in her face. She liked to accept as a
2250: belief what was really no more than delicate feigning. He divined that
2251: the betrayal into a passion of fear had been mortifying to her, and
2252: wished her to understand that he took it for good acting. Gwendolen
2253: cherished the idea that now he was struck with her talent as well as
2254: her beauty, and her uneasiness about his opinion was half turned to
2255: complacency.
2256: 
2257: But too many were in the secret of what had been included in the
2258: rehearsals, and what had not, and no one besides Klesmer took the
2259: trouble to soothe Gwendolen’s imagined mortification. The general
2260: sentiment was that the incident should be let drop.
2261: 
2262: There had really been a medium concerned in the starting open of the
2263: panel: one who had quitted the room in haste and crept to bed in much
2264: alarm of conscience. It was the small Isabel, whose intense curiosity,
2265: unsatisfied by the brief glimpse she had had of the strange picture on
2266: the day of arrival at Offendene, had kept her on the watch for an
2267: opportunity of finding out where Gwendolen had put the key, of stealing
2268: it from the discovered drawer when the rest of the family were out, and
2269: getting on a stool to unlock the panel. While she was indulging her
2270: thirst for knowledge in this way, a noise which she feared was an
2271: approaching footstep alarmed her: she closed the door and attempted
2272: hurriedly to lock it, but failing and not daring to linger, she
2273: withdrew the key and trusted that the panel would stick, as it seemed
2274: well inclined to do. In this confidence she had returned the key to its
2275: former place, stilling any anxiety by the thought that if the door were
2276: discovered to be unlocked nobody would know how the unlocking came
2277: about. The inconvenient Isabel, like other offenders, did not foresee
2278: her own impulse to confession, a fatality which came upon her the
2279: morning after the party, when Gwendolen said at the breakfast-table, “I
2280: know the door was locked before the housekeeper gave me the key, for I
2281: tried it myself afterward. Some one must have been to my drawer and
2282: taken the key.”
2283: 
2284: It seemed to Isabel that Gwendolen’s awful eyes had rested on her more
2285: than on the other sisters, and without any time for resolve, she said,
2286: with a trembling lip:
2287: 
2288: “Please forgive me, Gwendolen.”
2289: 
2290: The forgiveness was sooner bestowed than it would have been if
2291: Gwendolen had not desired to dismiss from her own and every one else’s
2292: memory any case in which she had shown her susceptibility to terror.
2293: She wondered at herself in these occasional experiences, which seemed
2294: like a brief remembered madness, an unexplained exception from her
2295: normal life; and in this instance she felt a peculiar vexation that her
2296: helpless fear had shown itself, not, as usual, in solitude, but in
2297: well-lit company. Her ideal was to be daring in speech and reckless in
2298: braving dangers, both moral and physical; and though her practice fell
2299: far behind her ideal, this shortcoming seemed to be due to the
2300: pettiness of circumstances, the narrow theatre which life offers to a
2301: girl of twenty, who cannot conceive herself as anything else than a
2302: lady, or as in any position which would lack the tribute of respect.
2303: She had no permanent consciousness of other fetters, or of more
2304: spiritual restraints, having always disliked whatever was presented to
2305: her under the name of religion, in the same way that some people
2306: dislike arithmetic and accounts: it had raised no other emotion in her,
2307: no alarm, no longing; so that the question whether she believed it had
2308: not occurred to her any more than it had occurred to her to inquire
2309: into the conditions of colonial property and banking, on which, as she
2310: had had many opportunities of knowing, the family fortune was
2311: dependent. All these facts about herself she would have been ready to
2312: admit, and even, more or less indirectly, to state. What she
2313: unwillingly recognized, and would have been glad for others to be
2314: unaware of, was that liability of hers to fits of spiritual dread,
2315: though this fountain of awe within her had not found its way into
2316: connection with the religion taught her or with any human relations.
2317: She was ashamed and frightened, as at what might happen again, in
2318: remembering her tremor on suddenly feeling herself alone, when, for
2319: example, she was walking without companionship and there came some
2320: rapid change in the light. Solitude in any wide scene impressed her
2321: with an undefined feeling of immeasurable existence aloof from her, in
2322: the midst of which she was helplessly incapable of asserting herself.
2323: The little astronomy taught her at school used sometimes to set her
2324: imagination at work in a way that made her tremble: but always when
2325: some one joined her she recovered her indifference to the vastness in
2326: which she seemed an exile; she found again her usual world in which her
2327: will was of some avail, and the religious nomenclature belonging to
2328: this world was no more identified for her with those uneasy impressions
2329: of awe than her uncle’s surplices seen out of use at the rectory. With
2330: human ears and eyes about her, she had always hitherto recovered her
2331: confidence, and felt the possibility of winning empire.
2332: 
2333: To her mamma and others her fits of timidity or terror were
2334: sufficiently accounted for by her “sensitiveness” or the “excitability
2335: of her nature”; but these explanatory phrases required conciliation
2336: with much that seemed to be blank indifference or rare self-mastery.
2337: Heat is a great agent and a useful word, but considered as a means of
2338: explaining the universe it requires an extensive knowledge of
2339: differences; and as a means of explaining character “sensitiveness” is
2340: in much the same predicament. But who, loving a creature like
2341: Gwendolen, would not be inclined to regard every peculiarity in her as
2342: a mark of pre-eminence? That was what Rex did. After the Hermione scene
2343: he was more persuaded than ever that she must be instinct with all
2344: feeling, and not only readier to respond to a worshipful love, but able
2345: to love better than other girls. Rex felt the summer on his young wings
2346: and soared happily.

2352: 
2353:   “_Perigot_. As the bonny lasse passed by,
2354:     _Willie_. Hey, ho, bonnilasse!
2355:          _P_. She roode at me with glauncing eye,
2356:          _W_. As clear as the crystal glasse.

2362: 
2363:     “The kindliest symptom, yet the most alarming crisis in the ticklish
2364:     state of youth; the nourisher and destroyer of hopeful wits; * * * the
2365:     servitude above freedom; the gentle mind’s religion; the liberal
2366:     superstition.”—CHARLES LAMB.
2367: 
2368: 
2369: The first sign of the unimagined snow-storm was like the transparent
2370: white cloud that seems to set off the blue. Anna was in the secret of
2371: Rex’s feeling; though for the first time in their lives he had said
2372: nothing to her about what he most thought of, and he only took it for
2373: granted that she knew it. For the first time, too, Anna could not say
2374: to Rex what was continually in her mind. Perhaps it might have been a
2375: pain which she would have had to conceal, that he should so soon care
2376: for some one else more than for herself, if such a feeling had not been
2377: thoroughly neutralized by doubt and anxiety on his behalf. Anna admired
2378: her cousin—would have said with simple sincerity, “Gwendolen is always
2379: very good to me,” and held it in the order of things for herself to be
2380: entirely subject to this cousin; but she looked at her with mingled
2381: fear and distrust, with a puzzled contemplation as of some wondrous and
2382: beautiful animal whose nature was a mystery, and who, for anything Anna
2383: knew, might have an appetite for devouring all the small creatures that
2384: were her own particular pets. And now Anna’s heart was sinking under
2385: the heavy conviction which she dared not utter, that Gwendolen would
2386: never care for Rex. What she herself held in tenderness and reverence
2387: had constantly seemed indifferent to Gwendolen, and it was easier to
2388: imagine her scorning Rex than returning any tenderness of his. Besides,
2389: she was always thinking of being something extraordinary. And poor Rex!
2390: Papa would be angry with him if he knew. And of course he was too young
2391: to be in love in that way; and she, Anna had thought that it would be
2392: years and years before any thing of that sort came, and that she would
2393: be Rex’s housekeeper ever so long. But what a heart must that be which
2394: did not return his love! Anna, in the prospect of his suffering, was
2395: beginning to dislike her too fascinating cousin.
2396: 
2397: It seemed to her, as it did to Rex, that the weeks had been filled with
2398: a tumultuous life evident to all observers: if he had been questioned
2399: on the subject he would have said that he had no wish to conceal what
2400: he hoped would be an engagement which he should immediately tell his
2401: father of: and yet for the first time in his life he was reserved not
2402: only about his feelings but—which was more remarkable to Anna—about
2403: certain actions. She, on her side, was nervous each time her father or
2404: mother began to speak to her in private lest they should say anything
2405: about Rex and Gwendolen. But the elders were not in the least alive to
2406: this agitating drama, which went forward chiefly in a sort of pantomime
2407: extremely lucid in the minds thus expressing themselves, but easily
2408: missed by spectators who were running their eyes over the _Guardian_ or
2409: the _Clerical Gazette_, and regarded the trivialities of the young ones
2410: with scarcely more interpretation than they gave to the action of
2411: lively ants.
2412: 
2413: “Where are you going, Rex?” said Anna one gray morning when her father
2414: had set off in his carriage to the sessions, Mrs. Gascoigne with him,
2415: and she had observed that her brother had on his antigropelos, the
2416: utmost approach he possessed to a hunting equipment.
2417: 
2418: “Going to see the hounds throw off at the Three Barns.”
2419: 
2420: “Are you going to take Gwendolen?” said Anna, timidly.
2421: 
2422: “She told you, did she?”
2423: 
2424: “No, but I thought—Does papa know you are going?”
2425: 
2426: “Not that I am aware of. I don’t suppose he would trouble himself about
2427: the matter.”
2428: 
2429: “You are going to use his horse?”
2430: 
2431: “He knows I do that whenever I can.”
2432: 
2433: “Don’t let Gwendolen ride after the hounds, Rex,” said Anna, whose
2434: fears gifted her with second-sight.
2435: 
2436: “Why not?” said Rex, smiling rather provokingly.
2437: 
2438: “Papa and mamma and aunt Davilow all wish her not to. They think it is
2439: not right for her.”
2440: 
2441: “Why should you suppose she is going to do what is not right?”
2442: 
2443: “Gwendolen minds nobody sometimes,” said Anna getting bolder by dint of
2444: a little anger.
2445: 
2446: “Then she would not mind me,” said Rex, perversely making a joke of
2447: poor Anna’s anxiety.
2448: 
2449: “Oh Rex, I cannot bear it. You will make yourself very unhappy.” Here
2450: Anna burst into tears.
2451: 
2452: “Nannie, Nannie, what on earth is the matter with you?” said Rex, a
2453: little impatient at being kept in this way, hat on and whip in hand.
2454: 
2455: “She will not care for you one bit—I know she never will!” said the
2456: poor child in a sobbing whisper. She had lost all control of herself.
2457: 
2458: Rex reddened and hurried away from her out of the hall door, leaving
2459: her to the miserable consciousness of having made herself disagreeable
2460: in vain.
2461: 
2462: He did think of her words as he rode along; they had the unwelcomeness
2463: which all unfavorable fortune-telling has, even when laughed at; but he
2464: quickly explained them as springing from little Anna’s tenderness, and
2465: began to be sorry that he was obliged to come away without soothing
2466: her. Every other feeling on the subject, however, was quickly merged in
2467: a resistant belief to the contrary of hers, accompanied with a new
2468: determination to prove that he was right. This sort of certainty had
2469: just enough kinship to doubt and uneasiness to hurry on a confession
2470: which an untouched security might have delayed.
2471: 
2472: Gwendolen was already mounted and riding up and down the avenue when
2473: Rex appeared at the gate. She had provided herself against
2474: disappointment in case he did not appear in time by having the groom
2475: ready behind her, for she would not have waited beyond a reasonable
2476: time. But now the groom was dismissed, and the two rode away in
2477: delightful freedom. Gwendolen was in her highest spirits, and Rex
2478: thought that she had never looked so lovely before; her figure, her
2479: long white throat, and the curves of her cheek and chin were always set
2480: off to perfection by the compact simplicity of her riding dress. He
2481: could not conceive a more perfect girl; and to a youthful lover like
2482: Rex it seems that the fundamental identity of the good, the true and
2483: the beautiful, is already extant and manifest in the object of his
2484: love. Most observers would have held it more than equally accountable
2485: that a girl should have like impressions about Rex, for in his handsome
2486: face there was nothing corresponding to the undefinable stinging
2487: quality—as it were a trace of demon ancestry—which made some
2488: beholders hesitate in their admiration of Gwendolen.
2489: 
2490: It was an exquisite January morning in which there was no threat of
2491: rain, but a gray sky making the calmest background for the charms of a
2492: mild winter scene—the grassy borders of the lanes, the hedgerows
2493: sprinkled with red berries and haunted with low twitterings, the purple
2494: bareness of the elms, the rich brown of the furrows. The horses’ hoofs
2495: made a musical chime, accompanying their young voices. She was laughing
2496: at his equipment, for he was the reverse of a dandy, and he was
2497: enjoying her laughter; the freshness of the morning mingled with the
2498: freshness of their youth; and every sound that came from their clear
2499: throats, every glance they gave each other, was the bubbling outflow
2500: from a spring of joy. It was all morning to them, within and without.
2501: And thinking of them in these moments one is tempted to that futile
2502: sort of wishing—if only things could have been a little otherwise
2503: then, so as to have been greatly otherwise after—if only these two
2504: beautiful young creatures could have pledged themselves to each other
2505: then and there, and never through life have swerved from that pledge!
2506: For some of the goodness which Rex believed in was there. Goodness is a
2507: large, often a prospective word; like harvest, which at one stage when
2508: we talk of it lies all underground, with an indeterminate future; is
2509: the germ prospering in the darkness? at another, it has put forth
2510: delicate green blades, and by-and-by the trembling blossoms are ready
2511: to be dashed off by an hour of rough wind or rain. Each stage has its
2512: peculiar blight, and may have the healthy life choked out of it by a
2513: particular action of the foul land which rears or neighbors it, or by
2514: damage brought from foulness afar.
2515: 
2516: “Anna had got it into her head that you would want to ride after the
2517: hounds this morning,” said Rex, whose secret associations with Anna’s
2518: words made this speech seem quite perilously near the most momentous of
2519: subjects.
2520: 
2521: “Did she?” said Gwendolen, laughingly. “What a little clairvoyant she
2522: is!”
2523: 
2524: “Shall you?” said Rex, who had not believed in her intending to do it
2525: if the elders objected, but confided in her having good reasons.
2526: 
2527: “I don’t know. I can’t tell what I shall do till I get there.
2528: Clairvoyants are often wrong: they foresee what is likely. I am not
2529: fond of what is likely: it is always dull. I do what is unlikely.”
2530: 
2531: “Ah, there you tell me a secret. When once I knew what people in
2532: general would be likely to do, I should know you would do the opposite.
2533: So you would have come round to a likelihood of your own sort. I shall
2534: be able to calculate on you. You couldn’t surprise me.”
2535: 
2536: “Yes, I could. I should turn round and do what was likely for people in
2537: general,” said Gwendolen, with a musical laugh.
2538: 
2539: “You see you can’t escape some sort of likelihood. And
2540: contradictoriness makes the strongest likelihood of all. You must give
2541: up a plan.”
2542: 
2543: “No, I shall not. My plan is to do what pleases me.” (Here should any
2544: young lady incline to imitate Gwendolen, let her consider the set of
2545: her head and neck: if the angle there had been different, the chin
2546: protrusive, and the cervical vertebrae a trifle more curved in their
2547: position, ten to one Gwendolen’s words would have had a jar in them for
2548: the sweet-natured Rex. But everything odd in her speech was humor and
2549: pretty banter, which he was only anxious to turn toward one point.)
2550: 
2551: “Can you manage to feel only what pleases you?” said he.
2552: 
2553: “Of course not; that comes from what other people do. But if the world
2554: were pleasanter, one would only feel what was pleasant. Girls’ lives
2555: are so stupid: they never do what they like.”
2556: 
2557: “I thought that was more the case of the men. They are forced to do
2558: hard things, and are often dreadfully bored, and knocked to pieces too.
2559: And then, if we love a girl very dearly we want to do as she likes, so
2560: after all you have your own way.”
2561: 
2562: “I don’t believe it. I never saw a married woman who had her own way.”
2563: 
2564: “What should you like to do?” said Rex, quite guilelessly, and in real
2565: anxiety.
2566: 
2567: “Oh, I don’t know!—go to the North Pole, or ride steeple-chases, or go
2568: to be a queen in the East like Lady Hester Stanhope,” said Gwendolen,
2569: flightily. Her words were born on her lips, but she would have been at
2570: a loss to give an answer of deeper origin.
2571: 
2572: “You don’t mean you would never be married?”
2573: 
2574: “No; I didn’t say that. Only when I married, I should not do as other
2575: women do.”
2576: 
2577: “You might do just as you liked if you married a man who loved you more
2578: dearly than anything else in the world,” said Rex, who, poor youth, was
2579: moving in themes outside the curriculum in which he had promised to win
2580: distinction. “I know one who does.”
2581: 
2582: “Don’t talk of Mr. Middleton, for heaven’s sake,” said Gwendolen,
2583: hastily, a quick blush spreading over her face and neck; “that is
2584: Anna’s chant. I hear the hounds. Let us go on.”
2585: 
2586: She put her chestnut to a canter, and Rex had no choice but to follow
2587: her. Still he felt encouraged. Gwendolen was perfectly aware that her
2588: cousin was in love with her; but she had no idea that the matter was of
2589: any consequence, having never had the slightest visitation of painful
2590: love herself. She wished the small romance of Rex’s devotion to fill up
2591: the time of his stay at Pennicote, and to avoid explanations which
2592: would bring it to an untimely end. Besides, she objected, with a sort
2593: of physical repulsion, to being directly made love to. With all her
2594: imaginative delight in being adored, there was a certain fierceness of
2595: maidenhood in her.
2596: 
2597: But all other thoughts were soon lost for her in the excitement of the
2598: scene at the Three Barns. Several gentlemen of the hunt knew her, and
2599: she exchanged pleasant greetings. Rex could not get another word with
2600: her. The color, the stir of the field had taken possession of Gwendolen
2601: with a strength which was not due to habitual associations, for she had
2602: never yet ridden after the hounds—only said she should like to do it,
2603: and so drawn forth a prohibition; her mamma dreading the danger, and
2604: her uncle declaring that for his part he held that kind of violent
2605: exercise unseemly in a woman, and that whatever might be done in other
2606: parts of the country, no lady of good position followed the Wessex
2607: hunt: no one but Mrs. Gadsby, the yeomanry captain’s wife, who had been
2608: a kitchenmaid and still spoke like one. This last argument had some
2609: effect on Gwendolen, and had kept her halting between her desire to
2610: assert her freedom and her horror of being classed with Mrs. Gadsby.
2611: 
2612: Some of the most unexceptionable women in the neighborhood occasionally
2613: went to see the hounds throw off; but it happened that none of them
2614: were present this morning to abstain from following, while Mrs. Gadsby,
2615: with her doubtful antecedents, grammatical and otherwise, was not
2616: visible to make following seem unbecoming. Thus Gwendolen felt no check
2617: on the animal stimulus that came from the stir and tongue of the
2618: hounds, the pawing of the horses, the varying voices of men, the
2619: movement hither and thither of vivid color on the background of green
2620: and gray stillness:—that utmost excitement of the coming chase which
2621: consists in feeling something like a combination of dog and horse, with
2622: the superadded thrill of social vanities and consciousness of
2623: centaur-power which belongs to humankind.
2624: 
2625: Rex would have felt more of the same enjoyment if he could have kept
2626: nearer to Gwendolen, and not seen her constantly occupied with
2627: acquaintances, or looked at by would-be acquaintances, all on lively
2628: horses which veered about and swept the surrounding space as
2629: effectually as a revolving lever.
2630: 
2631: “Glad to see you here this fine morning, Miss Harleth,” said Lord
2632: Brackenshaw, a middle-aged peer of aristocratic seediness in stained
2633: pink, with easy-going manners which would have made the threatened
2634: deluge seem of no consequence. “We shall have a first-rate run. A pity
2635: you didn’t go with us. Have you ever tried your little chestnut at a
2636: ditch? you wouldn’t be afraid, eh?”
2637: 
2638: “Not the least in the world,” said Gwendolen. And that was true: she
2639: was never fearful in action and companionship. “I have often taken him
2640: at some rails and a ditch too, near—”
2641: 
2642: “Ah, by Jove!” said his lordship, quietly, in notation that something
2643: was happening which must break off the dialogue: and as he reined off
2644: his horse, Rex was bringing his sober hackney up to Gwendolen’s side
2645: when—the hounds gave tongue, and the whole field was in motion as if
2646: the whirl of the earth were carrying it; Gwendolen along with
2647: everything else; no word of notice to Rex, who without a second thought
2648: followed too. Could he let Gwendolen go alone? under other
2649: circumstances he would have enjoyed the run, but he was just now
2650: perturbed by the check which had been put on the impetus to utter his
2651: love, and get utterance in return, an impetus which could not at once
2652: resolve itself into a totally different sort of chase, at least with
2653: the consciousness of being on his father’s gray nag, a good horse
2654: enough in his way, but of sober years and ecclesiastical habits.
2655: Gwendolen on her spirited little chestnut was up with the best, and
2656: felt as secure as an immortal goddess, having, if she had thought of
2657: risk, a core of confidence that no ill luck would happen to her. But
2658: she thought of no such thing, and certainly not of any risk there might
2659: be for her cousin. If she had thought of him, it would have struck her
2660: as a droll picture that he should be gradually falling behind, and
2661: looking round in search of gates: a fine lithe youth, whose heart must
2662: be panting with all the spirit of a beagle, stuck as if under a
2663: wizard’s spell on a stiff clerical hackney, would have made her laugh
2664: with a sense of fun much too strong for her to reflect on his
2665: mortification. But Gwendolen was apt to think rather of those who saw
2666: her than of those whom she could not see; and Rex was soon so far
2667: behind that if she had looked she would not have seen him. For I grieve
2668: to say that in the search for a gate, along a lane lately mended,
2669: Primrose fell, broke his knees, and undesignedly threw Rex over his
2670: head.
2671: 
2672: Fortunately a blacksmith’s son who also followed the hounds under
2673: disadvantages, namely, on foot (a loose way of hunting which had struck
2674: some even frivolous minds as immoral), was naturally also in the rear,
2675: and happened to be within sight of Rex’s misfortune. He ran to give
2676: help which was greatly needed, for Rex was a great deal stunned, and
2677: the complete recovery of sensation came in the form of pain. Joel Dagge
2678: on this occasion showed himself that most useful of personages, whose
2679: knowledge is of a kind suited to the immediate occasion: he not only
2680: knew perfectly well what was the matter with the horse, how far they
2681: were both from the nearest public-house and from Pennicote Rectory, and
2682: could certify to Rex that his shoulder was only a bit out of joint, but
2683: also offered experienced surgical aid.
2684: 
2685: “Lord, sir, let me shove it in again for you! I’s seen Nash, the
2686: bone-setter, do it, and done it myself for our little Sally twice over.
2687: It’s all one and the same, shoulders is. If you’ll trusten to me and
2688: tighten your mind up a bit, I’ll do it for you in no time.”
2689: 
2690: “Come then, old fellow,” said Rex, who could tighten his mind better
2691: than his seat in the saddle. And Joel managed the operation, though not
2692: without considerable expense of pain to his patient, who turned so
2693: pitiably pale while tightening his mind, that Joel remarked, “Ah, sir,
2694: you aren’t used to it, that’s how it is. I’s see lots and lots o’
2695: joints out. I see a man with his eye pushed out once—that was a rum go
2696: as ever I see. You can’t have a bit o’ fun wi’out such sort o’ things.
2697: But it went in again. I’s swallowed three teeth mysen, as sure as I’m
2698: alive. Now, sirrey” (this was addressed to Primrose), “come alonk—you
2699: musn’t make believe as you can’t.”
2700: 
2701: Joel being clearly a low character, it is, happily, not necessary to
2702: say more of him to the refined reader, than that he helped Rex to get
2703: home with as little delay as possible. There was no alternative but to
2704: get home, though all the while he was in anxiety about Gwendolen, and
2705: more miserable in the thought that she, too, might have had an
2706: accident, than in the pain of his own bruises and the annoyance he was
2707: about to cause his father. He comforted himself about her by reflecting
2708: that every one would be anxious to take care of her, and that some
2709: acquaintance would be sure to conduct her home.
2710: 
2711: Mr. Gascoigne was already at home, and was writing letters in his
2712: study, when he was interrupted by seeing poor Rex come in with a face
2713: which was not the less handsome and ingratiating for being pale and a
2714: little distressed. He was secretly the favorite son, and a young
2715: portrait of the father; who, however, never treated him with any
2716: partiality—rather, with an extra rigor. Mr. Gascoigne having inquired
2717: of Anna, knew that Rex had gone with Gwendolen to the meet at the Three
2718: Barns.
2719: 
2720: “What is the matter?” he said hastily, not laying down his pen.
2721: 
2722: “I’m very sorry, sir; Primrose has fallen down and broken his knees.”
2723: 
2724: “Where have you been with him?” said Mr. Gascoigne, with a touch of
2725: severity. He rarely gave way to temper.
2726: 
2727: “To the Three Barns to see the hounds throw off.”
2728: 
2729: “And you were fool enough to follow?”
2730: 
2731: “Yes, sir. I didn’t go at any fences, but the horse got his leg into a
2732: hole.”
2733: 
2734: “And you got hurt yourself, I hope, eh!”
2735: 
2736: “I got my shoulder put out, but a young blacksmith put it in again for
2737: me. I’m just a little battered, that’s all.”
2738: 
2739: “Well, sit down.”
2740: 
2741: “I’m very sorry about the horse, sir; I knew it would be a vexation to
2742: you.”
2743: 
2744: “And what has become of Gwendolen?” said Mr. Gascoigne, abruptly. Rex,
2745: who did not imagine that his father had made any inquiries about him,
2746: answered at first with a blush, which was the more remarkable for his
2747: previous paleness. Then he said, nervously,
2748: 
2749: “I am anxious to know—I should like to go or send at once to
2750: Offendene—but she rides so well, and I think she would keep up—there
2751: would most likely be many round her.”
2752: 
2753: “I suppose it was she who led you on, eh?” said Mr. Gascoigne, laying
2754: down his pen, leaning back in his chair, and looking at Rex with more
2755: marked examination.
2756: 
2757: “It was natural for her to want to go: she didn’t intend it
2758: beforehand—she was led away by the spirit of the thing. And, of
2759: course, I went when she went.”
2760: 
2761: Mr. Gascoigne left a brief interval of silence, and then said, with
2762: quiet irony,—“But now you observe, young gentleman, that you are not
2763: furnished with a horse which will enable you to play the squire to your
2764: cousin. You must give up that amusement. You have spoiled my nag for
2765: me, and that is enough mischief for one vacation. I shall beg you to
2766: get ready to start for Southampton to-morrow and join Stilfox, till you
2767: go up to Oxford with him. That will be good for your bruises as well as
2768: your studies.”
2769: 
2770: Poor Rex felt his heart swelling and comporting itself as if it had
2771: been no better than a girl’s.
2772: 
2773: “I hope you will not insist on my going immediately, sir.”
2774: 
2775: “Do you feel too ill?”
2776: 
2777: “No, not that—but—” here Rex bit his lips and felt the tears
2778: starting, to his great vexation; then he rallied and tried to say more
2779: firmly, “I want to go to Offendene, but I can go this evening.”
2780: 
2781: “I am going there myself. I can bring word about Gwendolen, if that is
2782: what you want.”
2783: 
2784: Rex broke down. He thought he discerned an intention fatal to his
2785: happiness, nay, his life. He was accustomed to believe in his father’s
2786: penetration, and to expect firmness. “Father, I can’t go away without
2787: telling her that I love her, and knowing that she loves me.”
2788: 
2789: Mr. Gascoigne was inwardly going through some self-rebuke for not being
2790: more wary, and was now really sorry for the lad; but every
2791: consideration was subordinate to that of using the wisest tactics in
2792: the case. He had quickly made up his mind and to answer the more
2793: quietly,
2794: 
2795: “My dear boy, you are too young to be taking momentous, decisive steps
2796: of that sort. This is a fancy which you have got into your head during
2797: an idle week or two: you must set to work at something and dismiss it.
2798: There is every reason against it. An engagement at your age would be
2799: totally rash and unjustifiable; and moreover, alliances between first
2800: cousins are undesirable. Make up your mind to a brief disappointment.
2801: Life is full of them. We have all got to be broken in; and this is a
2802: mild beginning for you.”
2803: 
2804: “No, not mild. I can’t bear it. I shall be good for nothing. I
2805: shouldn’t mind anything, if it were settled between us. I could do
2806: anything then,” said Rex, impetuously. “But it’s of no use to pretend
2807: that I will obey you. I can’t do it. If I said I would, I should be
2808: sure to break my word. I should see Gwendolen again.”
2809: 
2810: “Well, wait till to-morrow morning, that we may talk of the matter
2811: again—you will promise me that,” said Mr. Gascoigne, quietly; and Rex
2812: did not, could not refuse.
2813: 
2814: The rector did not even tell his wife that he had any other reason for
2815: going to Offendene that evening than his desire to ascertain that
2816: Gwendolen had got home safely. He found her more than safe—elated. Mr.
2817: Quallon, who had won the brush, had delivered the trophy to her, and
2818: she had brought it before her, fastened on the saddle; more than that,
2819: Lord Brackenshaw had conducted her home, and had shown himself
2820: delighted with her spirited riding. All this was told at once to her
2821: uncle, that he might see how well justified she had been in acting
2822: against his advice; and the prudential rector did feel himself in a
2823: slight difficulty, for at that moment he was particularly sensible that
2824: it was his niece’s serious interest to be well regarded by the
2825: Brackenshaws, and their opinion as to her following the hounds really
2826: touched the essence of his objection. However, he was not obliged to
2827: say anything immediately, for Mrs. Davilow followed up Gwendolen’s
2828: brief triumphant phrases with,
2829: 
2830: “Still, I do hope you will not do it again, Gwendolen. I should never
2831: have a moment’s quiet. Her father died by an accident, you know.”
2832: 
2833: Here Mrs. Davilow had turned away from Gwendolen, and looked at Mr.
2834: Gascoigne.
2835: 
2836: “Mamma, dear,” said Gwendolen, kissing her merrily, and passing over
2837: the question of the fears which Mrs. Davilow had meant to account for,
2838: “children don’t take after their parents in broken legs.”
2839: 
2840: Not one word had yet been said about Rex. In fact there had been no
2841: anxiety about him at Offendene. Gwendolen had observed to her mamma,
2842: “Oh, he must have been left far behind, and gone home in despair,” and
2843: it could not be denied that this was fortunate so far as it made way
2844: for Lord Brackenshaw’s bringing her home. But now Mr. Gascoigne said,
2845: with some emphasis, looking at Gwendolen,
2846: 
2847: “Well, the exploit has ended better for you than for Rex.”
2848: 
2849: “Yes, I dare say he had to make a terrible round. You have not taught
2850: Primrose to take the fences, uncle,” said Gwendolen, without the
2851: faintest shade of alarm in her looks and tone.
2852: 
2853: “Rex has had a fall,” said Mr. Gascoigne, curtly, throwing himself into
2854: an arm-chair resting his elbows and fitting his palms and fingers
2855: together, while he closed his lips and looked at Gwendolen, who said,
2856: 
2857: “Oh, poor fellow! he is not hurt, I hope?” with a correct look of
2858: anxiety such as elated mortals try to super-induce when their pulses
2859: are all the while quick with triumph; and Mrs. Davilow, in the same
2860: moment, uttered a low “Good heavens! There!”
2861: 
2862: Mr. Gascoigne went on: “He put his shoulder out, and got some bruises,
2863: I believe.” Here he made another little pause of observation; but
2864: Gwendolen, instead of any such symptoms as pallor and silence, had only
2865: deepened the compassionateness of her brow and eyes, and said again,
2866: “Oh, poor fellow! it is nothing serious, then?” and Mr. Gascoigne held
2867: his diagnosis complete. But he wished to make assurance doubly sure,
2868: and went on still with a purpose.
2869: 
2870: “He got his arm set again rather oddly. Some blacksmith—not a
2871: parishioner of mine—was on the field—a loose fish, I suppose, but
2872: handy, and set the arm for him immediately. So after all, I believe, I
2873: and Primrose come off worst. The horse’s knees are cut to pieces. He
2874: came down in a hole, it seems, and pitched Rex over his head.”
2875: 
2876: Gwendolen’s face had allowably become contented again, since Rex’s arm
2877: had been reset; and now, at the descriptive suggestions in the latter
2878: part of her uncle’s speech, her elated spirits made her features less
2879: unmanageable than usual; the smiles broke forth, and finally a
2880: descending scale of laughter.
2881: 
2882: “You are a pretty young lady—to laugh at other people’s calamities,”
2883: said Mr. Gascoigne, with a milder sense of disapprobation than if he
2884: had not had counteracting reasons to be glad that Gwendolen showed no
2885: deep feeling on the occasion.
2886: 
2887: “Pray forgive me, uncle. Now Rex is safe, it is so droll to fancy the
2888: figure he and Primrose would cut—in a lane all by themselves—only a
2889: blacksmith running up. It would make a capital caricature of ‘Following
2890: the Hounds.’”
2891: 
2892: Gwendolen rather valued herself on her superior freedom in laughing
2893: where others might only see matter for seriousness. Indeed, the
2894: laughter became her person so well that her opinion of its gracefulness
2895: was often shared by others; and it even entered into her uncle’s course
2896: of thought at this moment, that it was no wonder a boy should be
2897: fascinated by this young witch—who, however, was more mischievous than
2898: could be desired.
2899: 
2900: “How can you laugh at broken bones, child?” said Mrs. Davilow, still
2901: under her dominant anxiety. “I wish we had never allowed you to have
2902: the horse. You will see that we were wrong,” she added, looking with a
2903: grave nod at Mr. Gascoigne—“at least I was, to encourage her in asking
2904: for it.”
2905: 
2906: “Yes, seriously, Gwendolen,” said Mr. Gascoigne, in a judicious tone of
2907: rational advice to a person understood to be altogether rational, “I
2908: strongly recommend you—I shall ask you to oblige me so far—not to
2909: repeat your adventure of to-day. Lord Brackenshaw is very kind, but I
2910: feel sure that he would concur with me in what I say. To be spoken of
2911: as ‘the young lady who hunts’ by way of exception, would give a tone to
2912: the language about you which I am sure you would not like. Depend upon
2913: it, his lordship would not choose that Lady Beatrice or Lady Maria
2914: should hunt in this part of the country, if they were old enough to do
2915: so. When you are married, it will be different: you may do whatever
2916: your husband sanctions. But if you intend to hunt, you must marry a man
2917: who can keep horses.”
2918: 
2919: “I don’t know why I should do anything so horrible as to marry without
2920: _that_ prospect, at least,” said Gwendolen, pettishly. Her uncle’s
2921: speech had given her annoyance, which she could not show more directly;
2922: but she felt that she was committing herself, and after moving
2923: carelessly to another part of the room, went out.
2924: 
2925: “She always speaks in that way about marriage,” said Mrs. Davilow; “but
2926: it will be different when she has seen the right person.”
2927: 
2928: “Her heart has never been in the least touched, that you know of?” said
2929: Mr. Gascoigne.
2930: 
2931: Mrs. Davilow shook her head silently. “It was only last night she said
2932: to me, ‘Mamma, I wonder how girls manage to fall in love. It is easy to
2933: make them do it in books. But men are too ridiculous.’”
2934: 
2935: Mr. Gascoigne laughed a little, and made no further remark on the
2936: subject. The next morning at breakfast he said,
2937: 
2938: “How are your bruises, Rex?”
2939: 
2940: “Oh, not very mellow yet, sir; only beginning to turn a little.”
2941: 
2942: “You don’t feel quite ready for a journey to Southampton?”
2943: 
2944: “Not quite,” answered Rex, with his heart metaphorically in his mouth.
2945: 
2946: “Well, you can wait till to-morrow, and go to say good-bye to them at
2947: Offendene.”
2948: 
2949: Mrs. Gascoigne, who now knew the whole affair, looked steadily at her
2950: coffee lest she also should begin to cry, as Anna was doing already.
2951: 
2952: Mr. Gascoigne felt that he was applying a sharp remedy to poor Rex’s
2953: acute attack, but he believed it to be in the end the kindest. To let
2954: him know the hopelessness of his love from Gwendolen’s own lips might
2955: be curative in more ways than one.
2956: 
2957: “I can only be thankful that she doesn’t care about him,” said Mrs.
2958: Gascoigne, when she joined her husband in his study. “There are things
2959: in Gwendolen I cannot reconcile myself to. My Anna is worth two of her,
2960: with all her beauty and talent. It looks very ill in her that she will
2961: not help in the schools with Anna—not even in the Sunday-school. What
2962: you or I advise is of no consequence to her: and poor Fannie is
2963: completely under her thumb. But I know you think better of her,” Mrs.
2964: Gascoigne ended with a deferential hesitation.
2965: 
2966: “Oh, my dear, there is no harm in the girl. It is only that she has a
2967: high spirit, and it will not do to hold the reins too tight. The point
2968: is, to get her well married. She has a little too much fire in her for
2969: her present life with her mother and sisters. It is natural and right
2970: that she should be married soon—not to a poor man, but one who can
2971: give her a fitting position.”
2972: 
2973: Presently Rex, with his arm in a sling, was on his two miles’ walk to
2974: Offendene. He was rather puzzled by the unconditional permission to see
2975: Gwendolen, but his father’s real ground of action could not enter into
2976: his conjectures. If it had, he would first have thought it horribly
2977: cold-blooded, and then have disbelieved in his father’s conclusions.
2978: 
2979: When he got to the house, everybody was there but Gwendolen. The four
2980: girls, hearing him speak in the hall, rushed out of the library, which
2981: was their school-room, and hung round him with compassionate inquiries
2982: about his arm. Mrs. Davilow wanted to know exactly what had happened,
2983: and where the blacksmith lived, that she might make him a present;
2984: while Miss Merry, who took a subdued and melancholy part in all family
2985: affairs, doubted whether it would not be giving too much encouragement
2986: to that kind of character. Rex had never found the family troublesome
2987: before, but just now he wished them all away and Gwendolen there, and
2988: he was too uneasy for good-natured feigning. When at last he had said,
2989: “Where is Gwendolen?” and Mrs. Davilow had told Alice to go and see if
2990: her sister were come down, adding, “I sent up her breakfast this
2991: morning. She needed a long rest.” Rex took the shortest way out of his
2992: endurance by saying, almost impatiently, “Aunt, I want to speak to
2993: Gwendolen—I want to see her alone.”
2994: 
2995: “Very well, dear; go into the drawing-room. I will send her there,”
2996: said Mrs. Davilow, who had observed that he was fond of being with
2997: Gwendolen, as was natural, but had not thought of this as having any
2998: bearing on the realities of life: it seemed merely part of the
2999: Christmas holidays which were spinning themselves out.
3000: 
3001: Rex for his part thought that the realities of life were all hanging on
3002: this interview. He had to walk up and down the drawing-room in
3003: expectation for nearly ten minutes—ample space for all imaginative
3004: fluctuations; yet, strange to say, he was unvaryingly occupied in
3005: thinking what and how much he could do, when Gwendolen had accepted
3006: him, to satisfy his father that the engagement was the most prudent
3007: thing in the world, since it inspired him with double energy for work.
3008: He was to be a lawyer, and what reason was there why he should not rise
3009: as high as Eldon did? He was forced to look at life in the light of his
3010: father’s mind.
3011: 
3012: But when the door opened and she whose presence he was longing for
3013: entered, there came over him suddenly and mysteriously a state of
3014: tremor and distrust which he had never felt before. Miss Gwendolen,
3015: simple as she stood there, in her black silk, cut square about the
3016: round white pillar of her throat, a black band fastening her hair which
3017: streamed backward in smooth silky abundance, seemed more queenly than
3018: usual. Perhaps it was that there was none of the latent fun and
3019: tricksiness which had always pierced in her greeting of Rex. How much
3020: of this was due to her presentiment from what he had said yesterday
3021: that he was going to talk of love? How much from her desire to show
3022: regret about his accident? Something of both. But the wisdom of ages
3023: has hinted that there is a side of the bed which has a malign influence
3024: if you happen to get out on it; and this accident befalls some charming
3025: persons rather frequently. Perhaps it had befallen Gwendolen this
3026: morning. The hastening of her toilet, the way in which Bugle used the
3027: brush, the quality of the shilling serial mistakenly written for her
3028: amusement, the probabilities of the coming day, and, in short, social
3029: institutions generally, were all objectionable to her. It was not that
3030: she was out of temper, but that the world was not equal to the demands
3031: of her fine organism.
3032: 
3033: However it might be, Rex saw an awful majesty about her as she entered
3034: and put out her hand to him, without the least approach to a smile in
3035: eyes or mouth. The fun which had moved her in the evening had quite
3036: evaporated from the image of his accident, and the whole affair seemed
3037: stupid to her. But she said with perfect propriety, “I hope you are not
3038: much hurt, Rex; I deserve that you should reproach me for your
3039: accident.”
3040: 
3041: “Not at all,” said Rex, feeling the soul within him spreading itself
3042: like an attack of illness. “There is hardly any thing the matter with
3043: me. I am so glad you had the pleasure: I would willingly pay for it by
3044: a tumble, only I was sorry to break the horse’s knees.”
3045: 
3046: Gwendolen walked to the hearth and stood looking at the fire in the
3047: most inconvenient way for conversation, so that he could only get a
3048: side view of her face.
3049: 
3050: “My father wants me to go to Southampton for the rest of the vacation,”
3051: said Rex, his baritone trembling a little.
3052: 
3053: “Southampton! That’s a stupid place to go to, isn’t it?” said
3054: Gwendolen, chilly.
3055: 
3056: “It would be to me, because you would not be there.” Silence.
3057: 
3058: “Should you mind about me going away, Gwendolen?”
3059: 
3060: “Of course. Every one is of consequence in this dreary country,” said
3061: Gwendolen, curtly. The perception that poor Rex wanted to be tender
3062: made her curl up and harden like a sea-anemone at the touch of a finger.
3063: 
3064: “Are you angry with me, Gwendolen? Why do you treat me in this way all
3065: at once?” said Rex, flushing, and with more spirit in his voice, as if
3066: he too were capable of being angry.
3067: 
3068: Gwendolen looked round at him and smiled. “Treat you? Nonsense! I am
3069: only rather cross. Why did you come so very early? You must expect to
3070: find tempers in dishabille.”
3071: 
3072: “Be as cross with me as you like—only don’t treat me with
3073: indifference,” said Rex, imploringly. “All the happiness of my life
3074: depends on your loving me—if only a little—better than any one else.”
3075: 
3076: He tried to take her hand, but she hastily eluded his grasp and moved
3077: to the other end of the hearth, facing him.
3078: 
3079: “Pray don’t make love to me! I hate it!” she looked at him fiercely.
3080: 
3081: Rex turned pale and was silent, but could not take his eyes off her,
3082: and the impetus was not yet exhausted that made hers dart death at him.
3083: Gwendolen herself could not have foreseen that she should feel in this
3084: way. It was all a sudden, new experience to her. The day before she had
3085: been quite aware that her cousin was in love with her; she did not mind
3086: how much, so that he said nothing about it; and if any one had asked
3087: her why she objected to love-making speeches, she would have said,
3088: laughingly, “Oh I am tired of them all in the books.” But now the life
3089: of passion had begun negatively in her. She felt passionately averse to
3090: this volunteered love.
3091: 
3092: To Rex at twenty the joy of life seemed at an end more absolutely than
3093: it can do to a man at forty. But before they had ceased to look at each
3094: other, he did speak again.
3095: 
3096: “Is that last word you have to say to me, Gwendolen? Will it always be
3097: so?”
3098: 
3099: She could not help seeing his wretchedness and feeling a little regret
3100: for the old Rex who had not offended her. Decisively, but yet with some
3101: return of kindness, she said,
3102: 
3103: “About making love? Yes. But I don’t dislike you for anything else.”
3104: 
3105: There was just a perceptible pause before he said a low “good-bye,” and
3106: passed out of the room. Almost immediately after, she heard the heavy
3107: hall door bang behind him.
3108: 
3109: Mrs. Davilow, too, had heard Rex’s hasty departure, and presently came
3110: into the drawing-room, where she found Gwendolen seated on the low
3111: couch, her face buried, and her hair falling over her figure like a
3112: garment. She was sobbing bitterly. “My child, my child, what is it?”
3113: cried the mother, who had never before seen her darling struck down in
3114: this way, and felt something of the alarmed anguish that women, feel at
3115: the sight of overpowering sorrow in a strong man; for this child had
3116: been her ruler. Sitting down by her with circling arms, she pressed her
3117: cheek against Gwendolen’s head, and then tried to draw it upward.
3118: Gwendolen gave way, and letting her head rest against her mother, cried
3119: out sobbingly, “Oh, mamma, what can become of my life? there is nothing
3120: worth living for!”
3121: 
3122: “Why, dear?” said Mrs. Davilow. Usually she herself had been rebuked by
3123: her daughter for involuntary signs of despair.
3124: 
3125: “I shall never love anybody. I can’t love people. I hate them.”
3126: 
3127: “The time will come, dear, the time will come.”
3128: 
3129: Gwendolen was more and more convulsed with sobbing; but putting her
3130: arms round her mother’s neck with an almost painful clinging, she said
3131: brokenly, “I can’t bear any one to be very near me but you.”
3132: 
3133: Then the mother began to sob, for this spoiled child had never shown
3134: such dependence on her before: and so they clung to each other.
3135: 
3136: 
3137: 
3138: 
3139: CHAPTER VIII.
3140: 
3141:   What name doth Joy most borrow
3142:   When life is fair?
3143:                     “To-morrow.”
3144:   What name doth best fit Sorrow
3145:   In young despair?
3146:                     “To-morrow.”
3147: 
3148: 
3149: There was a much more lasting trouble at the rectory. Rex arrived there
3150: only to throw himself on his bed in a state of apparent apathy,
3151: unbroken till the next day, when it began to be interrupted by more
3152: positive signs of illness. Nothing could be said about his going to
3153: Southampton: instead of that, the chief thought of his mother and Anna
3154: was how to tend this patient who did not want to be well, and from
3155: being the brightest, most grateful spirit in the household, was
3156: metamorphosed into an irresponsive, dull-eyed creature who met all
3157: affectionate attempts with a murmur of “Let me alone.” His father
3158: looked beyond the crisis, and believed it to be the shortest way out of
3159: an unlucky affair; but he was sorry for the inevitable suffering, and
3160: went now and then to sit by him in silence for a few minutes, parting
3161: with a gentle pressure of his hand on Rex’s blank brow, and a “God
3162: bless you, my boy.” Warham and the younger children used to peep round
3163: the edge of the door to see this incredible thing of their lively
3164: brother being laid low; but fingers were immediately shaken at them to
3165: drive them back. The guardian who was always there was Anna, and her
3166: little hand was allowed to rest within her brother’s, though he never
3167: gave it a welcoming pressure. Her soul was divided between anguish for
3168: Rex and reproach of Gwendolen.
3169: 
3170: “Perhaps it is wicked of me, but I think I never _can_ love her again,”
3171: came as the recurrent burden of poor little Anna’s inward monody. And
3172: even Mrs. Gascoigne had an angry feeling toward her niece which she
3173: could not refrain from expressing (apologetically) to her husband.
3174: 
3175: “I know of course it is better, and we ought to be thankful that she is
3176: not in love with the poor boy; but really. Henry, I think she is hard;
3177: she has the heart of a coquette. I can not help thinking that she must
3178: have made him believe something, or the disappointment would not have
3179: taken hold of him in that way. And some blame attaches to poor Fanny;
3180: she is quite blind about that girl.”
3181: 
3182: Mr. Gascoigne answered imperatively: “The less said on that point the
3183: better, Nancy. I ought to have been more awake myself. As to the boy,
3184: be thankful if nothing worse ever happens to him. Let the thing die out
3185: as quickly as possible; and especially with regard to Gwendolen—let it
3186: be as if it had never been.”
3187: 
3188: The rector’s dominant feeling was that there had been a great escape.
3189: Gwendolen in love with Rex in return would have made a much harder
3190: problem, the solution of which might have been taken out of his hands.
3191: But he had to go through some further difficulty.
3192: 
3193: One fine morning Rex asked for his bath, and made his toilet as usual.
3194: Anna, full of excitement at this change, could do nothing but listen
3195: for his coming down, and at last hearing his step, ran to the foot of
3196: the stairs to meet him. For the first time he gave her a faint smile,
3197: but it looked so melancholy on his pale face that she could hardly help
3198: crying.
3199: 
3200: “Nannie!” he said gently, taking her hand and leading her slowly along
3201: with him to the drawing-room. His mother was there, and when she came
3202: to kiss him, he said: “What a plague I am!”
3203: 
3204: Then he sat still and looked out of the bow-window on the lawn and
3205: shrubs covered with hoar-frost, across which the sun was sending faint
3206: occasional gleams:—something like that sad smile on Rex’s face, Anna
3207: thought. He felt as if he had had a resurrection into a new world, and
3208: did not know what to do with himself there, the old interests being
3209: left behind. Anna sat near him, pretending to work, but really watching
3210: him with yearning looks. Beyond the garden hedge there was a road where
3211: wagons and carts sometimes went on field-work: a railed opening was
3212: made in the hedge, because the upland with its bordering wood and clump
3213: of ash-trees against the sky was a pretty sight. Presently there came
3214: along a wagon laden with timber; the horses were straining their grand
3215: muscles, and the driver having cracked his whip, ran along anxiously to
3216: guide the leader’s head, fearing a swerve. Rex seemed to be shaken into
3217: attention, rose and looked till the last quivering trunk of the timber
3218: had disappeared, and then walked once or twice along the room. Mrs.
3219: Gascoigne was no longer there, and when he came to sit down again,
3220: Anna, seeing a return of speech in her brother’s eyes, could not resist
3221: the impulse to bring a little stool and seat herself against his knee,
3222: looking up at him with an expression which seemed to say, “Do speak to
3223: me.” And he spoke.
3224: 
3225: “I’ll tell you what I’m thinking of, Nannie. I will go to Canada, or
3226: somewhere of that sort.” (Rex had not studied the character of our
3227: colonial possessions.)
3228: 
3229: “Oh, Rex, not for always!”
3230: 
3231: “Yes, to get my bread there. I should like to build a hut, and work
3232: hard at clearing, and have everything wild about me, and a great wide
3233: quiet.”
3234: 
3235: “And not take me with you?” said Anna, the big tears coming fast.
3236: 
3237: “How could I?”
3238: 
3239: “I should like it better than anything; and settlers go with their
3240: families. I would sooner go there than stay here in England. I could
3241: make the fires, and mend the clothes, and cook the food; and I could
3242: learn how to make the bread before we went. It would be nicer than
3243: anything—like playing at life over again, as we used to do when we
3244: made our tent with the drugget, and had our little plates and dishes.”
3245: 
3246: “Father and mother would not let you go.”
3247: 
3248: “Yes, I think they would, when I explained everything. It would save
3249: money; and papa would have more to bring up the boys with.”
3250: 
3251: There was further talk of the same practical kind at intervals, and it
3252: ended in Rex’s being obliged to consent that Anna should go with him
3253: when he spoke to his father on the subject.
3254: 
3255: Of course it was when the rector was alone in his study. Their mother
3256: would become reconciled to whatever he decided on, but mentioned to her
3257: first, the question would have distressed her.
3258: 
3259: “Well, my children!” said Mr. Gascoigne, cheerfully, as they entered.
3260: It was a comfort to see Rex about again.
3261: 
3262: “May we sit down with you a little, papa?” said Anna. “Rex has
3263: something to say.”
3264: 
3265: “With all my heart.”
3266: 
3267: It was a noticeable group that these three creatures made, each of them
3268: with a face of the same structural type—the straight brow, the nose
3269: suddenly straightened from an intention of being aquiline, the short
3270: upper lip, the short but strong and well-hung chin: there was even the
3271: same tone of complexion and set of the eye. The gray-haired father was
3272: at once massive and keen-looking; there was a perpendicular line in his
3273: brow which when he spoke with any force of interest deepened; and the
3274: habit of ruling gave him an air of reserved authoritativeness. Rex
3275: would have seemed a vision of his father’s youth, if it had been
3276: possible to imagine Mr. Gascoigne without distinct plans and without
3277: command, smitten with a heart sorrow, and having no more notion of
3278: concealment than a sick animal; and Anna was a tiny copy of Rex, with
3279: hair drawn back and knotted, her face following his in its changes of
3280: expression, as if they had one soul between them.
3281: 
3282: “You know all about what has upset me, father,” Rex began, and Mr.
3283: Gascoigne nodded.
3284: 
3285: “I am quite done up for life in this part of the world. I am sure it
3286: will be no use my going back to Oxford. I couldn’t do any reading. I
3287: should fail, and cause you expense for nothing. I want to have your
3288: consent to take another course, sir.”
3289: 
3290: Mr. Gascoigne nodded more slowly, the perpendicular line on his brow
3291: deepened, and Anna’s trembling increased.
3292: 
3293: “If you would allow me a small outfit, I should like to go to the
3294: colonies and work on the land there.” Rex thought the vagueness of the
3295: phrase prudential; “the colonies” necessarily embracing more
3296: advantages, and being less capable of being rebutted on a single ground
3297: than any particular settlement.
3298: 
3299: “Oh, and with me, papa,” said Anna, not bearing to be left out from the
3300: proposal even temporarily. “Rex would want some one to take care of
3301: him, you know—some one to keep house. And we shall never, either of
3302: us, be married. And I should cost nothing, and I should be so happy. I
3303: know it would be hard to leave you and mamma; but there are all the
3304: others to bring up, and we two should be no trouble to you any more.”
3305: 
3306: Anna had risen from her seat, and used the feminine argument of going
3307: closer to her papa as she spoke. He did not smile, but he drew her on
3308: his knee and held her there, as if to put her gently out of the
3309: question while he spoke to Rex.
3310: 
3311: “You will admit that my experience gives me some power of judging for
3312: you, and that I can probably guide you in practical matters better than
3313: you can guide yourself?”
3314: 
3315: Rex was obliged to say, “Yes, sir.”
3316: 
3317: “And perhaps you will admit—though I don’t wish to press that
3318: point—that you are bound in duty to consider my judgment and wishes?”
3319: 
3320: “I have never yet placed myself in opposition to you, sir.” Rex in his
3321: secret soul could not feel that he was bound not to go to the colonies,
3322: but to go to Oxford again—which was the point in question.
3323: 
3324: “But you will do so if you persist in setting your mind toward a rash
3325: and foolish procedure, and deafening yourself to considerations which
3326: my experience of life assures me of. You think, I suppose, that you
3327: have had a shock which has changed all your inclinations, stupefied
3328: your brains, unfitted you for anything but manual labor, and given you
3329: a dislike to society? Is that what you believe?”
3330: 
3331: “Something like that. I shall never be up to the sort of work I must do
3332: to live in this part of the world. I have not the spirit for it. I
3333: shall never be the same again. And without any disrespect to you,
3334: father, I think a young fellow should be allowed to choose his way of
3335: life, if he does nobody any harm. There are plenty to stay at home, and
3336: those who like might be allowed to go where there are empty places.”
3337: 
3338: “But suppose I am convinced on good evidence—as I am—that this state
3339: of mind of yours is transient, and that if you went off as you propose,
3340: you would by-and-by repent, and feel that you had let yourself slip
3341: back from the point you have been gaining by your education till now?
3342: Have you not strength of mind enough to see that you had better act on
3343: my assurance for a time, and test it? In my opinion, so far from
3344: agreeing with you that you should be free to turn yourself into a
3345: colonist and work in your shirt-sleeves with spade and hatchet—in my
3346: opinion you have no right whatever to expatriate yourself until you
3347: have honestly endeavored to turn to account the education you have
3348: received here. I say nothing of the grief to your mother and me.”
3349: 
3350: “I’m very sorry; but what can I do? I can’t study—that’s certain,”
3351: said Rex.
3352: 
3353: “Not just now, perhaps. You will have to miss a term. I have made
3354: arrangements for you—how you are to spend the next two months. But I
3355: confess I am disappointed in you, Rex. I thought you had more sense
3356: than to take up such ideas—to suppose that because you have fallen
3357: into a very common trouble, such as most men have to go through, you
3358: are loosened from all bonds of duty—just as if your brain had softened
3359: and you were no longer a responsible being.”
3360: 
3361: What could Rex say? Inwardly he was in a state of rebellion, but he had
3362: no arguments to meet his father’s; and while he was feeling, in spite
3363: of any thing that might be said, that he should like to go off to “the
3364: colonies” to-morrow, it lay in a deep fold of his consciousness that he
3365: ought to feel—if he had been a better fellow he would have felt—more
3366: about his old ties. This is the sort of faith we live by in our soul
3367: sicknesses.
3368: 
3369: Rex got up from his seat, as if he held the conference to be at an end.
3370: “You assent to my arrangement, then?” said Mr. Gascoigne, with that
3371: distinct resolution of tone which seems to hold one in a vise.
3372: 
3373: There was a little pause before Rex answered, “I’ll try what I can do,
3374: sir. I can’t promise.” His thought was, that trying would be of no use.
3375: 
3376: Her father kept Anna, holding her fast, though she wanted to follow
3377: Rex. “Oh, papa,” she said, the tears coming with her words when the
3378: door had closed; “it is very hard for him. Doesn’t he look ill?”
3379: 
3380: “Yes, but he will soon be better; it will all blow over. And now, Anna,
3381: be as quiet as a mouse about it all. Never let it be mentioned when he
3382: is gone.”
3383: 
3384: “No, papa. But I would not be like Gwendolen for any thing—to have
3385: people fall in love with me so. It is very dreadful.”
3386: 
3387: Anna dared not say that she was disappointed at not being allowed to go
3388: to the colonies with Rex; but that was her secret feeling, and she
3389: often afterward went inwardly over the whole affair, saying to herself,
3390: “I should have done with going out, and gloves, and crinoline, and
3391: having to talk when I am taken to dinner—and all that!”
3392: 
3393: I like to mark the time, and connect the course of individual lives
3394: with the historic stream, for all classes of thinkers. This was the
3395: period when the broadening of gauge in crinolines seemed to demand an
3396: agitation for the general enlargement of churches, ball-rooms, and
3397: vehicles. But Anna Gascoigne’s figure would only allow the size of
3398: skirt manufactured for young ladies of fourteen.
3399: 
3400: 
3401: 
3402: 
3403: CHAPTER IX.
3404: 
3405:   I’ll tell thee, Berthold, what men’s hopes are like:
3406:   A silly child that, quivering with joy,
3407:   Would cast its little mimic fishing-line
3408:   Baited with loadstone for a bowl of toys
3409:   In the salt ocean.
3410: 
3411: 
3412: Eight months after the arrival of the family at Offendene, that is to
3413: say in the end of the following June, a rumor was spread in the
3414: neighborhood which to many persons was matter of exciting interest. It
3415: had no reference to the results of the American war, but it was one
3416: which touched all classes within a certain circuit round Wanchester:
3417: the corn-factors, the brewers, the horse-dealers, and saddlers, all
3418: held it a laudable thing, and one which was to be rejoiced in on
3419: abstract grounds, as showing the value of an aristocracy in a free
3420: country like England; the blacksmith in the hamlet of Diplow felt that
3421: a good time had come round; the wives of laboring men hoped their
3422: nimble boys of ten or twelve would be taken into employ by the
3423: gentlemen in livery; and the farmers about Diplow admitted, with a
3424: tincture of bitterness and reserve, that a man might now again perhaps
3425: have an easier market or exchange for a rick of old hay or a wagon-load
3426: of straw. If such were the hopes of low persons not in society, it may
3427: be easily inferred that their betters had better reasons for
3428: satisfaction, probably connected with the pleasures of life rather than
3429: its business. Marriage, however, must be considered as coming under
3430: both heads; and just as when a visit of majesty is announced, the dream
3431: of knighthood or a baronetcy is to be found under various municipal
3432: nightcaps, so the news in question raised a floating indeterminate
3433: vision of marriage in several well-bred imaginations.
3434: 
3435: The news was that Diplow Hall, Sir Hugo Mallinger’s place, which had
3436: for a couple of years turned its white window-shutters in a painfully
3437: wall-eyed manner on its fine elms and beeches, its lilied pool and
3438: grassy acres specked with deer, was being prepared for a tenant, and
3439: was for the rest of the summer and through the hunting season to be
3440: inhabited in a fitting style both as to house and stable. But not by
3441: Sir Hugo himself: by his nephew, Mr. Mallinger Grandcourt, who was
3442: presumptive heir to the baronetcy, his uncle’s marriage having produced
3443: nothing but girls. Nor was this the only contingency with which fortune
3444: flattered young Grandcourt, as he was pleasantly called; for while the
3445: chance of the baronetcy came through his father, his mother had given a
3446: baronial streak to his blood, so that if certain intervening persons
3447: slightly painted in the middle distance died, he would become a baron
3448: and peer of this realm.
3449: 
3450: It is the uneven allotment of nature that the male bird alone has the
3451: tuft, but we have not yet followed the advice of hasty philosophers who
3452: would have us copy nature entirely in these matters; and if Mr.
3453: Mallinger Grandcourt became a baronet or a peer, his wife would share
3454: the title—which in addition to his actual fortune was certainly a
3455: reason why that wife, being at present unchosen, should be thought of
3456: by more than one person with a sympathetic interest as a woman sure to
3457: be well provided for.
3458: 
3459: Some readers of this history will doubtless regard it as incredible
3460: that people should construct matrimonial prospects on the mere report
3461: that a bachelor of good fortune and possibilities was coming within
3462: reach, and will reject the statement as a mere outflow of gall: they
3463: will aver that neither they nor their first cousins have minds so
3464: unbridled; and that in fact this is not human nature, which would know
3465: that such speculations might turn out to be fallacious, and would
3466: therefore not entertain them. But, let it be observed, nothing is here
3467: narrated of human nature generally: the history in its present stage
3468: concerns only a few people in a corner of Wessex—whose reputation,
3469: however, was unimpeached, and who, I am in the proud position of being
3470: able to state, were all on visiting terms with persons of rank.
3471: 
3472: There were the Arrowpoints, for example, in their beautiful place at
3473: Quetcham: no one could attribute sordid views in relation to their
3474: daughter’s marriage to parents who could leave her at least half a
3475: million; but having affectionate anxieties about their Catherine’s
3476: position (she having resolutely refused Lord Slogan, an unexceptionable
3477: Irish peer, whose estate wanted nothing but drainage and population),
3478: they wondered, perhaps from something more than a charitable impulse,
3479: whether Mr. Grandcourt was good-looking, of sound constitution,
3480: virtuous, or at least reformed, and if liberal-conservative, not too
3481: liberal-conservative; and without wishing anybody to die, thought his
3482: succession to the title an event to be desired.
3483: 
3484: If the Arrowpoints had such ruminations, it is the less surprising that
3485: they were stimulated in Mr. Gascoigne, who for being a clergyman was
3486: not the less subject to the anxieties of a parent and guardian; and we
3487: have seen how both he and Mrs. Gascoigne might by this time have come
3488: to feel that he was overcharged with the management of young creatures
3489: who were hardly to be held in with bit or bridle, or any sort of
3490: metaphor that would stand for judicious advice.
3491: 
3492: Naturally, people did not tell each other all they felt and thought
3493: about young Grandcourt’s advent: on no subject is this openness found
3494: prudently practicable—not even on the generation of acids, or the
3495: destination of the fixed stars: for either your contemporary with a
3496: mind turned toward the same subjects may find your ideas ingenious and
3497: forestall you in applying them, or he may have other views on acids and
3498: fixed stars, and think ill of you in consequence. Mr. Gascoigne did not
3499: ask Mr. Arrowpoint if he had any trustworthy source of information
3500: about Grandcourt considered as a husband for a charming girl; nor did
3501: Mrs. Arrowpoint observe to Mrs. Davilow that if the possible peer
3502: sought a wife in the neighborhood of Diplow, the only reasonable
3503: expectation was that he would offer his hand to Catherine, who,
3504: however, would not accept him unless he were in all respects fitted to
3505: secure her happiness. Indeed, even to his wife the rector was silent as
3506: to the contemplation of any matrimonial result, from the probability
3507: that Mr. Grandcourt would see Gwendolen at the next Archery Meeting;
3508: though Mrs. Gascoigne’s mind was very likely still more active in the
3509: same direction. She had said interjectionally to her sister, “It would
3510: be a mercy, Fanny, if that girl were well married!” to which Mrs.
3511: Davilow discerning some criticism of her darling in the fervor of that
3512: wish, had not chosen to make any audible reply, though she had said
3513: inwardly, “You will not get her to marry for your pleasure”; the mild
3514: mother becoming rather saucy when she identified herself with her
3515: daughter.
3516: 
3517: To her husband Mrs. Gascoigne said, “I hear Mr. Grandcourt has got two
3518: places of his own, but he comes to Diplow for the hunting. It is to be
3519: hoped he will set a good example in the neighborhood. Have you heard
3520: what sort of a young man he is, Henry?”
3521: 
3522: Mr. Gascoigne had not heard; at least, if his male acquaintances had
3523: gossiped in his hearing, he was not disposed to repeat their gossip, or
3524: to give it any emphasis in his own mind. He held it futile, even if it
3525: had been becoming, to show any curiosity as to the past of a young man
3526: whose birth, wealth, and consequent leisure made many habits venial
3527: which under other circumstances would have been inexcusable. Whatever
3528: Grandcourt had done, he had not ruined himself; and it is well-known
3529: that in gambling, for example, whether of the business or holiday sort,
3530: a man who has the strength of mind to leave off when he has only ruined
3531: others, is a reformed character. This is an illustration merely: Mr.
3532: Gascoigne had not heard that Grandcourt had been a gambler; and we can
3533: hardly pronounce him singular in feeling that a landed proprietor with
3534: a mixture of noble blood in his veins was not to be an object of
3535: suspicious inquiry like a reformed character who offers himself as your
3536: butler or footman. Reformation, where a man can afford to do without
3537: it, can hardly be other than genuine. Moreover, it was not certain on
3538: any other showing hitherto, that Mr. Grandcourt had needed reformation
3539: more than other young men in the ripe youth of five-and-thirty; and, at
3540: any rate, the significance of what he had been must be determined by
3541: what he actually was.
3542: 
3543: Mrs. Davilow, too, although she would not respond to her sister’s
3544: pregnant remark, could not be inwardly indifferent to an advent that
3545: might promise a brilliant lot for Gwendolen. A little speculation on
3546: “what may be” comes naturally, without encouragement—comes inevitably
3547: in the form of images, when unknown persons are mentioned; and Mr.
3548: Grandcourt’s name raised in Mrs. Davilow’s mind first of all the
3549: picture of a handsome, accomplished, excellent young man whom she would
3550: be satisfied with as a husband for her daughter; but then came the
3551: further speculation—would Gwendolen be satisfied with him? There was
3552: no knowing what would meet that girl’s taste or touch her
3553: affections—it might be something else than excellence; and thus the
3554: image of the perfect suitor gave way before a fluctuating combination
3555: of qualities that might be imagined to win Gwendolen’s heart. In the
3556: difficulty of arriving at the particular combination which would insure
3557: that result, the mother even said to herself, “It would not signify
3558: about her being in love, if she would only accept the right person.”
3559: For whatever marriage had been for herself, how could she the less
3560: desire it for her daughter? The difference her own misfortunes made
3561: was, that she never dared to dwell much to Gwendolen on the
3562: desirableness of marriage, dreading an answer something like that of
3563: the future Madame Roland, when her gentle mother urging the acceptance
3564: of a suitor, said, “Tu seras heureuse, ma chère.” “Oui, maman, comme
3565: toi.”
3566: 
3567: In relation to the problematic Mr. Grandcourt least of all would Mrs.
3568: Davilow have willingly let fall a hint of the aerial castle-building
3569: which she had the good taste to be ashamed of; for such a hint was
3570: likely enough to give an adverse poise to Gwendolen’s own thought, and
3571: make her detest the desirable husband beforehand. Since that scene
3572: after poor Rex’s farewell visit, the mother had felt a new sense of
3573: peril in touching the mystery of her child’s feeling, and in rashly
3574: determining what was her welfare: only she could think of welfare in no
3575: other shape than marriage.
3576: 
3577: The discussion of the dress that Gwendolen was to wear at the Archery
3578: Meeting was a relevant topic, however; and when it had been decided
3579: that as a touch of color on her white cashmere, nothing, for her
3580: complexion, was comparable to pale green—a feather which she was
3581: trying in her hat before the looking-glass having settled the
3582: question—Mrs. Davilow felt her ears tingle when Gwendolen, suddenly
3583: throwing herself into the attitude of drawing her bow, said with a look
3584: of comic enjoyment,
3585: 
3586: “How I pity all the other girls at the Archery Meeting—all thinking of
3587: Mr. Grandcourt! And they have not a shadow of a chance.”
3588: 
3589: Mrs. Davilow had not the presence of mind to answer immediately, and
3590: Gwendolen turned round quickly toward her, saying, wickedly,
3591: 
3592: “Now you know they have not, mamma. You and my uncle and aunt—you all
3593: intend him to fall in love with me.”
3594: 
3595: Mrs. Davilow, piqued into a little stratagem, said, “Oh, my dear, that
3596: is not so certain. Miss Arrowpoint has charms which you have not.”
3597: 
3598: “I know, but they demand thought. My arrow will pierce him before he
3599: has time for thought. He will declare himself my slave—I shall send
3600: him round the world to bring me back the wedding ring of a happy
3601: woman—in the meantime all the men who are between him and the title
3602: will die of different diseases—he will come back Lord Grandcourt—but
3603: without the ring—and fall at my feet. I shall laugh at him—he will
3604: rise in resentment—I shall laugh more—he will call for his steed and
3605: ride to Quetcham, where he will find Miss Arrowpoint just married to a
3606: needy musician, Mrs. Arrowpoint tearing her cap off, and Mr. Arrowpoint
3607: standing by. Exit Lord Grandcourt, who returns to Diplow, and, like M.
3608: Jabot, _change de linge_.”
3609: 
3610: Was ever any young witch like this? You thought of hiding things from
3611: her—sat upon your secret and looked innocent, and all the while she
3612: knew by the corner of your eye that it was exactly five pounds ten you
3613: were sitting on! As well turn the key to keep out the damp! It was
3614: probable that by dint of divination she already knew more than any one
3615: else did of Mr. Grandcourt. That idea in Mrs. Davilow’s mind prompted
3616: the sort of question which often comes without any other apparent
3617: reason than the faculty of speech and the not knowing what to do with
3618: it.
3619: 
3620: “Why, what kind of a man do you imagine him to be, Gwendolen?”
3621: 
3622: “Let me see!” said the witch, putting her forefinger to her lips, with
3623: a little frown, and then stretching out the finger with decision.
3624: “Short—just above my shoulder—trying to make himself tall by turning
3625: up his mustache and keeping his beard long—a glass in his right eye to
3626: give him an air of distinction—a strong opinion about his waistcoat,
3627: but uncertain and trimming about the weather, on which he will try to
3628: draw me out. He will stare at me all the while, and the glass in his
3629: eye will cause him to make horrible faces, especially when he smiles in
3630: a flattering way. I shall cast down my eyes in consequence, and he will
3631: perceive that I am not indifferent to his attentions. I shall dream
3632: that night that I am looking at the extraordinary face of a magnified
3633: insect—and the next morning he will make an offer of his hand; the
3634: sequel as before.”
3635: 
3636: “That is a portrait of some one you have seen already, Gwen. Mr.
3637: Grandcourt may be a delightful young man for what you know.”
3638: 
3639: “Oh, yes,” said Gwendolen, with a high note of careless admission,
3640: taking off her best hat and turning it round on her hand
3641: contemplatively. “I wonder what sort of behavior a delightful young man
3642: would have? I know he would have hunters and racers, and a London house
3643: and two country-houses—one with battlements and another with a
3644: veranda. And I feel sure that with a little murdering he might get a
3645: title.”
3646: 
3647: The irony of this speech was of the doubtful sort that has some genuine
3648: belief mixed up with it. Poor Mrs. Davilow felt uncomfortable under it.
3649: Her own meanings being usually literal and in intention innocent; and
3650: she said with a distressed brow:
3651: 
3652: “Don’t talk in that way, child, for heaven’s sake! you do read such
3653: books—they give you such ideas of everything. I declare when your aunt
3654: and I were your age we knew nothing about wickedness. I think it was
3655: better so.”
3656: 
3657: “Why did you not bring me up in that way, mamma?” said Gwendolen. But
3658: immediately perceiving in the crushed look and rising sob that she had
3659: given a deep wound, she tossed down her hat and knelt at her mother’s
3660: feet crying,
3661: 
3662: “Mamma, mamma! I was only speaking in fun. I meant nothing.”
3663: 
3664: “How could I, Gwendolen?” said poor Mrs. Davilow, unable to hear the
3665: retraction, and sobbing violently while she made the effort to speak.
3666: “Your will was always too strong for me—if everything else had been
3667: different.”
3668: 
3669: This disjoined logic was intelligible enough to the daughter. “Dear
3670: mamma, I don’t find fault with you—I love you,” said Gwendolen, really
3671: compunctious. “How can you help what I am? Besides, I am very charming.
3672: Come, now.” Here Gwendolen with her handkerchief gently rubbed away her
3673: mother’s tears. “Really—I am contented with myself. I like myself
3674: better than I should have liked my aunt and you. How dreadfully dull
3675: you must have been!”
3676: 
3677: Such tender cajolery served to quiet the mother, as it had often done
3678: before after like collisions. Not that the collisions had often been
3679: repeated at the same point; for in the memory of both they left an
3680: association of dread with the particular topics which had occasioned
3681: them: Gwendolen dreaded the unpleasant sense of compunction toward her
3682: mother, which was the nearest approach to self-condemnation and
3683: self-distrust that she had known; and Mrs. Davilow’s timid maternal
3684: conscience dreaded whatever had brought on the slightest hint of
3685: reproach. Hence, after this little scene, the two concurred in
3686: excluding Mr. Grandcourt from their conversation.
3687: 
3688: When Mr. Gascoigne once or twice referred to him, Mrs. Davilow feared
3689: least Gwendolen should betray some of her alarming keen-sightedness
3690: about what was probably in her uncle’s mind; but the fear was not
3691: justified. Gwendolen knew certain differences in the characters with
3692: which she was concerned as birds know climate and weather; and for the
3693: very reason that she was determined to evade her uncle’s control, she
3694: was determined not to clash with him. The good understanding between
3695: them was much fostered by their enjoyment of archery together: Mr.
3696: Gascoigne, as one of the best bowmen in Wessex, was gratified to find
3697: the elements of like skill in his niece; and Gwendolen was the more
3698: careful not to lose the shelter of his fatherly indulgence, because
3699: since the trouble with Rex both Mrs. Gascoigne and Anna had been unable
3700: to hide what she felt to be a very unreasonable alienation from her.
3701: Toward Anna she took some pains to behave with a regretful
3702: affectionateness; but neither of them dared to mention Rex’s name, and
3703: Anna, to whom the thought of him was part of the air she breathed, was
3704: ill at ease with the lively cousin who had ruined his happiness. She
3705: tried dutifully to repress any sign of her changed feeling; but who in
3706: pain can imitate the glance and hand-touch of pleasure.
3707: 
3708: This unfair resentment had rather a hardening effect on Gwendolen, and
3709: threw her into a more defiant temper. Her uncle too might be offended
3710: if she refused the next person who fell in love with her; and one day
3711: when that idea was in her mind she said,
3712: 
3713: “Mamma, I see now why girls are glad to be married—to escape being
3714: expected to please everybody but themselves.”
3715: 
3716: Happily, Mr. Middleton was gone without having made any avowal; and
3717: notwithstanding the admiration for the handsome Miss Harleth, extending
3718: perhaps over thirty square miles in a part of Wessex well studded with
3719: families whose numbers included several disengaged young men, each glad
3720: to seat himself by the lively girl with whom it was so easy to get on
3721: in conversation,—notwithstanding these grounds for arguing that
3722: Gwendolen was likely to have other suitors more explicit than the
3723: cautious curate, the fact was not so.
3724: 
3725: Care has been taken not only that the trees should not sweep the stars
3726: down, but also that every man who admires a fair girl should not be
3727: enamored of her, and even that every man who is enamored should not
3728: necessarily declare himself. There are various refined shapes in which
3729: the price of corn, known to be potent cause in their relation, might,
3730: if inquired into, show why a young lady, perfect in person,
3731: accomplishments, and costume, has not the trouble of rejecting many
3732: offers; and nature’s order is certainly benignant in not obliging us
3733: one and all to be desperately in love with the most admirable mortal we
3734: have ever seen. Gwendolen, we know, was far from holding that supremacy
3735: in the minds of all observers. Besides, it was but a poor eight months
3736: since she had come to Offendene, and some inclinations become manifest
3737: slowly, like the sunward creeping of plants.
3738: 
3739: In face of this fact that not one of the eligible young men already in
3740: the neighborhood had made Gwendolen an offer, why should Mr. Grandcourt
3741: be thought of as likely to do what they had left undone?
3742: 
3743: Perhaps because he was thought of as still more eligible; since a great
3744: deal of what passes for likelihood in the world is simply the reflex of
3745: a wish. Mr. and Mrs. Arrowpoint, for example, having no anxiety that
3746: Miss Harleth should make a brilliant marriage, had quite a different
3747: likelihood in their minds.
3748: 
3749: 
3750: 
3751: 
3752: CHAPTER X.
3753: 
3754:   _1st Gent._ What woman should be? Sir, consult the taste
3755:                    Of marriageable men. This planet’s store
3756:                    In iron, cotton, wool, or chemicals—
3757:                    All matter rendered to our plastic skill,
3758:                    Is wrought in shapes responsive to demand;
3759:                    The market’s pulse makes index high or low,
3760:                    By rule sublime. Our daughters must be wives,
3761:                    And to the wives must be what men will choose;
3762:                    Men’s taste is woman’s test. You mark the phrase?
3763:                    ’Tis good, I think?—the sense well-winged and poised
3764:                    With t’s and s’s.
3765:   _2nd Gent._                      Nay, but turn it round;
3766:                    Give us the test of taste. A fine _menu_—
3767:                    Is it to-day what Roman epicures
3768:                    Insisted that a gentleman must eat
3769:                    To earn the dignity of dining well?
3770: 
3771: 
3772: Brackenshaw Park, where the archery meeting was held, looked out from
3773: its gentle heights far over the neighboring valley to the outlying
3774: eastern downs and the broad, slow rise of cultivated country, hanging
3775: like a vast curtain toward the west. The castle which stood on the
3776: highest platform of the clustered hills, was built of rough-hewn
3777: limestone, full of lights and shadows made by the dark dust of lichens
3778: and the washings of the rain. Masses of beech and fir sheltered it on
3779: the north, and spread down here and there along the green slopes like
3780: flocks seeking the water which gleamed below. The archery-ground was a
3781: carefully-kept enclosure on a bit of table-land at the farthest end of
3782: the park, protected toward the south-west by tall elms and a thick
3783: screen of hollies, which kept the gravel walk and the bit of newly-mown
3784: turf where the targets were placed in agreeable afternoon shade. The
3785: Archery Hall with an arcade in front showed like a white temple against
3786: the greenery on the north side.
3787: 
3788: What could make a better background for the flower-groups of ladies,
3789: moving and bowing and turning their necks as it would become the
3790: leisurely lilies to do if they took to locomotion. The sounds too were
3791: very pleasant to hear, even when the military band from Wanchester
3792: ceased to play: musical laughs in all the registers and a harmony of
3793: happy, friendly speeches, now rising toward mild excitement, now
3794: sinking to an agreeable murmur.
3795: 
3796: No open-air amusement could be much freer from those noisy, crowding
3797: conditions which spoil most modern pleasures; no Archery Meeting could
3798: be more select, the number of friends accompanying the members being
3799: restricted by an award of tickets, so as to keep the maximum within the
3800: limits of convenience for the dinner and ball to be held in the castle.
3801: Within the enclosure no plebeian spectators were admitted except Lord
3802: Brackenshaw’s tenants and their families, and of these it was chiefly
3803: the feminine members who used the privilege, bringing their little boys
3804: and girls or younger brothers and sisters. The males among them
3805: relieved the insipidity of the entertainment by imaginative betting, in
3806: which the stake was “anything you like,” on their favorite archers; but
3807: the young maidens, having a different principle of discrimination, were
3808: considering which of those sweetly-dressed ladies they would choose to
3809: be, if the choice were allowed them. Probably the form these rural
3810: souls would most have striven for as a tabernacle, was some other than
3811: Gwendolen’s—one with more pink in her cheeks and hair of the most
3812: fashionable yellow; but among the male judges in the ranks immediately
3813: surrounding her there was unusual unanimity in pronouncing her the
3814: finest girl present.
3815: 
3816: No wonder she enjoyed her existence on that July day. Pre-eminence is
3817: sweet to those who love it, even under mediocre circumstances. Perhaps
3818: it was not quite mythical that a slave has been proud to be bought
3819: first; and probably a barn-door fowl on sale, though he may not have
3820: understood himself to be called the best of a bad lot, may have a
3821: self-informed consciousness of his relative importance, and strut
3822: consoled. But for complete enjoyment the outward and the inward must
3823: concur. And that concurrence was happening to Gwendolen.
3824: 
3825: Who can deny that bows and arrows are among the prettiest weapons in
3826: the world for feminine forms to play with? They prompt attitudes full
3827: of grace and power, where that fine concentration of energy seen in all
3828: markmanship, is freed from associations of bloodshed. The time-honored
3829: British resource of “killing something” is no longer carried on with
3830: bow and quiver; bands defending their passes against an invading nation
3831: fight under another sort of shade than a cloud of arrows; and poisoned
3832: darts are harmless survivals either in rhetoric or in regions
3833: comfortably remote. Archery has no ugly smell of brimstone; breaks
3834: nobody’s shins, breeds no athletic monsters; its only danger is that of
3835: failing, which for generous blood is enough to mould skilful action.
3836: And among the Brackenshaw archers the prizes were all of the nobler
3837: symbolic kind; not properly to be carried off in a parcel, degrading
3838: honor into gain; but the gold arrow and the silver, the gold star and
3839: the silver, to be worn for a long time in sign of achievement and then
3840: transferred to the next who did excellently. These signs of
3841: pre-eminence had the virtue of wreaths without their inconveniences,
3842: which might have produced a melancholy effect in the heat of the
3843: ball-room. Altogether the Brackenshaw Archery Club was an institution
3844: framed with good taste, so as not to have by necessity any ridiculous
3845: incidents.
3846: 
3847: And to-day all incalculable elements were in its favor. There was mild
3848: warmth, and no wind to disturb either hair or drapery or the course of
3849: the arrow; all skillful preparation had fair play, and when there was a
3850: general march to extract the arrows, the promenade of joyous young
3851: creatures in light speech and laughter, the graceful movement in common
3852: toward a common object, was a show worth looking at. Here Gwendolen
3853: seemed a Calypso among her nymphs. It was in her attitudes and
3854: movements that every one was obliged to admit her surpassing charm.
3855: 
3856: “That girl is like a high-mettled racer,” said Lord Brackenshaw to
3857: young Clintock, one of the invited spectators.
3858: 
3859: “First chop! tremendously pretty too,” said the elegant Grecian, who
3860: had been paying her assiduous attention; “I never saw her look better.”
3861: 
3862: Perhaps she had never looked so well. Her face was beaming with young
3863: pleasure in which there was no malign rays of discontent; for being
3864: satisfied with her own chances, she felt kindly toward everybody and
3865: was satisfied with the universe. Not to have the highest distinction in
3866: rank, not to be marked out as an heiress, like Miss Arrowpoint, gave an
3867: added triumph in eclipsing those advantages. For personal
3868: recommendation she would not have cared to change the family group
3869: accompanying her for any other: her mamma’s appearance would have
3870: suited an amiable duchess; her uncle and aunt Gascoigne with Anna made
3871: equally gratifying figures in their way; and Gwendolen was too full of
3872: joyous belief in herself to feel in the least jealous though Miss
3873: Arrowpoint was one of the best archeresses.
3874: 
3875: Even the reappearance of the formidable Herr Klesmer, which caused some
3876: surprise in the rest of the company, seemed only to fall in with
3877: Gwendolen’s inclination to be amused. Short of Apollo himself, what
3878: great musical _maestro_ could make a good figure at an archery meeting?
3879: There was a very satirical light in Gwendolen’s eyes as she looked
3880: toward the Arrowpoint party on their first entrance, when the contrast
3881: between Klesmer and the average group of English country people seemed
3882: at its utmost intensity in the close neighborhood of his hosts—or
3883: patrons, as Mrs. Arrowpoint would have liked to hear them called, that
3884: she might deny the possibility of any longer patronizing genius, its
3885: royalty being universally acknowledged. The contrast might have amused
3886: a graver personage than Gwendolen. We English are a miscellaneous
3887: people, and any chance fifty of us will present many varieties of
3888: animal architecture or facial ornament; but it must be admitted that
3889: our prevailing expression is not that of a lively, impassioned race,
3890: preoccupied with the ideal and carrying the real as a mere make-weight.
3891: The strong point of the English gentleman pure is the easy style of his
3892: figure and clothing; he objects to marked ins and outs in his costume,
3893: and he also objects to looking inspired.
3894: 
3895: Fancy an assemblage where the men had all that ordinary stamp of the
3896: well-bred Englishman, watching the entrance of Herr Klesmer—his mane
3897: of hair floating backward in massive inconsistency with the chimney-pot
3898: hat, which had the look of having been put on for a joke above his
3899: pronounced but well-modeled features and powerful clear-shaven mouth
3900: and chin; his tall, thin figure clad in a way which, not being strictly
3901: English, was all the worse for its apparent emphasis of intention.
3902: Draped in a loose garment with a Florentine _berretta_ on his head, he
3903: would have been fit to stand by the side of Leonardo de Vinci; but how
3904: when he presented himself in trousers which were not what English
3905: feeling demanded about the knees?—and when the fire that showed itself
3906: in his glances and the movements of his head, as he looked round him
3907: with curiosity, was turned into comedy by a hat which ruled that
3908: mankind should have well-cropped hair and a staid demeanor, such, for
3909: example, as Mr. Arrowsmith’s, whose nullity of face and perfect
3910: tailoring might pass everywhere without ridicule? One feels why it is
3911: often better for greatness to be dead, and to have got rid of the
3912: outward man.
3913: 
3914: Many present knew Klesmer, or knew of him; but they had only seen him
3915: on candle-light occasions when he appeared simply as a musician, and he
3916: had not yet that supreme, world-wide celebrity which makes an artist
3917: great to the most ordinary people by their knowledge of his great
3918: expensiveness. It was literally a new light for them to see him
3919: in—presented unexpectedly on this July afternoon in an exclusive
3920: society: some were inclined to laugh, others felt a little disgust at
3921: the want of judgment shown by the Arrowpoints in this use of an
3922: introductory card.
3923: 
3924: “What extreme guys those artistic fellows usually are!” said young
3925: Clintock to Gwendolen. “Do look at the figure he cuts, bowing with his
3926: hand on his heart to Lady Brackenshaw—and Mrs. Arrowpoint’s feather
3927: just reaching his shoulder.”
3928: 
3929: “You are one of the profane,” said Gwendolen. “You are blind to the
3930: majesty of genius. Herr Klesmer smites me with awe; I feel crushed in
3931: his presence; my courage all oozes from me.”
3932: 
3933: “Ah, you understand all about his music.”
3934: 
3935: “No, indeed,” said Gwendolen, with a light laugh; “it is he who
3936: understands all about mine and thinks it pitiable.” Klesmer’s verdict
3937: on her singing had been an easier joke to her since he had been struck
3938: by her _plastik_.
3939: 
3940: “It is not addressed to the ears of the future, I suppose. I’m glad of
3941: that: it suits mine.”
3942: 
3943: “Oh, you are very kind. But how remarkably well Miss Arrowpoint looks
3944: to-day! She would make quite a fine picture in that gold-colored dress.”
3945: 
3946: “Too splendid, don’t you think?”
3947: 
3948: “Well, perhaps a little too symbolical—too much like the figure of
3949: Wealth in an allegory.”
3950: 
3951: This speech of Gwendolen’s had rather a malicious sound, but it was not
3952: really more than a bubble of fun. She did not wish Miss Arrowpoint or
3953: any one else to be out of the way, believing in her own good fortune
3954: even more than in her skill. The belief in both naturally grew stronger
3955: as the shooting went on, for she promised to achieve one of the best
3956: scores—a success which astonished every one in a new member; and to
3957: Gwendolen’s temperament one success determined another. She trod on
3958: air, and all things pleasant seemed possible. The hour was enough for
3959: her, and she was not obliged to think what she should do next to keep
3960: her life at the due pitch.
3961: 
3962: “How does the scoring stand, I wonder?” said Lady Brackenshaw, a
3963: gracious personage who, adorned with two little girls and a boy of
3964: stout make, sat as lady paramount. Her lord had come up to her in one
3965: of the intervals of shooting. “It seems to me that Miss Harleth is
3966: likely to win the gold arrow.”
3967: 
3968: “Gad, I think she will, if she carries it on! she is running Juliet
3969: Fenn hard. It is wonderful for one in her first year. Catherine is not
3970: up to her usual mark,” continued his lordship, turning to the heiress’s
3971: mother who sat near. “But she got the gold arrow last time. And there’s
3972: a luck even in these games of skill. That’s better. It gives the hinder
3973: ones a chance.”
3974: 
3975: “Catherine will be very glad for others to win,” said Mrs. Arrowpoint,
3976: “she is so magnanimous. It was entirely her considerateness that made
3977: us bring Herr Klesmer instead of Canon Stopley, who had expressed a
3978: wish to come. For her own pleasure, I am sure she would rather have
3979: brought the Canon; but she is always thinking of others. I told her it
3980: was not quite _en règle_ to bring one so far out of our own set; but
3981: she said, ‘Genius itself is not _en règle_; it comes into the world to
3982: make new rules.’ And one must admit that.”
3983: 
3984: “Ay, to be sure,” said Lord Brackenshaw, in a tone of careless
3985: dismissal, adding quickly, “For my part, I am not magnanimous; I should
3986: like to win. But, confound it! I never have the chance now. I’m getting
3987: old and idle. The young ones beat me. As old Nestor says—the gods
3988: don’t give us everything at one time: I was a young fellow once, and
3989: now I am getting an old and wise one. Old, at any rate; which is a gift
3990: that comes to everybody if they live long enough, so it raises no
3991: jealousy.” The Earl smiled comfortably at his wife.
3992: 
3993: “Oh, my lord, people who have been neighbors twenty years must not talk
3994: to each other about age,” said Mrs. Arrowpoint. “Years, as the Tuscans
3995: say, are made for the letting of houses. But where is our new neighbor?
3996: I thought Mr. Grandcourt was to be here to-day.”
3997: 
3998: “Ah, by the way, so he was. The time’s getting on too,” said his
3999: lordship, looking at his watch. “But he only got to Diplow the other
4000: day. He came to us on Tuesday and said he had been a little bothered.
4001: He may have been pulled in another direction. Why, Gascoigne!”—the
4002: rector was just then crossing at a little distance with Gwendolen on
4003: his arm, and turned in compliance with the call—“this is a little too
4004: bad; you not only beat us yourself, but you bring up your niece to beat
4005: all the archeresses.”
4006: 
4007: “It _is_ rather scandalous in her to get the better of elder members,”
4008: said Mr. Gascoigne, with much inward satisfaction curling his short
4009: upper lip. “But it is not my doing, my lord. I only meant her to make a
4010: tolerable figure, without surpassing any one.”
4011: 
4012: “It is not my fault, either,” said Gwendolen, with pretty archness. “If
4013: I am to aim, I can’t help hitting.”
4014: 
4015: “Ay, ay, that may be a fatal business for some people,” said Lord
4016: Brackenshaw, good-humoredly; then taking out his watch and looking at
4017: Mrs. Arrowpoint again—“The time’s getting on, as you say. But
4018: Grandcourt is always late. I notice in town he’s always late, and he’s
4019: no bowman—understands nothing about it. But I told him he must come;
4020: he would see the flower of the neighborhood here. He asked about
4021: you—had seen Arrowpoint’s card. I think you had not made his
4022: acquaintance in town. He has been a good deal abroad. People don’t know
4023: him much.”
4024: 
4025: “No; we are strangers,” said Mrs. Arrowpoint. “But that is not what
4026: might have been expected. For his uncle Sir Hugo Mallinger and I are
4027: great friends when we meet.”
4028: 
4029: “I don’t know; uncles and nephews are not so likely to be seen together
4030: as uncles and nieces,” said his lordship, smiling toward the rector.
4031: “But just come with me one instant, Gascoigne, will you? I want to
4032: speak a word about the clout-shooting.”
4033: 
4034: Gwendolen chose to go too and be deposited in the same group with her
4035: mamma and aunt until she had to shoot again. That Mr. Grandcourt might
4036: after all not appear on the archery-ground, had begun to enter into
4037: Gwendolen’s thought as a possible deduction from the completeness of
4038: her pleasure. Under all her saucy satire, provoked chiefly by her
4039: divination that her friends thought of him as a desirable match for
4040: her, she felt something very far from indifference as to the impression
4041: she would make on him. True, he was not to have the slightest power
4042: over her (for Gwendolen had not considered that the desire to conquer
4043: is itself a sort of subjection); she had made up her mind that he was
4044: to be one of those complimentary and assiduously admiring men of whom
4045: even her narrow experience had shown her several with various-colored
4046: beards and various styles of bearing; and the sense that her friends
4047: would want her to think him delightful, gave her a resistant
4048: inclination to presuppose him ridiculous. But that was no reason why
4049: she could spare his presence: and even a passing prevision of trouble
4050: in case she despised and refused him, raised not the shadow of a wish
4051: that he should save her that trouble by showing no disposition to make
4052: her an offer. Mr. Grandcourt taking hardly any notice of her, and
4053: becoming shortly engaged to Miss Arrowpoint, was not a picture which
4054: flattered her imagination.
4055: 
4056: Hence Gwendolen had been all ear to Lord Brackenshaw’s mode of
4057: accounting for Grandcourt’s non-appearance; and when he did arrive, no
4058: consciousness—not even Mrs. Arrowpoint’s or Mr. Gascoigne’s—was more
4059: awake to the fact than hers, although she steadily avoided looking
4060: toward any point where he was likely to be. There should be no
4061: slightest shifting of angles to betray that it was of any consequence
4062: to her whether the much-talked-of Mr. Mallinger Grandcourt presented
4063: himself or not. She became again absorbed in the shooting, and so
4064: resolutely abstained from looking round observantly that, even
4065: supposing him to have taken a conspicuous place among the spectators,
4066: it might be clear she was not aware of him. And all the while the
4067: certainty that he was there made a distinct thread in her
4068: consciousness. Perhaps her shooting was the better for it: at any rate,
4069: it gained in precision, and she at last raised a delightful storm of
4070: clapping and applause by three hits running in the gold—a feat which
4071: among the Brackenshaw archers had not the vulgar reward of a shilling
4072: poll-tax, but that of a special gold star to be worn on the breast.
4073: That moment was not only a happy one to herself—it was just what her
4074: mamma and her uncle would have chosen for her. There was a general
4075: falling into ranks to give her space that she might advance
4076: conspicuously to receive the gold star from the hands of Lady
4077: Brackenshaw; and the perfect movement of her fine form was certainly a
4078: pleasant thing to behold in the clear afternoon light when the shadows
4079: were long and still. She was the central object of that pretty picture,
4080: and every one present must gaze at her. That was enough: she herself
4081: was determined to see nobody in particular, or to turn her eyes any way
4082: except toward Lady Brackenshaw, but her thoughts undeniably turned in
4083: other ways. It entered a little into her pleasure that Herr Klesmer
4084: must be observing her at a moment when music was out of the question,
4085: and his superiority very far in the background; for vanity is as ill
4086: at ease under indifference as tenderness is under a love which it
4087: cannot return; and the unconquered Klesmer threw a trace of his malign
4088: power even across her pleasant consciousness that Mr. Grandcourt was
4089: seeing her to the utmost advantage, and was probably giving her an
4090: admiration unmixed with criticism. She did not expect to admire _him_,
4091: but that was not necessary to her peace of mind.
4092: 
4093: Gwendolen met Lady Brackenshaw’s gracious smile without blushing (which
4094: only came to her when she was taken by surprise), but with a charming
4095: gladness of expression, and then bent with easy grace to have the star
4096: fixed near her shoulder. That little ceremony had been over long enough
4097: for her to have exchanged playful speeches and received congratulations
4098: as she moved among the groups who were now interesting themselves in
4099: the results of the scoring; but it happened that she stood outside
4100: examining the point of an arrow with rather an absent air when Lord
4101: Brackenshaw came up to her and said,
4102: 
4103: “Miss Harleth, here is a gentleman who is not willing to wait any
4104: longer for an introduction. He has been getting Mrs. Davilow to send me
4105: with him. Will you allow me to introduce Mr. Mallinger Grandcourt?”
4106:

4110: BOOK II.—MEETING STREAMS.
4111: 
4112: 
4113: CHAPTER XI.
4114: 
4115:     The beginning of an acquaintance whether with persons or things is to
4116:     get a definite outline for our ignorance.
4117: 
4118: 
4119: Mr. Grandcourt’s wish to be introduced had no suddenness for Gwendolen;
4120: but when Lord Brackenshaw moved aside a little for the prefigured
4121: stranger to come forward and she felt herself face to face with the
4122: real man, there was a little shock which flushed her cheeks and
4123: vexatiously deepened with her consciousness of it. The shock came from
4124: the reversal of her expectations: Grandcourt could hardly have been
4125: more unlike all her imaginary portraits of him. He was slightly taller
4126: than herself, and their eyes seemed to be on a level; there was not the
4127: faintest smile on his face as he looked at her, not a trace of
4128: self-consciousness or anxiety in his bearing: when he raised his hat he
4129: showed an extensive baldness surrounded with a mere fringe of
4130: reddish-blonde hair, but he also showed a perfect hand; the line of
4131: feature from brow to chin undisguised by beard was decidedly handsome,
4132: with only moderate departures from the perpendicular, and the slight
4133: whisker too was perpendicular. It was not possible for a human aspect
4134: to be freer from grimace or solicitous wrigglings: also it was perhaps
4135: not possible for a breathing man wide awake to look less animated. The
4136: correct Englishman, drawing himself up from his bow into rigidity,
4137: assenting severely, and seemed to be in a state of internal drill,
4138: suggests a suppressed vivacity, and may be suspected of letting go with
4139: some violence when he is released from parade; but Grandcourt’s bearing
4140: had no rigidity, it inclined rather to the flaccid. His complexion had
4141: a faded fairness resembling that of an actress when bare of the
4142: artificial white and red; his long narrow gray eyes expressed nothing
4143: but indifference. Attempts at description are stupid: who can all at
4144: once describe a human being? Even when he is presented to us we only
4145: begin that knowledge of his appearance which must be completed by
4146: innumerable impressions under differing circumstances. We recognize the
4147: alphabet; we are not sure of the language. I am only mentioning the
4148: point that Gwendolen saw by the light of a prepared contrast in the
4149: first minutes of her meeting with Grandcourt: they were summed up in
4150: the words, “He is not ridiculous.” But forthwith Lord Brackenshaw was
4151: gone, and what is called conversation had begun, the first and constant
4152: element in it being that Grandcourt looked at Gwendolen persistently
4153: with a slightly exploring gaze, but without change of expression, while
4154: she only occasionally looked at him with a flash of observation a
4155: little softened by coquetry. Also, after her answers there was a longer
4156: or shorter pause before he spoke again.
4157: 
4158: “I used to think archery was a great bore,” Grandcourt began. He spoke
4159: with a fine accent, but with a certain broken drawl, as of a
4160: distinguished personage with a distinguished cold on his chest.
4161: 
4162: “Are you converted to-day?” said Gwendolen.
4163: 
4164: (Pause, during which she imagined various degrees and modes of opinion
4165: about herself that might be entertained by Grandcourt.)
4166: 
4167: “Yes, since I saw you shooting. In things of this sort one generally
4168: sees people missing and simpering.”
4169: 
4170: “I suppose you are a first-rate shot with a rifle.”
4171: 
4172: (Pause, during which Gwendolen, having taken a rapid observation of
4173: Grandcourt, made a brief graphic description of him to an indefinite
4174: hearer.)
4175: 
4176: “I have left off shooting.”
4177: 
4178: “Oh, then, you are a formidable person. People who have done things once
4179: and left them off make one feel very contemptible, as if one were using
4180: cast-off fashions. I hope you have not left off all follies, because I
4181: practice a great many.”
4182: 
4183: (Pause, during which Gwendolen made several interpretations of her own
4184: speech.)
4185: 
4186: “What do you call follies?”
4187: 
4188: “Well, in general, I think, whatever is agreeable is called a folly. But
4189: you have not left off hunting, I hear.”
4190: 
4191: (Pause, wherein Gwendolen recalled what she had heard about
4192: Grandcourt’s position, and decided that he was the most
4193: aristocratic-looking man she had ever seen.)
4194: 
4195: “One must do something.”
4196: 
4197: “And do you care about the turf?—or is that among the things you have
4198: left off?”
4199: 
4200: (Pause, during which Gwendolen thought that a man of extremely calm,
4201: cold manners might be less disagreeable as a husband than other men,
4202: and not likely to interfere with his wife’s preferences.)
4203: 
4204: “I run a horse now and then; but I don’t go in for the thing as some
4205: men do. Are you fond of horses?”
4206: 
4207: “Yes, indeed; I never like my life so well as when I am on horseback,
4208: having a great gallop. I think of nothing. I only feel myself strong
4209: and happy.”
4210: 
4211: (Pause, wherein Gwendolen wondered whether Grandcourt would like what
4212: she said, but assured herself that she was not going to disguise her
4213: tastes.)
4214: 
4215: “Do you like danger?”
4216: 
4217: “I don’t know. When I am on horseback I never think of danger. It seems
4218: to me that if I broke my bones I should not feel it. I should go at
4219: anything that came in my way.”
4220: 
4221: (Pause during which Gwendolen had run through a whole hunting season
4222: with two chosen hunters to ride at will.)
4223: 
4224: “You would perhaps like tiger-hunting or pig-sticking. I saw some of
4225: that for a season or two in the East. Everything here is poor stuff
4226: after that.”
4227: 
4228: “_You_ are fond of danger, then?”
4229: 
4230: (Pause, wherein Gwendolen speculated on the probability that the men of
4231: coldest manners were the most adventurous, and felt the strength of her
4232: own insight, supposing the question had to be decided.)
4233: 
4234: “One must have something or other. But one gets used to it.”
4235: 
4236: “I begin to think I am very fortunate, because everything is new to me:
4237: it is only that I can’t get enough of it. I am not used to anything
4238: except being dull, which I should like to leave off as you have left
4239: off shooting.”
4240: 
4241: (Pause, during which it occurred to Gwendolen that a man of cold and
4242: distinguished manners might possibly be a dull companion; but on the
4243: other hand she thought that most persons were dull, that she had not
4244: observed husbands to be companions—and that after all she was not
4245: going to accept Grandcourt.)
4246: 
4247: “Why are you dull?”
4248: 
4249: “This is a dreadful neighborhood. There is nothing to be done in it.
4250: That is why I practiced my archery.”
4251: 
4252: (Pause, during which Gwendolen reflected that the life of an unmarried
4253: woman who could not go about and had no command of anything must
4254: necessarily be dull through all degrees of comparison as time went on.)
4255: 
4256: “You have made yourself queen of it. I imagine you will carry the first
4257: prize.”
4258: 
4259: “I don’t know that. I have great rivals. Did you not observe how well
4260: Miss Arrowpoint shot?”
4261: 
4262: (Pause, wherein Gwendolen was thinking that men had been known to
4263: choose some one else than the woman they most admired, and recalled
4264: several experiences of that kind in novels.)
4265: 
4266: “Miss Arrowpoint. No—that is, yes.”
4267: 
4268: “Shall we go now and hear what the scoring says? Every one is going to
4269: the other end now—shall we join them? I think my uncle is looking
4270: toward me. He perhaps wants me.”
4271: 
4272: Gwendolen found a relief for herself by thus changing the situation:
4273: not that the _tête-à-tête_ was quite disagreeable to her; but while it
4274: lasted she apparently could not get rid of the unwonted flush in her
4275: cheeks and the sense of surprise which made her feel less mistress of
4276: herself than usual. And this Mr. Grandcourt, who seemed to feel his own
4277: importance more than he did hers—a sort of unreasonableness few of us
4278: can tolerate—must not take for granted that he was of great moment to
4279: her, or that because others speculated on him as a desirable match she
4280: held herself altogether at his beck. How Grandcourt had filled up the
4281: pauses will be more evident hereafter.
4282: 
4283: “You have just missed the gold arrow, Gwendolen,” said Mr. Gascoigne.
4284: “Miss Juliet Fenn scores eight above you.”
4285: 
4286: “I am very glad to hear it. I should have felt that I was making myself
4287: too disagreeable—taking the best of everything,” said Gwendolen, quite
4288: easily.
4289: 
4290: It was impossible to be jealous of Juliet Fenn, a girl as middling as
4291: midday market in everything but her archery and plainness, in which
4292: last she was noticeable like her father: underhung and with receding
4293: brow resembling that of the more intelligent fishes. (Surely,
4294: considering the importance which is given to such an accident in female
4295: offspring, marriageable men, or what the new English calls “intending
4296: bridegrooms,” should look at themselves dispassionately in the glass,
4297: since their natural selection of a mate prettier than themselves is not
4298: certain to bar the effect of their own ugliness.)
4299: 
4300: There was now a lively movement in the mingling groups, which carried
4301: the talk along with it. Every one spoke to every one else by turns, and
4302: Gwendolen, who chose to see what was going on around her now, observed
4303: that Grandcourt was having Klesmer presented to him by some one unknown
4304: to her—a middle-aged man, with dark, full face and fat hands, who
4305: seemed to be on the easiest terms with both, and presently led the way
4306: in joining the Arrowpoints, whose acquaintance had already been made by
4307: both him and Grandcourt. Who this stranger was she did not care much to
4308: know; but she wished to observe what was Grandcourt’s manner toward
4309: others than herself. Precisely the same: except that he did not look
4310: much at Miss Arrowpoint, but rather at Klesmer, who was speaking with
4311: animation—now stretching out his long fingers horizontally, now
4312: pointing downward with his forefinger, now folding his arms and
4313: tossing his mane, while he addressed himself first to one and then to
4314: the other, including Grandcourt, who listened with an impassive face
4315: and narrow eyes, his left forefinger in his waistcoat-pocket, and his
4316: right slightly touching his thin whisker.
4317: 
4318: “I wonder which style Miss Arrowpoint admires most,” was a thought that
4319: glanced through Gwendolen’s mind, while her eyes and lips gathered
4320: rather a mocking expression. But she would not indulge her sense of
4321: amusement by watching, as if she were curious, and she gave all her
4322: animation to those immediately around her, determined not to care
4323: whether Mr. Grandcourt came near her again or not.
4324: 
4325: He did come, however, and at a moment when he could propose to
4326: conduct Mrs. Davilow to her carriage, “Shall we meet again in the
4327: ball-room?” she said as he raised his hat at parting. The “yes” in
4328: reply had the usual slight drawl and perfect gravity.
4329: 
4330: “You were wrong for once, Gwendolen,” said Mrs. Davilow, during their
4331: few minutes’ drive to the castle.
4332: 
4333: “In what, mamma?”
4334: 
4335: “About Mr. Grandcourt’s appearance and manners. You can’t find anything
4336: ridiculous in him.”
4337: 
4338: “I suppose I could if I tried, but I don’t want to do it,” said
4339: Gwendolen, rather pettishly; and her mother was afraid to say more.
4340: 
4341: It was the rule on these occasions for the ladies and gentlemen to dine
4342: apart, so that the dinner might make a time of comparative ease and
4343: rest for both. Indeed, the gentlemen had a set of archery stories about
4344: the epicurism of the ladies, who had somehow been reported to show a
4345: revolting masculine judgment in venison, even asking for the fat—a
4346: proof of the frightful rate at which corruption might go on in women,
4347: but for severe social restraint, and every year the amiable Lord
4348: Brackenshaw, who was something of a _gourmet_, mentioned Byron’s
4349: opinion that a woman should never be seen eating,—introducing it with
4350: a confidential—“The fact is” as if he were for the first time
4351: admitting his concurrence in that sentiment of the refined poet.
4352: 
4353: In the ladies’ dining-room it was evident that Gwendolen was not a
4354: general favorite with her own sex: there were no beginnings of intimacy
4355: between her and other girls, and in conversation they rather noticed
4356: what she said than spoke to her in free exchange. Perhaps it was that
4357: she was not much interested in them, and when left alone in their
4358: company had a sense of empty benches. Mrs. Vulcany once remarked that
4359: Miss Harleth was too fond of the gentlemen; but we know that she was
4360: not in the least fond of them—she was only fond of their homage—and
4361: women did not give her homage. The exception to this willing aloofness
4362: from her was Miss Arrowpoint, who often managed unostentatiously to be
4363: by her side, and talked to her with quiet friendliness.
4364: 
4365: “She knows, as I do, that our friends are ready to quarrel over a
4366: husband for us,” thought Gwendolen, “and she is determined not to enter
4367: into the quarrel.”
4368: 
4369: “I think Miss Arrowpoint has the best manners I ever saw,” said Mrs.
4370: Davilow, when she and Gwendolen were in a dressing-room with Mrs.
4371: Gascoigne and Anna, but at a distance where they could have their talk
4372: apart.
4373: 
4374: “I wish I were like her,” said Gwendolen.
4375: 
4376: “Why? Are you getting discontented with yourself, Gwen?”
4377: 
4378: “No; but I am discontented with things. She seems contented.”
4379: 
4380: “I am sure you ought to be satisfied to-day. You must have enjoyed the
4381: shooting. I saw you did.”
4382: 
4383: “Oh, that is over now, and I don’t know what will come next,” said
4384: Gwendolen, stretching herself with a sort of moan and throwing up her
4385: arms. They were bare now; it was the fashion to dance in the archery
4386: dress, throwing off the jacket; and the simplicity of her white
4387: cashmere with its border of pale green set off her form to the utmost.
4388: A thin line of gold round her neck, and the gold star on her breast,
4389: were her only ornaments. Her smooth soft hair piled up into a grand
4390: crown made a clear line about her brow. Sir Joshua would have been glad
4391: to take her portrait; and he would have had an easier task than the
4392: historian at least in this, that he would not have had to represent the
4393: truth of change—only to give stability to one beautiful moment.
4394: 
4395: “The dancing will come next,” said Mrs. Davilow “You are sure to enjoy
4396: that.”
4397: 
4398: “I shall only dance in the quadrille. I told Mr. Clintock so. I shall
4399: not waltz or polk with any one.”
4400: 
4401: “Why in the world do you say that all on a sudden?”
4402: 
4403: “I can’t bear having ugly people so near me.”
4404: 
4405: “Whom do you mean by ugly people?”
4406: 
4407: “Oh, plenty.”
4408: 
4409: “Mr. Clintock, for example, is not ugly.” Mrs. Davilow dared not
4410: mention Grandcourt.
4411: 
4412: “Well, I hate woolen cloth touching me.”
4413: 
4414: “Fancy!” said Mrs. Davilow to her sister who now came up from the other
4415: end of the room. “Gwendolen says she will not waltz or polk.”
4416: 
4417: “She is rather given to whims, I think,” said Mrs. Gascoigne, gravely.
4418: “It would be more becoming in her to behave as other young ladies do on
4419: such an occasion as this; especially when she has had the advantage of
4420: first-rate dancing lessons.”
4421: 
4422: “Why should I dance if I don’t like it, aunt? It is not in the
4423: catechism.”
4424: 
4425: “My _dear_!” said Mrs. Gascoigne, in a tone of severe check, and Anna
4426: looked frightened at Gwendolen’s daring. But they all passed on without
4427: saying any more.
4428: 
4429: Apparently something had changed Gwendolen’s mood since the hour of
4430: exulting enjoyment in the archery-ground. But she did not look the
4431: worse under the chandeliers in the ball-room, where the soft splendor
4432: of the scene and the pleasant odors from the conservatory could not but
4433: be soothing to the temper, when accompanied with the consciousness of
4434: being preeminently sought for. Hardly a dancing man but was anxious to
4435: have her for a partner, and each whom she accepted was in a state of
4436: melancholy remonstrance that she would not waltz or polk.
4437: 
4438: “Are you under a vow, Miss Harleth?”—“Why are you so cruel to us
4439: all?”—“You waltzed with me in February.”—“And you who waltz so
4440: perfectly!” were exclamations not without piquancy for her. The ladies
4441: who waltzed naturally thought that Miss Harleth only wanted to make
4442: herself particular; but her uncle when he overheard her refusal,
4443: supported her by saying,
4444: 
4445: “Gwendolen has usually good reasons.” He thought she was certainly more
4446: distinguished in not waltzing, and he wished her to be distinguished.
4447: The archery ball was intended to be kept at the subdued pitch that
4448: suited all dignities clerical and secular; it was not an escapement for
4449: youthful high spirits, and he himself was of opinion that the
4450: fashionable dances were too much of a romp.
4451: 
4452: Among the remonstrant dancing men, however, Mr. Grandcourt was not
4453: numbered. After standing up for a quadrille with Miss Arrowpoint, it
4454: seemed that he meant to ask for no other partner. Gwendolen observed
4455: him frequently with the Arrowpoints, but he never took an opportunity
4456: of approaching her. Mr. Gascoigne was sometimes speaking to him; but
4457: Mr. Gascoigne was everywhere. It was in her mind now that she would
4458: probably after all not have the least trouble about him: perhaps he had
4459: looked at her without any particular admiration, and was too much used
4460: to everything in the world to think of her as more than one of the
4461: girls who were invited in that part of the country. Of course! It was
4462: ridiculous of elders to entertain notions about what a man would do,
4463: without having seen him even through a telescope. Probably he meant to
4464: marry Miss Arrowpoint. Whatever might come, she, Gwendolen, was not
4465: going to be disappointed: the affair was a joke whichever way it
4466: turned, for she had never committed herself even by a silent confidence
4467: in anything Mr. Grandcourt would do. Still, she noticed that he did
4468: sometimes quietly and gradually change his position according to hers,
4469: so that he could see her whenever she was dancing, and if he did not
4470: admire her—so much the worse for him.
4471: 
4472: This movement for the sake of being in sight of her was more direct
4473: than usual rather late in the evening, when Gwendolen had accepted
4474: Klesmer as a partner; and that wide-glancing personage, who saw
4475: everything and nothing by turns, said to her when they were walking,
4476: “Mr. Grandcourt is a man of taste. He likes to see you dancing.”
4477: 
4478: “Perhaps he likes to look at what is against his taste,” said
4479: Gwendolen, with a light laugh; she was quite courageous with Klesmer
4480: now. “He may be so tired of admiring that he likes disgust for variety.”
4481: 
4482: “Those words are not suitable to your lips,” said Klesmer, quickly,
4483: with one of his grand frowns, while he shook his hand as if to banish
4484: the discordant sounds.
4485: 
4486: “Are you as critical of words as of music?”
4487: 
4488: “Certainly I am. I should require your words to be what your face and
4489: form are—always among the meanings of a noble music.”
4490: 
4491: “That is a compliment as well as a correction. I am obliged for both.
4492: But do you know I am bold enough to wish to correct _you_, and require
4493: you to understand a joke?”
4494: 
4495: “One may understand jokes without liking them,” said the terrible
4496: Klesmer. “I have had opera books sent me full of jokes; it was just
4497: because I understood them that I did not like them. The comic people
4498: are ready to challenge a man because he looks grave. ‘You don’t see the
4499: witticism, sir?’ ‘No, sir, but I see what you meant.’ Then I am what we
4500: call ticketed as a fellow without _esprit_. But, in fact,” said
4501: Klesmer, suddenly dropping from his quick narrative to a reflective
4502: tone, with an impressive frown, “I am very sensible to wit and humor.”
4503: 
4504: “I am glad you tell me that,” said Gwendolen, not without some
4505: wickedness of intention. But Klesmer’s thoughts had flown off on the
4506: wings of his own statement, as their habit was, and she had the
4507: wickedness all to herself. “Pray, who is that standing near the
4508: card-room door?” she went on, seeing there the same stranger with whom
4509: Klesmer had been in animated talk on the archery ground. “He is a
4510: friend of yours, I think.”
4511: 
4512: “No, no; an amateur I have seen in town; Lush, a Mr. Lush—too fond of
4513: Meyerbeer and Scribe—too fond of the mechanical-dramatic.”
4514: 
4515: “Thanks. I wanted to know whether you thought his face and form
4516: required that his words should be among the meanings of noble music?”
4517: Klesmer was conquered, and flashed at her a delightful smile which made
4518: them quite friendly until she begged to be deposited by the side of her
4519: mamma.
4520: 
4521: Three minutes afterward her preparations for Grandcourt’s indifference
4522: were all canceled. Turning her head after some remark to her mother,
4523: she found that he had made his way up to her.
4524: 
4525: “May I ask if you are tired of dancing, Miss Harleth?” he began,
4526: looking down with his former unperturbed expression.
4527: 
4528: “Not in the least.”
4529: 
4530: “Will you do me the honor—the next—or another quadrille?”
4531: 
4532: “I should have been very happy,” said Gwendolen looking at her card,
4533: “but I am engaged for the next to Mr. Clintock—and indeed I perceive
4534: that I am doomed for every quadrille; I have not one to dispose of.”
4535: She was not sorry to punish Mr. Grandcourt’s tardiness, yet at the same
4536: time she would have liked to dance with him. She gave him a charming
4537: smile as she looked up to deliver her answer, and he stood still
4538: looking down at her with no smile at all.
4539: 
4540: “I am unfortunate in being too late,” he said, after a moment’s pause.
4541: 
4542: “It seemed to me that you did not care for dancing,” said Gwendolen. “I
4543: thought it might be one of the things you had left off.”
4544: 
4545: “Yes, but I have not begun to dance with you,” said Grandcourt. Always
4546: there was the same pause before he took up his cue. “You make dancing a
4547: new thing, as you make archery.”
4548: 
4549: “Is novelty always agreeable?”
4550: 
4551: “No, no—not always.”
4552: 
4553: “Then I don’t know whether to feel flattered or not. When you had once
4554: danced with me there would be no more novelty in it.”
4555: 
4556: “On the contrary, there would probably be much more.”
4557: 
4558: “That is deep. I don’t understand.”
4559: 
4560: “It is difficult to make Miss Harleth understand her power?” Here
4561: Grandcourt had turned to Mrs. Davilow, who, smiling gently at her
4562: daughter, said,
4563: 
4564: “I think she does not generally strike people as slow to understand.”
4565: 
4566: “Mamma,” said Gwendolen, in a deprecating tone, “I am adorably stupid,
4567: and want everything explained to me—when the meaning is pleasant.”
4568: 
4569: “If you are stupid, I admit that stupidity is adorable,” returned
4570: Grandcourt, after the usual pause, and without change of tone. But
4571: clearly he knew what to say.
4572: 
4573: “I begin to think that my cavalier has forgotten me,” Gwendolen
4574: observed after a little while. “I see the quadrille is being formed.”
4575: 
4576: “He deserves to be renounced,” said Grandcourt.
4577: 
4578: “I think he is very pardonable,” said Gwendolen.
4579: 
4580: “There must have been some misunderstanding,” said Mrs. Davilow. “Mr.
4581: Clintock was too anxious about the engagement to have forgotten it.”
4582: 
4583: But now Lady Brackenshaw came up and said, “Miss Harleth, Mr. Clintock
4584: has charged me to express to you his deep regret that he was obliged to
4585: leave without having the pleasure of dancing with you again. An express
4586: came from his father, the archdeacon; something important; he was to
4587: go. He was _au désespoir_.”
4588: 
4589: “Oh, he was very good to remember the engagement under the
4590: circumstances,” said Gwendolen. “I am sorry he was called away.” It was
4591: easy to be politely sorrowful on so felicitous an occasion.
4592: 
4593: “Then I can profit by Mr. Clintock’s misfortune?” said Grandcourt. “May
4594: I hope that you will let me take his place?”
4595: 
4596: “I shall be very happy to dance the next quadrille with you.”
4597: 
4598: The appropriateness of the event seemed an augury, and as Gwendolen
4599: stood up for the quadrille with Grandcourt, there was a revival in her
4600: of the exultation—the sense of carrying everything before her, which
4601: she had felt earlier in the day. No man could have walked through the
4602: quadrille with more irreproachable ease than Grandcourt; and the
4603: absence of all eagerness in his attention to her suited his partner’s
4604: taste. She was now convinced that he meant to distinguish her, to mark
4605: his admiration of her in a noticeable way; and it began to appear
4606: probable that she would have it in her power to reject him, whence
4607: there was a pleasure in reckoning up the advantages which would make
4608: her rejection splendid, and in giving Mr. Grandcourt his utmost value.
4609: It was also agreeable to divine that this exclusive selection of her to
4610: dance with, from among all the unmarried ladies present, would attract
4611: observation; though she studiously avoided seeing this, and at the end
4612: of the quadrille walked away on Grandcourt’s arm as if she had been one
4613: of the shortest sighted instead of the longest and widest sighted of
4614: mortals. They encountered Miss Arrowpoint, who was standing with Lady
4615: Brackenshaw and a group of gentlemen. The heiress looked at Gwendolen
4616: invitingly and said, “I hope you will vote with us, Miss Harleth, and
4617: Mr. Grandcourt too, though he is not an archer.” Gwendolen and
4618: Grandcourt paused to join the group, and found that the voting turned
4619: on the project of a picnic archery meeting to be held in Cardell Chase,
4620: where the evening entertainment would be more poetic than a ball under
4621: chandeliers—a feast of sunset lights along the glades and through the
4622: branches and over the solemn tree-tops.
4623: 
4624: Gwendolen thought the scheme delightful—equal to playing Robin Hood
4625: and Maid Marian: and Mr. Grandcourt, when appealed to a second time,
4626: said it was a thing to be done; whereupon Mr. Lush, who stood behind
4627: Lady Brackenshaw’s elbow, drew Gwendolen’s notice by saying with a
4628: familiar look and tone to Grandcourt, “Diplow would be a good place for
4629: the meeting, and more convenient: there’s a fine bit between the oaks
4630: toward the north gate.”
4631: 
4632: Impossible to look more unconscious of being addressed than Grandcourt;
4633: but Gwendolen took a new survey of the speaker, deciding, first, that
4634: he must be on terms of intimacy with the tenant of Diplow, and,
4635: secondly, that she would never, if she could help it, let him come
4636: within a yard of her. She was subject to physical antipathies, and Mr.
4637: Lush’s prominent eyes, fat though not clumsy figure, and strong black
4638: gray-besprinkled hair of frizzy thickness, which, with the rest of his
4639: prosperous person, was enviable to many, created one of the strongest
4640: of her antipathies. To be safe from his looking at her, she murmured to
4641: Grandcourt, “I should like to continue walking.”
4642: 
4643: He obeyed immediately; but when they were thus away from any audience,
4644: he spoke no word for several minutes, and she, out of a half-amused,
4645: half-serious inclination for experiment, would not speak first. They
4646: turned into the large conservatory, beautifully lit up with Chinese
4647: lamps. The other couples there were at a distance which would not have
4648: interfered with any dialogue, but still they walked in silence until
4649: they had reached the farther end where there was a flush of pink light,
4650: and the second wide opening into the ball-room. Grandcourt, when they
4651: had half turned round, paused and said languidly,
4652: 
4653: “Do you like this kind of thing?”
4654: 
4655: If the situation had been described to Gwendolen half an hour before,
4656: she would have laughed heartily at it, and could only have imagined
4657: herself returning a playful, satirical answer. But for some mysterious
4658: reason—it was a mystery of which she had a faint wondering
4659: consciousness—she dared not be satirical: she had begun to feel a wand
4660: over her that made her afraid of offending Grandcourt.
4661: 
4662: “Yes,” she said, quietly, without considering what “kind of thing” was
4663: meant—whether the flowers, the scents, the ball in general, or this
4664: episode of walking with Mr. Grandcourt in particular. And they returned
4665: along the conservatory without farther interpretation. She then
4666: proposed to go and sit down in her old place, and they walked among
4667: scattered couples preparing for the waltz to the spot where Mrs.
4668: Davilow had been seated all the evening. As they approached it her seat
4669: was vacant, but she was coming toward it again, and, to Gwendolen’s
4670: shuddering annoyance, with Mr. Lush at her elbow. There was no avoiding
4671: the confrontation: her mamma came close to her before they had reached
4672: the seats, and, after a quiet greeting smile, said innocently,
4673: “Gwendolen, dear, let me present Mr. Lush to you.” Having just made the
4674: acquaintance of this personage, as an intimate and constant companion
4675: of Mr. Grandcourt’s, Mrs. Davilow imagined it altogether desirable that
4676: her daughter also should make the acquaintance.
4677: 
4678: It was hardly a bow that Gwendolen gave—rather, it was the slightest
4679: forward sweep of the head away from the physiognomy that inclined
4680: itself toward her, and she immediately moved toward her seat, saying,
4681: “I want to put on my burnous.” No sooner had she reached it, than Mr.
4682: Lush was there, and had the burnous in his hand: to annoy this
4683: supercilious young lady, he would incur the offense of forestalling
4684: Grandcourt; and, holding up the garment close to Gwendolen, he said,
4685: “Pray, permit me?” But she, wheeling away from him as if he had been a
4686: muddy hound, glided on to the ottoman, saying, “No, thank you.”
4687: 
4688: A man who forgave this would have much Christian feeling, supposing he
4689: had intended to be agreeable to the young lady; but before he seized
4690: the burnous Mr. Lush had ceased to have that intention. Grandcourt
4691: quietly took the drapery from him, and Mr. Lush, with a slight bow,
4692: moved away. “You had perhaps better put it on,” said Mr. Grandcourt,
4693: looking down on her without change of expression.
4694: 
4695: “Thanks; perhaps it would be wise,” said Gwendolen, rising, and
4696: submitting very gracefully to take the burnous on her shoulders.
4697: 
4698: After that, Mr. Grandcourt exchanged a few polite speeches with Mrs.
4699: Davilow, and, in taking leave, asked permission to call at Offendene
4700: the next day. He was evidently not offended by the insult directed
4701: toward his friend. Certainly Gwendolen’s refusal of the burnous from
4702: Mr. Lush was open to the interpretation that she wished to receive it
4703: from Mr. Grandcourt. But she, poor child, had no design in this action,
4704: and was simply following her antipathy and inclination, confiding in
4705: them as she did in the more reflective judgments into which they
4706: entered as sap into leafage. Gwendolen had no sense that these men were
4707: dark enigmas to her, or that she needed any help in drawing conclusions
4708: about them—Mr. Grandcourt at least. The chief question was, how far
4709: his character and ways might answer her wishes; and unless she were
4710: satisfied about that, she had said to herself that she would not accept
4711: his offer.
4712: 
4713: Could there be a slenderer, more insignificant thread in human history
4714: than this consciousness of a girl, busy with her small inferences of
4715: the way in which she could make her life pleasant?—in a time, too,
4716: when ideas were with fresh vigor making armies of themselves, and the
4717: universal kinship was declaring itself fiercely; when women on the
4718: other side of the world would not mourn for the husbands and sons who
4719: died bravely in a common cause, and men stinted of bread on our side of
4720: the world heard of that willing loss and were patient: a time when the
4721: soul of man was walking to pulses which had for centuries been beating
4722: in him unfelt, until their full sum made a new life of terror or of joy.
4723: 
4724: What in the midst of that mighty drama are girls and their blind
4725: visions? They are the Yea or Nay of that good for which men are
4726: enduring and fighting. In these delicate vessels is borne onward
4727: through the ages the treasure of human affections.

4732: CHAPTER XII.
4733: 
4734:   “O gentlemen, the time of life is short;
4735:   To spend that shortness basely were too long,
4736:   If life did ride upon a dial’s point,
4737:   Still ending at the arrival of an hour.”
4738:                 —SHAKESPEARE: _Henry IV_.
4739: 
4740: 
4741: On the second day after the archery meeting, Mr. Henleigh Mallinger
4742: Grandcourt was at his breakfast-table with Mr. Lush. Everything around
4743: them was agreeable: the summer air through the open windows, at which
4744: the dogs could walk in from the old green turf on the lawn; the soft,
4745: purplish coloring of the park beyond, stretching toward a mass of
4746: bordering wood; the still life in the room, which seemed the stiller
4747: for its sober antiquated elegance, as if it kept a conscious, well-bred
4748: silence, unlike the restlessness of vulgar furniture.
4749: 
4750: Whether the gentlemen were agreeable to each other was less evident.
4751: Mr. Grandcourt had drawn his chair aside so as to face the lawn, and
4752: with his left leg over another chair, and his right elbow on the table,
4753: was smoking a large cigar, while his companion was still eating. The
4754: dogs—half-a-dozen of various kinds were moving lazily in and out,
4755: taking attitudes of brief attention—gave a vacillating preference
4756: first to one gentleman, then to the other; being dogs in such good
4757: circumstances that they could play at hunger, and liked to be served
4758: with delicacies which they declined to put in their mouths; all except
4759: Fetch, the beautiful liver-colored water-spaniel, which sat with its
4760: forepaws firmly planted and its expressive brown face turned upward,
4761: watching Grandcourt with unshaken constancy. He held in his lap a tiny
4762: Maltese dog with a tiny silver collar and bell, and when he had a hand
4763: unused by cigar or coffee-cup, it rested on this small parcel of animal
4764: warmth. I fear that Fetch was jealous, and wounded that her master gave
4765: her no word or look; at last it seemed that she could bear this neglect
4766: no longer, and she gently put her large silky paw on her master’s leg.
4767: Grandcourt looked at her with unchanged face for half a minute, and
4768: then took the trouble to lay down his cigar while he lifted the
4769: unimpassioned Fluff close to his chin and gave it caressing pats, all
4770: the while gravely watching Fetch, who, poor thing, whimpered
4771: interruptedly, as if trying to repress that sign of discontent, and at
4772: last rested her head beside the appealing paw, looking up with piteous
4773: beseeching. So, at least, a lover of dogs must have interpreted Fetch,
4774: and Grandcourt kept so many dogs that he was reputed to love them; at
4775: any rate, his impulse to act just in that way started from such an
4776: interpretation. But when the amusing anguish burst forth in a howling
4777: bark, Grandcourt pushed Fetch down without speaking, and, depositing
4778: Fluff carelessly on the table (where his black nose predominated over a
4779: salt-cellar), began to look to his cigar, and found, with some
4780: annoyance against Fetch as the cause, that the brute of a cigar
4781: required relighting. Fetch, having begun to wail, found, like others of
4782: her sex, that it was not easy to leave off; indeed, the second howl was
4783: a louder one, and the third was like unto it.
4784: 
4785: “Turn out that brute, will you?” said Grandcourt to Lush, without
4786: raising his voice or looking at him—as if he counted on attention to
4787: the smallest sign.
4788: 
4789: And Lush immediately rose, lifted Fetch, though she was rather heavy,
4790: and he was not fond of stooping, and carried her out, disposing of her
4791: in some way that took him a couple of minutes before he returned. He
4792: then lit a cigar, placed himself at an angle where he could see
4793: Grandcourt’s face without turning, and presently said,
4794: 
4795: “Shall you ride or drive to Quetcham to-day?”
4796: 
4797: “I am not going to Quetcham.”
4798: 
4799: “You did not go yesterday.”
4800: 
4801: Grandcourt smoked in silence for half a minute, and then said,
4802: 
4803: “I suppose you sent my card and inquiries.”
4804: 
4805: “I went myself at four, and said you were sure to be there shortly.
4806: They would suppose some accident prevented you from fulfilling the
4807: intention. Especially if you go to-day.”
4808: 
4809: Silence for a couple of minutes. Then Grandcourt said, “What men are
4810: invited here with their wives?”
4811: 
4812: Lush drew out a note-book. “The Captain and Mrs. Torrington come next
4813: week. Then there are Mr. Hollis and Lady Flora, and the Cushats and the
4814: Gogoffs.”
4815: 
4816: “Rather a ragged lot,” remarked Grandcourt, after a while. “Why did you
4817: ask the Gogoffs? When you write invitations in my name, be good enough
4818: to give me a list, instead of bringing down a giantess on me without my
4819: knowledge. She spoils the look of the room.”
4820: 
4821: “You invited the Gogoffs yourself when you met them in Paris.”
4822: 
4823: “What has my meeting them in Paris to do with it? I told you to give me
4824: a list.”
4825: 
4826: Grandcourt, like many others, had two remarkably different voices.
4827: Hitherto we have heard him speaking in a superficial interrupted drawl
4828: suggestive chiefly of languor and _ennui_. But this last brief speech
4829: was uttered in subdued inward, yet distinct, tones, which Lush had long
4830: been used to recognize as the expression of a peremptory will.
4831: 
4832: “Are there any other couples you would like to invite?”
4833: 
4834: “Yes; think of some decent people, with a daughter or two. And one of
4835: your damned musicians. But not a comic fellow.”
4836: 
4837: “I wonder if Klesmer would consent to come to us when he leaves
4838: Quetcham. Nothing but first-class music will go down with Miss
4839: Arrowpoint.”
4840: 
4841: Lush spoke carelessly, but he was really seizing an opportunity and
4842: fixing an observant look on Grandcourt, who now for the first time,
4843: turned his eyes toward his companion, but slowly and without speaking
4844: until he had given two long luxuriant puffs, when he said, perhaps in a
4845: lower tone than ever, but with a perceptible edge of contempt,
4846: 
4847: “What in the name of nonsense have I to do with Miss Arrowpoint and her
4848: music?”
4849: 
4850: “Well, something,” said Lush, jocosely. “You need not give yourself
4851: much trouble, perhaps. But some forms must be gone through before a man
4852: can marry a million.”
4853: 
4854: “Very likely. But I am not going to marry a million.”
4855: 
4856: “That’s a pity—to fling away an opportunity of this sort, and knock
4857: down your own plans.”
4858: 
4859: “_Your_ plans, I suppose you mean.”
4860: 
4861: “You have some debts, you know, and things may turn out inconveniently,
4862: after all. The heirship is not _absolutely_ certain.”
4863: 
4864: Grandcourt did not answer, and Lush went on.
4865: 
4866: “It really is a fine opportunity. The father and mother ask for nothing
4867: better, I can see, and the daughter’s looks and manners require no
4868: allowances, any more than if she hadn’t a sixpence. She is not
4869: beautiful; but equal to carrying any rank. And she is not likely to
4870: refuse such prospects as you can offer her.”
4871: 
4872: “Perhaps not.”
4873: 
4874: “The father and mother would let you do anything you like with them.”
4875: 
4876: “But I should not like to do anything with them.”
4877: 
4878: Here it was Lush who made a little pause before speaking again, and
4879: then he said in a deep voice of remonstrance, “Good God, Grandcourt!
4880: after your experience, will you let a whim interfere with your
4881: comfortable settlement in life?”
4882: 
4883: “Spare your oratory. I know what I am going to do.”
4884: 
4885: “What?” Lush put down his cigar and thrust his hands into his side
4886: pockets, as if he had to face something exasperating, but meant to keep
4887: his temper.
4888: 
4889: “I am going to marry the other girl.”
4890: 
4891: “Have you fallen in love?” This question carried a strong sneer.
4892: 
4893: “I am going to marry her.”
4894: 
4895: “You have made her an offer already, then?”
4896: 
4897: “No.”
4898: 
4899: “She is a young lady with a will of her own, I fancy. Extremely well
4900: fitted to make a rumpus. She would know what she liked.”
4901: 
4902: “She doesn’t like you,” said Grandcourt, with the ghost of a smile.
4903: 
4904: “Perfectly true,” said Lush, adding again in a markedly sneering tone.
4905: “However, if you and she are devoted to each other, that will be
4906: enough.”
4907: 
4908: Grandcourt took no notice of this speech, but sipped his coffee, rose,
4909: and strolled out on the lawn, all the dogs following him.
4910: 
4911: Lush glanced after him a moment, then resumed his cigar and lit it, but
4912: smoked slowly, consulting his beard with inspecting eyes and fingers,
4913: till he finally stroked it with an air of having arrived at some
4914: conclusion, and said in a subdued voice,
4915: 
4916: “Check, old boy!”
4917: 
4918: Lush, being a man of some ability, had not known Grandcourt for fifteen
4919: years without learning what sort of measures were useless with him,
4920: though what sort might be useful remained often dubious. In the
4921: beginning of his career he held a fellowship, and was near taking
4922: orders for the sake of a college living, but, not being fond of that
4923: prospect, accepted instead the office of traveling companion to a
4924: marquess, and afterward to young Grandcourt, who had lost his father
4925: early, and who found Lush so convenient that he had allowed him to
4926: become prime minister in all his more personal affairs. The habit of
4927: fifteen years had made Grandcourt more and more in need of Lush’s
4928: handiness, and Lush more and more in need of the lazy luxury to which
4929: his transactions on behalf of Grandcourt made no interruption worth
4930: reckoning. I cannot say that the same lengthened habit had intensified
4931: Grandcourt’s want of respect for his companion since that want had been
4932: absolute from the beginning, but it had confirmed his sense that he
4933: might kick Lush if he chose—only he never did choose to kick any
4934: animal, because the act of kicking is a compromising attitude, and a
4935: gentleman’s dogs should be kicked for him. He only said things which
4936: might have exposed himself to be kicked if his confidant had been a man
4937: of independent spirit. But what son of a vicar who has stinted his wife
4938: and daughters of calico in order to send his male offspring to Oxford,
4939: can keep an independent spirit when he is bent on dining with high
4940: discrimination, riding good horses, living generally in the most
4941: luxuriant honey-blossomed clover—and all without working? Mr. Lush had
4942: passed for a scholar once, and had still a sense of scholarship when he
4943: was not trying to remember much of it; but the bachelor’s and other
4944: arts which soften manners are a time-honored preparation for sinecures;
4945: and Lush’s present comfortable provision was as good a sinecure in not
4946: requiring more than the odor of departed learning. He was not
4947: unconscious of being held kickable, but he preferred counting that
4948: estimate among the peculiarities of Grandcourt’s character, which made
4949: one of his incalculable moods or judgments as good as another. Since in
4950: his own opinion he had never done a bad action, it did not seem
4951: necessary to consider whether he should be likely to commit one if his
4952: love of ease required it. Lush’s love of ease was well-satisfied at
4953: present, and if his puddings were rolled toward him in the dust, he
4954: took the inside bits and found them relishing.
4955: 
4956: This morning, for example, though he had encountered more annoyance
4957: than usual, he went to his private sitting-room and played a good hour
4958: on the violoncello.
4959:

4961: 
4962: 
4963: CHAPTER XIII.
4964: 
4965:   “Philistia, be thou glad of me!”
4966: 
4967: 
4968: Grandcourt having made up his mind to marry Miss Harleth, showed a
4969: power of adapting means to ends. During the next fortnight there was
4970: hardly a day on which by some arrangement or other he did not see her,
4971: or prove by emphatic attentions that she occupied his thoughts. His
4972: cousin, Mrs. Torrington, was now doing the honors of his house, so that
4973: Mrs. Davilow and Gwendolen could be invited to a large party at Diplow
4974: in which there were many witnesses how the host distinguished the
4975: dowerless beauty, and showed no solicitude about the heiress. The
4976: world—I mean Mr. Gascoigne and all the families worth speaking of
4977: within visiting distance of Pennicote—felt an assurance on the subject
4978: which in the rector’s mind converted itself into a resolution to do his
4979: duty by his niece and see that the settlements were adequate. Indeed
4980: the wonder to him and Mrs. Davilow was that the offer for which so many
4981: suitable occasions presented themselves had not been already made; and
4982: in this wonder Grandcourt himself was not without a share. When he had
4983: told his resolution to Lush he had thought that the affair would be
4984: concluded more quickly, and to his own surprise he had repeatedly
4985: promised himself in a morning that he would to-day give Gwendolen the
4986: opportunity of accepting him, and had found in the evening that the
4987: necessary formality was still unaccomplished. This remarkable fact
4988: served to heighten his determination on another day. He had never
4989: admitted to himself that Gwendolen might refuse him, but—heaven help
4990: us all!—we are often unable to act on our certainties; our objection
4991: to a contrary issue (were it possible) is so strong that it rises like
4992: a spectral illusion between us and our certainty; we are rationally
4993: sure that the blind worm can not bite us mortally, but it would be so
4994: intolerable to be bitten, and the creature has a biting look—we
4995: decline to handle it.
4996: 
4997: He had asked leave to have a beautiful horse of his brought for
4998: Gwendolen to ride. Mrs. Davilow was to accompany her in the carriage,
4999: and they were to go to Diplow to lunch, Grandcourt conducting them. It
5000: was a fine mid-harvest time, not too warm for a noonday ride of five
5001: miles to be delightful; the poppies glowed on the borders of the
5002: fields, there was enough breeze to move gently like a social spirit
5003: among the ears of uncut corn, and to wing the shadow of a cloud across
5004: the soft gray downs; here the sheaves were standing, there the horses
5005: were straining their muscles under the last load from a wide space of
5006: stubble, but everywhere the green pasture made a broader setting for
5007: the corn-fields, and the cattle took their rest under wide branches.
5008: The road lay through a bit of country where the dairy-farms looked much
5009: as they did in the days of our forefathers—where peace and permanence
5010: seemed to find a home away from the busy change that sent the railway
5011: train flying in the distance.
5012: 
5013: But the spirit of peace and permanence did not penetrate poor Mrs.
5014: Davilow’s mind so as to overcome her habit of uneasy foreboding.
5015: Gwendolen and Grandcourt cantering in front of her, and then slackening
5016: their pace to a conversational walk till the carriage came up with them
5017: again, made a gratifying sight; but it served chiefly to keep up the
5018: conflict of hopes and fears about her daughter’s lot. Here was an
5019: irresistible opportunity for a lover to speak and put an end to all
5020: uncertainties, and Mrs. Davilow could only hope with trembling that
5021: Gwendolen’s decision would be favorable. Certainly if Rex’s love had
5022: been repugnant to her, Mr. Grandcourt had the advantage of being in
5023: complete contrast with Rex; and that he had produced some quite novel
5024: impression on her seemed evident in her marked abstinence from
5025: satirical observations, nay, her total silence about his
5026: characteristics, a silence which Mrs. Davilow did not dare to break.
5027: “Is he a man she would be happy with?”—was a question that inevitably
5028: arose in the mother’s mind. “Well, perhaps as happy as she would be
5029: with any one else—or as most other women are”—was the answer with
5030: which she tried to quiet herself; for she could not imagine Gwendolen
5031: under the influence of any feeling which would make her satisfied in
5032: what we traditionally call “mean circumstances.”
5033: 
5034: Grandcourt’s own thought was looking in the same direction: he wanted
5035: to have done with the uncertainty that belonged to his not having
5036: spoken. As to any further uncertainty—well, it was something without
5037: any reasonable basis, some quality in the air which acted as an
5038: irritant to his wishes.
5039: 
5040: Gwendolen enjoyed the riding, but her pleasure did not break forth in
5041: girlish unpremeditated chat and laughter as it did on that morning with
5042: Rex. She spoke a little, and even laughed, but with a lightness as of a
5043: far-off echo: for her too there was some peculiar quality in the
5044: air—not, she was sure, any subjugation of her will by Mr. Grandcourt,
5045: and the splendid prospects he meant to offer her; for Gwendolen desired
5046: every one, that dignified gentleman himself included, to understand
5047: that she was going to do just as she liked, and that they had better
5048: not calculate on her pleasing them. If she chose to take this husband,
5049: she would have him know that she was not going to renounce her freedom,
5050: or according to her favorite formula, “not going to do as other women
5051: did.”
5052: 
5053: Grandcourt’s speeches this morning were, as usual, all of that brief
5054: sort which never fails to make a conversational figure when the speaker
5055: is held important in his circle. Stopping so soon, they give signs of a
5056: suppressed and formidable ability so say more, and have also the
5057: meritorious quality of allowing lengthiness to others.
5058: 
5059: “How do you like Criterion’s paces?” he said, after they had entered
5060: the park and were slacking from a canter to a walk.
5061: 
5062: “He is delightful to ride. I should like to have a leap with him, if it
5063: would not frighten mamma. There was a good wide channel we passed five
5064: minutes ago. I should like to have a gallop back and take it.”
5065: 
5066: “Pray do. We can take it together.”
5067: 
5068: “No, thanks. Mamma is so timid—if she saw me it might make her ill.”
5069: 
5070: “Let me go and explain. Criterion would take it without fail.”
5071: 
5072: “No—indeed—you are very kind—but it would alarm her too much. I dare
5073: take any leap when she is not by; but I do it and don’t tell her about
5074: it.”
5075: 
5076: “We can let the carriage pass and then set off.”
5077: 
5078: “No, no, pray don’t think of it any more: I spoke quite randomly,” said
5079: Gwendolen; she began to feel a new objection to carrying out her own
5080: proposition.
5081: 
5082: “But Mrs. Davilow knows I shall take care of you.”
5083: 
5084: “Yes, but she would think of you as having to take care of my broken
5085: neck.”
5086: 
5087: There was a considerable pause before Grandcourt said, looking toward
5088: her, “I should like to have the right always to take care of you.”
5089: 
5090: Gwendolen did not turn her eyes on him; it seemed to her a long while
5091: that she was first blushing, and then turning pale, but to Grandcourt’s
5092: rate of judgment she answered soon enough, with the lightest flute-tone
5093: and a careless movement of the head, “Oh, I am not sure that I want to
5094: be taken care of: if I chose to risk breaking my neck, I should like to
5095: be at liberty to do it.”
5096: 
5097: She checked her horse as she spoke, and turned in her saddle, looking
5098: toward the advancing carriage. Her eyes swept across Grandcourt as she
5099: made this movement, but there was no language in them to correct the
5100: carelessness of her reply. At that very moment she was aware that she
5101: was risking something—not her neck, but the possibility of finally
5102: checking Grandcourt’s advances, and she did not feel contented with the
5103: possibility.
5104: 
5105: “Damn her!” thought Grandcourt, as he too checked his horse. He was not
5106: a wordy thinker, and this explosive phrase stood for mixed impressions
5107: which eloquent interpreters might have expanded into some sentences
5108: full of an irritated sense that he was being mystified, and a
5109: determination that this girl should not make a fool of him. Did she
5110: want him to throw himself at her feet and declare that he was dying for
5111: her? It was not by that gate that she could enter on the privileges he
5112: could give her. Or did she expect him to write his proposals? Equally a
5113: delusion. He would not make his offer in any way that could place him
5114: definitely in the position of being rejected. But as to her accepting
5115: him, she had done it already in accepting his marked attentions: and
5116: anything which happened to break them off would be understood to her
5117: disadvantage. She was merely coquetting, then?
5118: 
5119: However, the carriage came up, and no further _tête-à-tête_ could well
5120: occur before their arrival at the house, where there was abundant
5121: company, to whom Gwendolen, clad in riding-dress, with her hat laid
5122: aside, clad also in the repute of being chosen by Mr. Grandcourt, was
5123: naturally a centre of observation; and since the objectionable Mr. Lush
5124: was not there to look at her, this stimulus of admiring attention
5125: heightened her spirits, and dispersed, for the time, the uneasy
5126: consciousness of divided impulses which threatened her with repentance
5127: of her own acts. Whether Grandcourt had been offended or not there was
5128: no judging: his manners were unchanged, but Gwendolen’s acuteness had
5129: not gone deeper than to discern that his manners were no clue for her,
5130: and because these were unchanged she was not the less afraid of him.
5131: 
5132: She had not been at Diplow before except to dine; and since certain
5133: points of view from the windows and the garden were worth showing, Lady
5134: Flora Hollis proposed after luncheon, when some of the guests had
5135: dispersed, and the sun was sloping toward four o’clock, that the
5136: remaining party should make a little exploration. Here came frequent
5137: opportunities when Grandcourt might have retained Gwendolen apart, and
5138: have spoken to her unheard. But no! He indeed spoke to no one else, but
5139: what he said was nothing more eager or intimate than it had been in
5140: their first interview. He looked at her not less than usual; and some
5141: of her defiant spirit having come back, she looked full at him in
5142: return, not caring—rather preferring—that his eyes had no expression
5143: in them.
5144: 
5145: But at last it seemed as if he entertained some contrivance. After they
5146: had nearly made the tour of the grounds, the whole party stopped by the
5147: pool to be amused with Fetch’s accomplishment of bringing a water lily
5148: to the bank like Cowper’s spaniel Beau, and having been disappointed in
5149: his first attempt insisted on his trying again.
5150: 
5151: Here Grandcourt, who stood with Gwendolen outside the group, turned
5152: deliberately, and fixing his eyes on a knoll planted with American
5153: shrubs, and having a winding path up it, said languidly,
5154: 
5155: “This is a bore. Shall we go up there?”
5156: 
5157: “Oh, certainly—since we are exploring,” said Gwendolen. She was rather
5158: pleased, and yet afraid.
5159: 
5160: The path was too narrow for him to offer his arm, and they walked up in
5161: silence. When they were on the bit of platform at the summit,
5162: Grandcourt said,
5163: 
5164: “There is nothing to be seen here: the thing was not worth climbing.”
5165: 
5166: How was it that Gwendolen did not laugh? She was perfectly silent,
5167: holding up the folds of her robe like a statue, and giving a harder
5168: grasp to the handle of her whip, which she had snatched up
5169: automatically with her hat when they had first set off.
5170: 
5171: “What sort of a place do you prefer?” said Grandcourt.
5172: 
5173: “Different places are agreeable in their way. On the whole, I think, I
5174: prefer places that are open and cheerful. I am not fond of anything
5175: sombre.”
5176: 
5177: “Your place of Offendene is too sombre....”.
5178: 
5179: “It is, rather.”
5180: 
5181: “You will not remain there long, I hope.”
5182: 
5183: “Oh, yes, I think so. Mamma likes to be near her sister.”
5184: 
5185: Silence for a short space.
5186: 
5187: “It is not to be supposed that _you_ will always live there, though
5188: Mrs. Davilow may.”
5189: 
5190: “I don’t know. We women can’t go in search of adventures—to find out
5191: the North-West Passage or the source of the Nile, or to hunt tigers in
5192: the East. We must stay where we grow, or where the gardeners like to
5193: transplant us. We are brought up like the flowers, to look as pretty as
5194: we can, and be dull without complaining. That is my notion about the
5195: plants; they are often bored, and that is the reason why some of them
5196: have got poisonous. What do you think?” Gwendolen had run on rather
5197: nervously, lightly whipping the rhododendron bush in front of her.
5198: 
5199: “I quite agree. Most things are bores,” said Grandcourt, his mind
5200: having been pushed into an easy current, away from its intended track.
5201: But, after a moment’s pause, he continued in his broken, refined drawl,
5202: 
5203: “But a woman can be married.”
5204: 
5205: “Some women can.”
5206: 
5207: “You, certainly, unless you are obstinately cruel.”
5208: 
5209: “I am not sure that I am not both cruel and obstinate.” Here Gwendolen
5210: suddenly turned her head and looked full at Grandcourt, whose eyes she
5211: had felt to be upon her throughout their conversation. She was
5212: wondering what the effect of looking at him would be on herself rather
5213: than on him.
5214: 
5215: He stood perfectly still, half a yard or more away from her; and it
5216: flashed through her mind what a sort of lotus-eater’s stupor had begun
5217: in him and was taking possession of her. Then he said,
5218: 
5219: “Are you as uncertain about yourself as you make others about you?”
5220: 
5221: “I am quite uncertain about myself; I don’t know how uncertain others
5222: may be.”
5223: 
5224: “And you wish them to understand that you don’t care?” said Grandcourt,
5225: with a touch of new hardness in his tone.
5226: 
5227: “I did not say that,” Gwendolen replied, hesitatingly, and turning her
5228: eyes away whipped the rhododendron bush again. She wished she were on
5229: horseback that she might set off on a canter. It was impossible to set
5230: off running down the knoll.
5231: 
5232: “You do care, then,” said Grandcourt, not more quickly, but with a
5233: softened drawl.
5234: 
5235: “Ha! my whip!” said Gwendolen, in a little scream of distress. She had
5236: let it go—what could be more natural in a slight agitation?—and—but
5237: this seemed less natural in a gold-handled whip which had been left
5238: altogether to itself—it had gone with some force over the immediate
5239: shrubs, and had lodged itself in the branches of an azalea half-way
5240: down the knoll. She could run down now, laughing prettily, and
5241: Grandcourt was obliged to follow; but she was beforehand with him in
5242: rescuing the whip, and continued on her way to the level ground, when
5243: she paused and looked at Grandcourt with an exasperating brightness in
5244: her glance and a heightened color, as if she had carried a triumph, and
5245: these indications were still noticeable to Mrs. Davilow when Gwendolen
5246: and Grandcourt joined the rest of the party.
5247: 
5248: “It is all coquetting,” thought Grandcourt; “the next time I beckon she
5249: will come down.”
5250: 
5251: It seemed to him likely that this final beckoning might happen the very
5252: next day, when there was to be a picnic archery meeting in Cardell
5253: Chase, according to the plan projected on the evening of the ball.
5254: 
5255: Even in Gwendolen’s mind that result was one of two likelihoods that
5256: presented themselves alternately, one of two decisions toward which she
5257: was being precipitated, as if they were two sides of a boundary-line,
5258: and she did not know on which she should fall. This subjection to a
5259: possible self, a self not to be absolutely predicted about, caused her
5260: some astonishment and terror; her favorite key of life—doing as she
5261: liked—seemed to fail her, and she could not foresee what at a given
5262: moment she might like to do. The prospect of marrying Grandcourt really
5263: seemed more attractive to her than she had believed beforehand that any
5264: marriage could be: the dignities, the luxuries, the power of doing a
5265: great deal of what she liked to do, which had now come close to her,
5266: and within her choice to secure or to lose, took hold of her nature as
5267: if it had been the strong odor of what she had only imagined and longed
5268: for before. And Grandcourt himself? He seemed as little of a flaw in
5269: his fortunes as a lover and husband could possibly be. Gwendolen wished
5270: to mount the chariot and drive the plunging horses herself, with a
5271: spouse by her side who would fold his arms and give her his countenance
5272: without looking ridiculous. Certainly, with all her perspicacity, and
5273: all the reading which seemed to her mamma dangerously instructive, her
5274: judgment was consciously a little at fault before Grandcourt. He was
5275: adorably quiet and free from absurdities—he would be a husband to suit
5276: with the best appearance a woman could make. But what else was he? He
5277: had been everywhere, and seen everything. _That_ was desirable, and
5278: especially gratifying as a preamble to his supreme preference for
5279: Gwendolen Harleth. He did not appear to enjoy anything much. That was
5280: not necessary: and the less he had of particular tastes, or desires,
5281: the more freedom his wife was likely to have in following hers.
5282: Gwendolen conceived that after marriage she would most probably be able
5283: to manage him thoroughly.
5284: 
5285: How was it that he caused her unusual constraint now?—that she was
5286: less daring and playful in her talk with him than with any other
5287: admirer she had known? That absence of demonstrativeness which she was
5288: glad of, acted as a charm in more senses than one, and was slightly
5289: benumbing. Grandcourt after all was formidable—a handsome lizard of a
5290: hitherto unknown species, not of the lively, darting kind. But
5291: Gwendolen knew hardly anything about lizards, and ignorance gives one a
5292: large range of probabilities. This splendid specimen was probably
5293: gentle, suitable as a boudoir pet: what may not a lizard be, if you
5294: know nothing to the contrary? Her acquaintance with Grandcourt was such
5295: that no accomplishment suddenly revealed in him would have surprised
5296: her. And he was so little suggestive of drama, that it hardly occurred
5297: to her to think with any detail how his life of thirty-six years had
5298: been passed: in general, she imagined him always cold and dignified,
5299: not likely ever to have committed himself. He had hunted the tiger—had
5300: he ever been in love or made love? The one experience and the other
5301: seemed alike remote in Gwendolen’s fancy from the Mr. Grandcourt who
5302: had come to Diplow in order apparently to make a chief epoch in her
5303: destiny—perhaps by introducing her to that state of marriage which she
5304: had resolved to make a state of greater freedom than her girlhood. And
5305: on the whole she wished to marry him; he suited her purpose; her
5306: prevailing, deliberate intention was, to accept him.
5307: 
5308: But was she going to fulfill her deliberate intention? She began to be
5309: afraid of herself, and to find out a certain difficulty in doing as she
5310: liked. Already her assertion of independence in evading his advances
5311: had been carried farther than was necessary, and she was thinking with
5312: some anxiety what she might do on the next occasion.
5313: 
5314: Seated according to her habit with her back to the horses on their
5315: drive homeward, she was completely under the observation of her mamma,
5316: who took the excitement and changefulness in the expression of her
5317: eyes, her unwonted absence of mind and total silence, as unmistakable
5318: signs that something unprecedented had occurred between her and
5319: Grandcourt. Mrs. Davilow’s uneasiness determined her to risk some
5320: speech on the subject: the Gascoignes were to dine at Offendene, and in
5321: what had occurred this morning there might be some reason for
5322: consulting the rector; not that she expected him anymore than herself
5323: to influence Gwendolen, but that her anxious mind wanted to be
5324: disburdened.
5325: 
5326: “Something has happened, dear?” she began, in a tender tone of question.
5327: 
5328: Gwendolen looked round, and seeming to be roused to the consciousness
5329: of her physical self, took off her gloves and then her hat, that the
5330: soft breeze might blow on her head. They were in a retired bit of the
5331: road, where the long afternoon shadows from the bordering trees fell
5332: across it and no observers were within sight. Her eyes continued to
5333: meet her mother’s, but she did not speak.
5334: 
5335: “Mr. Grandcourt has been saying something?—Tell me, dear.” The last
5336: words were uttered beseechingly.
5337: 
5338: “What am I to tell you, mamma?” was the perverse answer.
5339: 
5340: “I am sure something has agitated you. You ought to confide in me,
5341: Gwen. You ought not to leave me in doubt and anxiety.” Mrs. Davilow’s
5342: eyes filled with tears.
5343: 
5344: “Mamma, dear, please don’t be miserable,” said Gwendolen, with pettish
5345: remonstrance. “It only makes me more so. I am in doubt myself.”
5346: 
5347: “About Mr. Grandcourt’s intentions?” said Mrs. Davilow, gathering
5348: determination from her alarms.
5349: 
5350: “No; not at all,” said Gwendolen, with some curtness, and a pretty
5351: little toss of the head as she put on her hat again.
5352: 
5353: “About whether you will accept him, then?”
5354: 
5355: “Precisely.”
5356: 
5357: “Have you given him a doubtful answer?”
5358: 
5359: “I have given him no answer at all.”
5360: 
5361: “He _has_ spoken so that you could not misunderstand him?”
5362: 
5363: “As far as I would let him speak.”
5364: 
5365: “You expect him to persevere?” Mrs. Davilow put this question rather
5366: anxiously, and receiving no answer, asked another: “You don’t consider
5367: that you have discouraged him?”
5368: 
5369: “I dare say not.”
5370: 
5371: “I thought you liked him, dear,” said Mrs. Davilow, timidly.
5372: 
5373: “So I do, mamma, as liking goes. There is less to dislike about him
5374: than about most men. He is quiet and _distingué_.” Gwendolen so far
5375: spoke with a pouting sort of gravity; but suddenly she recovered some
5376: of her mischievousness, and her face broke into a smile as she
5377: added—“Indeed he has all the qualities that would make a husband
5378: tolerable—battlement, veranda, stable, etc., no grins and no glass in
5379: his eye.”
5380: 
5381: “Do be serious with me for a moment, dear. Am I to understand that you
5382: mean to accept him?”
5383: 
5384: “Oh, pray, mamma, leave me to myself,” said Gwendolen, with a pettish
5385: distress in her voice.
5386: 
5387: And Mrs. Davilow said no more.
5388: 
5389: When they got home Gwendolen declared that she would not dine. She was
5390: tired, and would come down in the evening after she had taken some
5391: rest. The probability that her uncle would hear what had passed did not
5392: trouble her. She was convinced that whatever he might say would be on
5393: the side of her accepting Grandcourt, and she wished to accept him if
5394: she could. At this moment she would willingly have had weights hung on
5395: her own caprice.
5396: 
5397: Mr. Gascoigne did hear—not Gwendolen’s answers repeated verbatim, but
5398: a softened generalized account of them. The mother conveyed as vaguely
5399: as the keen rector’s questions would let her the impression that
5400: Gwendolen was in some uncertainty about her own mind, but inclined on
5401: the whole to acceptance. The result was that the uncle felt himself
5402: called on to interfere; he did not conceive that he should do his duty
5403: in witholding direction from his niece in a momentous crisis of this
5404: kind. Mrs. Davilow ventured a hesitating opinion that perhaps it would
5405: be safer to say nothing—Gwendolen was so sensitive (she did not like
5406: to say willful). But the rector’s was a firm mind, grasping its first
5407: judgments tenaciously and acting on them promptly, whence
5408: counter-judgments were no more for him than shadows fleeting across the
5409: solid ground to which he adjusted himself.
5410: 
5411: This match with Grandcourt presented itself to him as a sort of public
5412: affair; perhaps there were ways in which it might even strengthen the
5413: establishment. To the rector, whose father (nobody would have suspected
5414: it, and nobody was told) had risen to be a provincial corn-dealer,
5415: aristocratic heirship resembled regal heirship in excepting its
5416: possessor from the ordinary standard of moral judgments, Grandcourt,
5417: the almost certain baronet, the probable peer, was to be ranged with
5418: public personages, and was a match to be accepted on broad general
5419: grounds national and ecclesiastical. Such public personages, it is
5420: true, are often in the nature of giants which an ancient community may
5421: have felt pride and safety in possessing, though, regarded privately,
5422: these born eminences must often have been inconvenient and even
5423: noisome. But of the future husband personally Mr. Gascoigne was
5424: disposed to think the best. Gossip is a sort of smoke that comes from
5425: the dirty tobacco-pipes of those who diffuse it: it proves nothing
5426: but the bad taste of the smoker. But if Grandcourt had really made any
5427: deeper or more unfortunate experiments in folly than were common in
5428: young men of high prospects, he was of an age to have finished them.
5429: All accounts can be suitably wound up when a man has not ruined
5430: himself, and the expense may be taken as an insurance against future
5431: error. This was the view of practical wisdom; with reference to higher
5432: views, repentance had a supreme moral and religious value. There was
5433: every reason to believe that a woman of well-regulated mind would be
5434: happy with Grandcourt.
5435: 
5436: It was no surprise to Gwendolen on coming down to tea to be told that
5437: her uncle wished to see her in the dining-room. He threw aside the
5438: paper as she entered and greeted her with his usual kindness. As his
5439: wife had remarked, he always “made much” of Gwendolen, and her
5440: importance had risen of late. “My dear,” he said, in a fatherly way,
5441: moving a chair for her as he held her hand, “I want to speak to you on
5442: a subject which is more momentous than any other with regard to your
5443: welfare. You will guess what I mean. But I shall speak to you with
5444: perfect directness: in such matters I consider myself bound to act as
5445: your father. You have no objection, I hope?”
5446: 
5447: “Oh dear, no, uncle. You have always been very kind to me,” said
5448: Gwendolen, frankly. This evening she was willing, if it were possible,
5449: to be a little fortified against her troublesome self, and her
5450: resistant temper was in abeyance. The rector’s mode of speech always
5451: conveyed a thrill of authority, as of a word of command: it seemed to
5452: take for granted that there could be no wavering in the audience, and
5453: that every one was going to be rationally obedient.
5454: 
5455: “It is naturally a satisfaction to me that the prospect of a marriage
5456: for you—advantageous in the highest degree—has presented itself so
5457: early. I do not know exactly what has passed between you and Mr.
5458: Grandcourt, but I presume there can be little doubt, from the way in
5459: which he has distinguished you, that he desires to make you his wife.”
5460: 
5461: Gwendolen did not speak immediately, and her uncle said with more
5462: emphasis,
5463: 
5464: “Have you any doubt of that yourself, my dear?”
5465: 
5466: “I suppose that is what he has been thinking of. But he may have
5467: changed his mind to-morrow,” said Gwendolen.
5468: 
5469: “Why to-morrow? Has he made advances which you have discouraged?”
5470: 
5471: “I think he meant—he began to make advances—but I did not encourage
5472: them. I turned the conversation.”
5473: 
5474: “Will you confide in me so far as to tell me your reasons?”
5475: 
5476: “I am not sure that I had any reasons, uncle.” Gwendolen laughed rather
5477: artificially.
5478: 
5479: “You are quite capable of reflecting, Gwendolen. You are aware that
5480: this is not a trivial occasion, and it concerns your establishment for
5481: life under circumstances which may not occur again. You have a duty
5482: here both to yourself and your family. I wish to understand whether you
5483: have any ground for hesitating as to your acceptance of Mr. Grandcourt.”
5484: 
5485: “I suppose I hesitate without grounds.” Gwendolen spoke rather
5486: poutingly, and her uncle grew suspicious.
5487: 
5488: “Is he disagreeable to you personally?”
5489: 
5490: “No.”
5491: 
5492: “Have you heard anything of him which has affected you disagreeably?”
5493: The rector thought it impossible that Gwendolen could have heard the
5494: gossip he had heard, but in any case he must endeavor to put all things
5495: in the right light for her.
5496: 
5497: “I have heard nothing about him except that he is a great match,” said
5498: Gwendolen, with some sauciness; “and that affects me very agreeably.”
5499: 
5500: “Then, my dear Gwendolen, I have nothing further to say than this: you
5501: hold your fortune in your own hands—a fortune such as rarely happens
5502: to a girl in your circumstances—a fortune in fact which almost takes
5503: the question out of the range of mere personal feeling, and makes your
5504: acceptance of it a duty. If Providence offers you power and
5505: position—especially when unclogged by any conditions that are
5506: repugnant to you—your course is one of responsibility, into which
5507: caprice must not enter. A man does not like to have his attachment
5508: trifled with: he may not be at once repelled—these things are matters
5509: of individual disposition. But the trifling may be carried too far. And
5510: I must point out to you that in case Mr. Grandcourt were repelled
5511: without your having refused him—without your having intended
5512: ultimately to refuse him, your situation would be a humiliating and
5513: painful one. I, for my part, should regard you with severe
5514: disapprobation, as the victim of nothing else than your own coquetry
5515: and folly.”
5516: 
5517: Gwendolen became pallid as she listened to this admonitory speech. The
5518: ideas it raised had the force of sensations. Her resistant courage
5519: would not help her here, because her uncle was not urging her against
5520: her own resolve; he was pressing upon her the motives of dread which
5521: she already felt; he was making her more conscious of the risks that
5522: lay within herself. She was silent, and the rector observed that he had
5523: produced some strong effect.
5524: 
5525: “I mean this in kindness, my dear.” His tone had softened.
5526: 
5527: “I am aware of that, uncle,” said Gwendolen, rising and shaking her
5528: head back, as if to rouse herself out of painful passivity. “I am not
5529: foolish. I know that I must be married some time—before it is too
5530: late. And I don’t see how I could do better than marry Mr. Grandcourt.
5531: I mean to accept him, if possible.” She felt as if she were reinforcing
5532: herself by speaking with this decisiveness to her uncle.
5533: 
5534: But the rector was a little startled by so bare a version of his own
5535: meaning from those young lips. He wished that in her mind his advice
5536: should be taken in an infusion of sentiments proper to a girl, and such
5537: as are presupposed in the advice of a clergyman, although he may not
5538: consider them always appropriate to be put forward. He wished his niece
5539: parks, carriages, a title—everything that would make this world a
5540: pleasant abode; but he wished her not to be cynical—to be, on the
5541: contrary, religiously dutiful, and have warm domestic affections.
5542: 
5543: “My dear Gwendolen,” he said, rising also, and speaking with benignant
5544: gravity, “I trust that you will find in marriage a new fountain of duty
5545: and affection. Marriage is the only true and satisfactory sphere of a
5546: woman, and if your marriage with Mr. Grandcourt should be happily
5547: decided upon, you will have, probably, an increasing power, both of
5548: rank and wealth, which may be used for the benefit of others. These
5549: considerations are something higher than romance! You are fitted by
5550: natural gifts for a position which, considering your birth and early
5551: prospects, could hardly be looked forward to as in the ordinary course
5552: of things; and I trust that you will grace it, not only by those
5553: personal gifts, but by a good and consistent life.”
5554: 
5555: “I hope mamma will be the happier,” said Gwendolen, in a more cheerful
5556: way, lifting her hands backward to her neck and moving toward the door.
5557: She wanted to waive those higher considerations.
5558: 
5559: Mr. Gascoigne felt that he had come to a satisfactory understanding
5560: with his niece, and had furthered her happy settlement in life by
5561: furthering her engagement to Grandcourt. Meanwhile there was another
5562: person to whom the contemplation of that issue had been a motive for
5563: some activity, and who believed that he, too, on this particular day
5564: had done something toward bringing about a favorable decision in _his_
5565: sense—which happened to be the reverse of the rector’s.
5566: 
5567: Mr. Lush’s absence from Diplow during Gwendolen’s visit had been due,
5568: not to any fear on his part of meeting that supercilious young lady, or
5569: of being abashed by her frank dislike, but to an engagement from which
5570: he expected important consequences. He was gone, in fact, to the
5571: Wanchester station to meet a lady, accompanied by a maid and two
5572: children, whom he put into a fly, and afterward followed to the hotel
5573: of the Golden Keys, in that town. An impressive woman, whom many would
5574: turn to look at again in passing; her figure was slim and sufficiently
5575: tall, her face rather emaciated, so that its sculpturesque beauty was
5576: the more pronounced, her crisp hair perfectly black, and her large,
5577: anxious eyes what we call black. Her dress was soberly correct, her
5578: age, perhaps, physically more advanced than the number of years would
5579: imply, but hardly less than seven-and-thirty. An uneasy-looking woman:
5580: her glance seemed to presuppose that the people and things were going
5581: to be unfavorable to her, while she was, nevertheless, ready to meet
5582: them with resolution. The children were lovely—a dark-haired girl of
5583: six or more, a fairer boy of five. When Lush incautiously expressed
5584: some surprise at her having brought the children, she said, with a
5585: sharp-toned intonation,
5586: 
5587: “Did you suppose I should come wandering about here by myself? Why
5588: should I not bring all four if I liked?”
5589: 
5590: “Oh, certainly,” said Lush, with his usual fluent _nonchalance_.
5591: 
5592: He stayed an hour or so in conference with her, and rode back to Diplow
5593: in a state of mind that was at once hopeful and busily anxious as to
5594: the execution of the little plan on which his hopefulness was based.
5595: Grandcourt’s marriage to Gwendolen Harleth would not, he believed, be
5596: much of a good to either of them, and it would plainly be fraught with
5597: disagreeables to himself. But now he felt confident enough to say
5598: inwardly, “I will take, nay, I will lay odds that the marriage will
5599: never happen.”
5600: 
5601: 
5602: 
5603: 
5604: CHAPTER XIV.
5605: 
5606:   I will not clothe myself in wreck—wear gems
5607:   Sawed from cramped finger-bones of women drowned;
5608:   Feel chilly vaporous hands of ireful ghosts
5609:   Clutching my necklace: trick my maiden breast
5610:   With orphans’ heritage. Let your dead love
5611:   Marry its dead.
5612: 
5613: 
5614: Gwendolen looked lovely and vigorous as a tall, newly-opened lily the
5615: next morning: there was a reaction of young energy in her, and
5616: yesterday’s self-distrust seemed no more than the transient shiver on
5617: the surface of a full stream. The roving archery match in Cardell Chase
5618: was a delightful prospect for the sport’s sake: she felt herself
5619: beforehand moving about like a wood-nymph under the beeches (in
5620: appreciative company), and the imagined scene lent a charm to further
5621: advances on the part of Grandcourt—not an impassioned lyrical Daphnis
5622: for the wood-nymph, certainly: but so much the better. To-day Gwendolen
5623: foresaw him making slow conversational approaches to a declaration, and
5624: foresaw herself awaiting and encouraging it according to the rational
5625: conclusion which she had expressed to her uncle.
5626: 
5627: When she came down to breakfast (after every one had left the table
5628: except Mrs. Davilow) there were letters on her plate. One of them she
5629: read with a gathering smile, and then handed it to her mamma, who, on
5630: returning it, smiled also, finding new cheerfulness in the good spirits
5631: her daughter had shown ever since waking, and said,
5632: 
5633: “You don’t feel inclined to go a thousand miles away?”
5634: 
5635: “Not exactly so far.”
5636: 
5637: “It was a sad omission not to have written again before this. Can’t you
5638: write now—before we set out this morning?”
5639: 
5640: “It is not so pressing. To-morrow will do. You see they leave town
5641: to-day. I must write to Dover. They will be there till Monday.”
5642: 
5643: “Shall I write for you, dear—if it teases you?”
5644: 
5645: Gwendolen did not speak immediately, but after sipping her coffee,
5646: answered brusquely, “Oh no, let it be; I will write to-morrow.” Then,
5647: feeling a touch of compunction, she looked up and said with playful
5648: tenderness, “Dear, old, beautiful mamma!”
5649: 
5650: “Old, child, truly.”
5651: 
5652: “Please don’t, mamma! I meant old for darling. You are hardly
5653: twenty-five years older than I am. When you talk in that way my life
5654: shrivels up before me.”
5655: 
5656: “One can have a great deal of happiness in twenty-five years, my dear.”
5657: 
5658: “I must lose no time in beginning,” said Gwendolen, merrily. “The
5659: sooner I get my palaces and coaches the better.”
5660: 
5661: “And a good husband who adores you, Gwen,” said Mrs. Davilow,
5662: encouragingly.
5663: 
5664: Gwendolen put out her lips saucily and said nothing.
5665: 
5666: It was a slight drawback on her pleasure in starting that the rector
5667: was detained by magistrate’s business, and would probably not be able
5668: to get to Cardell Chase at all that day. She cared little that Mrs.
5669: Gascoigne and Anna chose not to go without him, but her uncle’s
5670: presence would have seemed to make it a matter of course that the
5671: decision taken would be acted on. For decision in itself began to be
5672: formidable. Having come close to accepting Grandcourt, Gwendolen felt
5673: this lot of unhoped-for fullness rounding itself too definitely. When
5674: we take to wishing a great deal for ourselves, whatever we get soon
5675: turns into mere limitation and exclusion. Still there was the
5676: reassuring thought that marriage would be the gate into a larger
5677: freedom.
5678: 
5679: The place of meeting was a grassy spot called Green Arbor, where a bit
5680: of hanging wood made a sheltering amphitheatre. It was here that the
5681: coachful of servants with provisions had to prepare the picnic meal;
5682: and the warden of the Chase was to guide the roving archers so as to
5683: keep them within the due distance from this centre, and hinder them
5684: from wandering beyond the limit which had been fixed on—a curve that
5685: might be drawn through certain well-known points, such as the double
5686: Oak, the Whispering Stones, and the High Cross. The plan was to take
5687: only a preliminary stroll before luncheon, keeping the main roving
5688: expedition for the more exquisite lights of the afternoon. The muster
5689: was rapid enough to save every one from dull moments of waiting, and
5690: when the groups began to scatter themselves through the light and
5691: shadow made here by closely neighboring beeches and there by rarer
5692: oaks, one may suppose that a painter would have been glad to look on.
5693: This roving archery was far prettier than the stationary game, but
5694: success in shooting at variable marks were less favored by practice,
5695: and the hits were distributed among the volunteer archers otherwise
5696: than they would have been in target-shooting. From this cause, perhaps,
5697: as well as from the twofold distraction of being preoccupied and
5698: wishing not to betray her preoccupation, Gwendolen did not greatly
5699: distinguish herself in these first experiments, unless it were by the
5700: lively grace with which she took her comparative failure. She was in
5701: white and green as on the day of the former meeting, when it made an
5702: epoch for her that she was introduced to Grandcourt; he was continually
5703: by her side now, yet it would have been hard to tell from mere looks
5704: and manners that their relation to each other had at all changed since
5705: their first conversation. Still there were other grounds that made most
5706: persons conclude them to be, if not engaged already, on the eve of
5707: being so. And she believed this herself. As they were all returning
5708: toward Green Arbor in divergent groups, not thinking at all of taking
5709: aim but merely chattering, words passed which seemed really the
5710: beginning of that end—the beginning of her acceptance. Grandcourt
5711: said, “Do you know how long it is since I first saw you in this dress?”
5712: 
5713: “The archery meeting was on the 25th, and this is the 13th,” said
5714: Gwendolen, laughingly. “I am not good at calculating, but I will
5715: venture to say that it must be nearly three weeks.”
5716: 
5717: A little pause, and then he said, “That is a great loss of time.”
5718: 
5719: “That your knowing me has caused you? Pray don’t be uncomplimentary; I
5720: don’t like it.”
5721: 
5722: Pause again. “It is because of the gain that I feel the loss.”
5723: 
5724: Here Gwendolen herself left a pause. She was thinking, “He is really
5725: very ingenious. He never speaks stupidly.” Her silence was so unusual
5726: that it seemed the strongest of favorable answers, and he continued:
5727: 
5728: “The gain of knowing you makes me feel the time I lose in uncertainty.
5729: Do _you_ like uncertainty?”
5730: 
5731: “I think I do, rather,” said Gwendolen, suddenly beaming on him with a
5732: playful smile. “There is more in it.”
5733: 
5734: Grandcourt met her laughing eyes with a slow, steady look right into
5735: them, which seemed like vision in the abstract, and then said, “Do you
5736: mean more torment for me?”
5737: 
5738: There was something so strange to Gwendolen in this moment that she was
5739: quite shaken out of her usual self-consciousness. Blushing and turning
5740: away her eyes, she said, “No, that would make me sorry.”
5741: 
5742: Grandcourt would have followed up this answer, which the change in her
5743: manner made apparently decisive of her favorable intention; but he was
5744: not in any way overcome so as to be unaware that they were now, within
5745: sight of everybody, descending the space into Green Arbor, and
5746: descending it at an ill-chosen point where it began to be
5747: inconveniently steep. This was a reason for offering his hand in the
5748: literal sense to help her; she took it, and they came down in silence,
5749: much observed by those already on the level—among others by Mrs.
5750: Arrowpoint, who happened to be standing with Mrs. Davilow. That lady
5751: had now made up her mind that Grandcourt’s merits were not such as
5752: would have induced Catherine to accept him, Catherine having so high a
5753: standard as to have refused Lord Slogan. Hence she looked at the tenant
5754: of Diplow with dispassionate eyes.
5755: 
5756: “Mr. Grandcourt is not equal as a man to his uncle, Sir Hugo
5757: Mallinger—too languid. To be sure, Mr. Grandcourt is a much younger
5758: man, but I shouldn’t wonder if Sir Hugo were to outlive him,
5759: notwithstanding the difference of years. It is ill calculating on
5760: successions,” concluded Mrs. Arrowpoint, rather too loudly.
5761: 
5762: “It is indeed,” said Mrs. Davilow, able to assent with quiet
5763: cheerfulness, for she was so well satisfied with the actual situation
5764: of affairs that her habitual melancholy in their general
5765: unsatisfactoriness was altogether in abeyance.
5766: 
5767: I am not concerned to tell of the food that was eaten in that green
5768: refectory, or even to dwell on the stories of the forest scenery that
5769: spread themselves out beyond the level front of the hollow; being just
5770: now bound to tell a story of life at a stage when the blissful beauty
5771: of earth and sky entered only by narrow and oblique inlets into the
5772: consciousness, which was busy with a small social drama almost as
5773: little penetrated by a feeling of wider relations as if it had been a
5774: puppet-show. It will be understood that the food and champagne were of
5775: the best—the talk and laughter too, in the sense of belonging to the
5776: best society, where no one makes an invidious display of anything in
5777: particular, and the advantages of the world are taken with that
5778: high-bred depreciation which follows from being accustomed to them.
5779: Some of the gentlemen strolled a little and indulged in a cigar, there
5780: being a sufficient interval before four o’clock—the time for
5781: beginning to rove again. Among these, strange to say, was Grandcourt;
5782: but not Mr. Lush, who seemed to be taking his pleasure quite generously
5783: to-day by making himself particularly serviceable, ordering everything
5784: for everybody, and by this activity becoming more than ever a blot on
5785: the scene to Gwendolen, though he kept himself amiably aloof from her,
5786: and never even looked at her obviously. When there was a general move
5787: to prepare for starting, it appeared that the bows had all been put
5788: under the charge of Lord Brackenshaw’s valet, and Mr. Lush was
5789: concerned to save ladies the trouble of fetching theirs from the
5790: carriage where they were propped. He did not intend to bring
5791: Gwendolen’s, but she, fearful lest he should do so, hurried to fetch it
5792: herself. The valet, seeing her approach, met her with it, and in giving
5793: it into her hand gave also a letter addressed to her. She asked no
5794: question about it, perceived at a glance that the address was in a
5795: lady’s handwriting (of the delicate kind which used to be esteemed
5796: feminine before the present uncial period), and moving away with her
5797: bow in her hand, saw Mr. Lush coming to fetch other bows. To avoid
5798: meeting him she turned aside and walked with her back toward the stand
5799: of carriages, opening the letter. It contained these words,
5800: 
5801:     If Miss Harleth is in doubt whether she should accept Mr. Grandcourt,
5802:     let her break from her party after they have passed the Whispering
5803:     Stones and return to that spot. She will then hear something to decide
5804:     her; but she can only hear it by keeping this letter a strict secret
5805:     from every one. If she does not act according to this letter, she will
5806:     repent, as the woman who writes it has repented. The secrecy Miss
5807:     Harleth will feel herself bound in honor to guard.
5808: 
5809: Gwendolen felt an inward shock, but her immediate thought was, “It is
5810: come in time.” It lay in her youthfulness that she was absorbed by the
5811: idea of the revelation to be made, and had not even a momentary
5812: suspicion of contrivance that could justify her in showing the letter.
5813: Her mind gathered itself up at once into the resolution, that she would
5814: manage to go unobserved to the Whispering Stones; and thrusting the
5815: letter into her pocket she turned back to rejoin the company, with that
5816: sense of having something to conceal which to her nature had a bracing
5817: quality and helped her to be mistress of herself.
5818: 
5819: It was a surprise to every one that Grandcourt was not, like the other
5820: smokers, on the spot in time to set out roving with the rest. “We shall
5821: alight on him by-and-by,” said Lord Brackenshaw; “he can’t be gone
5822: far.” At any rate, no man could be waited for. This apparent
5823: forgetfulness might be taken for the distraction of a lover so absorbed
5824: in thinking of the beloved object as to forget an appointment which
5825: would bring him into her actual presence. And the good-natured Earl
5826: gave Gwendolen a distant jocose hint to that effect, which she took
5827: with suitable quietude. But the thought in her mind was “Can he too be
5828: starting away from a decision?” It was not exactly a pleasant thought
5829: to her; but it was near the truth. “Starting away,” however, was not
5830: the right expression for the languor of intention that came over
5831: Grandcourt, like a fit of diseased numbness, when an end seemed within
5832: easy reach: to desist then, when all expectation was to the contrary,
5833: became another gratification of mere will, sublimely independent of
5834: definite motive. At that moment he had begun a second large cigar in a
5835: vague, hazy obstinacy which, if Lush or any other mortal who might be
5836: insulted with impunity had interrupted by overtaking him with a request
5837: for his return, would have expressed itself by a slow removal of his
5838: cigar, to say in an undertone, “You’ll be kind enough to go to the
5839: devil, will you?”
5840: 
5841: But he was not interrupted, and the rovers set off without any visible
5842: depression of spirits, leaving behind only a few of the less vigorous
5843: ladies, including Mrs. Davilow, who preferred a quiet stroll free from
5844: obligation to keep up with others. The enjoyment of the day was soon at
5845: its highest pitch, the archery getting more spirited and the changing
5846: scenes of the forest from roofed grove to open glade growing lovelier
5847: with the lengthening shadows, and the deeply-felt but undefinable
5848: gradations of the mellowing afternoon. It was agreed that they were
5849: playing an extemporized _As you like it_; and when a pretty compliment
5850: had been turned to Gwendolen about her having the part of Rosalind, she
5851: felt the more compelled to be surpassing in loveliness. This was not
5852: very difficult to her, for the effect of what had happened to-day was
5853: an excitement which needed a vent—a sense of adventure rather than
5854: alarm, and a straining toward the management of her retreat, so as not
5855: to be impeded.
5856: 
5857: The roving had been lasting nearly an hour before the arrival at the
5858: Whispering Stones, two tall conical blocks that leaned toward each
5859: other like gigantic gray-mantled figures. They were soon surveyed and
5860: passed by with the remark that they would be good ghosts on a starlit
5861: night. But a soft sunlight was on them now, and Gwendolen felt daring.
5862: The stones were near a fine grove of beeches, where the archers found
5863: plenty of marks.
5864: 
5865: “How far are we from Green Arbor now?” said Gwendolen, having got in
5866: front by the side of the warden.
5867: 
5868: “Oh, not more than half a mile, taking along the avenue we’re going to
5869: cross up there: but I shall take round a couple of miles, by the High
5870: Cross.”
5871: 
5872: She was falling back among the rest, when suddenly they seemed all to
5873: be hurrying obliquely forward under the guidance of Mr. Lush, and
5874: lingering a little where she was, she perceived her opportunity of
5875: slipping away. Soon she was out of sight, and without running she
5876: seemed to herself to fly along the ground and count the moments nothing
5877: till she found herself back again at the Whispering Stones. They turned
5878: their blank gray sides to her: what was there on the other side? If
5879: there were nothing after all? That was her only dread now—to have to
5880: turn back again in mystification; and walking round the right-hand
5881: stone without pause, she found herself in front of some one whose large
5882: dark eyes met hers at a foot’s distance. In spite of expectation, she
5883: was startled and shrank bank, but in doing so she could take in the
5884: whole figure of this stranger and perceive that she was unmistakably a
5885: lady, and one who must have been exceedingly handsome. She perceived,
5886: also, that a few yards from her were two children seated on the grass.
5887: 
5888: “Miss Harleth?” said the lady.
5889: 
5890: “Yes.” All Gwendolen’s consciousness was wonder.
5891: 
5892: “Have you accepted Mr. Grandcourt?”
5893: 
5894: “No.”
5895: 
5896: “I have promised to tell you something. And you will promise to keep my
5897: secret. However you may decide you will not tell Mr. Grandcourt, or any
5898: one else, that you have seen me?”
5899: 
5900: “I promise.”
5901: 
5902: “My name is Lydia Glasher. Mr. Grandcourt ought not to marry any one
5903: but me. I left my husband and child for him nine years ago. Those two
5904: children are his, and we have two others—girls—who are older. My
5905: husband is dead now, and Mr. Grandcourt ought to marry me. He ought to
5906: make that boy his heir.”
5907: 
5908: She looked at the boy as she spoke, and Gwendolen’s eyes followed hers.
5909: The handsome little fellow was puffing out his cheeks in trying to blow
5910: a tiny trumpet which remained dumb. His hat hung backward by a string,
5911: and his brown curls caught the sun-rays. He was a cherub.
5912: 
5913: The two women’s eyes met again, and Gwendolen said proudly, “I will not
5914: interfere with your wishes.” She looked as if she were shivering, and
5915: her lips were pale.
5916: 
5917: “You are very attractive, Miss Harleth. But when he first knew me, I
5918: too was young. Since then my life has been broken up and embittered. It
5919: is not fair that he should be happy and I miserable, and my boy thrust
5920: out of sight for another.”
5921: 
5922: These words were uttered with a biting accent, but with a determined
5923: abstinence from anything violent in tone or manner. Gwendolen, watching
5924: Mrs. Glasher’s face while she spoke, felt a sort of terror: it was as
5925: if some ghastly vision had come to her in a dream and said, “I am a
5926: woman’s life.”
5927: 
5928: “Have you anything more to say to me?” she asked in a low tone, but
5929: still proud and coldly. The revulsion within her was not tending to
5930: soften her. Everyone seemed hateful.
5931: 
5932: “Nothing. You know what I wished you to know. You can inquire about me
5933: if you like. My husband was Colonel Glasher.”
5934: 
5935: “Then I will go,” said Gwendolen, moving away with a ceremonious
5936: inclination, which was returned with equal grace.
5937: 
5938: In a few minutes Gwendolen was in the beech grove again but her party
5939: had gone out of sight and apparently had not sent in search of her, for
5940: all was solitude till she had reached the avenue pointed out by the
5941: warden. She determined to take this way back to Green Arbor, which she
5942: reached quickly; rapid movements seeming to her just now a means of
5943: suspending the thoughts which might prevent her from behaving with due
5944: calm. She had already made up her mind what step she would take.
5945: 
5946: Mrs. Davilow was of course astonished to see Gwendolen returning alone,
5947: and was not without some uneasiness which the presence of other ladies
5948: hindered her from showing. In answer to her words of surprise Gwendolen
5949: said,
5950: 
5951: “Oh, I have been rather silly. I lingered behind to look at the
5952: Whispering Stones, and the rest hurried on after something, so I lost
5953: sight of them. I thought it best to come home by the short way—the
5954: avenue that the warden had told me of. I’m not sorry after all. I had
5955: had enough walking.”
5956: 
5957: “Your party did not meet Mr. Grandcourt, I presume,” said Mrs.
5958: Arrowpoint, not without intention.
5959: 
5960: “No,” said Gwendolen, with a little flash of defiance, and a light
5961: laugh. “And we didn’t see any carvings on the trees, either. Where can
5962: he be? I should think he has fallen into the pool or had an apoplectic
5963: fit.”
5964: 
5965: With all Gwendolen’s resolve not to betray any agitation, she could not
5966: help it that her tone was unusually high and hard, and her mother felt
5967: sure that something unpropitious had happened.
5968: 
5969: Mrs. Arrowpoint thought that the self-confident young lady was much
5970: piqued, and that Mr. Grandcourt was probably seeing reason to change
5971: his mind.
5972: 
5973: “If you have no objection, mamma, I will order the carriage,” said
5974: Gwendolen. “I am tired. And every one will be going soon.”
5975: 
5976: Mrs. Davilow assented; but by the time the carriage was announced as
5977: ready—the horses having to be fetched from the stables on the warden’s
5978: premises—the roving party reappeared, and with them Mr. Grandcourt.
5979: 
5980: “Ah, there you are!” said Lord Brackenshaw, going up to Gwendolen, who
5981: was arranging her mamma’s shawl for the drive. “We thought at first you
5982: had alighted on Grandcourt and he had taken you home. Lush said so. But
5983: after that we met Grandcourt. However, we didn’t suppose you could be
5984: in any danger. The warden said he had told you a near way back.”
5985: 
5986: “You are going?” said Grandcourt, coming up with his usual air, as if
5987: he did not conceive that there had been any omission on his part. Lord
5988: Brackenshaw gave place to him and moved away.
5989: 
5990: “Yes, we are going,” said Gwendolen, looking busily at her scarf, which
5991: she was arranging across her shoulders Scotch fashion.
5992: 
5993: “May I call at Offendene to-morrow?”
5994: 
5995: “Oh yes, if you like,” said Gwendolen, sweeping him from a distance
5996: with her eyelashes. Her voice was light and sharp as the first touch of
5997: frost.
5998: 
5999: Mrs. Davilow accepted his arm to lead her to the carriage; but while
6000: that was happening, Gwendolen with incredible swiftness had got in
6001: advance of them, and had sprung into the carriage.
6002: 
6003: “I got in, mamma, because I wished to be on this side,” she said,
6004: apologetically. But she had avoided Grandcourt’s touch: he only lifted
6005: his hat and walked away—with the not unsatisfactory impression that
6006: she meant to show herself offended by his neglect.
6007: 
6008: The mother and daughter drove for five minutes in silence. Then
6009: Gwendolen said, “I intend to join the Langens at Dover, mamma. I shall
6010: pack up immediately on getting home, and set off by the early train. I
6011: shall be at Dover almost as soon as they are; we can let them know by
6012: telegraph.”
6013: 
6014: “Good heavens, child! what can be your reason for saying so?”
6015: 
6016: “My reason for saying it, mamma, is that I mean to do it.”
6017: 
6018: “But why do you mean to do it?”
6019: 
6020: “I wish to go away.”
6021: 
6022: “Is it because you are offended with Mr. Grandcourt’s odd behavior in
6023: walking off to-day?”
6024: 
6025: “It is useless to enter into such questions. I am not going in any case
6026: to marry Mr. Grandcourt. Don’t interest yourself further about it.”
6027: 
6028: “What can I say to your uncle, Gwendolen? Consider the position you
6029: place me in. You led him to believe only last night that you had made
6030: up your mind in favor of Mr. Grandcourt.”
6031: 
6032: “I am very sorry to cause you annoyance, mamma, dear, but I can’t help
6033: it,” said Gwendolen, with still harder resistance in her tone.
6034: “Whatever you or my uncle may think or do, I shall not alter my
6035: resolve, and I shall not tell my reason. I don’t care what comes of it.
6036: I don’t care if I never marry any one. There is nothing worth caring
6037: for. I believe all men are bad, and I hate them.”
6038: 
6039: “But need you set off in this way, Gwendolen?” said Mrs. Davilow,
6040: miserable and helpless.
6041: 
6042: “Now mamma, don’t interfere with me. If you have ever had any trouble
6043: in your own life, remember it and don’t interfere with me. If I am to
6044: be miserable, let it be by my own choice.”
6045: 
6046: The mother was reduced to trembling silence. She began to see that the
6047: difficulty would be lessened if Gwendolen went away.
6048: 
6049: And she did go. The packing was all carefully done that evening, and
6050: not long after dawn the next day Mrs. Davilow accompanied her daughter
6051: to the railway station. The sweet dews of morning, the cows and horses
6052: looking over the hedges without any particular reason, the early
6053: travelers on foot with their bundles, seemed all very melancholy and
6054: purposeless to them both. The dingy torpor of the railway station,
6055: before the ticket could be taken, was still worse. Gwendolen had
6056: certainly hardened in the last twenty-four hours: her mother’s trouble
6057: evidently counted for little in her present state of mind, which did
6058: not essentially differ from the mood that makes men take to worse
6059: conduct when their belief in persons or things is upset. Gwendolen’s
6060: uncontrolled reading, though consisting chiefly in what are called
6061: pictures of life, had somehow not prepared her for this encounter with
6062: reality. Is that surprising? It is to be believed that attendance at
6063: the _opéra bouffe_ in the present day would not leave men’s minds
6064: entirely without shock, if the manners observed there with some
6065: applause were suddenly to start up in their own families. Perspective,
6066: as its inventor remarked, is a beautiful thing. What horrors of damp
6067: huts, where human beings languish, may not become picturesque through
6068: aerial distance! What hymning of cancerous vices may we not languish
6069: over as sublimest art in the safe remoteness of a strange language and
6070: artificial phrase! Yet we keep a repugnance to rheumatism and other
6071: painful effects when presented in our personal experience.
6072: 
6073: Mrs. Davilow felt Gwendolen’s new phase of indifference keenly, and as
6074: she drove back alone, the brightening morning was sadder to her than
6075: before.
6076: 
6077: Mr. Grandcourt called that day at Offendene, but nobody was at home.
6078: 
6079: 
6080: 
6081: 
6082: CHAPTER XV.
6083: 
6084:     “_Festina lente_—celerity should be contempered with
6085:     cunctation.”—SIR THOMAS BROWNE.
6086: 
6087: 
6088: Gwendolen, we have seen, passed her time abroad in the new excitement
6089: of gambling, and in imagining herself an empress of luck, having
6090: brought from her late experience a vague impression that in this
6091: confused world it signified nothing what any one did, so that they
6092: amused themselves. We have seen, too, that certain persons,
6093: mysteriously symbolized as Grapnell & Co., having also thought of
6094: reigning in the realm of luck, and being also bent on amusing
6095: themselves, no matter how, had brought about a painful change in her
6096: family circumstances; whence she had returned home—carrying with her,
6097: against her inclination, a necklace which she had pawned and some one
6098: else had redeemed.
6099: 
6100: While she was going back to England, Grandcourt was coming to find her;
6101: coming, that is, after his own manner—not in haste by express straight
6102: from Diplow to Leubronn, where she was understood to be; but so
6103: entirely without hurry that he was induced by the presence of some
6104: Russian acquaintances to linger at Baden-Baden and make various
6105: appointments with them, which, however, his desire to be at Leubronn
6106: ultimately caused him to break. Grandcourt’s passions were of the
6107: intermittent, flickering kind: never flaming out strongly. But a great
6108: deal of life goes on without strong passion: myriads of cravats are
6109: carefully tied, dinners attended, even speeches made proposing the
6110: health of august personages without the zest arising from a strong
6111: desire. And a man may make a good appearance in high social
6112: positions—may be supposed to know the classics, to have his reserves
6113: on science, a strong though repressed opinion on politics, and all the
6114: sentiments of the English gentleman, at a small expense of vital
6115: energy. Also, he may be obstinate or persistent at the same low rate,
6116: and may even show sudden impulses which have a false air of daemonic
6117: strength because they seem inexplicable, though perhaps their secret
6118: lies merely in the want of regulated channels for the soul to move
6119: in—good and sufficient ducts of habit without which our nature easily
6120: turns to mere ooze and mud, and at any pressure yields nothing but a
6121: spurt or a puddle.
6122: 
6123: Grandcourt had not been altogether displeased by Gwendolen’s running
6124: away from the splendid chance he was holding out to her. The act had
6125: some piquancy for him. He liked to think that it was due to resentment
6126: of his careless behavior in Cardell Chase, which, when he came to
6127: consider it, did appear rather cool. To have brought her so near a
6128: tender admission, and then to have walked headlong away from further
6129: opportunities of winning the consent which he had made her understand
6130: him to be asking for, was enough to provoke a girl of spirit; and to be
6131: worth his mastering it was proper that she should have some spirit.
6132: Doubtless she meant him to follow her, and it was what he meant too.
6133: But for a whole week he took no measures toward starting, and did not
6134: even inquire where Miss Harleth was gone. Mr. Lush felt a triumph that
6135: was mingled with much distrust; for Grandcourt had said no word to him
6136: about her, and looked as neutral as an alligator; there was no telling
6137: what might turn up in the slowly-churning chances of his mind. Still,
6138: to have put off a decision was to have made room for the waste of
6139: Grandcourt’s energy.
6140: 
6141: The guests at Diplow felt more curiosity than their host. How was it
6142: that nothing more was heard of Miss Harleth? Was it credible that she
6143: had refused Mr. Grandcourt? Lady Flora Hollis, a lively middle-aged
6144: woman, well endowed with curiosity, felt a sudden interest in making a
6145: round of calls with Mrs. Torrington, including the rectory, Offendene,
6146: and Quetcham, and thus not only got twice over, but also discussed with
6147: the Arrowpoints, the information that Miss Harleth was gone to
6148: Leubronn, with some old friends, the Baron and Baroness von Langen; for
6149: the immediate agitation and disappointment of Mrs. Davilow and the
6150: Gascoignes had resolved itself into a wish that Gwendolen’s
6151: disappearance should not be interpreted as anything eccentric or
6152: needful to be kept secret. The rector’s mind, indeed, entertained the
6153: possibility that the marriage was only a little deferred, for Mrs.
6154: Davilow had not dared to tell him of the bitter determination with
6155: which Gwendolen had spoken. And in spite of his practical ability, some
6156: of his experience had petrified into maxims and quotations. Amaryllis
6157: fleeing desired that her hiding-place should be known; and that love
6158: will find out the way “over the mountain and over the wave” may be said
6159: without hyperbole in this age of steam. Gwendolen, he conceived, was an
6160: Amaryllis of excellent sense but coquettish daring; the question was
6161: whether she had dared too much.
6162: 
6163: Lady Flora, coming back charged with news about Miss Harleth, saw no
6164: good reason why she should not try whether she could electrify Mr.
6165: Grandcourt by mentioning it to him at the table; and in doing so shot a
6166: few hints of a notion having got abroad that he was a disappointed
6167: adorer. Grandcourt heard with quietude, but with attention; and the
6168: next day he ordered Lush to bring about a decent reason for breaking up
6169: the party at Diplow by the end of another week, as he meant to go
6170: yachting to the Baltic or somewhere—it being impossible to stay at
6171: Diplow as if he were a prisoner on parole, with a set of people whom he
6172: had never wanted. Lush needed no clearer announcement that Grandcourt
6173: was going to Leubronn; but he might go after the manner of a creeping
6174: billiard-ball and stick on the way. What Mr. Lush intended was to make
6175: himself indispensable so that he might go too, and he succeeded;
6176: Gwendolen’s repulsion for him being a fact that only amused his patron,
6177: and made him none the less willing to have Lush always at hand.
6178: 
6179: This was how it happened that Grandcourt arrived at the _Czarina_ on
6180: the fifth day after Gwendolen had left Leubronn, and found there his
6181: uncle, Sir Hugo Mallinger, with his family, including Deronda. It is
6182: not necessarily a pleasure either to the reigning power or the heir
6183: presumptive when their separate affairs—a touch of gout, say, in the
6184: one, and a touch of willfulness in the other—happen to bring them to
6185: the same spot. Sir Hugo was an easy-tempered man, tolerant both of
6186: differences and defects; but a point of view different from his own
6187: concerning the settlement of the family estates fretted him rather more
6188: than if it had concerned Church discipline or the ballot, and faults
6189: were the less venial for belonging to a person whose existence was
6190: inconvenient to him. In no case could Grandcourt have been a nephew
6191: after his own heart; but as the presumptive heir to the Mallinger
6192: estates he was the sign and embodiment of a chief grievance in the
6193: baronet’s life—the want of a son to inherit the lands, in no portion
6194: of which had he himself more than a life-interest. For in the
6195: ill-advised settlement which his father, Sir Francis, had chosen to
6196: make by will, even Diplow with its modicum of land had been left under
6197: the same conditions as the ancient and wide inheritance of the two
6198: Toppings—Diplow, where Sir Hugo had lived and hunted through many a
6199: season in his younger years, and where his wife and daughters ought to
6200: have been able to retire after his death.
6201: 
6202: This grievance had naturally gathered emphasis as the years advanced,
6203: and Lady Mallinger, after having had three daughters in quick
6204: succession, had remained for eight years till now that she was over
6205: forty without producing so much as another girl; while Sir Hugo, almost
6206: twenty years older, was at a time of life when, notwithstanding the
6207: fashionable retardation of most things from dinners to marriages, a
6208: man’s hopefulness is apt to show signs of wear, until restored by
6209: second childhood.
6210: 
6211: In fact, he had begun to despair of a son, and this confirmation of
6212: Grandcourt’s interest in the estates certainly tended to make his image
6213: and presence the more unwelcome; but, on the other hand, it carried
6214: circumstances which disposed Sir Hugo to take care that the relation
6215: between them should be kept as friendly as possible. It led him to
6216: dwell on a plan which had grown up side by side with his disappointment
6217: of an heir; namely, to try and secure Diplow as a future residence for
6218: Lady Mallinger and her daughters, and keep this pretty bit of the
6219: family inheritance for his own offspring in spite of that
6220: disappointment. Such knowledge as he had of his nephew’s disposition
6221: and affairs encouraged the belief that Grandcourt might consent to a
6222: transaction by which he would get a good sum of ready money, as an
6223: equivalent for his prospective interest in the domain of Diplow and the
6224: moderate amount of land attached to it. If, after all, the unhoped-for
6225: son should be born, the money would have been thrown away, and
6226: Grandcourt would have been paid for giving up interests that had turned
6227: out good for nothing; but Sir Hugo set down this risk as _nil_, and of
6228: late years he had husbanded his fortune so well by the working of mines
6229: and the sale of leases that he was prepared for an outlay.
6230: 
6231: Here was an object that made him careful to avoid any quarrel with
6232: Grandcourt. Some years before, when he was making improvements at the
6233: Abbey, and needed Grandcourt’s concurrence in his felling an
6234: obstructive mass of timber on the demesne, he had congratulated himself
6235: on finding that there was no active spite against him in his nephew’s
6236: peculiar mind; and nothing had since occurred to make them hate each
6237: other more than was compatible with perfect politeness, or with any
6238: accommodation that could be strictly mutual.
6239: 
6240: Grandcourt, on his side, thought his uncle a superfluity and a bore,
6241: and felt that the list of things in general would be improved whenever
6242: Sir Hugo came to be expunged. But he had been made aware through Lush,
6243: always a useful medium, of the baronet’s inclinations concerning
6244: Diplow, and he was gratified to have the alternative of the money in
6245: his mind: even if he had not thought it in the least likely that he
6246: would choose to accept it, his sense of power would have been flattered
6247: by his being able to refuse what Sir Hugo desired. The hinted
6248: transaction had told for something among the motives which had made him
6249: ask for a year’s tenancy of Diplow, which it had rather annoyed Sir
6250: Hugo to grant, because the excellent hunting in the neighborhood might
6251: decide Grandcourt not to part with his chance of future possession;—a
6252: man who has two places, in one of which the hunting is less good,
6253: naturally desiring a third where it is better. Also, Lush had thrown
6254: out to Sir Hugo the probability that Grandcourt would woo and win Miss
6255: Arrowpoint, and in that case ready money might be less of a temptation
6256: to him. Hence, on this unexpected meeting at Leubronn, the baronet felt
6257: much curiosity to know how things had been going on at Diplow, was bent
6258: on being as civil as possible to his nephew, and looked forward to some
6259: private chat with Lush.
6260: 
6261: Between Deronda and Grandcourt there was a more faintly-marked but
6262: peculiar relation, depending on circumstances which have yet to be made
6263: known. But on no side was there any sign of suppressed chagrin on the
6264: first meeting at the _table d’hôte_, an hour after Grandcourt’s
6265: arrival; and when the quartette of gentlemen afterward met on the
6266: terrace, without Lady Mallinger, they moved off together to saunter
6267: through the rooms, Sir Hugo saying as they entered the large _saal_,
6268: 
6269: “Did you play much at Baden, Grandcourt?”
6270: 
6271: “No; I looked on and betted a little with some Russians there.”
6272: 
6273: “Had you luck?”
6274: 
6275: “What did I win, Lush?”
6276: 
6277: “You brought away about two hundred,” said Lush.
6278: 
6279: “You are not here for the sake of the play, then?” said Sir Hugo.
6280: 
6281: “No; I don’t care about play now. It’s a confounded strain,” said
6282: Grandcourt, whose diamond ring and demeanor, as he moved along playing
6283: slightly with his whisker, were being a good deal stared at by rouged
6284: foreigners interested in a new milord.
6285: 
6286: “The fact is, somebody should invent a mill to do amusements for you,
6287: my dear fellow,” said Sir Hugo, “as the Tartars get their praying done.
6288: But I agree with you; I never cared for play. It’s monotonous—knits
6289: the brain up into meshes. And it knocks me up to watch it now. I
6290: suppose one gets poisoned with the bad air. I never stay here more than
6291: ten minutes. But where’s your gambling beauty, Deronda? Have you seen
6292: her lately?”
6293: 
6294: “She’s gone,” said Deronda, curtly.
6295: 
6296: “An uncommonly fine girl, a perfect Diana,” said Sir Hugo, turning to
6297: Grandcourt again. “Really worth a little straining to look at her. I
6298: saw her winning, and she took it as coolly as if she had known it all
6299: beforehand. The same day Deronda happened to see her losing like
6300: wildfire, and she bore it with immense pluck. I suppose she was cleaned
6301: out, or was wise enough to stop in time. How do you know she’s gone?”
6302: 
6303: “Oh, by the Visitor-list, ...” said Deronda, with a scarcely perceptible
6304: shrug. “Vandernoodt told me her name was Harleth, and she was with the
6305: Baron and Baroness von Langen. I saw by the list that Miss Harleth was
6306: no longer there.”
6307: 
6308: This held no further information for Lush than that Gwendolen had been
6309: gambling. He had already looked at the list, and ascertained that
6310: Gwendolen had gone, but he had no intention of thrusting this knowledge
6311: on Grandcourt before he asked for it; and he had not asked, finding it
6312: enough to believe that the object of search would turn up somewhere or
6313: other.
6314: 
6315: But now Grandcourt had heard what was rather piquant, and not a word
6316: about Miss Harleth had been missed by him. After a moment’s pause he
6317: said to Deronda,
6318: 
6319: “Do you know those people—the Langens?”
6320: 
6321: “I have talked with them a little since Miss Harleth went away. I knew
6322: nothing of them before.”
6323: 
6324: “Where is she gone—do you know?”
6325: 
6326: “She is gone home,” said Deronda, coldly, as if he wished to say no
6327: more. But then, from a fresh impulse, he turned to look markedly at
6328: Grandcourt, and added, “But it is possible you know her. Her home is
6329: not far from Diplow: Offendene, near Winchester.”
6330: 
6331: Deronda, turning to look straight at Grandcourt, who was on his left
6332: hand, might have been a subject for those old painters who liked
6333: contrasts of temperament. There was a calm intensity of life and
6334: richness of tint in his face that on a sudden gaze from him was rather
6335: startling, and often made him seem to have spoken, so that servants and
6336: officials asked him automatically, “What did you say, sir?” when he had
6337: been quite silent. Grandcourt himself felt an irritation, which he did
6338: not show except by a slight movement of the eyelids, at Deronda’s
6339: turning round on him when he was not asked to do more than speak. But
6340: he answered, with his usual drawl, “Yes, I know her,” and paused with
6341: his shoulder toward Deronda, to look at the gambling.
6342: 
6343: “What of her, eh?” asked Sir Hugo of Lush, as the three moved on a
6344: little way. “She must be a new-comer at Offendene. Old Blenny lived
6345: there after the dowager died.”
6346: 
6347: “A little too much of her,” said Lush, in a low, significant tone; not
6348: sorry to let Sir Hugo know the state of affairs.
6349: 
6350: “Why? how?” said the baronet. They all moved out of the _salon_ into an
6351: airy promenade.
6352: 
6353: “He has been on the brink of marrying her,” Lush went on. “But I hope
6354: it’s off now. She’s a niece of the clergyman—Gascoigne—at Pennicote.
6355: Her mother is a widow with a brood of daughters. This girl will have
6356: nothing, and is as dangerous as gunpowder. It would be a foolish
6357: marriage. But she has taken a freak against him, for she ran off here
6358: without notice, when he had agreed to call the next day. The fact is,
6359: he’s here after her; but he was in no great hurry, and between his
6360: caprice and hers they are likely enough not to get together again. But
6361: of course he has lost his chance with the heiress.”
6362: 
6363: Grandcourt joining them said, “What a beastly den this is!—a worse
6364: hole than Baden. I shall go back to the hotel.”
6365: 
6366: When Sir Hugo and Deronda were alone, the baronet began,
6367: 
6368: “Rather a pretty story. That girl has something in her. She must be
6369: worth running after—has _de l’imprévu_. I think her appearance on the
6370: scene has bettered my chance of getting Diplow, whether the marriage
6371: comes off or not.”
6372: 
6373: “I should hope a marriage like that would not come off,” said Deronda,
6374: in a tone of disgust.
6375: 
6376: “What! are you a little touched with the sublime lash?” said Sir Hugo,
6377: putting up his glasses to help his short sight in looking at his
6378: companion. “Are you inclined to run after her?”
6379: 
6380: “On the contrary,” said Deronda, “I should rather be inclined to run
6381: away from her.”
6382: 
6383: “Why, you would easily cut out Grandcourt. A girl with her spirit would
6384: think you the finer match of the two,” said Sir Hugo, who often tried
6385: Deronda’s patience by finding a joke in impossible advice. (A
6386: difference of taste in jokes is a great strain on the affections.)
6387: 
6388: “I suppose pedigree and land belong to a fine match,” said Deronda,
6389: coldly.
6390: 
6391: “The best horse will win in spite of pedigree, my boy. You remember
6392: Napoleon’s _mot—Je suis un ancêtre_” said Sir Hugo, who habitually
6393: undervalued birth, as men after dining well often agree that the good
6394: of life is distributed with wonderful equality.
6395: 
6396: “I am not sure that I want to be an ancestor,” said Deronda. “It
6397: doesn’t seem to me the rarest sort of origination.”
6398: 
6399: “You won’t run after the pretty gambler, then?” said Sir Hugo, putting
6400: down his glasses.
6401: 
6402: “Decidedly not.”
6403: 
6404: This answer was perfectly truthful; nevertheless it had passed through
6405: Deronda’s mind that under other circumstances he should have given way
6406: to the interest this girl had raised in him, and tried to know more of
6407: her. But his history had given him a stronger bias in another
6408: direction. He felt himself in no sense free.
6409: 
6410: 
6411: 
6412: 
6413: CHAPTER XVI.
6414: 
6415:     Men, like planets, have both a visible and an invisible history. The
6416:     astronomer threads the darkness with strict deduction, accounting so
6417:     for every visible arc in the wanderer’s orbit; and the narrator of
6418:     human actions, if he did his work with the same completeness, would
6419:     have to thread the hidden pathways of feeling and thought which lead
6420:     up to every moment of action, and to those moments of intense
6421:     suffering which take the quality of action—like the cry of
6422:     Prometheus, whose chained anguish seems a greater energy than the sea
6423:     and sky he invokes and the deity he defies.
6424: 
6425: 
6426: Deronda’s circumstances, indeed, had been exceptional. One moment had
6427: been burned into his life as its chief epoch—a moment full of July
6428: sunshine and large pink roses shedding their last petals on a grassy
6429: court enclosed on three sides by a gothic cloister. Imagine him in such
6430: a scene: a boy of thirteen, stretched prone on the grass where it was
6431: in shadow, his curly head propped on his arms over a book, while his
6432: tutor, also reading, sat on a camp-stool under shelter. Deronda’s book
6433: was Sismondi’s _History of the Italian Republics_; the lad had a
6434: passion for history, eager to know how time had been filled up since
6435: the flood, and how things were carried on in the dull periods. Suddenly
6436: he let down his left arm and looked at his tutor, saying in purest
6437: boyish tones,
6438: 
6439: “Mr. Fraser, how was it that the popes and cardinals always had so many
6440: nephews?”
6441: 
6442: The tutor, an able young Scotchman, who acted as Sir Hugo Mallinger’s
6443: secretary, roused rather unwillingly from his political economy,
6444: answered with the clear-cut emphatic chant which makes a truth doubly
6445: telling in Scotch utterance,
6446: 
6447: “Their own children were called nephews.”
6448: 
6449: “Why?” said Deronda.
6450: 
6451: “It was just for the propriety of the thing; because, as you know very
6452: well, priests don’t marry, and the children were illegitimate.”
6453: 
6454: Mr. Fraser, thrusting out his lower lip and making his chant of the
6455: last word the more emphatic for a little impatience at being
6456: interrupted, had already turned his eyes on his book again, while
6457: Deronda, as if something had stung him, started up in a sitting
6458: attitude with his back to the tutor.
6459: 
6460: He had always called Sir Hugo Mallinger his uncle, and when it once
6461: occurred to him to ask about his father and mother, the baronet had
6462: answered, “You lost your father and mother when you were quite a little
6463: one; that is why I take care of you.” Daniel then straining to discern
6464: something in that early twilight, had a dim sense of having been kissed
6465: very much, and surrounded by thin, cloudy, scented drapery, till his
6466: fingers caught in something hard, which hurt him, and he began to cry.
6467: Every other memory he had was of the little world in which he still
6468: lived. And at that time he did not mind about learning more, for he was
6469: too fond of Sir Hugo to be sorry for the loss of unknown parents. Life
6470: was very delightful to the lad, with an uncle who was always indulgent
6471: and cheerful—a fine man in the bright noon of life, whom Daniel
6472: thought absolutely perfect, and whose place was one of the finest in
6473: England, at once historical, romantic, and home-like: a picturesque
6474: architectural outgrowth from an abbey, which had still remnants of the
6475: old monastic trunk. Diplow lay in another county, and was a
6476: comparatively landless place which had come into the family from a rich
6477: lawyer on the female side who wore the perruque of the restoration;
6478: whereas the Mallingers had the grant of Monk’s Topping under Henry the
6479: Eighth, and ages before had held the neighboring lands of King’s
6480: Topping, tracing indeed their origin to a certain Hugues le Malingre,
6481: who came in with the Conqueror—and also apparently with a sickly
6482: complexion which had been happily corrected in his descendants. Two
6483: rows of these descendants, direct and collateral, females of the male
6484: line, and males of the female, looked down in the gallery over the
6485: cloisters on the nephew Daniel as he walked there: men in armor with
6486: pointed beards and arched eyebrows, pinched ladies in hoops and ruffs
6487: with no face to speak of; grave-looking men in black velvet and stuffed
6488: hips, and fair, frightened women holding little boys by the hand;
6489: smiling politicians in magnificent perruques, and ladies of the
6490: prize-animal kind, with rosebud mouths and full eyelids, according to
6491: Lely; then a generation whose faces were revised and embellished in the
6492: taste of Kneller; and so on through refined editions of the family
6493: types in the time of Reynolds and Romney, till the line ended with Sir
6494: Hugo and his younger brother Henleigh. This last had married Miss
6495: Grandcourt, and taken her name along with her estates, thus making a
6496: junction between two equally old families, impaling the three Saracens’
6497: heads proper and three bezants of the one with the tower and falcons
6498: _argent_ of the other, and, as it happened, uniting their highest
6499: advantages in the prospects of that Henleigh Mallinger Grandcourt who
6500: is at present more of an acquaintance to us than either Sir Hugo or his
6501: nephew Daniel Deronda.
6502: 
6503: In Sir Hugo’s youthful portrait with rolled collar and high cravat, Sir
6504: Thomas Lawrence had done justice to the agreeable alacrity of
6505: expression and sanguine temperament still to be seen in the original,
6506: but had done something more than justice in slightly lengthening the
6507: nose, which was in reality shorter than might have been expected in a
6508: Mallinger. Happily the appropriate nose of the family reappeared in his
6509: younger brother, and was to be seen in all its refined regularity in
6510: his nephew Mallinger Grandcourt. But in the nephew Daniel Deronda the
6511: family faces of various types, seen on the walls of the gallery, found
6512: no reflex. Still he was handsomer than any of them, and when he was
6513: thirteen might have served as model for any painter who wanted to image
6514: the most memorable of boys: you could hardly have seen his face
6515: thoroughly meeting yours without believing that human creatures had
6516: done nobly in times past, and might do more nobly in time to come. The
6517: finest childlike faces have this consecrating power, and make us
6518: shudder anew at all the grossness and basely-wrought griefs of the
6519: world, lest they should enter here and defile.
6520: 
6521: But at this moment on the grass among the rose-petals, Daniel Deronda
6522: was making a first acquaintance with those griefs. A new idea had
6523: entered his mind, and was beginning to change the aspect of his
6524: habitual feelings as happy careless voyagers are changed with the sky
6525: suddenly threatened and the thought of danger arises. He sat perfectly
6526: still with his back to the tutor, while his face expressed rapid inward
6527: transition. The deep blush, which had come when he first started up,
6528: gradually subsided; but his features kept that indescribable look of
6529: subdued activity which often accompanies a new mental survey of
6530: familiar facts. He had not lived with other boys, and his mind showed
6531: the same blending of child’s ignorance with surprising knowledge which
6532: is oftener seen in bright girls. Having read Shakespeare as well as a
6533: great deal of history, he could have talked with the wisdom of a
6534: bookish child about men who were born out of wedlock and were held
6535: unfortunate in consequence, being under disadvantages which required
6536: them to be a sort of heroes if they were to work themselves up to an
6537: equal standing with their legally born brothers. But he had never
6538: brought such knowledge into any association with his own lot, which had
6539: been too easy for him ever to think about it—until this moment when
6540: there had darted into his mind with the magic of quick comparison, the
6541: possibility that here was the secret of his own birth, and that the man
6542: whom he called uncle was really his father. Some children, even younger
6543: than Daniel, have known the first arrival of care, like an ominous
6544: irremovable guest in their tender lives, on the discovery that their
6545: parents, whom they had imagined able to buy everything, were poor and
6546: in hard money troubles. Daniel felt the presence of a new guest who
6547: seemed to come with an enigmatic veiled face, and to carry
6548: dimly-conjectured, dreaded revelations. The ardor which he had given to
6549: the imaginary world in his books suddenly rushed toward his own history
6550: and spent its pictorial energy there, explaining what he knew,
6551: representing the unknown. The uncle whom he loved very dearly took the
6552: aspect of a father who held secrets about him—who had done him a
6553: wrong—yes, a wrong: and what had become of his mother, for whom he
6554: must have been taken away?—Secrets about which he, Daniel, could never
6555: inquire; for to speak or to be spoken to about these new thoughts
6556: seemed like falling flakes of fire to his imagination. Those who have
6557: known an impassioned childhood will understand this dread of utterance
6558: about any shame connected with their parents. The impetuous advent of
6559: new images took possession of him with the force of fact for the first
6560: time told, and left him no immediate power for the reflection that he
6561: might be trembling at a fiction of his own. The terrible sense of
6562: collision between a strong rush of feeling and the dread of its
6563: betrayal, found relief at length in big slow tears, which fell without
6564: restraint until the voice of Mr. Fraser was heard saying:
6565: 
6566: “Daniel, do you see that you are sitting on the bent pages of your
6567: book?”
6568: 
6569: Daniel immediately moved the book without turning round, and after
6570: holding it before him for an instant, rose with it and walked away into
6571: the open grounds, where he could dry his tears unobserved. The first
6572: shock of suggestion past, he could remember that he had no certainty
6573: how things really had been, and that he had been making conjectures
6574: about his own history, as he had often made stories about Pericles or
6575: Columbus, just to fill up the blanks before they became famous. Only
6576: there came back certain facts which had an obstinate reality, almost
6577: like the fragments of a bridge, telling you unmistakably how the arches
6578: lay. And again there came a mood in which his conjectures seemed like a
6579: doubt of religion, to be banished as an offense, and a mean prying
6580: after what he was not meant to know; for there was hardly a delicacy of
6581: feeling this lad was not capable of. But the summing-up of all his
6582: fluctuating experience at this epoch was, that a secret impression had
6583: come to him which had given him something like a new sense in relation
6584: to all the elements of his life. And the idea that others probably knew
6585: things concerning which they did not choose to mention, set up in him a
6586: premature reserve which helped to intensify his inward experience. His
6587: ears open now to words which before that July day would have passed by
6588: him unnoted; and round every trivial incident which imagination could
6589: connect with his suspicions, a newly-roused set of feelings were ready
6590: to cluster themselves.
6591: 
6592: One such incident a month later wrought itself deeply into his life.
6593: Daniel had not only one of those thrilling boy voices which seem to
6594: bring an idyllic heaven and earth before our eyes, but a fine musical
6595: instinct, and had early made out accompaniments for himself on the
6596: piano, while he sang from memory. Since then he had had some teaching,
6597: and Sir Hugo, who delighted in the boy, used to ask for his music in
6598: the presence of guests. One morning after he had been singing “Sweet
6599: Echo” before a small party of gentlemen whom the rain had kept in the
6600: house, the baronet, passing from a smiling remark to his next neighbor
6601: said:
6602: 
6603: “Come here, Dan!”
6604: 
6605: The boy came forward with unusual reluctance. He wore an embroidered
6606: holland blouse which set off the rich coloring of his head and throat,
6607: and the resistant gravity about his mouth and eyes as he was being
6608: smiled upon, made their beauty the more impressive. Every one was
6609: admiring him.
6610: 
6611: “What do you say to being a great singer? Should you like to be adored
6612: by the world and take the house by storm, like Mario and Tamberlik?”
6613: 
6614: Daniel reddened instantaneously, but there was a just perceptible
6615: interval before he answered with angry decision,
6616: 
6617: “No; I should hate it!”
6618: 
6619: “Well, well, well!” said Sir Hugo, with surprised kindliness intended
6620: to be soothing. But Daniel turned away quickly, left the room, and
6621: going to his own chamber threw himself on the broad window-sill, which
6622: was a favorite retreat of his when he had nothing particular to do.
6623: Here he could see the rain gradually subsiding with gleams through the
6624: parting clouds which lit up a great reach of the park, where the old
6625: oaks stood apart from each other, and the bordering wood was pierced
6626: with a green glade which met the eastern sky. This was a scene which
6627: had always been part of his home—part of the dignified ease which had
6628: been a matter of course in his life. And his ardent clinging nature had
6629: appropriated it all with affection. He knew a great deal of what it was
6630: to be a gentleman by inheritance, and without thinking much about
6631: himself—for he was a boy of active perceptions and easily forgot his
6632: own existence in that of Robert Bruce—he had never supposed that he
6633: could be shut out from such a lot, or have a very different part in the
6634: world from that of the uncle who petted him. It is possible (though not
6635: greatly believed in at present) to be fond of poverty and take it for a
6636: bride, to prefer scoured deal, red quarries and whitewash for one’s
6637: private surroundings, to delight in no splendor but what has open doors
6638: for the whole nation, and to glory in having no privileges except such
6639: as nature insists on; and noblemen have been known to run away from
6640: elaborate ease and the option of idleness, that they might bind
6641: themselves for small pay to hard-handed labor. But Daniel’s tastes were
6642: altogether in keeping with his nurture: his disposition was one in
6643: which everyday scenes and habits beget not _ennui_ or rebellion, but
6644: delight, affection, aptitudes; and now the lad had been stung to the
6645: quick by the idea that his uncle—perhaps his father—thought of a
6646: career for him which was totally unlike his own, and which he knew very
6647: well was not thought of among possible destinations for the sons of
6648: English gentlemen. He had often stayed in London with Sir Hugo, who to
6649: indulge the boy’s ear had carried him to the opera to hear the great
6650: tenors, so that the image of a singer taking the house by storm was
6651: very vivid to him; but now, spite of his musical gift, he set himself
6652: bitterly against the notion of being dressed up to sing before all
6653: those fine people, who would not care about him except as a wonderful
6654: toy. That Sir Hugo should have thought of him in that position for a
6655: moment, seemed to Daniel an unmistakable proof that there was something
6656: about his birth which threw him out from the class of gentlemen to
6657: which the baronet belonged. Would it ever be mentioned to him? Would
6658: the time come when his uncle would tell him everything? He shrank from
6659: the prospect: in his imagination he preferred ignorance. If his father
6660: had been wicked—Daniel inwardly used strong words, for he was feeling
6661: the injury done him as a maimed boy feels the crushed limb which for
6662: others is merely reckoned in an average of accidents—if his father had
6663: done any wrong, he wished it might never be spoken of to him: it was
6664: already a cutting thought that such knowledge might be in other minds.
6665: Was it in Mr. Fraser’s? probably not, else he would not have spoken in
6666: that way about the pope’s nephews. Daniel fancied, as older people do,
6667: that every one else’s consciousness was as active as his own on a
6668: matter which was vital to him. Did Turvey the valet know?—and old Mrs.
6669: French the housekeeper?—and Banks the bailiff, with whom he had ridden
6670: about the farms on his pony?—And now there came back the recollection
6671: of a day some years before when he was drinking Mrs. Banks’s whey, and
6672: Banks said to his wife with a wink and a cunning laugh, “He features
6673: the mother, eh?” At that time little Daniel had merely thought that
6674: Banks made a silly face, as the common farming men often did, laughing
6675: at what was not laughable; and he rather resented being winked at and
6676: talked of as if he did not understand everything. But now that small
6677: incident became information: it was to be reasoned on. How could he be
6678: like his mother and not like his father? His mother must have been a
6679: Mallinger, if Sir Hugo were his uncle. But no! His father might have
6680: been Sir Hugo’s brother and have changed his name, as Mr. Henleigh
6681: Mallinger did when he married Miss Grandcourt. But then, why had he
6682: never heard Sir Hugo speak of his brother Deronda, as he spoke of his
6683: brother Grandcourt? Daniel had never before cared about the family
6684: tree—only about that ancestor who had killed three Saracens in one
6685: encounter. But now his mind turned to a cabinet of estate-maps in the
6686: library, where he had once seen an illuminated parchment hanging out,
6687: that Sir Hugo said was the family tree. The phrase was new and odd to
6688: him—he was a little fellow then—hardly more than half his present
6689: age—and he gave it no precise meaning. He knew more now and wished
6690: that he could examine that parchment. He imagined that the cabinet was
6691: always locked, and longed to try it. But here he checked himself. He
6692: might be seen: and he would never bring himself near even a silent
6693: admission of the sore that had opened in him.
6694: 
6695: It is in such experiences of a boy or girlhood, while elders are
6696: debating whether most education lies in science or literature, that the
6697: main lines of character are often laid down. If Daniel had been of a
6698: less ardently affectionate nature, the reserve about himself and the
6699: supposition that others had something to his disadvantage in their
6700: minds, might have turned into a hard, proud antagonism. But inborn
6701: lovingness was strong enough to keep itself level with resentment.
6702: There was hardly any creature in his habitual world that he was not
6703: fond of; teasing them occasionally, of course—all except his uncle, or
6704: “Nunc,” as Sir Hugo had taught him to say; for the baronet was the
6705: reverse of a strait-laced man, and left his dignity to take care of
6706: itself. Him Daniel loved in that deep-rooted filial way which makes
6707: children always the happier for being in the same room with father or
6708: mother, though their occupations may be quite apart. Sir Hugo’s
6709: watch-chain and seals, his handwriting, his mode of smoking and of
6710: talking to his dogs and horses, had all a rightness and charm about
6711: them to the boy which went along with the happiness of morning and
6712: breakfast time. That Sir Hugo had always been a Whig, made Tories and
6713: Radicals equally opponents of the truest and best; and the books he had
6714: written were all seen under the same consecration of loving belief
6715: which differenced what was his from what was not his, in spite of
6716: general resemblance. Those writings were various, from volumes of
6717: travel in the brilliant style, to articles on things in general, and
6718: pamphlets on political crises; but to Daniel they were alike in having
6719: an unquestionable rightness by which other people’s information could
6720: be tested.
6721: 
6722: Who cannot imagine the bitterness of a first suspicion that something
6723: in this object of complete love was _not_ quite right? Children demand
6724: that their heroes should be fleckless, and easily believe them so:
6725: perhaps a first discovery to the contrary is hardly a less
6726: revolutionary shock to a passionate child than the threatened downfall
6727: of habitual beliefs which makes the world seem to totter for us in
6728: maturer life.
6729: 
6730: But some time after this renewal of Daniel’s agitation it appeared that
6731: Sir Hugo must have been making a merely playful experiment in his
6732: question about the singing. He sent for Daniel into the library, and
6733: looking up from his writing as the boy entered threw himself sideways
6734: in his arm-chair. “Ah, Dan!” he said kindly, drawing one of the old
6735: embroidered stools close to him. “Come and sit down here.”
6736: 
6737: Daniel obeyed, and Sir Hugo put a gentle hand on his shoulder, looking
6738: at him affectionately.
6739: 
6740: “What is it, my boy? Have you heard anything that has put you out of
6741: spirits lately?”
6742: 
6743: Daniel was determined not to let the tears come, but he could not speak.
6744: 
6745: “All changes are painful when people have been happy, you know,” said
6746: Sir Hugo, lifting his hand from the boy’s shoulder to his dark curls
6747: and rubbing them gently. “You can’t be educated exactly as I wish you
6748: to be without our parting. And I think you will find a great deal to
6749: like at school.”
6750: 
6751: This was not what Daniel expected, and was so far a relief, which gave
6752: him spirit to answer,
6753: 
6754: “Am I to go to school?”
6755: 
6756: “Yes, I mean you to go to Eton. I wish you to have the education of an
6757: English gentleman; and for that it is necessary that you should go to a
6758: public school in preparation for the university: Cambridge I mean you
6759: to go to; it was my own university.”
6760: 
6761: Daniel’s color came and went.
6762: 
6763: “What do you say, Sirrah?” said Sir Hugo, smiling.
6764: 
6765: “I should like to be a gentleman,” said Daniel, with firm distinctness,
6766: “and go to school, if that is what a gentleman’s son must do.”
6767: 
6768: Sir Hugo watched him silently for a few moments, thinking he understood
6769: now why the lad had seemed angry at the notion of becoming a singer.
6770: Then he said tenderly,
6771: 
6772: “And so you won’t mind about leaving your old Nunc?”
6773: 
6774: “Yes, I shall,” said Daniel, clasping Sir Hugo’s caressing arm with
6775: both his hands. “But sha’n’t I come home and be with you in the
6776: holidays?”
6777: 
6778: “Oh yes, generally,” said Sir Hugo. “But now I mean you to go at once
6779: to a new tutor, to break the change for you before you go to Eton.”
6780: 
6781: After this interview Daniel’s spirit rose again. He was meant to be a
6782: gentleman, and in some unaccountable way it might be that his
6783: conjectures were all wrong. The very keenness of the lad taught him to
6784: find comfort in his ignorance. While he was busying his mind in the
6785: construction of possibilities, it became plain to him that there must
6786: be possibilities of which he knew nothing. He left off brooding, young
6787: joy and the spirit of adventure not being easily quenched within him,
6788: and in the interval before his going away he sang about the house,
6789: danced among the old servants, making them parting gifts, and insisted
6790: many times to the groom on the care that was to be taken of the black
6791: pony.
6792: 
6793: “Do you think I shall know much less than the other boys, Mr. Fraser?”
6794: said Daniel. It was his bent to think that every stranger would be
6795: surprised at his ignorance.
6796: 
6797: “There are dunces to be found everywhere,” said the judicious Fraser.
6798: “You’ll not be the biggest; but you’ve not the makings of a Porson in
6799: you, or a Leibnitz either.”
6800: 
6801: “I don’t want to be a Porson or a Leibnitz,” said Daniel. “I would
6802: rather be a greater leader, like Pericles or Washington.”
6803: 
6804: “Ay, ay; you’ve a notion they did with little parsing, and less
6805: algebra,” said Fraser. But in reality he thought his pupil a remarkable
6806: lad, to whom one thing was as easy as another, if he had only a mind to
6807: it.
6808: 
6809: Things went on very well with Daniel in his new world, except that a
6810: boy with whom he was at once inclined to strike up a close friendship
6811: talked to him a great deal about his home and parents, and seemed to
6812: expect a like expansiveness in return. Daniel immediately shrank into
6813: reserve, and this experience remained a check on his naturally strong
6814: bent toward the formation of intimate friendship. Every one, his tutor
6815: included, set him down as a reserved boy, though he was so good-humored
6816: and unassuming, as well as quick, both at study and sport, that nobody
6817: called his reserve disagreeable. Certainly his face had a great deal to
6818: do with that favorable interpretation; but in this instance the beauty
6819: of the closed lips told no falsehood.
6820: 
6821: A surprise that came to him before his first vacation strengthened the
6822: silent consciousness of a grief within, which might be compared in some
6823: ways with Byron’s susceptibility about his deformed foot. Sir Hugo
6824: wrote word that he was married to Miss Raymond, a sweet lady, whom
6825: Daniel must remember having seen. The event would make no difference
6826: about his spending the vacation at the Abbey; he would find Lady
6827: Mallinger a new friend whom he would be sure to love—and much more to
6828: the usual effect when a man, having done something agreeable to
6829: himself, is disposed to congratulate others on his own good fortune,
6830: and the deducible satisfactoriness of events in general.
6831: 
6832: Let Sir Hugo be partly excused until the grounds of his action can be
6833: more fully known. The mistakes in his behavior to Deronda were due to
6834: that dullness toward what may be going on in other minds, especially
6835: the minds of children, which is among the commonest deficiencies, even
6836: in good-natured men like him, when life has been generally easy to
6837: themselves, and their energies have been quietly spent in feeling
6838: gratified. No one was better aware than he that Daniel was generally
6839: suspected to be his own son. But he was pleased with that suspicion;
6840: and his imagination had never once been troubled with the way in which
6841: the boy himself might be affected, either then or in the future, by the
6842: enigmatic aspect of his circumstances. He was as fond of him as could
6843: be, and meant the best by him. And, considering the lightness with
6844: which the preparation of young lives seem to lie on respectable
6845: consciences, Sir Hugo Mallinger can hardly be held open to exceptional
6846: reproach. He had been a bachelor till he was five-and-forty, had always
6847: been regarded as a fascinating man of elegant tastes; what could be
6848: more natural, even according to the index of language, than that he
6849: should have a beautiful boy like the little Deronda to take care of?
6850: The mother might even, perhaps, be in the great world—met with in Sir
6851: Hugo’s residence abroad. The only person to feel any objection was the
6852: boy himself, who could not have been consulted. And the boy’s
6853: objections had never been dreamed of by anybody but himself.
6854: 
6855: By the time Deronda was ready to go to Cambridge, Lady Mallinger had
6856: already three daughters—charming babies, all three, but whose sex was
6857: announced as a melancholy alternative, the offspring desired being a
6858: son; if Sir Hugo had no son the succession must go to his nephew,
6859: Mallinger Grandcourt. Daniel no longer held a wavering opinion about
6860: his own birth. His fuller knowledge had tended to convince him that Sir
6861: Hugo was his father, and he conceived that the baronet, since he never
6862: approached a communication on the subject, wished him to have a tacit
6863: understanding of the fact, and to accept in silence what would be
6864: generally considered more than the due love and nurture. Sir Hugo’s
6865: marriage might certainly have been felt as a new ground of resentment
6866: by some youths in Deronda’s position, and the timid Lady Mallinger with
6867: her fast-coming little ones might have been images to scowl at, as
6868: likely to divert much that was disposable in the feelings and
6869: possessions of the baronet from one who felt his own claim to be prior.
6870: But hatred of innocent human obstacles was a form of moral stupidity
6871: not in Deronda’s grain; even the indignation which had long mingled
6872: itself with his affection for Sir Hugo took the quality of pain rather
6873: than of temper; and as his mind ripened to the idea of tolerance toward
6874: error, he habitually liked the idea with his own silent grievances.
6875: 
6876: The sense of an entailed disadvantage—the deformed foot doubtfully
6877: hidden by the shoe, makes a restlessly active spiritual yeast, and
6878: easily turns a self-centered, unloving nature into an Ishmaelite. But
6879: in the rarer sort, who presently see their own frustrated claim as one
6880: among a myriad, the inexorable sorrow takes the form of fellowship and
6881: makes the imagination tender. Deronda’s early-weakened susceptibility,
6882: charged at first with ready indignation and resistant pride, had raised
6883: in him a premature reflection on certain questions of life; it had
6884: given a bias to his conscience, a sympathy with certain ills, and a
6885: tension of resolve in certain directions, who marked him off from other
6886: youths much more than any talents he possessed.
6887: 
6888: One day near the end of the long vacation, when he had been making a
6889: tour in the Rhineland with his Eton tutor, and was come for a farewell
6890: stay at the Abbey before going to Cambridge, he said to Sir Hugo,
6891: 
6892: “What do you intend me to be, sir?” They were in the library, and it
6893: was the fresh morning. Sir Hugo had called him in to read a letter from
6894: a Cambridge Don who was to be interested in him; and since the baronet
6895: wore an air at once business-like and leisurely, the moment seemed
6896: propitious for entering on a grave subject which had never yet been
6897: thoroughly discussed.
6898: 
6899: “Whatever your inclination leads you to, my boy. I thought it right to
6900: give you the option of the army, but you shut the door on that, and I
6901: was glad. I don’t expect you to choose just yet—by-and-by, when you
6902: have looked about you a little more and tried your mettle among older
6903: men. The university has a good wide opening into the forum. There are
6904: prizes to be won, and a bit of good fortune often gives the turn to a
6905: man’s taste. From what I see and hear, I should think you can take up
6906: anything you like. You are in the deeper water with your classics than
6907: I ever got into, and if you are rather sick of that swimming, Cambridge
6908: is the place where you can go into mathematics with a will, and disport
6909: yourself on the dry sand as much as you like. I floundered along like a
6910: carp.”
6911: 
6912: “I suppose money will make some difference, sir,” said Daniel blushing.
6913: “I shall have to keep myself by-and-by.”
6914: 
6915: “Not exactly. I recommend you not to be extravagant—yes, yes, I
6916: know—you are not inclined to that—but you need not take up anything
6917: against the grain. You will have a bachelor’s income—enough for you to
6918: look about with. Perhaps I had better tell you that you may consider
6919: yourself secure of seven hundred a year. You might make yourself a
6920: barrister—be a writer—take up politics. I confess that is what would
6921: please me best. I should like to have you at my elbow and pulling with
6922: me.”
6923: 
6924: Deronda looked embarrassed. He felt that he ought to make some sign of
6925: gratitude, but other feelings clogged his tongue. A moment was passing
6926: by in which a question about his birth was throbbing within him, and
6927: yet it seemed more impossible than ever that the question should find
6928: vent—more impossible than ever that he could hear certain things from
6929: Sir Hugo’s lips. The liberal way in which he was dealt with was the
6930: more striking because the baronet had of late cared particularly for
6931: money, and for making the utmost of his life-interest in the estate by
6932: way of providing for his daughters; and as all this flashed through
6933: Daniel’s mind it was momentarily within his imagination that the
6934: provision for him might come in some way from his mother. But such
6935: vaporous conjecture passed away as quickly as it came.
6936: 
6937: Sir Hugo appeared not to notice anything peculiar in Daniel’s manner,
6938: and presently went on with his usual chatty liveliness.
6939: 
6940: “I am glad you have done some good reading outside your classics, and
6941: have got a grip of French and German. The truth is, unless a man can
6942: get the prestige and income of a Don and write donnish books, it’s
6943: hardly worth while for him to make a Greek and Latin machine of himself
6944: and be able to spin you out pages of the Greek dramatists at any verse
6945: you’ll give him as a cue. That’s all very fine, but in practical life
6946: nobody does give you the cue for pages of Greek. In fact, it’s a nicety
6947: of conversation which I would have you attend to—much quotation of any
6948: sort, even in English is bad. It tends to choke ordinary remark. One
6949: couldn’t carry on life comfortably without a little blindness to the
6950: fact that everything had been said better than we can put it ourselves.
6951: But talking of Dons, I have seen Dons make a capital figure in society;
6952: and occasionally he can shoot you down a cart-load of learning in the
6953: right place, which will tell in politics. Such men are wanted; and if
6954: you have any turn for being a Don, I say nothing against it.”
6955: 
6956: “I think there’s not much chance of that. Quicksett and Puller are both
6957: stronger than I am. I hope you will not be much disappointed if I don’t
6958: come out with high honors.”
6959: 
6960: “No, no. I should like you to do yourself credit, but for God’s sake
6961: don’t come out as a superior expensive kind of idiot, like young
6962: Brecon, who got a Double First, and has been learning to knit braces
6963: ever since. What I wish you to get is a passport in life. I don’t go
6964: against our university system: we want a little disinterested culture
6965: to make head against cotton and capital, especially in the House. My
6966: Greek has all evaporated; if I had to construe a verse on a sudden, I
6967: should get an apoplectic fit. But it formed my taste. I dare say my
6968: English is the better for it.”
6969: 
6970: On this point Daniel kept a respectful silence. The enthusiastic belief
6971: in Sir Hugo’s writings as a standard, and in the Whigs as the chosen
6972: race among politicians, had gradually vanished along with the seraphic
6973: boy’s face. He had not been the hardest of workers at Eton. Though some
6974: kinds of study and reading came as easily as boating to him, he was not
6975: of the material that usually makes the first-rate Eton scholar. There
6976: had sprung up in him a meditative yearning after wide knowledge which
6977: is likely always to abate ardor in the fight for prize acquirement in
6978: narrow tracks. Happily he was modest, and took any second-rateness in
6979: himself simply as a fact, not as a marvel necessarily to be accounted
6980: for by a superiority. Still, Mr. Fraser’s high opinion of the lad had
6981: not been altogether belied by the youth: Daniel had the stamp of rarity
6982: in a subdued fervor of sympathy, an activity of imagination on behalf
6983: of others which did not show itself effusively, but was continually
6984: seen in acts of considerateness that struck his companions as moral
6985: eccentricity. “Deronda would have been first-rate if he had had more
6986: ambition,” was a frequent remark about him. But how could a fellow push
6987: his way properly when he objected to swop for his own advantage,
6988: knocked under by choice when he was within an inch of victory, and,
6989: unlike the great Clive, would rather be the calf than the butcher? It
6990: was a mistake, however, to suppose that Deronda had not his share of
6991: ambition. We know he had suffered keenly from the belief that there was
6992: a tinge of dishonor in his lot; but there are some cases, and his was
6993: one of them, in which the sense of injury breeds—not the will to
6994: inflict injuries and climb over them as a ladder, but, a hatred of all
6995: injury. He had his flashes of fierceness and could hit out upon
6996: occasion, but the occasions were not always what might have been
6997: expected. For in what related to himself his resentful impulses had
6998: been early checked by a mastering affectionateness. Love has a habit of
6999: saying “Never mind” to angry self, who, sitting down for the nonce in
7000: the lower place, by-and-by gets used to it. So it was that as Deronda
7001: approached manhood his feeling for Sir Hugo, while it was getting more
7002: and more mixed with criticism, was gaining in that sort of allowance
7003: which reconciles criticism with tenderness. The dear old beautiful home
7004: and everything within it, Lady Mallinger and her little ones included,
7005: were consecrated for the youth as they had been for the boy—only with
7006: a certain difference of light on the objects. The altarpiece was no
7007: longer miraculously perfect, painted under infallible guidance, but the
7008: human hand discerned in the work was appealing to a reverent tenderness
7009: safer from the gusts of discovery. Certainly Deronda’s ambition, even
7010: in his spring-time, lay exceptionally aloof from conspicuous, vulgar
7011: triumph, and from other ugly forms of boyish energy; perhaps because he
7012: was early impassioned by ideas, and burned his fire on those heights.
7013: One may spend a good deal of energy in disliking and resisting what
7014: others pursue, and a boy who is fond of somebody else’s pencil-case may
7015: not be more energetic than another who is fond of giving his own
7016: pencil-case away. Still it was not Deronda’s disposition to escape from
7017: ugly scenes; he was more inclined to sit through them and take care of
7018: the fellow least able to take care of himself. It had helped to make
7019: him popular that he was sometimes a little compromised by this apparent
7020: comradeship. For a meditative interest in learning how human miseries
7021: are wrought—as precocious in him as another sort of genius in the poet
7022: who writes a Queen Mab at nineteen—was so infused with kindliness that
7023: it easily passed for comradeship. Enough. In many of our neighbors’
7024: lives there is much not only of error and lapse, but of a certain
7025: exquisite goodness which can never be written or even spoken—only
7026: divined by each of us, according to the inward instruction of our own
7027: privacy.
7028: 
7029: The impression he made at Cambridge corresponded to his position at
7030: Eton. Every one interested in him agreed that he might have taken a
7031: high place if his motives had been of a more pushing sort, and if he
7032: had not, instead of regarding studies as instruments of success,
7033: hampered himself with the notion that they were to feed motive and
7034: opinion—a notion which set him criticising methods and arguing against
7035: his freight and harness when he should have been using all his might to
7036: pull. In the beginning his work at the university had a new zest for
7037: him: indifferent to the continuation of Eton classical drill, he
7038: applied himself vigorously to mathematics, for which he had shown an
7039: early aptitude under Mr. Fraser, and he had the delight of feeling his
7040: strength in a comparatively fresh exercise of thought. That delight,
7041: and the favorable opinion of his tutor, determined him to try for a
7042: mathematical scholarship in the Easter of his second year: he wished to
7043: gratify Sir Hugo by some achievement, and the study of the higher
7044: mathematics, having the growing fascination inherent in all thinking
7045: which demands intensity, was making him a more exclusive worker than he
7046: had been before.
7047: 
7048: But here came the old check which had been growing with his growth. He
7049: found the inward bent toward comprehension and thoroughness diverging
7050: more and more from the track marked out by the standards of
7051: examination: he felt a heightening discontent with the wearing futility
7052: and enfeebling strain of a demand for excessive retention and dexterity
7053: without any insight into the principles which form the vital
7054: connections of knowledge. (Deronda’s undergraduateship occurred fifteen
7055: years ago, when the perfection of our university methods was not yet
7056: indisputable.) In hours when his dissatisfaction was strong upon him he
7057: reproached himself for having been attracted by the conventional
7058: advantage of belonging to an English university, and was tempted toward
7059: the project of asking Sir Hugo to let him quit Cambridge and pursue a
7060: more independent line of study abroad. The germs of this inclination
7061: had been already stirring in his boyish love of universal history,
7062: which made him want to be at home in foreign countries, and follow in
7063: imagination the traveling students of the middle ages. He longed now to
7064: have the sort of apprenticeship to life which would not shape him too
7065: definitely, and rob him of the choice that might come from a free
7066: growth. One sees that Deronda’s demerits were likely to be on the side
7067: of reflective hesitation, and this tendency was encouraged by his
7068: position; there was no need for him to get an immediate income, or to
7069: fit himself in haste for a profession; and his sensibility to the
7070: half-known facts of his parentage made him an excuse for lingering
7071: longer than others in a state of social neutrality. Other men, he
7072: inwardly said, had a more definite place and duties. But the project
7073: which flattered his inclination might not have gone beyond the stage of
7074: ineffective brooding, if certain circumstances had not quickened it
7075: into action.
7076: 
7077: The circumstances arose out of an enthusiastic friendship which
7078: extended into his after-life. Of the same year with himself, and
7079: occupying small rooms close to his, was a youth who had come as an
7080: exhibitioner from Christ’s Hospital, and had eccentricities enough for
7081: a Charles Lamb. Only to look at his pinched features and blonde hair
7082: hanging over his collar reminded one of pale quaint heads by early
7083: German painters; and when this faint coloring was lit up by a joke,
7084: there came sudden creases about the mouth and eyes which might have
7085: been moulded by the soul of an aged humorist. His father, an engraver
7086: of some distinction, had been dead eleven years, and his mother had
7087: three girls to educate and maintain on a meagre annuity. Hans
7088: Meyrick—he had been daringly christened after Holbein—felt himself
7089: the pillar, or rather the knotted and twisted trunk, round which these
7090: feeble climbing plants must cling. There was no want of ability or of
7091: honest well-meaning affection to make the prop trustworthy: the ease
7092: and quickness with which he studied might serve him to win prizes at
7093: Cambridge, as he had done among the Blue Coats, in spite of
7094: irregularities. The only danger was, that the incalculable tendencies
7095: in him might be fatally timed, and that his good intentions might be
7096: frustrated by some act which was not due to habit but to capricious,
7097: scattered impulses. He could not be said to have any one bad habit; yet
7098: at longer or shorter intervals he had fits of impish recklessness, and
7099: did things that would have made the worst habits.
7100: 
7101: Hans in his right mind, however, was a lovable creature, and in Deronda
7102: he had happened to find a friend who was likely to stand by him with
7103: the more constancy, from compassion for these brief aberrations that
7104: might bring a long repentance. Hans, indeed, shared Deronda’s rooms
7105: nearly as much as he used his own: to Deronda he poured himself out on
7106: his studies, his affairs, his hopes; the poverty of his home, and his
7107: love for the creatures there; the itching of his fingers to draw, and
7108: his determination to fight it away for the sake of getting some sort of
7109: a plum that he might divide with his mother and the girls. He wanted no
7110: confidence in return, but seemed to take Deronda as an Olympian who
7111: needed nothing—an egotism in friendship which is common enough with
7112: mercurial, expansive natures. Deronda was content, and gave Meyrick all
7113: the interest he claimed, getting at last a brotherly anxiety about him,
7114: looking after him in his erratic moments, and contriving by adroitly
7115: delicate devices not only to make up for his friend’s lack of pence,
7116: but to save him from threatening chances. Such friendship easily
7117: becomes tender: the one spreads strong sheltering wings that delight in
7118: spreading, the other gets the warm protection which is also a delight.
7119: Meyrick was going in for a classical scholarship, and his success, in
7120: various ways momentous, was the more probable from the steadying
7121: influence of Deronda’s friendship.
7122: 
7123: But an imprudence of Meyrick’s, committed at the beginning of the
7124: autumn term, threatened to disappoint his hopes. With his usual
7125: alternation between unnecessary expense and self-privation, he had
7126: given too much money for an old engraving which fascinated him, and to
7127: make up for it, had come from London in a third-class carriage with his
7128: eyes exposed to a bitter wind and any irritating particles the wind
7129: might drive before it. The consequence was a severe inflammation of the
7130: eyes, which for some time hung over him the threat of a lasting injury.
7131: This crushing trouble called out all Deronda’s readiness to devote
7132: himself, and he made every other occupation secondary to that of being
7133: companion and eyes to Hans, working with him and for him at his
7134: classics, that if possible his chance of the classical scholarship
7135: might be saved. Hans, to keep the knowledge of his suffering from his
7136: mother and sisters, alleged his work as a reason for passing the
7137: Christmas at Cambridge, and his friend stayed up with him.
7138: 
7139: Meanwhile Deronda relaxed his hold on his mathematics, and Hans,
7140: reflecting on this, at length said: “Old fellow, while you are hoisting
7141: me you are risking yourself. With your mathematical cram one may be
7142: like Moses or Mohammed or somebody of that sort who had to cram, and
7143: forgot in one day what it had taken him forty to learn.”
7144: 
7145: Deronda would not admit that he cared about the risk, and he had really
7146: been beguiled into a little indifference by double sympathy: he was
7147: very anxious that Hans should not miss the much-needed scholarship, and
7148: he felt a revival of interest in the old studies. Still, when Hans,
7149: rather late in the day, got able to use his own eyes, Deronda had
7150: tenacity enough to try hard and recover his lost ground. He failed,
7151: however; but he had the satisfaction of seeing Meyrick win.
7152: 
7153: Success, as a sort of beginning that urged completion, might have
7154: reconciled Deronda to his university course; but the emptiness of all
7155: things, from politics to pastimes, is never so striking to us as when
7156: we fail in them. The loss of the personal triumph had no severity for
7157: him, but the sense of having spent his time ineffectively in a mode of
7158: working which had been against the grain, gave him a distaste for any
7159: renewal of the process, which turned his imagined project of quitting
7160: Cambridge into a serious intention. In speaking of his intention to
7161: Meyrick he made it appear that he was glad of the turn events had
7162: taken—glad to have the balance dip decidedly, and feel freed from his
7163: hesitations; but he observed that he must of course submit to any
7164: strong objection on the part of Sir Hugo.
7165: 
7166: Meyrick’s joy and gratitude were disturbed by much uneasiness. He
7167: believed in Deronda’s alleged preference, but he felt keenly that in
7168: serving him Daniel had placed himself at a disadvantage in Sir Hugo’s
7169: opinion, and he said mournfully, “If you had got the scholarship, Sir
7170: Hugo would have thought that you asked to leave us with a better grace.
7171: You have spoiled your luck for my sake, and I can do nothing to amend
7172: it.”
7173: 
7174: “Yes, you can; you are to be a first-rate fellow. I call that a
7175: first-rate investment of my luck.”
7176: 
7177: “Oh, confound it! You save an ugly mongrel from drowning, and expect
7178: him to cut a fine figure. The poets have made tragedies enough about
7179: signing one’s self over to wickedness for the sake of getting something
7180: plummy; I shall write a tragedy of a fellow who signed himself over to
7181: be good, and was uncomfortable ever after.”
7182: 
7183: But Hans lost no time in secretly writing the history of the affair to
7184: Sir Hugo, making it plain that but for Deronda’s generous devotion he
7185: could hardly have failed to win the prize he had been working for.
7186: 
7187: The two friends went up to town together: Meyrick to rejoice with his
7188: mother and the girls in their little home at Chelsea; Deronda to carry
7189: out the less easy task of opening his mind to Sir Hugo. He relied a
7190: little on the baronet’s general tolerance of eccentricities, but he
7191: expected more opposition than he met with. He was received with even
7192: warmer kindness than usual, the failure was passed over lightly, and
7193: when he detailed his reasons for wishing to quit the university and go
7194: to study abroad, Sir Hugo sat for some time in a silence which was
7195: rather meditative than surprised. At last he said, looking at Daniel
7196: with examination, “So you don’t want to be an Englishman to the
7197: backbone after all?”
7198: 
7199: “I want to be an Englishman, but I want to understand other points of
7200: view. And I want to get rid of a merely English attitude in studies.”
7201: 
7202: “I see; you don’t want to be turned out in the same mould as every
7203: other youngster. And I have nothing to say against your doffing some of
7204: our national prejudices. I feel the better myself for having spent a
7205: good deal of my time abroad. But, for God’s sake, keep an English cut,
7206: and don’t become indifferent to bad tobacco! And, my dear boy, it is
7207: good to be unselfish and generous; but don’t carry that too far. It
7208: will not do to give yourself to be melted down for the benefit of the
7209: tallow-trade; you must know where to find yourself. However, I shall
7210: put no veto on your going. Wait until I can get off Committee, and I’ll
7211: run over with you.”
7212: 
7213: So Deronda went according to his will. But not before he had spent some
7214: hours with Hans Meyrick, and been introduced to the mother and sisters
7215: in the Chelsea home. The shy girls watched and registered every look of
7216: their brother’s friend, declared by Hans to have been the salvation of
7217: him, a fellow like nobody else, and, in fine, a brick. They so
7218: thoroughly accepted Deronda as an ideal, that when he was gone the
7219: youngest set to work, under the criticism of the two elder girls, to
7220: paint him as Prince Camaralzaman.

7225: CHAPTER XVII.
7226: 
7227:         “This is true the poet sings,
7228:   That a sorrow’s crown of sorrow
7229:   Is remembering happier things.”
7230:                                 —TENNYSON: _In Memoriam_.
7231: 
7232: 
7233: On a fine evening near the end of July, Deronda was rowing himself on
7234: the Thames. It was already a year or more since he had come back to
7235: England, with the understanding that his education was finished, and
7236: that he was somehow to take his place in English society; but though,
7237: in deference to Sir Hugo’s wish, and to fence off idleness, he had
7238: begun to read law, this apparent decision had been without other result
7239: than to deepen the roots of indecision. His old love of boating had
7240: revived with the more force now that he was in town with the
7241: Mallingers, because he could nowhere else get the same still seclusion
7242: which the river gave him. He had a boat of his own at Putney, and
7243: whenever Sir Hugo did not want him, it was his chief holiday to row
7244: till past sunset and come in again with the stars. Not that he was in a
7245: sentimental stage; but he was in another sort of contemplative mood
7246: perhaps more common in the young men of our day—that of questioning
7247: whether it were worth while to take part in the battle of the world: I
7248: mean, of course, the young men in whom the unproductive labor of
7249: questioning is sustained by three or five per cent, on capital which
7250: somebody else has battled for. It puzzled Sir Hugo that one who made a
7251: splendid contrast with all that was sickly and puling should be
7252: hampered with ideas which, since they left an accomplished Whig like
7253: himself unobstructed, could be no better than spectral illusions;
7254: especially as Deronda set himself against authorship—a vocation which
7255: is understood to turn foolish thinking into funds.
7256: 
7257: Rowing in his dark-blue shirt and skull-cap, his curls closely clipped,
7258: his mouth beset with abundant soft waves of beard, he bore only
7259: disguised traces of the seraphic boy “trailing clouds of glory.” Still,
7260: even one who had never seen him since his boyhood might have looked at
7261: him with slow recognition, due perhaps to the peculiarity of the gaze
7262: which Gwendolen chose to call “dreadful,” though it had really a very
7263: mild sort of scrutiny. The voice, sometimes audible in subdued snatches
7264: of song, had turned out merely a high baritone; indeed, only to look at
7265: his lithe, powerful frame and the firm gravity of his face would have
7266: been enough for an experienced guess that he had no rare and ravishing
7267: tenor such as nature reluctantly makes at some sacrifice. Look at his
7268: hands: they are not small and dimpled, with tapering fingers that seem
7269: to have only a deprecating touch: they are long, flexible,
7270: firmly-grasping hands, such as Titian has painted in a picture where he
7271: wanted to show the combination of refinement with force. And there is
7272: something of a likeness, too, between the faces belonging to the
7273: hands—in both the uniform pale-brown skin, the perpendicular brow, the
7274: calmly penetrating eyes. Not seraphic any longer: thoroughly
7275: terrestrial and manly; but still of a kind to raise belief in a human
7276: dignity which can afford to recognize poor relations.
7277: 
7278: Such types meet us here and there among average conditions; in a
7279: workman, for example, whistling over a bit of measurement and lifting
7280: his eyes to answer our question about the road. And often the grand
7281: meanings of faces as well as of written words may lie chiefly in the
7282: impressions that happen just now to be of importance in relation to
7283: Deronda, rowing on the Thames in a very ordinary equipment for a young
7284: Englishman at leisure, and passing under Kew Bridge with no thought of
7285: an adventure in which his appearance was likely to play any part. In
7286: fact, he objected very strongly to the notion, which others had not
7287: allowed him to escape, that his appearance was of a kind to draw
7288: attention; and hints of this, intended to be complimentary, found an
7289: angry resonance in him, coming from mingled experiences, to which a
7290: clue has already been given. His own face in the glass had during many
7291: years associated for him with thoughts of some one whom he must be
7292: like—one about whose character and lot he continually wondered, and
7293: never dared to ask.
7294: 
7295: In the neighborhood of Kew Bridge, between six and seven o’clock, the
7296: river was no solitude. Several persons were sauntering on the
7297: towing-path, and here and there a boat was plying. Deronda had been
7298: rowing fast to get over this spot, when, becoming aware of a great
7299: barge advancing toward him, he guided his boat aside, and rested on his
7300: oar within a couple of yards of the river-brink. He was all the while
7301: unconsciously continuing the low-toned chant which had haunted his
7302: throat all the way up the river—the gondolier’s song in the _Otello_,
7303: where Rossini has worthily set to music the immortal words of Dante,
7304: 
7305:           “Nessun maggior dolore
7306:   Che ricordarsi del tempo felice
7307:   Nella miseria”:[*]
7308: 
7309:      [* Dante’s words are best rendered by our own poet in the lines at
7310:      the head of the chapter.]
7311: 
7312: and, as he rested on his oar, the pianissimo fall of the melodic wail
7313: “nella miseria” was distinctly audible on the brink of the water. Three
7314: or four persons had paused at various spots to watch the barge passing
7315: the bridge, and doubtless included in their notice the young gentleman
7316: in the boat; but probably it was only to one ear that the low vocal
7317: sounds came with more significance than if they had been an
7318: insect-murmur amidst the sum of current noises. Deronda, awaiting the
7319: barge, now turning his head to the river-side, and saw at a few yards’
7320: distant from him a figure which might have been an impersonation of the
7321: misery he was unconsciously giving voice to: a girl hardly more than
7322: eighteen, of low slim figure, with most delicate little face, her dark
7323: curls pushed behind her ears under a large black hat, a long woolen
7324: cloak over her shoulders. Her hands were hanging down clasped before
7325: her, and her eyes were fixed on the river with a look of immovable,
7326: statue-like despair. This strong arrest of his attention made him cease
7327: singing: apparently his voice had entered her inner world without her
7328: taking any note of whence it came, for when it suddenly ceased she
7329: changed her attitude slightly, and, looking round with a frightened
7330: glance, met Deronda’s face. It was but a couple of moments, but that
7331: seemed a long while for two people to look straight at each other. Her
7332: look was something like that of a fawn or other gentle animal before it
7333: turns to run away: no blush, no special alarm, but only some timidity
7334: which yet could not hinder her from a long look before she turned. In
7335: fact, it seemed to Deronda that she was only half conscious of her
7336: surroundings: was she hungry, or was there some other cause of
7337: bewilderment? He felt an outleap of interest and compassion toward her;
7338: but the next instant she had turned and walked away to a neighboring
7339: bench under a tree. He had no right to linger and watch her:
7340: poorly-dressed, melancholy women are common sights; it was only the
7341: delicate beauty, picturesque lines and color of the image that was
7342: exceptional, and these conditions made it more markedly impossible that
7343: he should obtrude his interest upon her. He began to row away and was
7344: soon far up the river; but no other thoughts were busy enough quite to
7345: expel that pale image of unhappy girlhood. He fell again and again to
7346: speculating on the probable romance that lay behind that loneliness and
7347: look of desolation; then to smile at his own share in the prejudice
7348: that interesting faces must have interesting adventures; then to
7349: justify himself for feeling that sorrow was the more tragic when it
7350: befell delicate, childlike beauty.
7351: 
7352: “I should not have forgotten the look of misery if she had been ugly
7353: and vulgar,” he said to himself. But there was no denying that the
7354: attractiveness of the image made it likelier to last. It was clear to
7355: him as an onyx cameo; the brown-black drapery, the white face with
7356: small, small features and dark, long-lashed eyes. His mind glanced over
7357: the girl-tragedies that are going on in the world, hidden, unheeded, as
7358: if they were but tragedies of the copse or hedgerow, where the helpless
7359: drag wounded wings forsakenly, and streak the shadowed moss with the
7360: red moment-hand of their own death. Deronda of late, in his solitary
7361: excursions, had been occupied chiefly with uncertainties about his own
7362: course; but those uncertainties, being much at their leisure, were wont
7363: to have such wide-sweeping connections with all life and history that
7364: the new image of helpless sorrow easily blent itself with what seemed
7365: to him the strong array of reasons why he should shrink from getting
7366: into that routine of the world which makes men apologize for all its
7367: wrong-doing, and take opinions as mere professional equipment—why he
7368: should not draw strongly at any thread in the hopelessly-entangled
7369: scheme of things.
7370: 
7371: He used his oars little, satisfied to go with the tide and be taken
7372: back by it. It was his habit to indulge himself in that solemn
7373: passivity which easily comes with the lengthening shadows and mellow
7374: light, when thinking and desiring melt together imperceptibly, and what
7375: in other hours may have seemed argument takes the quality of passionate
7376: vision. By the time he had come back again with the tide past Richmond
7377: Bridge the sun was near setting: and the approach of his favorite
7378: hour—with its deepening stillness and darkening masses of tree and
7379: building between the double glow of the sky and the river—disposed him
7380: to linger as if they had been an unfinished strain of music. He looked
7381: out for a perfectly solitary spot where he could lodge his boat against
7382: the bank, and, throwing himself on his back with his head propped on
7383: the cushions, could watch out the light of sunset and the opening of
7384: that bead-roll which some oriental poet describes as God’s call to the
7385: little stars, who each answer, “Here am I.” He chose a spot in the bend
7386: of the river just opposite Kew Gardens, where he had a great breadth of
7387: water before him reflecting the glory of the sky, while he himself was
7388: in shadow. He lay with his hands behind his head, propped on a level
7389: with the boat’s edge, so that he could see all round him, but could not
7390: be seen by any one at a few yards’ distance; and for a long while he
7391: never turned his eyes from the view right in front of him. He was
7392: forgetting everything else in a half-speculative, half-involuntary
7393: identification of himself with the objects he was looking at, thinking
7394: how far it might be possible habitually to shift his centre till his
7395: own personality would be no less outside him than the landscape—when
7396: the sense of something moving on the bank opposite him where it was
7397: bordered by a line of willow bushes, made him turn his glance
7398: thitherward. In the first moment he had a darting presentiment about
7399: the moving figure; and now he could see the small face with the strange
7400: dying sunlight upon it. He feared to frighten her by a sudden movement,
7401: and watched her with motionless attention. She looked round, but seemed
7402: only to gather security from the apparent solitude, hid her hat among
7403: the willows, and immediately took off her woolen cloak. Presently she
7404: seated herself and deliberately dipped the cloak in the water, holding
7405: it there a little while, then taking it out with effort, rising from
7406: her seat as she did so. By this time Deronda felt sure that she meant
7407: to wrap the wet cloak round her as a drowning shroud; there was no
7408: longer time to hesitate about frightening her. He rose and seized his
7409: oar to ply across; happily her position lay a little below him. The
7410: poor thing, overcome with terror at this sign of discovery from the
7411: opposite bank, sank down on the brink again, holding her cloak half out
7412: of the water. She crouched and covered her face as if she kept a faint
7413: hope that she had not been seen, and that the boatman was accidentally
7414: coming toward her. But soon he was within brief space of her, steadying
7415: his boat against the bank, and speaking, but very gently,
7416: 
7417: “Don’t be afraid. You are unhappy. Pray, trust me. Tell me what I can
7418: do to help you.”
7419: 
7420: She raised her head and looked up at him. His face now was toward the
7421: light, and she knew it again. But she did not speak for a few moments
7422: which were a renewal of their former gaze at each other. At last she
7423: said in a low sweet voice, with an accent so distinct that it suggested
7424: foreignness and yet was not foreign, “I saw you before,” and then added
7425: dreamily, after a like pause, “nella miseria.”
7426: 
7427: Deronda, not understanding the connection of her thoughts, supposed
7428: that her mind was weakened by distress and hunger.
7429: 
7430: “It was you, singing?” she went on, hesitatingly—“Nessun maggior
7431: dolore.” The mere words themselves uttered in her sweet undertones
7432: seemed to give the melody to Deronda’s ear.
7433: 
7434: “Ah, yes,” he said, understanding now, “I am often singing them. But I
7435: fear you will injure yourself staying here. Pray let me take you in my
7436: boat to some place of safety. And that wet cloak—let me take it.”
7437: 
7438: He would not attempt to take it without her leave, dreading lest he
7439: should scare her. Even at his words, he fancied that she shrank and
7440: clutched the cloak more tenaciously. But her eyes were fixed on him
7441: with a question in them as she said, “You look good. Perhaps it is
7442: God’s command.”
7443: 
7444: “Do trust me. Let me help you. I will die before I will let any harm
7445: come to you.”
7446: 
7447: She rose from her sitting posture, first dragging the saturated cloak
7448: and then letting it fall on the ground—it was too heavy for her tired
7449: arms. Her little woman’s figure as she laid her delicate chilled hands
7450: together one over the other against her waist, and went a step backward
7451: while she leaned her head forward as if not to lose sight of his face,
7452: was unspeakably touching.
7453: 
7454: “Great God!” the words escaped Deronda in a tone so low and solemn that
7455: they seemed like a prayer become unconsciously vocal. The agitating
7456: impression this forsaken girl was making on him stirred a fibre that
7457: lay close to his deepest interest in the fates of women—“perhaps my
7458: mother was like this one.” The old thought had come now with a new
7459: impetus of mingled feeling, and urged that exclamation in which both
7460: East and West have for ages concentrated their awe in the presence of
7461: inexorable calamity.
7462: 
7463: The low-toned words seemed to have some reassurance in them for the
7464: hearer: she stepped forward close to the boat’s side, and Deronda put
7465: out his hand, hoping now that she would let him help her in. She had
7466: already put her tiny hand into his which closed around it, when some
7467: new thought struck her, and drawing back she said,
7468: 
7469: “I have nowhere to go—nobody belonging to me in all this land.”
7470: 
7471: “I will take you to a lady who has daughters,” said Deronda,
7472: immediately. He felt a sort of relief in gathering that the wretched
7473: home and cruel friends he imagined her to be fleeing from were not in
7474: the near background. Still she hesitated, and said more timidly than
7475: ever,
7476: 
7477: “Do you belong to the theatre?”
7478: 
7479: “No; I have nothing to do with the theatre,” said Deronda, in a decided
7480: tone. Then beseechingly, “I will put you in perfect safety at once;
7481: with a lady, a good woman; I am sure she will be kind. Let us lose no
7482: time: you will make yourself ill. Life may still become sweet to you.
7483: There are good people—there are good women who will take care of you.”
7484: 
7485: She drew backward no more, but stepped in easily, as if she were used
7486: to such action, and sat down on the cushions.
7487: 
7488: “You had a covering for your head,” said Deronda.
7489: 
7490: “My hat?” (She lifted up her hands to her head.) “It is quite hidden in
7491: the bush.”
7492: 
7493: “I will find it,” said Deronda, putting out his hand deprecatingly as
7494: she attempted to rise. “The boat is fixed.”
7495: 
7496: He jumped out, found the hat, and lifted up the saturated cloak,
7497: wringing it and throwing it into the bottom of the boat.
7498: 
7499: “We must carry the cloak away, to prevent any one who may have noticed
7500: you from thinking you have been drowned,” he said, cheerfully, as he
7501: got in again and presented the old hat to her. “I wish I had any other
7502: garment than my coat to offer you. But shall you mind throwing it over
7503: your shoulders while we are on the water? It is quite an ordinary thing
7504: to do, when people return late and are not enough provided with wraps.”
7505: He held out the coat toward her with a smile, and there came a faint
7506: melancholy smile in answer, as she took it and put it on very cleverly.
7507: 
7508: “I have some biscuits—should you like them?” said Deronda.
7509: 
7510: “No; I cannot eat. I had still some money left to buy bread.”
7511: 
7512: He began to ply his oar without further remark, and they went along
7513: swiftly for many minutes without speaking. She did not look at him, but
7514: was watching the oar, leaning forward in an attitude of repose, as if
7515: she were beginning to feel the comfort of returning warmth and the
7516: prospect of life instead of death. The twilight was deepening; the red
7517: flush was all gone and the little stars were giving their answer one
7518: after another. The moon was rising, but was still entangled among the
7519: trees and buildings. The light was not such that he could distinctly
7520: discern the expression of her features or her glance, but they were
7521: distinctly before him nevertheless—features and a glance which seemed
7522: to have given a fuller meaning for him to the human face. Among his
7523: anxieties one was dominant: his first impression about her, that her
7524: mind might be disordered, had not been quite dissipated: the project of
7525: suicide was unmistakable, and given a deeper color to every other
7526: suspicious sign. He longed to begin a conversation, but abstained,
7527: wishing to encourage the confidence that might induce her to speak
7528: first. At last she did speak.
7529: 
7530: “I like to listen to the oar.”
7531: 
7532: “So do I.”
7533: 
7534: “If you had not come, I should have been dead now.”
7535: 
7536: “I cannot bear you to speak of that. I hope you will never be sorry
7537: that I came.”
7538: 
7539: “I cannot see how I shall be glad to live. The _maggior dolore_ and the
7540: _miseria_ have lasted longer than the _tempo felice_.” She paused and
7541: then went on dreamily,—“_Dolore—miseria_—I think those words are
7542: alive.”
7543: 
7544: Deronda was mute: to question her seemed an unwarrantable freedom; he
7545: shrank from appearing to claim the authority of a benefactor, or to
7546: treat her with the less reverence because she was in distress. She went
7547: on musingly,
7548: 
7549: “I thought it was not wicked. Death and life are one before the
7550: Eternal. I know our fathers slew their children and then slew
7551: themselves, to keep their souls pure. I meant it so. But now I am
7552: commanded to live. I cannot see how I shall live.”
7553: 
7554: “You will find friends. I will find them for you.”
7555: 
7556: She shook her head and said mournfully, “Not my mother and brother. I
7557: cannot find them.”
7558: 
7559: “You are English? You must be—speaking English so perfectly.”
7560: 
7561: She did not answer immediately, but looked at Deronda again, straining
7562: to see him in the double light. Until now she had been watching the
7563: oar. It seemed as if she were half roused, and wondered which part of
7564: her impression was dreaming and which waking. Sorrowful isolation had
7565: benumbed her sense of reality, and the power of distinguishing outward
7566: and inward was continually slipping away from her. Her look was full of
7567: wondering timidity such as the forsaken one in the desert might have
7568: lifted to the angelic vision before she knew whether his message was in
7569: anger or in pity.
7570: 
7571: “You want to know if I am English?” she said at last, while Deronda was
7572: reddening nervously under a gaze which he felt more fully than he saw.
7573: 
7574: “I want to know nothing except what you like to tell me,” he said,
7575: still uneasy in the fear that her mind was wandering. “Perhaps it is
7576: not good for you to talk.”
7577: 
7578: “Yes, I will tell you. I am English-born. But I am a Jewess.”
7579: 
7580: Deronda was silent, inwardly wondering that he had not said this to
7581: himself before, though any one who had seen delicate-faced Spanish
7582: girls might simply have guessed her to be Spanish.
7583: 
7584: “Do you despise me for it?” she said presently in low tones, which had
7585: a sadness that pierced like a cry from a small dumb creature in fear.
7586: 
7587: “Why should I?” said Deronda. “I am not so foolish.”
7588: 
7589: “I know many Jews are bad.”
7590: 
7591: “So are many Christians. But I should not think it fair for you to
7592: despise me because of that.”
7593: 
7594: “My mother and brother were good. But I shall never find them. I am
7595: come a long way—from abroad. I ran away; but I cannot tell you—I
7596: cannot speak of it. I thought I might find my mother again—God would
7597: guide me. But then I despaired. This morning when the light came, I
7598: felt as if one word kept sounding within me—Never! never! But now—I
7599: begin—to think—” her words were broken by rising sobs—“I am
7600: commanded to live—perhaps we are going to her.”
7601: 
7602: With an outburst of weeping she buried her head on her knees. He hoped
7603: that this passionate weeping might relieve her excitement. Meanwhile he
7604: was inwardly picturing in much embarrassment how he should present
7605: himself with her in Park Lane—the course which he had at first
7606: unreflectingly determined on. No one kinder and more gentle than Lady
7607: Mallinger; but it was hardly probable that she would be at home; and he
7608: had a shuddering sense of a lackey staring at this delicate, sorrowful
7609: image of womanhood—of glaring lights and fine staircases, and perhaps
7610: chilling suspicious manners from lady’s maid and housekeeper, that
7611: might scare the mind already in a state of dangerous susceptibility.
7612: But to take her to any other shelter than a home already known to him
7613: was not to be contemplated: he was full of fears about the issue of the
7614: adventure which had brought on him a responsibility all the heavier for
7615: the strong and agitating impression this childlike creature had made on
7616: him. But another resource came to mind: he could venture to take her to
7617: Mrs. Meyrick’s—to the small house at Chelsea—where he had been often
7618: enough since his return from abroad to feel sure that he could appeal
7619: there to generous hearts, which had a romantic readiness to believe in
7620: innocent need and to help it. Hans Meyrick was safe away in Italy, and
7621: Deronda felt the comfort of presenting himself with his charge at a
7622: house where he would be met by a motherly figure of quakerish neatness,
7623: and three girls who hardly knew of any evil closer to them than what
7624: lay in history-books, and dramas, and would at once associate a lovely
7625: Jewess with Rebecca in _Ivanhoe_, besides thinking that everything they
7626: did at Deronda’s request would be done for their idol, Hans. The vision
7627: of the Chelsea home once raised, Deronda no longer hesitated.
7628: 
7629: The rumbling thither in the cab after the stillness of the water seemed
7630: long. Happily his charge had been quiet since her fit of weeping, and
7631: submitted like a tired child. When they were in the cab, she laid down
7632: her hat and tried to rest her head, but the jolting movement would not
7633: let it rest. Still she dozed, and her sweet head hung helpless, first
7634: on one side, then on the other.
7635: 
7636: “They are too good to have any fear about taking her in,” thought
7637: Deronda. Her person, her voice, her exquisite utterance, were one
7638: strong appeal to belief and tenderness. Yet what had been the history
7639: which had brought her to this desolation? He was going on a strange
7640: errand—to ask shelter for this waif. Then there occurred to him the
7641: beautiful story Plutarch somewhere tells of the Delphic women: how when
7642: the Maenads, outworn with their torch-lit wanderings, lay down to sleep
7643: in the market-place, the matrons came and stood silently round them to
7644: keep guard over their slumbers; then, when they waked, ministered to
7645: them tenderly and saw them safely to their own borders. He could trust
7646: the women he was going to for having hearts as good.
7647: 
7648: Deronda felt himself growing older this evening and entering on a new
7649: phase in finding a life to which his own had come—perhaps as a rescue;
7650: but how to make sure that snatching from death was rescue? The moment
7651: of finding a fellow-creature is often as full of mingled doubt and
7652: exultation as the moment of finding an idea.
7653: 
7654: 
7655: 
7656: 
7657: CHAPTER XVIII.
7658: 
7659:   Life is a various mother: now she dons
7660:   Her plumes and brilliants, climbs the marble stairs
7661:   With head aloft, nor ever turns her eyes
7662:   On lackeys who attend her; now she dwells
7663:   Grim-clad, up darksome alleys, breathes hot gin,
7664:   And screams in pauper riot.
7665: 
7666:                              But to these
7667:   She came a frugal matron, neat and deft,
7668:   With cheerful morning thoughts and quick device
7669:   To find the much in little.
7670: 
7671: 
7672: Mrs. Meyrick’s house was not noisy: the front parlor looked on the
7673: river, and the back on gardens, so that though she was reading aloud to
7674: her daughters, the window could be left open to freshen the air of the
7675: small double room where a lamp and two candles were burning. The
7676: candles were on a table apart for Kate, who was drawing illustrations
7677: for a publisher; the lamp was not only for the reader but for Amy and
7678: Mab, who were embroidering satin cushions for “the great world.”
7679: 
7680: Outside, the house looked very narrow and shabby, the bright light
7681: through the holland blind showing the heavy old-fashioned window-frame;
7682: but it is pleasant to know that many such grim-walled slices of space
7683: in our foggy London have been and still are the homes of a culture the
7684: more spotlessly free from vulgarity, because poverty has rendered
7685: everything like display an impersonal question, and all the grand shows
7686: of the world simply a spectacle which rouses petty rivalry or vain
7687: effort after possession.
7688: 
7689: The Meyricks’ was a home of that kind: and they all clung to this
7690: particular house in a row because its interior was filled with objects
7691: always in the same places, which, for the mother held memories of her
7692: marriage time, and for the young ones seemed as necessary and
7693: uncriticised a part of their world as the stars of the Great Bear seen
7694: from the back windows. Mrs. Meyrick had borne much stint of other
7695: matters that she might be able to keep some engravings specially
7696: cherished by her husband; and the narrow spaces of wall held a world
7697: history in scenes and heads which the children had early learned by
7698: heart. The chairs and tables were also old friends preferred to new.
7699: But in these two little parlors with no furniture that a broker would
7700: have cared to cheapen except the prints and piano, there was space and
7701: apparatus for a wide-glancing, nicely-select life, opened to the
7702: highest things in music, painting and poetry. I am not sure that in the
7703: times of greatest scarcity, before Kate could get paid-work, these
7704: ladies had always had a servant to light their fires and sweep their
7705: rooms; yet they were fastidious in some points, and could not believe
7706: that the manners of ladies in the fashionable world were so full of
7707: coarse selfishness, petty quarreling, and slang as they are represented
7708: to be in what are called literary photographs. The Meyricks had their
7709: little oddities, streaks of eccentricity from the mother’s blood as
7710: well as the father’s, their minds being like mediæval houses with
7711: unexpected recesses and openings from this into that, flights of steps
7712: and sudden outlooks.
7713: 
7714: But mother and daughters were all united by a triple bond—family love;
7715: admiration for the finest work, the best action; and habitual industry.
7716: Hans’ desire to spend some of his money in making their lives more
7717: luxurious had been resisted by all of them, and both they and he had
7718: been thus saved from regrets at the threatened triumphs of his yearning
7719: for art over the attractions of secured income—a triumph that would
7720: by-and-by oblige him to give up his fellowship. They could all afford
7721: to laugh at his Gavarni-caricatures and to hold him blameless in
7722: following a natural bent which their unselfishness and independence had
7723: left without obstacle. It was enough for them to go on in their old
7724: way, only having a grand treat of opera-going (to the gallery) when
7725: Hans came home on a visit.
7726: 
7727: Seeing the group they made this evening, one could hardly wish them to
7728: change their way of life. They were all alike small, and so in due
7729: proportion to their miniature rooms. Mrs. Meyrick was reading aloud
7730: from a French book; she was a lively little woman, half French, half
7731: Scotch, with a pretty articulateness of speech that seemed to make
7732: daylight in her hearer’s understanding. Though she was not yet fifty,
7733: her rippling hair, covered by a quakerish net cap, was chiefly gray,
7734: but her eyebrows were brown as the bright eyes below them; her black
7735: dress, almost like a priest’s cassock with its rows of buttons, suited
7736: a neat figure hardly five feet high. The daughters were to match the
7737: mother, except that Mab had Hans’ light hair and complexion, with a
7738: bossy, irregular brow, and other quaintnesses that reminded one of him.
7739: Everything about them was compact, from the firm coils of their hair,
7740: fastened back _à la Chinoise_, to their gray skirts in Puritan
7741: nonconformity with the fashion, which at that time would have demanded
7742: that four feminine circumferences should fill all the free space in the
7743: front parlor. All four, if they had been wax-work, might have been
7744: packed easily in a fashionable lady’s traveling trunk. Their faces
7745: seemed full of speech, as if their minds had been shelled, after the
7746: manner of horse-chestnuts, and become brightly visible. The only large
7747: thing of its kind in the room was Hafiz, the Persian cat, comfortably
7748: poised on the brown leather back of a chair, and opening his large eyes
7749: now and then to see that the lower animals were not in any mischief.
7750: 
7751: The book Mrs. Meyrick had before her was Erckmann-Chatrian’s _Historie
7752: d’un Conscrit_. She had just finished reading it aloud, and Mab, who
7753: had let her work fall on the ground while she stretched her head
7754: forward and fixed her eyes on the reader, exclaimed,
7755: 
7756: “I think that is the finest story in the world.”
7757: 
7758: “Of course, Mab!” said Amy, “it is the last you have heard. Everything
7759: that pleases you is the best in its turn.”
7760: 
7761: “It is hardly to be called a story,” said Kate. “It is a bit of history
7762: brought near us with a strong telescope. We can see the soldiers’
7763: faces: no, it is more than that—we can hear everything—we can almost
7764: hear their hearts beat.”
7765: 
7766: “I don’t care what you call it,” said Mab, flirting away her thimble.
7767: “Call it a chapter in Revelations. It makes me want to do something
7768: good, something grand. It makes me so sorry for everybody. It makes me
7769: like Schiller—I want to take the world in my arms and kiss it. I must
7770: kiss you instead, little mother!” She threw her arms round her mother’s
7771: neck.
7772: 
7773: “Whenever you are in that mood, Mab, down goes your work,” said Amy.
7774: “It would be doing something good to finish your cushion without
7775: soiling it.”
7776: 
7777: “Oh—oh—oh!” groaned Mab, as she stooped to pick up her work and
7778: thimble. “I wish I had three wounded conscripts to take care of.”
7779: 
7780: “You would spill their beef tea while you were talking,” said Amy.
7781: 
7782: “Poor Mab! don’t be hard on her,” said the mother. “Give me the
7783: embroidery now, child. You go on with your enthusiasm, and I will go on
7784: with the pink and white poppy.”
7785: 
7786: “Well, ma, I think you are more caustic than Amy,” said Kate, while she
7787: drew her head back to look at her drawing.
7788: 
7789: “Oh—oh—oh!” cried Mab again, rising and stretching her arms. “I wish
7790: something wonderful would happen. I feel like the deluge. The waters of
7791: the great deep are broken up, and the windows of heaven are opened. I
7792: must sit down and play the scales.”
7793: 
7794: Mab was opening the piano while the others were laughing at this
7795: climax, when a cab stopped before the house, and there forthwith came a
7796: quick rap of the knocker.
7797: 
7798: “Dear me!” said Mrs. Meyrick, starting up, “it is after ten, and Phœbe
7799: is gone to bed.” She hastened out, leaving the parlor door open.
7800: 
7801: “Mr. Deronda!” The girls could hear this exclamation from their mamma.
7802: Mab clasped her hands, saying in a loud whisper, “There now! something
7803: _is_ going to happen.” Kate and Amy gave up their work in amazement.
7804: But Deronda’s tone in reply was so low that they could not hear his
7805: words, and Mrs. Meyrick immediately closed the parlor door.
7806: 
7807: “I know I am trusting to your goodness in a most extraordinary way,”
7808: Deronda went on, after giving his brief narrative; “but you can imagine
7809: how helpless I feel with a young creature like this on my hands. I
7810: could not go with her among strangers, and in her nervous state I
7811: should dread taking her into a house full of servants. I have trusted
7812: to your mercy. I hope you will not think my act unwarrantable.”
7813: 
7814: “On the contrary. You have honored me by trusting me. I see your
7815: difficulty. Pray bring her in. I will go and prepare the girls.”
7816: 
7817: While Deronda went back to the cab, Mrs. Meyrick turned into the parlor
7818: again and said: “Here is somebody to take care of instead of your
7819: wounded conscripts, Mab: a poor girl who was going to drown herself in
7820: despair. Mr. Deronda found her only just in time to save her. He
7821: brought her along in his boat, and did not know what else it would be
7822: safe to do with her, so he has trusted us and brought her here. It
7823: seems she is a Jewess, but quite refined, he says—knowing Italian and
7824: music.”
7825: 
7826: The three girls, wondering and expectant, came forward and stood near
7827: each other in mute confidence that they were all feeling alike under
7828: this appeal to their compassion. Mab looked rather awe-stricken, as if
7829: this answer to her wish were something preternatural.
7830: 
7831: Meanwhile Deronda going to the door of the cab where the pale face was
7832: now gazing out with roused observation, said, “I have brought you to
7833: some of the kindest people in the world: there are daughters like you.
7834: It is a happy home. Will you let me take you to them?”
7835: 
7836: She stepped out obediently, putting her hand in his and forgetting her
7837: hat; and when Deronda led her into the full light of the parlor where
7838: the four little women stood awaiting her, she made a picture that would
7839: have stirred much duller sensibilities than theirs. At first she was a
7840: little dazed by the sudden light, and before she had concentrated her
7841: glance he had put her hand into the mother’s. He was inwardly rejoicing
7842: that the Meyricks were so small: the dark-curled head was the highest
7843: among them. The poor wanderer could not be afraid of these gentle faces
7844: so near hers: and now she was looking at each of them in turn while the
7845: mother said, “You must be weary, poor child.”
7846: 
7847: “We will take care of you—we will comfort you—we will love you,”
7848: cried Mab, no longer able to restrain herself, and taking the small
7849: right hand caressingly between both her own. This gentle welcoming
7850: warmth was penetrating the bewildered one: she hung back just enough to
7851: see better the four faces in front of her, whose good will was being
7852: reflected in hers, not in any smile, but in that undefinable change
7853: which tells us that anxiety is passing in contentment. For an instant
7854: she looked up at Deronda, as if she were referring all this mercy to
7855: him, and then again turning to Mrs. Meyrick, said with more
7856: collectedness in her sweet tones than he had heard before,
7857: 
7858: “I am a stranger. I am a Jewess. You might have thought I was wicked.”
7859: 
7860: “No, we are sure you are good,” burst out Mab.
7861: 
7862: “We think no evil of you, poor child. You shall be safe with us,” said
7863: Mrs. Meyrick. “Come now and sit down. You must have some food, and then
7864: you must go to rest.”
7865: 
7866: The stranger looked up again at Deronda, who said,
7867: 
7868: “You will have no more fears with these friends? You will rest
7869: to-night?”
7870: 
7871: “Oh, I should not fear. I should rest. I think these are the
7872: ministering angels.”
7873: 
7874: Mrs. Meyrick wanted to lead her to seat, but again hanging back gently,
7875: the poor weary thing spoke as if with a scruple at being received
7876: without a further account of herself.
7877: 
7878: “My name is Mirah Lapidoth. I am come a long way, all the way from
7879: Prague by myself. I made my escape. I ran away from dreadful things. I
7880: came to find my mother and brother in London. I had been taken from my
7881: mother when I was little, but I thought I could find her again. I had
7882: trouble—the houses were all gone—I could not find her. It has been a
7883: long while, and I had not much money. That is why I am in distress.”
7884: 
7885: “Our mother will be good to you,” cried Mab. “See what a nice little
7886: mother she is!”
7887: 
7888: “Do sit down now,” said Kate, moving a chair forward, while Amy ran to
7889: get some tea.
7890: 
7891: Mirah resisted no longer, but seated herself with perfect grace,
7892: crossing her little feet, laying her hands one over the other on her
7893: lap, and looking at her friends with placid reverence; whereupon Hafiz,
7894: who had been watching the scene restlessly came forward with tail erect
7895: and rubbed himself against her ankles. Deronda felt it time to go.
7896: 
7897: “Will you allow me to come again and inquire—perhaps at five
7898: to-morrow?” he said to Mrs. Meyrick.
7899: 
7900: “Yes, pray; we shall have had time to make acquaintance then.”
7901: 
7902: “Good-bye,” said Deronda, looking down at Mirah, and putting out his
7903: hand. She rose as she took it, and the moment brought back to them both
7904: strongly the other moment when she had first taken that outstretched
7905: hand. She lifted her eyes to his and said with reverential fervor, “The
7906: God of our fathers bless you and deliver you from all evil as you have
7907: delivered me. I did not believe there was any man so good. None before
7908: have thought me worthy of the best. You found me poor and miserable,
7909: yet you have given me the best.”
7910: 
7911: Deronda could not speak, but with silent adieux to the Meyricks,
7912: hurried away.

7918: 
7919: 
7920: CHAPTER XIX.
7921: 
7922:     “I pity the man who can travel from Dan to Beersheba, and say, ‘’Tis
7923:     all barren’: and so it is: and so is all the world to him who will not
7924:     cultivate the fruits it offers.”—STERNE: _Sentimental Journey_.
7925: 
7926: 
7927: To say that Deronda was romantic would be to misrepresent him; but
7928: under his calm and somewhat self-repressed exterior there was a fervor
7929: which made him easily find poetry and romance among the events of
7930: everyday life. And perhaps poetry and romance are as plentiful as ever
7931: in the world except for those phlegmatic natures who I suspect would in
7932: any age have regarded them as a dull form of erroneous thinking. They
7933: exist very easily in the same room with the microscope and even in
7934: railway carriages: what banishes them in the vacuum in gentlemen and
7935: lady passengers. How should all the apparatus of heaven and earth, from
7936: the farthest firmament to the tender bosom of the mother who nourished
7937: us, make poetry for a mind that had no movements of awe and tenderness,
7938: no sense of fellowship which thrills from the near to the distant, and
7939: back again from the distant to the near?
7940: 
7941: To Deronda this event of finding Mirah was as heart-stirring as
7942: anything that befell Orestes or Rinaldo. He sat up half the night,
7943: living again through the moments since he had first discerned Mirah on
7944: the river-brink, with the fresh and fresh vividness which belongs to
7945: emotive memory. When he took up a book to try and dull this urgency of
7946: inward vision, the printed words were no more than a network through
7947: which he saw and heard everything as clearly as before—saw not only
7948: the actual events of two hours, but possibilities of what had been and
7949: what might be which those events were enough to feed with the warm
7950: blood of passionate hope and fear. Something in his own experience
7951: caused Mirah’s search after her mother to lay hold with peculiar force
7952: on his imagination. The first prompting of sympathy was to aid her in
7953: her search: if given persons were extant in London there were ways of
7954: finding them, as subtle as scientific experiment, the right machinery
7955: being set at work. But here the mixed feelings which belonged to
7956: Deronda’s kindred experience naturally transfused themselves into his
7957: anxiety on behalf of Mirah.
7958: 
7959: The desire to know his own mother, or to know about her, was constantly
7960: haunted with dread; and in imagining what might befall Mirah it quickly
7961: occurred to him that finding the mother and brother from whom she had
7962: been parted when she was a little one might turn out to be a calamity.
7963: When she was in the boat she said that her mother and brother were
7964: good; but the goodness might have been chiefly in her own ignorant
7965: innocence and yearning memory, and the ten or twelve years since the
7966: parting had been time enough for much worsening. Spite of his strong
7967: tendency to side with the objects of prejudice, and in general with
7968: those who got the worst of it, his interest had never been practically
7969: drawn toward existing Jews, and the facts he knew about them, whether
7970: they walked conspicuous in fine apparel or lurked in by-streets, were
7971: chiefly of a sort most repugnant to him. Of learned and accomplished
7972: Jews he took it for granted that they had dropped their religion, and
7973: wished to be merged in the people of their native lands. Scorn flung at
7974: a Jew as such would have roused all his sympathy in griefs of
7975: inheritance; but the indiscriminate scorn of a race will often strike a
7976: specimen who has well earned it on his own account, and might fairly be
7977: gibbeted as a rascally son of Adam. It appears that the Caribs, who
7978: know little of theology, regard thieving as a practice peculiarly
7979: connected with Christian tenets, and probably they could allege
7980: experimental grounds for this opinion. Deronda could not escape (who
7981: can?) knowing ugly stories of Jewish characteristics and occupations;
7982: and though one of his favorite protests was against the severance of
7983: past and present history, he was like others who shared his protest, in
7984: never having cared to reach any more special conclusions about actual
7985: Jews than that they retained the virtues and vices of a long-oppressed
7986: race. But now that Mirah’s longing roused his mind to a closer survey
7987: of details, very disagreeable images urged themselves of what it might
7988: be to find out this middle-aged Jewess and her son. To be sure, there
7989: was the exquisite refinement and charm of the creature herself to make
7990: a presumption in favor of her immediate kindred, but—he must wait to
7991: know more: perhaps through Mrs. Meyrick he might gather some guiding
7992: hints from Mirah’s own lips. Her voice, her accent, her looks—all the
7993: sweet purity that clothed her as with a consecrating garment made him
7994: shrink the more from giving her, either ideally or practically, an
7995: association with what was hateful or contaminating. But these fine
7996: words with which we fumigate and becloud unpleasant facts are not the
7997: language in which we think. Deronda’s thinking went on in rapid images
7998: of what might be: he saw himself guided by some official scout into a
7999: dingy street; he entered through a dim doorway, and saw a hawk-eyed
8000: woman, rough-headed, and unwashed, cheapening a hungry girl’s last bit
8001: of finery; or in some quarter only the more hideous for being smarter,
8002: he found himself under the breath of a young Jew talkative and
8003: familiar, willing to show his acquaintance with gentlemen’s tastes, and
8004: not fastidious in any transactions with which they would favor him—and
8005: so on through the brief chapter of his experience in this kind. Excuse
8006: him: his mind was not apt to run spontaneously into insulting ideas, or
8007: to practice a form of wit which identifies Moses with the advertisement
8008: sheet; but he was just now governed by dread, and if Mirah’s parents
8009: had been Christian, the chief difference would have been that his
8010: forebodings would have been fed with wider knowledge. It was the habit
8011: of his mind to connect dread with unknown parentage, and in this case
8012: as well as his own there was enough to make the connection reasonable.
8013: 
8014: But what was to be done with Mirah? She needed shelter and protection
8015: in the fullest sense, and all his chivalrous sentiment roused itself to
8016: insist that the sooner and the more fully he could engage for her the
8017: interest of others besides himself, the better he should fulfill her
8018: claims on him. He had no right to provide for her entirely, though he
8019: might be able to do so; the very depth of the impression she had
8020: produced made him desire that she should understand herself to be
8021: entirely independent of him; and vague visions of the future which he
8022: tried to dispel as fantastic left their influence in an anxiety
8023: stronger than any motive he could give for it, that those who saw his
8024: actions closely should be acquainted from the first with the history of
8025: his relation to Mirah. He had learned to hate secrecy about the grand
8026: ties and obligations of his life—to hate it the more because a strong
8027: spell of interwoven sensibilities hindered him from breaking such
8028: secrecy. Deronda had made a vow to himself that—since the truths which
8029: disgrace mortals are not all of their own making—the truth should
8030: never be made a disgrace to another by his act. He was not without
8031: terror lest he should break this vow, and fall into the apologetic
8032: philosophy which explains the world into containing nothing better than
8033: one’s own conduct.
8034: 
8035: At one moment he resolved to tell the whole of his adventure to Sir
8036: Hugo and Lady Mallinger the next morning at breakfast, but the
8037: possibility that something quite new might reveal itself on his next
8038: visit to Mrs. Meyrick’s checked this impulse, and he finally went to
8039: sleep on the conclusion that he would wait until that visit had been
8040: made.
8041: 
8042: 
8043: 
8044: 
8045: CHAPTER XX.
8046: 
8047:     “It will hardly be denied that even in this frail and corrupted world,
8048:     we sometimes meet persons who, in their very mien and aspect, as well
8049:     as in the whole habit of life, manifest such a signature and stamp of
8050:     virtue, as to make our judgment of them a matter of intuition rather
8051:     than the result of continued  examination.”—ALEXANDER KNOX: quoted in
8052:     Southey’s Life of Wesley.
8053: 
8054: 
8055: Mirah said that she had slept well that night; and when she came down
8056: in Mab’s black dress, her dark hair curling in fresh fibrils as it
8057: gradually dried from its plenteous bath, she looked like one who was
8058: beginning to take comfort after the long sorrow and watching which had
8059: paled her cheek and made blue semicircles under her eyes. It was Mab
8060: who carried her breakfast and ushered her down—with some pride in the
8061: effect produced by a pair of tiny felt slippers which she had rushed
8062: out to buy because there were no shoes in the house small enough for
8063: Mirah, whose borrowed dress ceased about her ankles and displayed the
8064: cheap clothing that, moulding itself on her feet, seemed an adornment
8065: as choice as the sheaths of buds. The farthing buckles were bijoux.
8066: 
8067: “Oh, if you please, mamma?” cried Mab, clasping her hands and stooping
8068: toward Mirah’s feet, as she entered the parlor; “look at the slippers,
8069: how beautiful they fit! I declare she is like the Queen Budoor—‘two
8070: delicate feet, the work of the protecting and all-recompensing Creator,
8071: support her; and I wonder how they can sustain what is above them.’”
8072: 
8073: Mirah looked down at her own feet in a childlike way and then smiled at
8074: Mrs. Meyrick, who was saying inwardly, “One could hardly imagine this
8075: creature having an evil thought. But wise people would tell me to be
8076: cautious.” She returned Mirah’s smile and said, “I fear the feet have
8077: had to sustain their burden a little too often lately. But to-day she
8078: will rest and be my companion.”
8079: 
8080: “And she will tell you so many things and I shall not hear them,”
8081: grumbled Mab, who felt herself in the first volume of a delightful
8082: romance and obliged to miss some chapters because she had to go to
8083: pupils.
8084: 
8085: Kate was already gone to make sketches along the river, and Amy was
8086: away on business errands. It was what the mother wished, to be alone
8087: with this stranger, whose story must be a sorrowful one, yet was
8088: needful to be told.
8089: 
8090: The small front parlor was as good as a temple that morning. The
8091: sunlight was on the river and soft air came in through the open window;
8092: the walls showed a glorious silent cloud of witnesses—the Virgin
8093: soaring amid her cherubic escort; grand Melancholia with her solemn
8094: universe; the Prophets and Sibyls; the School of Athens; the Last
8095: Supper; mystic groups where far-off ages made one moment; grave Holbein
8096: and Rembrandt heads; the Tragic Muse; last-century children at their
8097: musings or their play; Italian poets—all were there through the medium
8098: of a little black and white. The neat mother who had weathered her
8099: troubles, and come out of them with a face still cheerful, was sorting
8100: colored wools for her embroidery. Hafiz purred on the window-ledge, the
8101: clock on the mantle-piece ticked without hurry, and the occasional
8102: sound of wheels seemed to lie outside the more massive central quiet.
8103: Mrs. Meyrick thought that this quiet might be the best invitation to
8104: speech on the part of her companion, and chose not to disturb it by
8105: remark. Mirah sat opposite in her former attitude, her hands clasped on
8106: her lap, her ankles crossed, her eyes at first traveling slowly over
8107: the objects around her, but finally resting with a sort of placid
8108: reverence on Mrs. Meyrick. At length she began to speak softly.
8109: 
8110: “I remember my mother’s face better than anything; yet I was not seven
8111: when I was taken away, and I am nineteen now.”
8112: 
8113: “I can understand that,” said Mrs. Meyrick. “There are some earliest
8114: things that last the longest.”
8115: 
8116: “Oh, yes, it was the earliest. I think my life began with waking up and
8117: loving my mother’s face: it was so near to me, and her arms were round
8118: me, and she sang to me. One hymn she sang so often, so often: and then
8119: she taught me to sing it with her: it was the first I ever sang. They
8120: were always Hebrew hymns she sang; and because I never knew the meaning
8121: of the words they seemed full of nothing but our love and happiness.
8122: When I lay in my little bed and it was all white above me, she used to
8123: bend over me, between me and the white, and sing in a sweet, low voice.
8124: I can dream myself back into that time when I am awake, and it often
8125: comes back to me in my sleep—my hand is very little, I put it up to
8126: her face and she kisses it. Sometimes in my dreams I begin to tremble
8127: and think that we are both dead; but then I wake up and my hand lies
8128: like this, and for a moment I hardly know myself. But if I could see my
8129: mother again I should know her.”
8130: 
8131: “You must expect some change after twelve years,” said Mrs. Meyrick,
8132: gently. “See my grey hair: ten years ago it was bright brown. The days
8133: and months pace over us like restless little birds, and leave the marks
8134: of their feet backward and forward; especially when they are like birds
8135: with heavy hearts—then they tread heavily.”
8136: 
8137: “Ah, I am sure her heart has been heavy for want of me. But to feel her
8138: joy if we could meet again, and I could make her know I love her and
8139: give her deep comfort after all her mourning! If that could be, I
8140: should mind nothing; I should be glad that I have lived through my
8141: trouble. I did despair. The world seemed miserable and wicked; none
8142: helped me so that I could bear their looks and words; I felt that my
8143: mother was dead, and death was the only way to her. But then in the
8144: last moment—yesterday, when I longed for the water to close over
8145: me—and I thought that death was the best image of mercy—then goodness
8146: came to me living, and I felt trust in the living. And—it is
8147: strange—but I began to hope that she was living too. And now I with
8148: you—here—this morning, peace and hope have come into me like a flood.
8149: I want nothing; I can wait; because I hope and believe and am
8150: grateful—oh, so grateful! You have not thought evil of me—you have
8151: not despised me.”
8152: 
8153: Mirah spoke with low-toned fervor, and sat as still as a picture all
8154: the while.
8155: 
8156: “Many others would have felt as we do, my dear,” said Mrs. Meyrick,
8157: feeling a mist come over her eyes as she looked at her work.
8158: 
8159: “But I did not meet them—they did not come to me.”
8160: 
8161: “How was it that you were taken from your mother?”
8162: 
8163: “Ah, I am a long while coming to that. It is dreadful to speak of, yet
8164: I must tell you—I must tell you everything. My father—it was he that
8165: took me away. I thought we were only going on a little journey; and I
8166: was pleased. There was a box with all my little things in. But we went
8167: on board a ship, and got farther and farther away from the land. Then I
8168: was ill; and I thought it would never end—it was the first misery, and
8169: it seemed endless. But at last we landed. I knew nothing then, and
8170: believed what my father said. He comforted me, and told me I should go
8171: back to my mother. But it was America we had reached, and it was long
8172: years before we came back to Europe. At first I often asked my father
8173: when we were going back; and I tried to learn writing fast, because I
8174: wanted to write to my mother; but one day when he found me trying to
8175: write a letter, he took me on his knee and told me that my mother and
8176: brother were dead; that was why we did not go back. I remember my
8177: brother a little; he carried me once; but he was not always at home. I
8178: believed my father when he said that they were dead. I saw them under
8179: the earth when he said they were there, with their eyes forever closed.
8180: I never thought of its not being true; and I used to cry every night in
8181: my bed for a long while. Then when she came so often to me, in my
8182: sleep, I thought she must be living about me though I could not always
8183: see her, and that comforted me. I was never afraid in the dark, because
8184: of that; and very often in the day I used to shut my eyes and bury my
8185: face and try to see her and to hear her singing. I came to do that at
8186: last without shutting my eyes.”
8187: 
8188: Mirah paused with a sweet content in her face, as if she were having
8189: her happy vision, while she looked out toward the river.
8190: 
8191: “Still your father was not unkind to you, I hope,” said Mrs. Meyrick,
8192: after a minute, anxious to recall her.
8193: 
8194: “No; he petted me, and took pains to teach me. He was an actor; and I
8195: found out, after, that the ‘Coburg’ I used to hear of his going to at
8196: home was a theatre. But he had more to do with the theatre than acting.
8197: He had not always been an actor; he had been a teacher, and knew many
8198: languages. His acting was not very good; I think, but he managed the
8199: stage, and wrote and translated plays. An Italian lady, a singer, lived
8200: with us a long time. They both taught me, and I had a master besides,
8201: who made me learn by heart and recite. I worked quite hard, though I
8202: was so little; and I was not nine when I first went on the stage. I
8203: could easily learn things, and I was not afraid. But then and ever
8204: since I hated our way of life. My father had money, and we had finery
8205: about us in a disorderly way; always there were men and women coming
8206: and going; there was loud laughing and disputing, strutting, snapping
8207: of fingers, jeering, faces I did not like to look at—though many
8208: petted and caressed me. But then I remembered my mother. Even at first
8209: when I understood nothing, I shrank away from all those things outside
8210: me into companionship with thoughts that were not like them; and I
8211: gathered thoughts very fast, because I read many things—plays and
8212: poetry, Shakespeare and Schiller, and learned evil and good. My father
8213: began to believe that I might be a great singer: my voice was
8214: considered wonderful for a child; and he had the best teaching for me.
8215: But it was painful that he boasted of me, and set me to sing for show
8216: at any minute, as if I had been a musical box. Once when I was nine
8217: years old, I played the part of a little girl who had been forsaken and
8218: did not know it, and sat singing to herself while she played with
8219: flowers. I did it without any trouble; but the clapping and all the
8220: sounds of the theatre were hateful to me; and I never liked the praise
8221: I had, because it all seemed very hard and unloving: I missed the love
8222: and trust I had been born into. I made a life in my own thoughts quite
8223: different from everything about me: I chose what seemed to me beautiful
8224: out of the plays and everything, and made my world out of it; and it
8225: was like a sharp knife always grazing me that we had two sorts of life
8226: which jarred so with each other—women looking good and gentle on the
8227: stage, and saying good things as if they felt them, and directly after
8228: I saw them with coarse, ugly manners. My father sometimes noticed my
8229: shrinking ways; and Signora said one day, when I had been rehearsing,
8230: ‘She will never be an artist: she has no notion of being anybody but
8231: herself. That does very well now, but by-and-by you will see—she will
8232: have no more face and action than a singing-bird.’ My father was angry,
8233: and they quarreled. I sat alone and cried, because what she had said
8234: was like a long unhappy future unrolled before me. I did not want to be
8235: an artist; but this was what my father expected of me. After a while
8236: Signora left us, and a governess used to come and give me lessons in
8237: different things, because my father began to be afraid of my singing
8238: too much; but I still acted from time to time. Rebellious feelings grew
8239: stronger in me, and I wished to get away from this life; but I could
8240: not tell where to go, and I dreaded the world. Besides, I felt it would
8241: be wrong to leave my father: I dreaded doing wrong, for I thought I
8242: might get wicked and hateful to myself, in the same way that many
8243: others seemed hateful to me. For so long, so long I had never felt my
8244: outside world happy; and if I got wicked I should lose my world of
8245: happy thoughts where my mother lived with me. That was my childish
8246: notion all through those years. Oh how long they were!”
8247: 
8248: Mirah fell to musing again.
8249: 
8250: “Had you no teaching about what was your duty?” said Mrs. Meyrick. She
8251: did not like to say “religion”—finding herself on inspection rather
8252: dim as to what the Hebrew religion might have turned into at this date.
8253: 
8254: “No—only that I ought to do what my father wished. He did not follow
8255: our religion at New York, and I think he wanted me not to know much
8256: about it. But because my mother used to take me to the synagogue, and I
8257: remembered sitting on her knee and looking through the railing and
8258: hearing the chanting and singing, I longed to go. One day when I was
8259: quite small I slipped out and tried to find the synagogue, but I lost
8260: myself a long while till a peddler questioned me and took me home. My
8261: father, missing me, had been much in fear, and was very angry. I too
8262: had been so frightened at losing myself that it was long before I
8263: thought of venturing out again. But after Signora left us we went to
8264: rooms where our landlady was a Jewess and observed her religion. I
8265: asked her to take me with her to the synagogue; and I read in her
8266: prayer-books and Bible, and when I had money enough I asked her to buy
8267: me books of my own, for these books seemed a closer companionship with
8268: my mother: I knew that she must have looked at the very words and said
8269: them. In that way I have come to know a little of our religion, and the
8270: history of our people, besides piecing together what I read in plays
8271: and other books about Jews and Jewesses; because I was sure my mother
8272: obeyed her religion. I had left off asking my father about her. It is
8273: very dreadful to say it, but I began to disbelieve him. I had found
8274: that he did not always tell the truth, and made promises without
8275: meaning to keep them; and that raised my suspicion that my mother and
8276: brother were still alive though he had told me they were dead. For in
8277: going over the past again as I got older and knew more, I felt sure
8278: that my mother had been deceived, and had expected to see us back again
8279: after a very little while; and my father taking me on his knee and
8280: telling me that my mother and brother were both dead seemed to me now
8281: but a bit of acting, to set my mind at rest. The cruelty of that
8282: falsehood sank into me, and I hated all untruth because of it. I wrote
8283: to my mother secretly: I knew the street, Colman Street, where we
8284: lived, and that it was not Blackfriars Bridge and the Coburg, and that
8285: our name was Cohen then, though my father called us Lapidoth, because,
8286: he said, it was a name of his forefathers in Poland. I sent my letter
8287: secretly; but no answer came, and I thought there was no hope for me.
8288: Our life in America did not last much longer. My father suddenly told
8289: me we were to pack up and go to Hamburg, and I was rather glad. I hoped
8290: we might get among a different sort of people, and I knew German quite
8291: well—some German plays almost all by heart. My father spoke it better
8292: than he spoke English. I was thirteen then, and I seemed to myself
8293: quite old—I knew so much, and yet so little. I think other children
8294: cannot feel as I did. I had often wished that I had been drowned when I
8295: was going away from my mother. But I set myself to obey and suffer:
8296: what else could I do? One day when we were on our voyage, a new thought
8297: came into my mind. I was not very ill that time, and I kept on deck a
8298: good deal. My father acted and sang and joked to amuse people on board,
8299: and I used often to hear remarks about him. One day, when I was looking
8300: at the sea and nobody took notice of me, I overheard a gentleman say,
8301: ‘Oh, he is one of those clever Jews—a rascal, I shouldn’t wonder.
8302: There’s no race like them for cunning in the men and beauty in the
8303: women. I wonder what market he means that daughter for.’ When I heard
8304: this it darted into my mind that the unhappiness in my life came from
8305: my being a Jewess, and that always to the end the world would think
8306: slightly of me and that I must bear it, for I should be judged by that
8307: name; and it comforted me to believe that my suffering was part of the
8308: affliction of my people, my part in the long song of mourning that has
8309: been going on through ages and ages. For if many of our race were
8310: wicked and made merry in their wickedness—what was that but part of
8311: the affliction borne by the just among them, who were despised for the
8312: sins of their brethren?—But you have not rejected me.”
8313: 
8314: Mirah had changed her tone in this last sentence, having suddenly
8315: reflected that at this moment she had reason not for complaint but for
8316: gratitude.
8317: 
8318: “And we will try to save you from being judged unjustly by others, my
8319: poor child,” said Mrs. Meyrick, who had now given up all attempt at
8320: going on with her work, and sat listening with folded hands and a face
8321: hardly less eager than Mab’s would have been. “Go on, go on: tell me
8322: all.”
8323: 
8324: “After that we lived in different towns—Hamburg and Vienna, the
8325: longest. I began to study singing again: and my father always got money
8326: about the theatres. I think he brought a good deal of money from
8327: America, I never knew why we left. For some time he was in great
8328: spirits about my singing, and he made me rehearse parts and act
8329: continually. He looked forward to my coming out in the opera. But
8330: by-and-by it seemed that my voice would never be strong enough—it did
8331: not fulfill its promise. My master at Vienna said, ‘Don’t strain it
8332: further: it will never do for the public:—it is gold, but a thread of
8333: gold dust.’ My father was bitterly disappointed: we were not so well
8334: off at that time. I think I have not quite told you what I felt about
8335: my father. I knew he was fond of me and meant to indulge me, and that
8336: made me afraid of hurting him; but he always mistook what would please
8337: me and give me happiness. It was his nature to take everything lightly;
8338: and I soon left off asking him any questions about things that I cared
8339: for much, because he always turned them off with a joke. He would even
8340: ridicule our own people; and once when he had been imitating their
8341: movements and their tones in praying, only to make others laugh, I
8342: could not restrain myself—for I always had an anger in my heart about
8343: my mother—and when we were alone, I said, ‘Father, you ought not to
8344: mimic our own people before Christians who mock them: would it not be
8345: bad if I mimicked you, that they might mock you?’ But he only shrugged
8346: his shoulders and laughed and pinched my chin, and said, ‘You couldn’t
8347: do it, my dear.’ It was this way of turning off everything, that made a
8348: great wall between me and my father, and whatever I felt most I took
8349: the most care to hide from him. For there were some things—when they
8350: were laughed at I could not bear it: the world seemed like a hell to
8351: me. Is this world and all the life upon it only like a farce or a
8352: vaudeville, where you find no great meanings? Why then are there
8353: tragedies and grand operas, where men do difficult things and choose to
8354: suffer? I think it is silly to speak of all things as a joke. And I saw
8355: that his wishing me to sing the greatest music, and parts in grand
8356: operas, was only wishing for what would fetch the greatest price. That
8357: hemmed in my gratitude for his affectionateness, and the tenderest
8358: feeling I had toward him was pity. Yes, I did sometimes pity him. He
8359: had aged and changed. Now he was no longer so lively. I thought he
8360: seemed worse—less good to others than to me. Every now and then in the
8361: latter years his gaiety went away suddenly, and he would sit at home
8362: silent and gloomy; or he would come in and fling himself down and sob,
8363: just as I have done myself when I have been in trouble. If I put my
8364: hand on his knee and say, ‘What is the matter, father?’ he would make
8365: no answer, but would draw my arm round his neck and put his arm round
8366: me and go on crying. There never came any confidence between us; but
8367: oh, I was sorry for him. At those moments I knew he must feel his life
8368: bitter, and I pressed my cheek against his head and prayed. Those
8369: moments were what most bound me to him; and I used to think how much my
8370: mother once loved him, else she would not have married him.
8371: 
8372: “But soon there came the dreadful time. We had been at Pesth and we
8373: came back to Vienna. In spite of what my master Leo had said, my father
8374: got me an engagement, not at the opera, but to take singing parts at a
8375: suburb theatre in Vienna. He had nothing to do with the theatre then; I
8376: did not understand what he did, but I think he was continually at a
8377: gambling house, though he was careful always about taking me to the
8378: theatre. I was very miserable. The plays I acted in were detestable to
8379: me. Men came about us and wanted to talk to me: women and men seemed to
8380: look at me with a sneering smile; it was no better than a fiery
8381: furnace. Perhaps I make it worse than it was—you don’t know that life:
8382: but the glare and the faces, and my having to go on and act and sing
8383: what I hated, and then see people who came to stare at me behind the
8384: scenes—it was all so much worse than when I was a little girl. I went
8385: through with it; I did it; I had set my mind to obey my father and
8386: work, for I saw nothing better that I could do. But I felt that my
8387: voice was getting weaker, and I knew that my acting was not good except
8388: when it was not really acting, but the part was one that I could be
8389: myself in, and some feeling within me carried me along. That was seldom.
8390: 
8391: “Then, in the midst of all this, the news came to me one morning that
8392: my father had been taken to prison, and he had sent for me. He did not
8393: tell me the reason why he was there, but he ordered me to go to an
8394: address he gave me, to see a Count who would be able to get him
8395: released. The address was to some public rooms where I was to ask for
8396: the Count, and beg him to come to my father. I found him, and
8397: recognized him as a gentleman whom I had seen the other night for the
8398: first time behind the scenes. That agitated me, for I remembered his
8399: way of looking at me and kissing my hand—I thought it was in mockery.
8400: But I delivered my errand, and he promised to go immediately to my
8401: father, who came home again that very evening, bringing the Count with
8402: him. I now began to feel a horrible dread of this man, for he worried
8403: me with his attentions, his eyes were always on me: I felt sure that
8404: whatever else there might be in his mind toward me, below it all there
8405: was scorn for the Jewess and the actress. And when he came to me the
8406: next day in the theatre and would put my shawl around me, a terror took
8407: hold of me; I saw that my father wanted me to look pleased. The Count
8408: was neither very young nor very old; his hair and eyes were pale; he
8409: was tall and walked heavily, and his face was heavy and grave except
8410: when he looked at me. He smiled at me, and his smile went through me
8411: with horror: I could not tell why he was so much worse to me than other
8412: men. Some feelings are like our hearing: they come as sounds do, before
8413: we know their reason. My father talked to me about him when we were
8414: alone, and praised him—said what a good friend he had been. I said
8415: nothing, because I supposed he had got my father out of prison. When
8416: the Count came again, my father left the room. He asked me if I liked
8417: being on the stage. I said No, I only acted in obedience to my father.
8418: He always spoke French, and called me _petite ange_ and such things,
8419: which I felt insulting. I knew he meant to make love to me, and I had
8420: it firmly in my mind that a nobleman and one who was not a Jew could
8421: have no love for me that was not half contempt. But then he told me
8422: that I need not act any longer; he wished me to visit him at his
8423: beautiful place, where I might be queen of everything. It was difficult
8424: to me to speak, I felt so shaken with anger: I could only say, ‘I would
8425: rather stay on the stage forever,’ and I left him there. Hurrying out
8426: of the room I saw my father sauntering in the passage. My heart was
8427: crushed. I went past him and locked myself up. It had sunk into me that
8428: my father was in a conspiracy with that man against me. But the next
8429: day he persuaded me to come out: he said that I had mistaken
8430: everything, and he would explain: if I did not come out and act and
8431: fulfill my engagement, we should be ruined and he must starve. So I
8432: went on acting, and for a week or more the Count never came near me. My
8433: father changed our lodgings, and kept at home except when he went to
8434: the theatre with me. He began one day to speak discouragingly of my
8435: acting, and say, I could never go on singing in public—I should lose
8436: my voice—I ought to think of my future, and not put my nonsensical
8437: feelings between me and my fortune. He said, ‘What will you do? You
8438: will be brought down to sing and beg at people’s doors. You have had a
8439: splendid offer and ought to accept it.’ I could not speak: a horror
8440: took possession of me when I thought of my mother and of him. I felt
8441: for the first time that I should not do wrong to leave him. But the
8442: next day he told me that he had put an end to my engagement at the
8443: theatre, and that we were to go to Prague. I was getting suspicious of
8444: everything, and my will was hardening to act against him. It took us
8445: two days to pack and get ready; and I had it in my mind that I might be
8446: obliged to run away from my father, and then I would come to London and
8447: try if it were possible to find my mother. I had a little money, and I
8448: sold some things to get more. I packed a few clothes in a little bag
8449: that I could carry with me, and I kept my mind on the watch. My
8450: father’s silence—his letting drop that subject of the Count’s
8451: offer—made me feel sure that there was a plan against me. I felt as if
8452: it had been a plan to take me to a madhouse. I once saw a picture of a
8453: madhouse, that I could never forget; it seemed to me very much like
8454: some of the life I had seen—the people strutting, quarreling,
8455: leering—the faces with cunning and malice in them. It was my will to
8456: keep myself from wickedness; and I prayed for help. I had seen what
8457: despised women were: and my heart turned against my father, for I saw
8458: always behind him that man who made me shudder. You will think I had
8459: not enough reason for my suspicions, and perhaps I had not, outside my
8460: own feeling; but it seemed to me that my mind had been lit up, and all
8461: that might be stood out clear and sharp. If I slept, it was only to see
8462: the same sort of things, and I could hardly sleep at all. Through our
8463: journey I was everywhere on the watch. I don’t know why, but it came
8464: before me like a real event, that my father would suddenly leave me and
8465: I should find myself with the Count where I could not get away from
8466: him. I thought God was warning me: my mother’s voice was in my soul. It
8467: was dark when we reached Prague, and though the strange bunches of
8468: lamps were lit it was difficult to distinguish faces as we drove along
8469: the street. My father chose to sit outside—he was always smoking
8470: now—and I watched everything in spite of the darkness. I do believe I
8471: could see better then than I ever did before: the strange clearness
8472: within seemed to have got outside me. It was not my habit to notice
8473: faces and figures much in the street; but this night I saw every one;
8474: and when we passed before a great hotel I caught sight only of a back
8475: that was passing in—the light of the great bunch of lamps a good way
8476: off fell on it. I knew it—before the face was turned, as it fell into
8477: shadow, I knew who it was. Help came to me. I feel sure help came. I
8478: did not sleep that night. I put on my plainest things—the cloak and
8479: hat I have worn ever since; and I sat watching for the light and the
8480: sound of the doors being unbarred. Some one rose early—at four
8481: o’clock, to go to the railway. That gave me courage. I slipped out,
8482: with my little bag under my cloak, and none noticed me. I had been a
8483: long while attending to the railway guide that I might learn the way to
8484: England; and before the sun had risen I was in the train for Dresden.
8485: Then I cried for joy. I did not know whether my money would last out,
8486: but I trusted. I could sell the things in my bag, and the little rings
8487: in my ears, and I could live on bread only. My only terror was lest my
8488: father should follow me. But I never paused. I came on, and on, and on,
8489: only eating bread now and then. When I got to Brussels I saw that I
8490: should not have enough money, and I sold all that I could sell; but
8491: here a strange thing happened. Putting my hand into the pocket of my
8492: cloak, I found a half-napoleon. Wondering and wondering how it came
8493: there, I remembered that on the way from Cologne there was a young
8494: workman sitting against me. I was frightened at every one, and did not
8495: like to be spoken to. At first he tried to talk, but when he saw that I
8496: did not like it, he left off. It was a long journey; I ate nothing but
8497: a bit of bread, and he once offered me some of the food he brought in,
8498: but I refused it. I do believe it was he who put that bit of gold in my
8499: pocket. Without it I could hardly have got to Dover, and I did walk a
8500: good deal of the way from Dover to London. I knew I should look like a
8501: miserable beggar-girl. I wanted not to look very miserable, because if
8502: I found my mother it would grieve her to see me so. But oh, how vain my
8503: hope was that she would be there to see me come! As soon as I set foot
8504: in London, I began to ask for Lambeth and Blackfriars Bridge, but they
8505: were a long way off, and I went wrong. At last I got to Blackfriars
8506: Bridge and asked for Colman Street. People shook their heads. None knew
8507: it. I saw it in my mind—our doorsteps, and the white tiles hung in the
8508: windows, and the large brick building opposite with wide doors. But
8509: there was nothing like it. At last when I asked a tradesman where the
8510: Coburg Theatre and Colman Street were, he said, ‘Oh, my little woman,
8511: that’s all done away with. The old streets have been pulled down;
8512: everything is new.’ I turned away and felt as if death had laid a hand
8513: on me. He said: ‘Stop, stop! young woman; what is it you’re wanting
8514: with Colman Street, eh?’ meaning well, perhaps. But his tone was what I
8515: could not bear; and how could I tell him what I wanted? I felt blinded
8516: and bewildered with a sudden shock. I suddenly felt that I was very
8517: weak and weary, and yet where could I go? for I looked so poor and
8518: dusty, and had nothing with me—I looked like a street-beggar. And I
8519: was afraid of all places where I could enter. I lost my trust. I
8520: thought I was forsaken. It seemed that I had been in a fever of
8521: hope—delirious—all the way from Prague: I thought that I was helped,
8522: and I did nothing but strain my mind forward and think of finding my
8523: mother; and now—there I stood in a strange world. All who saw me would
8524: think ill of me, and I must herd with beggars. I stood on the bridge
8525: and looked along the river. People were going on to a steamboat. Many
8526: of them seemed poor, and I felt as if it would be a refuge to get away
8527: from the streets; perhaps the boat would take me where I could soon get
8528: into a solitude. I had still some pence left, and I bought a loaf when
8529: I went on the boat. I wanted to have a little time and strength to
8530: think of life and death. How could I live? And now again it seemed that
8531: if ever I were to find my mother again, death was the way to her. I
8532: ate, that I might have strength to think. The boat set me down at a
8533: place along the river—I don’t know where—and it was late in the
8534: evening. I found some large trees apart from the road, and I sat down
8535: under them that I might rest through the night. Sleep must have soon
8536: come to me, and when I awoke it was morning. The birds were singing,
8537: and the dew was white about me, I felt chill and oh, so lonely! I got
8538: up and walked and followed the river a long way and then turned back
8539: again. There was no reason why I should go anywhere. The world about me
8540: seemed like a vision that was hurrying by while I stood still with my
8541: pain. My thoughts were stronger than I was; they rushed in and forced
8542: me to see all my life from the beginning; ever since I was carried away
8543: from my mother I had felt myself a lost child taken up and used by
8544: strangers, who did not care what my life was to me, but only what I
8545: could do for them. It seemed all a weary wandering and
8546: heart-loneliness—as if I had been forced to go to merrymakings without
8547: the expectation of joy. And now it was worse. I was lost again, and I
8548: dreaded lest any stranger should notice me and speak to me. I had a
8549: terror of the world. None knew me; all would mistake me. I had seen so
8550: many in my life who made themselves glad with scorning, and laughed at
8551: another’s shame. What could I do? This life seemed to be closing in
8552: upon me with a wall of fire—everywhere there was scorching that made
8553: me shrink. The high sunlight made me shrink. And I began to think that
8554: my despair was the voice of God telling me to die. But it would take me
8555: long to die of hunger. Then I thought of my people, how they had been
8556: driven from land to land and been afflicted, and multitudes had died of
8557: misery in their wandering—was I the first? And in the wars and
8558: troubles when Christians were cruelest, our fathers had sometimes slain
8559: their children and afterward themselves: it was to save them from being
8560: false apostates. That seemed to make it right for me to put an end to
8561: my life; for calamity had closed me in too, and I saw no pathway but to
8562: evil. But my mind got into war with itself, for there were contrary
8563: things in it. I knew that some had held it wrong to hasten their own
8564: death, though they were in the midst of flames; and while I had some
8565: strength left it was a longing to bear if I ought to bear—else where
8566: was the good of all my life? It had not been happy since the first
8567: years: when the light came every morning I used to think, ‘I will bear
8568: it.’ But always before I had some hope; now it was gone. With these
8569: thoughts I wandered and wandered, inwardly crying to the Most High,
8570: from whom I should not flee in death more than in life—though I had no
8571: strong faith that He cared for me. The strength seemed departing from
8572: my soul; deep below all my cries was the feeling that I was alone and
8573: forsaken. The more I thought the wearier I got, till it seemed I was
8574: not thinking at all, but only the sky and the river and the Eternal God
8575: were in my soul. And what was it whether I died or lived? If I lay down
8576: to die in the river, was it more than lying down to sleep?—for there
8577: too I committed my soul—I gave myself up. I could not bear memories
8578: any more; I could only feel what was present in me—it was all one
8579: longing to cease from my weary life, which seemed only a pain outside
8580: the great peace that I might enter into. That was how it was. When the
8581: evening came and the sun was gone, it seemed as if that was all I had
8582: to wait for. And a new strength came into me to will what I would do.
8583: You know what I did. I was going to die. You know what happened—did he
8584: not tell you? Faith came to me again; I was not forsaken. He told you
8585: how he found me?”
8586: 
8587: Mrs. Meyrick gave no audible answer, but pressed her lips against
8588: Mirah’s forehead.
8589: 
8590:        *       *       *       *       *
8591: 
8592: “She’s just a pearl; the mud has only washed her,” was the fervid
8593: little woman’s closing commentary when, _tête-à-tête_ with Deronda in
8594: the back parlor that evening, she had conveyed Mirah’s story to him
8595: with much vividness.
8596: 
8597: “What is your feeling about a search for this mother?” said Deronda.
8598: “Have you no fears? I have, I confess.”
8599: 
8600: “Oh, I believe the mother’s good,” said Mrs. Meyrick, with rapid
8601: decisiveness; “or _was_ good. She may be dead—that’s my fear. A good
8602: woman, you may depend: you may know it by the scoundrel the father is.
8603: Where did the child get her goodness from? Wheaten flour has to be
8604: accounted for.”
8605: 
8606: Deronda was rather disappointed at this answer; he had wanted a
8607: confirmation of his own judgment, and he began to put in demurrers. The
8608: argument about the mother would not apply to the brother; and Mrs.
8609: Meyrick admitted that the brother might be an ugly likeness of the
8610: father. Then, as to advertising, if the name was Cohen, you might as
8611: well advertise for two undescribed terriers; and here Mrs. Meyrick
8612: helped him, for the idea of an advertisement, already mentioned to
8613: Mirah, had roused the poor child’s terror; she was convinced that her
8614: father would see it—he saw everything in the papers. Certainly there
8615: were safer means than advertising; men might be set to work whose
8616: business it was to find missing persons; but Deronda wished Mrs.
8617: Meyrick to feel with him that it would be wiser to wait, before seeking
8618: a dubious—perhaps a deplorable result; especially as he was engaged to
8619: go abroad the next week for a couple of months. If a search were made,
8620: he would like to be at hand, so that Mrs. Meyrick might not be unaided
8621: in meeting any consequences—supposing that she would generously
8622: continue to watch over Mirah.
8623: 
8624: “We should be very jealous of any one who took the task from us,” said
8625: Mrs. Meyrick. “She will stay under my roof; there is Hans’s old room
8626: for her.”
8627: 
8628: “Will she be content to wait?” said Deronda, anxiously.
8629: 
8630: “No trouble there. It is not her nature to run into planning and
8631: devising: only to submit. See how she submitted to that father! It was
8632: a wonder to herself how she found the will and contrivance to run away
8633: from him. About finding her mother, her only notion now is to trust;
8634: since you were sent to save her and we are good to her, she trusts that
8635: her mother will be found in the same unsought way. And when she is
8636: talking I catch her feeling like a child.”
8637: 
8638: Mrs. Meyrick hoped that the sum Deronda put into her hands as a
8639: provision for Mirah’s wants was more than would be needed; after a
8640: little while Mirah would perhaps like to occupy herself as the other
8641: girls did, and make herself independent. Deronda pleaded that she must
8642: need a long rest. “Oh, yes; we will hurry nothing,” said Mrs. Meyrick.
8643: 
8644: “Rely upon it, she shall be taken tender care of. If you like to give
8645: me your address abroad, I will write to let you know how we get on. It
8646: is not fair that we should have all the pleasure of her salvation to
8647: ourselves. And besides, I want to make believe that I am doing
8648: something for you as well as for Mirah.”
8649: 
8650: “That is no make-believe. What should I have done without you last
8651: night? Everything would have gone wrong. I shall tell Hans that the
8652: best of having him for a friend is, knowing his mother.”
8653: 
8654: After that they joined the girls in the other room, where Mirah was
8655: seated placidly, while the others were telling her what they knew about
8656: Mr. Deronda—his goodness to Hans, and all the virtues that Hans had
8657: reported of him.
8658: 
8659: “Kate burns a pastille before his portrait every day,” said Mab. “And I
8660: carry his signature in a little black-silk bag round my neck to keep
8661: off the cramp. And Amy says the multiplication-table in his name. We
8662: must all do something extra in honor of him, now he has brought you to
8663: us.”
8664: 
8665: “I suppose he is too great a person to want anything,” said Mirah,
8666: smiling at Mab, and appealing to the graver Amy. “He is perhaps very
8667: high in the world?”
8668: 
8669: “He is very much above us in rank,” said Amy. “He is related to grand
8670: people. I dare say he leans on some of the satin cushions we prick our
8671: fingers over.”
8672: 
8673: “I am glad he is of high rank,” said Mirah, with her usual quietness.
8674: 
8675: “Now, why are you glad of that?” said Amy, rather suspicious of this
8676: sentiment, and on the watch for Jewish peculiarities which had not
8677: appeared.
8678: 
8679: “Because I have always disliked men of high rank before.”
8680: 
8681: “Oh, Mr. Deronda is not so very high,” said Kate, “He need not hinder
8682: us from thinking ill of the whole peerage and baronetage if we like.”
8683: 
8684: When he entered, Mirah rose with the same look of grateful reverence
8685: that she had lifted to him the evening before: impossible to see a
8686: creature freer at once from embarrassment and boldness. Her theatrical
8687: training had left no recognizable trace; probably her manners had not
8688: much changed since she played the forsaken child at nine years of age;
8689: and she had grown up in her simplicity and truthfulness like a little
8690: flower-seed that absorbs the chance confusion of its surrounding into
8691: its own definite mould of beauty. Deronda felt that he was making
8692: acquaintance with something quite new to him in the form of womanhood.
8693: For Mirah was not childlike from ignorance: her experience of evil and
8694: trouble was deeper and stranger than his own. He felt inclined to watch
8695: her and listen to her as if she had come from a far off shore inhabited
8696: by a race different from our own.
8697: 
8698: But for that very reason he made his visit brief with his usual
8699: activity of imagination as to how his conduct might affect others, he
8700: shrank from what might seem like curiosity or the assumption of a right
8701: to know as much as he pleased of one to whom he had done a service. For
8702: example, he would have liked to hear her sing, but he would have felt
8703: the expression of such a wish to be rudeness in him—since she could
8704: not refuse, and he would all the while have a sense that she was being
8705: treated like one whose accomplishments were to be ready on demand. And
8706: whatever reverence could be shown to woman, he was bent on showing to
8707: this girl. Why? He gave himself several good reasons; but whatever one
8708: does with a strong unhesitating outflow of will has a store of motive
8709: that it would be hard to put into words. Some deeds seem little more
8710: than interjections which give vent to the long passion of a life.
8711: 
8712: So Deronda soon took his farewell for the two months during which he
8713: expected to be absent from London, and in a few days he was on his way
8714: with Sir Hugo and Lady Mallinger to Leubronn.
8715: 
8716: He had fulfilled his intention of telling them about Mirah. The baronet
8717: was decidedly of opinion that the search for the mother and brother had
8718: better be let alone. Lady Mallinger was much interested in the poor
8719: girl, observing that there was a society for the conversion of the
8720: Jews, and that it was to be hoped Mirah would embrace Christianity; but
8721: perceiving that Sir Hugo looked at her with amusement, she concluded
8722: that she had said something foolish. Lady Mallinger felt apologetically
8723: about herself as a woman who had produced nothing but daughters in a
8724: case where sons were required, and hence regarded the apparent
8725: contradictions of the world as probably due to the weakness of her own
8726: understanding. But when she was much puzzled, it was her habit to say
8727: to herself, “I will ask Daniel.” Deronda was altogether a convenience
8728: in the family; and Sir Hugo too, after intending to do the best for
8729: him, had begun to feel that the pleasantest result would be to have
8730: this substitute for a son always ready at his elbow.
8731: 
8732: This was the history of Deronda, so far as he knew it, up to the time
8733: of that visit to Leubronn in which he saw Gwendolen Harleth at the
8734: gaming-table.
8735: 
8736: 
8737: 
8738: 
8739: CHAPTER XXI.
8740: 
8741:     It is a common sentence that Knowledge is power; but who hath duly
8742:     considered or set forth the power of Ignorance? Knowledge slowly
8743:     builds up what Ignorance in an hour pulls down. Knowledge, through
8744:     patient and frugal centuries, enlarges discovery and makes record of
8745:     it; Ignorance, wanting its day’s dinner, lights a fire with the
8746:     record, and gives a flavor to its one roast with the burned souls of
8747:     many generations. Knowledge, instructing the sense, refining and
8748:     multiplying needs, transforms itself into skill and makes life various
8749:     with a new six days’ work; comes Ignorance drunk on the seventh, with
8750:     a firkin of oil and a match and an easy “Let there not be,” and the
8751:     many-colored creation is shriveled up in blackness. Of a truth,
8752:     Knowledge is power, but it is a power reined by scruple, having a
8753:     conscience of what must be and what may be; whereas Ignorance is a
8754:     blind giant who, let him but wax unbound, would make it a sport to
8755:     seize the pillars that hold up the long-wrought fabric of human good,
8756:     and turn all the places of joy dark as a buried Babylon. And looking
8757:     at life parcel-wise, in the growth of a single lot, who having a
8758:     practiced vision may not see that ignorance of the true bond between
8759:     events, and false conceit of means whereby sequences may be
8760:     compelled—like that falsity of eyesight which overlooks the gradations of
8761:     distance, seeing that which is afar off as if it were within a step or
8762:     a grasp—precipitates the mistaken soul on destruction?
8763: 
8764: 
8765: It was half-past ten in the morning when Gwendolen Harleth, after her
8766: gloomy journey from Leubronn, arrived at the station from which she
8767: must drive to Offendene. No carriage or friend was awaiting her, for in
8768: the telegram she had sent from Dover she had mentioned a later train,
8769: and in her impatience of lingering at a London station she had set off
8770: without picturing what it would be to arrive unannounced at half an
8771: hour’s drive from home—at one of those stations which have been fixed
8772: on not as near anywhere, but as equidistant from everywhere. Deposited
8773: as a _femme sole_ with her large trunks, and having to wait while a
8774: vehicle was being got from the large-sized lantern called the Railway
8775: Inn, Gwendolen felt that the dirty paint in the waiting-room, the dusty
8776: decanter of flat water, and the texts in large letters calling on her
8777: to repent and be converted, were part of the dreary prospect opened by
8778: her family troubles; and she hurried away to the outer door looking
8779: toward the lane and fields. But here the very gleams of sunshine seemed
8780: melancholy, for the autumnal leaves and grass were shivering, and the
8781: wind was turning up the feathers of a cock and two croaking hens which
8782: had doubtless parted with their grown-up offspring and did not know
8783: what to do with themselves. The railway official also seemed without
8784: resources, and his innocent demeanor in observing Gwendolen and her
8785: trunks was rendered intolerable by the cast in his eye; especially
8786: since, being a new man, he did not know her, and must conclude that she
8787: was not very high in the world. The vehicle—a dirty old barouche—was
8788: within sight, and was being slowly prepared by an elderly laborer.
8789: Contemptible details these, to make part of a history; yet the turn of
8790: most lives is hardly to be accounted for without them. They are
8791: continually entering with cumulative force into a mood until it gets
8792: the mass and momentum of a theory or a motive. Even philosophy is not
8793: quite free from such determining influences; and to be dropped solitary
8794: at an ugly, irrelevant-looking spot, with a sense of no income on the
8795: mind, might well prompt a man to discouraging speculation on the origin
8796: of things and the reason of a world where a subtle thinker found
8797: himself so badly off. How much more might such trifles tell on a young
8798: lady equipped for society with a fastidious taste, an Indian shawl over
8799: her arm, some twenty cubic feet of trunks by her side, and a mortal
8800: dislike to the new consciousness of poverty which was stimulating her
8801: imagination of disagreeables? At any rate they told heavily on poor
8802: Gwendolen, and helped to quell her resistant spirit. What was the good
8803: of living in the midst of hardships, ugliness, and humiliation? This
8804: was the beginning of being at home again, and it was a sample of what
8805: she had to expect.
8806: 
8807: Here was the theme on which her discontent rung its sad changes during
8808: her slow drive in the uneasy barouche, with one great trunk squeezing
8809: the meek driver, and the other fastened with a rope on the seat in
8810: front of her. Her ruling vision all the way from Leubronn had been that
8811: the family would go abroad again; for of course there must be some
8812: little income left—her mamma did not mean that they would have
8813: literally nothing. To go to a dull place abroad and live poorly, was
8814: the dismal future that threatened her: she had seen plenty of poor
8815: English people abroad and imagined herself plunged in the despised
8816: dullness of their ill-plenished lives, with Alice, Bertha, Fanny and
8817: Isabel all growing up in tediousness around her, while she advanced
8818: toward thirty and her mamma got more and more melancholy. But she did
8819: not mean to submit, and let misfortune do what it would with her: she
8820: had not yet quite believed in the misfortune; but weariness and disgust
8821: with this wretched arrival had begun to affect her like an
8822: uncomfortable waking, worse than the uneasy dreams which had gone
8823: before. The self-delight with which she had kissed her image in the
8824: glass had faded before the sense of futility in being anything
8825: whatever—charming, clever, resolute—what was the good of it all?
8826: Events might turn out anyhow, and men were hateful. Yes, men were
8827: hateful. But in these last hours, a certain change had come over their
8828: meaning. It is one thing to hate stolen goods, and another thing to
8829: hate them the more because their being stolen hinders us from making
8830: use of them. Gwendolen had begun to be angry with Grandcourt for being
8831: what had hindered her from marrying him, angry with him as the cause of
8832: her present dreary lot.
8833: 
8834: But the slow drive was nearly at an end, and the lumbering vehicle
8835: coming up the avenue was within sight of the windows. A figure
8836: appearing under the portico brought a rush of new and less selfish
8837: feeling in Gwendolen, and when springing from the carriage she saw the
8838: dear beautiful face with fresh lines of sadness in it, she threw her
8839: arms round her mother’s neck, and for the moment felt all sorrows only
8840: in relation to her mother’s feeling about them.
8841: 
8842: Behind, of course, were the sad faces of the four superfluous girls,
8843: each, poor thing—like those other many thousand sisters of us
8844: all—having her peculiar world which was of no importance to any one
8845: else, but all of them feeling Gwendolen’s presence to be somehow a
8846: relenting of misfortune: where Gwendolen was, something interesting
8847: would happen; even her hurried submission to their kisses, and “Now go
8848: away, girls,” carried the sort of comfort which all weakness finds in
8849: decision and authoritativeness. Good Miss Merry, whose air of meek
8850: depression, hitherto held unaccountable in a governess affectionately
8851: attached to the family, was now at the general level of circumstances,
8852: did not expect any greeting, but busied herself with the trunks and the
8853: coachman’s pay; while Mrs. Davilow and Gwendolen hastened up-stairs and
8854: shut themselves in the black and yellow bedroom.
8855: 
8856: “Never mind, mamma dear,” said Gwendolen, tenderly pressing her
8857: handkerchief against the tears that were rolling down Mrs. Davilow’s
8858: cheeks. “Never mind. I don’t mind. I will do something. I will be
8859: something. Things will come right. It seemed worse because I was away.
8860: Come now! you must be glad because I am here.”
8861: 
8862: Gwendolen felt every word of that speech. A rush of compassionate
8863: tenderness stirred all her capability of generous resolution; and the
8864: self-confident projects which had vaguely glanced before her during her
8865: journey sprang instantaneously into new definiteness. Suddenly she
8866: seemed to perceive how she could be “something.” It was one of her best
8867: moments, and the fond mother, forgetting everything below that tide
8868: mark, looked at her with a sort of adoration. She said,
8869: 
8870: “Bless you, my good, good darling! I can be happy, if you can!”
8871: 
8872: But later in the day there was an ebb; the old slippery rocks, the old
8873: weedy places reappeared. Naturally, there was a shrinking of courage as
8874: misfortune ceased to be a mere announcement, and began to disclose
8875: itself as a grievous tyrannical inmate. At first—that ugly drive at an
8876: end—it was still Offendene that Gwendolen had come home to, and all
8877: surroundings of immediate consequence to her were still there to secure
8878: her personal ease; the roomy stillness of the large solid house while
8879: she rested; all the luxuries of her toilet cared for without trouble to
8880: her; and a little tray with her favorite food brought to her in
8881: private. For she had said, “Keep them all away from us to-day, mamma.
8882: Let you and me be alone together.”
8883: 
8884: When Gwendolen came down into the drawing-room, fresh as a newly-dipped
8885: swan, and sat leaning against the cushions of the settee beside her
8886: mamma, their misfortune had not yet turned its face and breath upon
8887: her. She felt prepared to hear everything, and began in a tone of
8888: deliberate intention,
8889: 
8890: “What have you thought of doing, exactly, mamma?”
8891: 
8892: “Oh, my dear, the next thing to be done is to move away from this
8893: house. Mr. Haynes most fortunately is as glad to have it now as he
8894: would have been when we took it. Lord Brackenshaw’s agent is to arrange
8895: everything with him to the best advantage for us: Bazley, you know; not
8896: at all an ill-natured man.”
8897: 
8898: “I cannot help thinking that Lord Brackenshaw would let you stay here
8899: rent-free, mamma,” said Gwendolen, whose talents had not been applied
8900: to business so much as to discernment of the admiration excited by her
8901: charms.
8902: 
8903: “My dear child, Lord Brackenshaw is in Scotland, and knows nothing
8904: about us. Neither your uncle nor I would choose to apply to him.
8905: Besides, what could we do in this house without servants, and without
8906: money to warm it? The sooner we are out the better. We have nothing to
8907: carry but our clothes, you know?”
8908: 
8909: “I suppose you mean to go abroad, then?” said Gwendolen. After all,
8910: this is what she had familiarized her mind with.
8911: 
8912: “Oh, no, dear, no. How could we travel? You never did learn anything
8913: about income and expenses,” said Mrs. Davilow, trying to smile, and
8914: putting her hand on Gwendolen’s as she added, mournfully, “that makes
8915: it so much harder for you, my pet.”
8916: 
8917: “But where are we to go?” said Gwendolen, with a trace of sharpness in
8918: her tone. She felt a new current of fear passing through her.
8919: 
8920: “It is all decided. A little furniture is to be got in from the
8921: rectory—all that can be spared.” Mrs. Davilow hesitated. She dreaded
8922: the reality for herself less than the shock she must give to Gwendolen,
8923: who looked at her with tense expectancy, but was silent.
8924: 
8925: “It is Sawyer’s Cottage we are to go to.”
8926: 
8927: At first, Gwendolen remained silent, paling with anger—justifiable
8928: anger, in her opinion. Then she said with haughtiness,
8929: 
8930: “That is impossible. Something else than that ought to have been
8931: thought of. My uncle ought not to allow that. I will not submit to it.”
8932: 
8933: “My sweet child, what else could have been thought of? Your uncle, I am
8934: sure, is as kind as he can be: but he is suffering himself; he has his
8935: family to bring up. And do you quite understand? You must remember—we
8936: have nothing. We shall have absolutely nothing except what he and my
8937: sister give us. They have been as wise and active as possible, and we
8938: must try to earn something. I and the girls are going to work a
8939: table-cloth border for the Ladies’ Charity at Winchester, and a
8940: communion cloth that the parishioners are to present to Pennicote
8941: Church.”
8942: 
8943: Mrs. Davilow went into these details timidly: but how else was she to
8944: bring the fact of their position home to this poor child who, alas!
8945: must submit at present, whatever might be in the background for her?
8946: and she herself had a superstition that there must be something better
8947: in the background.
8948: 
8949: “But surely somewhere else than Sawyer’s Cottage might have been
8950: found,” Gwendolen persisted—taken hold of (as if in a nightmare) by
8951: the image of this house where an exciseman had lived.
8952: 
8953: “No, indeed, dear. You know houses are scarce, and we may be thankful
8954: to get anything so private. It is not so very bad. There are two little
8955: parlors and four bedrooms. You shall sit alone whenever you like.”
8956: 
8957: The ebb of sympathetic care for her mamma had gone so low just now,
8958: that Gwendolen took no notice of these deprecatory words.
8959: 
8960: “I cannot conceive that all your property is gone at once, mamma. How
8961: can you be sure in so short a time? It is not a week since you wrote to
8962: me.”
8963: 
8964: “The first news came much earlier, dear. But I would not spoil your
8965: pleasure till it was quite necessary.”
8966: 
8967: “Oh, how vexatious!” said Gwendolen, coloring with fresh anger. “If I
8968: had known, I could have brought home the money I had won: and for want
8969: of knowing, I stayed and lost it. I had nearly two hundred pounds, and
8970: it would have done for us to live on a little while, till I could carry
8971: out some plan.” She paused an instant and then added more impetuously,
8972: “Everything has gone against me. People have come near me only to
8973: blight me.”
8974: 
8975: Among the “people” she was including Deronda. If he had not interfered
8976: in her life she would have gone to the gaming-table again with a few
8977: napoleons, and might have won back her losses.
8978: 
8979: “We must resign ourselves to the will of Providence, my child,” said
8980: poor Mrs. Davilow, startled by this revelation of the gambling, but not
8981: daring to say more. She felt sure that “people” meant Grandcourt, about
8982: whom her lips were sealed. And Gwendolen answered immediately,
8983: 
8984: “But I don’t resign myself. I shall do what I can against it. What is
8985: the good of calling the people’s wickedness Providence? You said in
8986: your letter it was Mr. Lassman’s fault we had lost our money. Has he
8987: run away with it all?”
8988: 
8989: “No, dear, you don’t understand. There were great speculations: he
8990: meant to gain. It was all about mines and things of that sort. He
8991: risked too much.”
8992: 
8993: “I don’t call that Providence: it was his improvidence with our money,
8994: and he ought to be punished. Can’t we go to law and recover our
8995: fortune? My uncle ought to take measures, and not sit down by such
8996: wrongs. We ought to go to law.”
8997: 
8998: “My dear child, law can never bring back money lost in that way. Your
8999: uncle says it is milk spilled upon the ground. Besides, one must have a
9000: fortune to get any law: there is no law for people who are ruined. And
9001: our money has only gone along with other people’s. We are not the
9002: only sufferers: others have to resign themselves besides us.”
9003: 
9004: “But I don’t resign myself to live at Sawyer’s Cottage and see you
9005: working for sixpences and shillings because of that. I shall not do it.
9006: I shall do what is more befitting our rank and education.”
9007: 
9008: “I am sure your uncle and all of us will approve of that, dear, and
9009: admire you the more for it,” said Mrs. Davilow, glad of an unexpected
9010: opening for speaking on a difficult subject. “I didn’t mean that you
9011: should resign yourself to worse when anything better offered itself.
9012: Both your uncle and aunt have felt that your abilities and education
9013: were a fortune for you, and they have already heard of something within
9014: your reach.”
9015: 
9016: “What is that, mamma?” some of Gwendolen’s anger gave way to interest,
9017: and she was not without romantic conjectures.
9018: 
9019: “There are two situations that offer themselves. One is in a bishop’s
9020: family, where there are three daughters, and the other is in quite a
9021: high class of school; and in both, your French, and music, and
9022: dancing—and then your manners and habits as a lady, are exactly what
9023: is wanted. Each is a hundred a year—and—just for the present,”—Mrs.
9024: Davilow had become frightened and hesitating,—“to save you from the
9025: petty, common way of living that we must go to—you would perhaps
9026: accept one of the two.”
9027: 
9028: “What! be like Miss Graves at Madame Meunier’s? No.”
9029: 
9030: “I think, myself, that Dr. Monpert’s would be more suitable. There
9031: could be no hardship in a bishop’s family.”
9032: 
9033: “Excuse me, mamma. There are hardships everywhere for a governess. And
9034: I don’t see that it would be pleasanter to be looked down on in a
9035: bishop’s family than in any other. Besides, you know very well I hate
9036: teaching. Fancy me shut up with three awkward girls something like
9037: Alice! I would rather emigrate than be a governess.”
9038: 
9039: What it precisely was to emigrate, Gwendolen was not called on to
9040: explain. Mrs. Davilow was mute, seeing no outlet, and thinking with
9041: dread of the collision that might happen when Gwendolen had to meet her
9042: uncle and aunt. There was an air of reticence in Gwendolen’s haughty,
9043: resistant speeches which implied that she had a definite plan in
9044: reserve; and her practical ignorance continually exhibited, could not
9045: nullify the mother’s belief in the effectiveness of that forcible will
9046: and daring which had held mastery over herself.
9047: 
9048: “I have some ornaments, mamma, and I could sell them,” said Gwendolen.
9049: “They would make a sum: I want a little sum—just to go on with. I dare
9050: say Marshall, at Wanchester, would take them: I know he showed me some
9051: bracelets once that he said he had bought from a lady. Jocosa might go
9052: and ask him. Jocosa is going to leave us, of course. But she might do
9053: that first.”
9054: 
9055: “She would do anything she could, poor, dear soul. I have not told you
9056: yet—she wanted me to take all her savings—her three hundred pounds. I
9057: tell her to set up a little school. It will be hard for her to go into
9058: a new family now she has been so long with us.”
9059: 
9060: “Oh, recommend her for the bishop’s daughters,” said Gwendolen, with a
9061: sudden gleam of laughter in her face. “I am sure she will do better
9062: than I should.”
9063: 
9064: “Do take care not to say such things to your uncle,” said Mrs. Davilow.
9065: “He will be hurt at your despising what he has exerted himself about.
9066: But I dare say you have something else in your mind that he might not
9067: disapprove, if you consulted him.”
9068: 
9069: “There is some one else I want to consult first. Are the Arrowpoints
9070: at Quetcham still, and is Herr Klesmer there? But I daresay you know
9071: nothing about it, poor, dear mamma. Can Jeffries go on horseback with a
9072: note?”
9073: 
9074: “Oh, my dear, Jeffries is not here, and the dealer has taken the
9075: horses. But some one could go for us from Leek’s farm. The Arrowpoints
9076: are at Quetcham, I know. Miss Arrowpoint left her card the other day: I
9077: could not see her. But I don’t know about Herr Klesmer. Do you want to
9078: send before to-morrow?”
9079: 
9080: “Yes, as soon as possible. I will write a note,” said Gwendolen, rising.
9081: 
9082: “What can you be thinking of, Gwen?” said Mrs. Davilow, relieved in the
9083: midst of her wonderment by signs of alacrity and better humor.
9084: 
9085: “Don’t mind what, there’s a dear, good mamma,” said Gwendolen,
9086: reseating herself a moment to give atoning caresses. “I mean to do
9087: something. Never mind what until it is all settled. And then you shall
9088: be comforted. The dear face!—it is ten years older in these three
9089: weeks. Now, now, now! don’t cry”—Gwendolen, holding her mamma’s head
9090: with both hands, kissed the trembling eyelids. “But mind you don’t
9091: contradict me or put hindrances in my way. I must decide for myself. I
9092: cannot be dictated to by my uncle or any one else. My life is my own
9093: affair. And I think”—here her tone took an edge of scorn—“I think I
9094: can do better for you than let you live in Sawyer’s Cottage.”
9095: 
9096: In uttering this last sentence Gwendolen again rose, and went to a desk
9097: where she wrote the following note to Klesmer:—
9098: 
9099:     Miss Harleth presents her compliments to Herr Klesmer, and ventures
9100:     to request of him the very great favor that he will call upon her, if
9101:     possible, to-morrow. Her reason for presuming so far on his kindness
9102:     is of a very serious nature. Unfortunate family circumstances have
9103:     obliged her to take a course in which she can only turn for advice to
9104:     the great knowledge and judgment of Herr Klesmer.
9105: 
9106: “Pray get this sent to Quetcham at once, mamma,” said Gwendolen, as she
9107: addressed the letter. “The man must be told to wait for an answer. Let
9108: no time be lost.”
9109: 
9110: For the moment, the absorbing purpose was to get the letter dispatched;
9111: but when she had been assured on this point, another anxiety arose and
9112: kept her in a state of uneasy excitement. If Klesmer happened not to be
9113: at Quetcham, what could she do next? Gwendolen’s belief in her star, so
9114: to speak, had had some bruises. Things had gone against her. A splendid
9115: marriage which presented itself within reach had shown a hideous flaw.
9116: The chances of roulette had not adjusted themselves to her claims; and
9117: a man of whom she knew nothing had thrust himself between her and her
9118: intentions. The conduct of those uninteresting people who managed the
9119: business of the world had been culpable just in the points most
9120: injurious to her in particular. Gwendolen Harleth, with all her beauty
9121: and conscious force, felt the close threats of humiliation: for the
9122: first time the conditions of this world seemed to her like a hurrying
9123: roaring crowd in which she had got astray, no more cared for and
9124: protected than a myriad of other girls, in spite of its being a
9125: peculiar hardship to her. If Klesmer were not at Quetcham—that would
9126: be all of a piece with the rest: the unwelcome negative urged itself as
9127: a probability, and set her brain working at desperate alternatives
9128: which might deliver her from Sawyer’s Cottage or the ultimate necessity
9129: of “taking a situation,” a phrase that summed up for her the
9130: disagreeables most wounding to her pride, most irksome to her tastes;
9131: at least so far as her experience enabled her to imagine disagreeables.
9132: 
9133: Still Klesmer might be there, and Gwendolen thought of the result in
9134: that case with a hopefulness which even cast a satisfactory light over
9135: her peculiar troubles, as what might well enter into the biography of
9136: celebrities and remarkable persons. And if she had heard her immediate
9137: acquaintances cross-examined as to whether they thought her remarkable,
9138: the first who said “No” would have surprised her.
9139: 
9140: 
9141: 
9142: 
9143: CHAPTER XXII.
9144: 
9145:   We please our fancy with ideal webs
9146:   Of innovation, but our life meanwhile
9147:   Is in the loom, where busy passion plies
9148:   The shuttle to and fro, and gives our deeds
9149:   The accustomed pattern.
9150: 
9151: 
9152: Gwendolen’s note, coming “pat betwixt too early and too late,” was put
9153: into Klesmer’s hands just when he was leaving Quetcham, and in order to
9154: meet her appeal to his kindness he, with some inconvenience to himself
9155: spent the night at Wanchester. There were reasons why he would not
9156: remain at Quetcham.
9157: 
9158: That magnificent mansion, fitted with regard to the greatest expense,
9159: had in fact became too hot for him, its owners having, like some great
9160: politicians, been astonished at an insurrection against the established
9161: order of things, which we plain people after the event can perceive to
9162: have been prepared under their very noses.
9163: 
9164: There were as usual many guests in the house, and among them one in
9165: whom Miss Arrowpoint foresaw a new pretender to her hand: a political
9166: man of good family who confidently expected a peerage, and felt on
9167: public grounds that he required a larger fortune to support the title
9168: properly. Heiresses vary, and persons interested in one of them
9169: beforehand are prepared to find that she is too yellow or too red, tall
9170: and toppling or short and square, violent and capricious or moony and
9171: insipid; but in every case it is taken for granted that she will
9172: consider herself an appendage to her fortune, and marry where others
9173: think her fortunes ought to go. Nature, however, not only accommodates
9174: herself ill to our favorite practices by making “only children”
9175: daughters, but also now and then endows the misplaced daughter with a
9176: clear head and a strong will. The Arrowpoints had already felt some
9177: anxiety owing to these endowments of their Catherine. She would not
9178: accept the view of her social duty which required her to marry a needy
9179: nobleman or a commoner on the ladder toward nobility; and they were not
9180: without uneasiness concerning her persistence in declining suitable
9181: offers. As to the possibility of her being in love with Klesmer they
9182: were not at all uneasy—a very common sort of blindness. For in general
9183: mortals have a great power of being astonished at the presence of an
9184: effect toward which they have done everything, and at the absence of an
9185: effect toward which they had done nothing but desire it. Parents are
9186: astonished at the ignorance of their sons, though they have used the
9187: most time-honored and expensive means of securing it; husbands and
9188: wives are mutually astonished at the loss of affection which they have
9189: taken no pains to keep; and all of us in our turn are apt to be
9190: astonished that our neighbors do not admire us. In this way it happens
9191: that the truth seems highly improbable. The truth is something
9192: different from the habitual lazy combinations begotten by our wishes.
9193: The Arrowpoints’ hour of astonishment was come.
9194: 
9195: When there is a passion between an heiress and a proud
9196: independent-spirited man, it is difficult for them to come to an
9197: understanding; but the difficulties are likely to be overcome unless
9198: the proud man secures himself by a constant _alibi_. Brief meetings
9199: after studied absence are potent in disclosure: but more potent still
9200: is frequent companionship, with full sympathy in taste and admirable
9201: qualities on both sides; especially where the one is in the position of
9202: teacher and the other is delightedly conscious of receptive ability
9203: which also gives the teacher delight. The situation is famous in
9204: history, and has no less charm now than it had in the days of Abelard.
9205: 
9206: But this kind of comparison had not occurred to the Arrowpoints when
9207: they first engaged Klesmer to come down to Quetcham. To have a
9208: first-rate musician in your house is a privilege of wealth; Catherine’s
9209: musical talent demanded every advantage; and she particularly desired
9210: to use her quieter time in the country for more thorough study. Klesmer
9211: was not yet a Liszt, understood to be adored by ladies of all European
9212: countries with the exception of Lapland: and even with that
9213: understanding it did not follow that he would make proposals to an
9214: heiress. No musician of honor would do so. Still less was it
9215: conceivable that Catherine would give him the slightest pretext for
9216: such daring. The large check that Mr. Arrowpoint was to draw in
9217: Klesmer’s name seemed to make him as safe an inmate as a footman. Where
9218: marriage is inconceivable, a girl’s sentiments are safe.
9219: 
9220: Klesmer was eminently a man of honor, but marriages rarely begin with
9221: formal proposals, and moreover, Catherine’s limit of the conceivable
9222: did not exactly correspond with her mother’s.
9223: 
9224: Outsiders might have been more apt to think that Klesmer’s position was
9225: dangerous for himself if Miss Arrowpoint had been an acknowledged
9226: beauty; not taking into account that the most powerful of all beauty is
9227: that which reveals itself after sympathy and not before it. There is a
9228: charm of eye and lip which comes with every little phrase that
9229: certifies delicate perception or fine judgment, with every
9230: unostentatious word or smile that shows a heart awake to others; and no
9231: sweep of garment or turn of figure is more satisfying than that which
9232: enters as a restoration of confidence that one person is present on
9233: whom no intention will be lost. What dignity of meaning goes on
9234: gathering in frowns and laughs which are never observed in the wrong
9235: place; what suffused adorableness in a human frame where there is a
9236: mind that can flash out comprehension and hands that can execute
9237: finely! The more obvious beauty, also adorable sometimes—one may say
9238: it without blasphemy—begins by being an apology for folly, and ends
9239: like other apologies in becoming tiresome by iteration; and that
9240: Klesmer, though very susceptible to it, should have a passionate
9241: attachment to Miss Arrowpoint, was no more a paradox than any other
9242: triumph of a manifold sympathy over a monotonous attraction. We object
9243: less to be taxed with the enslaving excess of our passions than with
9244: our deficiency in wider passion; but if the truth were known, our
9245: reputed intensity is often the dullness of not knowing what else to do
9246: with ourselves. Tannhäuser, one suspects, was a knight of ill-furnished
9247: imagination, hardly of larger discourse than a heavy Guardsman; Merlin
9248: had certainly seen his best days, and was merely repeating himself,
9249: when he fell into that hopeless captivity; and we know that Ulysses
9250: felt so manifest an _ennui_ under similar circumstances that Calypso
9251: herself furthered his departure. There is indeed a report that he
9252: afterward left Penelope; but since she was habitually absorbed in
9253: worsted work, and it was probably from her that Telemachus got his
9254: mean, pettifogging disposition, always anxious about the property and
9255: the daily consumption of meat, no inference can be drawn from this
9256: already dubious scandal as to the relation between companionship and
9257: constancy.
9258: 
9259: Klesmer was as versatile and fascinating as a young Ulysses on a
9260: sufficient acquaintance—one whom nature seemed to have first made
9261: generously and then to have added music as a dominant power using all
9262: the abundant rest, and, as in Mendelssohn, finding expression for
9263: itself not only in the highest finish of execution, but in that fervor
9264: of creative work and theoretic belief which pierces the whole future of
9265: a life with the delight of congruous devoted purpose. His foibles of
9266: arrogance and vanity did not exceed such as may be found in the best
9267: English families; and Catherine Arrowpoint had no corresponding
9268: restlessness to clash with his: notwithstanding her native kindliness
9269: she was perhaps too coolly firm and self-sustained. But she was one of
9270: those satisfactory creatures whose intercourse has the charm of
9271: discovery; whose integrity of faculty and expression begets a wish to
9272: know what they will say on all subjects or how they will perform
9273: whatever they undertake; so that they end by raising not only a
9274: continual expectation but a continual sense of fulfillment—the systole
9275: and diastole of blissful companionship. In such cases the outward
9276: presentment easily becomes what the image is to the worshipper. It was
9277: not long before the two became aware that each was interesting to the
9278: other; but the “how far” remained a matter of doubt. Klesmer did not
9279: conceive that Miss Arrowpoint was likely to think of him as a possible
9280: lover, and she was not accustomed to think of herself as likely to stir
9281: more than a friendly regard, or to fear the expression of more from any
9282: man who was not enamored of her fortune. Each was content to suffer some
9283: unshared sense of denial for the sake of loving the other’s society a
9284: little too well; and under these conditions no need had been felt to
9285: restrict Klesmer’s visits for the last year either in country or in
9286: town. He knew very well that if Miss Arrowpoint had been poor he would
9287: have made ardent love to her instead of sending a storm through the
9288: piano, or folding his arms and pouring out a hyperbolical tirade about
9289: something as impersonal as the north pole; and she was not less aware
9290: that if it had been possible for Klesmer to wish for her hand she would
9291: have found overmastering reasons for giving it to him. Here was the
9292: safety of full cups, which are as secure from overflow as the half-empty,
9293: always supposing no disturbance. Naturally, silent feeling had
9294: not remained at the same point any more than the stealthly dial-hand,
9295: and in the present visit to Quetcham, Klesmer had begun to think that he
9296: would not come again; while Catherine was more sensitive to his frequent
9297: _brusquerie_, which she rather resented as a needless effort to assert
9298: his footing of superior in every sense except the conventional.
9299: 
9300: Meanwhile enters the expectant peer, Mr. Bult, an esteemed party man
9301: who, rather neutral in private life, had strong opinions concerning the
9302: districts of the Niger, was much at home also in Brazils, spoke with
9303: decision of affairs in the South Seas, was studious of his
9304: Parliamentary and itinerant speeches, and had the general solidity and
9305: suffusive pinkness of a healthy Briton on the central table-land of
9306: life. Catherine, aware of a tacit understanding that he was an
9307: undeniable husband for an heiress, had nothing to say against him but
9308: that he was thoroughly tiresome to her. Mr. Bult was amiably confident,
9309: and had no idea that his insensibility to counterpoint could ever be
9310: reckoned against him. Klesmer he hardly regarded in the light of a
9311: serious human being who ought to have a vote; and he did not mind Miss
9312: Arrowpoint’s addiction to music any more than her probable expenses in
9313: antique lace. He was consequently a little amazed at an after-dinner
9314: outburst of Klesmer’s on the lack of idealism in English politics,
9315: which left all mutuality between distant races to be determined simply
9316: by the need of a market; the crusades, to his mind, had at least this
9317: excuse, that they had a banner of sentiment round which generous
9318: feelings could rally: of course, the scoundrels rallied too, but what
9319: then? they rally in equal force round your advertisement van of “Buy
9320: cheap, sell dear.” On this theme Klesmer’s eloquence, gesticulatory and
9321: other, went on for a little while like stray fireworks accidentally
9322: ignited, and then sank into immovable silence. Mr. Bult was not
9323: surprised that Klesmer’s opinions should be flighty, but was astonished
9324: at his command of English idiom and his ability to put a point in a way
9325: that would have told at a constituents’ dinner—to be accounted for
9326: probably by his being a Pole, or a Czech, or something of that
9327: fermenting sort, in a state of political refugeeism which had obliged
9328: him to make a profession of his music; and that evening in the
9329: drawing-room he for the first time went up to Klesmer at the piano,
9330: Miss Arrowpoint being near, and said,
9331: 
9332: “I had no idea before that you were a political man.”
9333: 
9334: Klesmer’s only answer was to fold his arms, put out his nether lip, and
9335: stare at Mr. Bult.
9336: 
9337: “You must have been used to public speaking. You speak uncommonly well,
9338: though I don’t agree with you. From what you said about sentiment, I
9339: fancy you are a Panslavist.”
9340: 
9341: “No; my name is Elijah. I am the Wandering Jew,” said Klesmer, flashing
9342: a smile at Miss Arrowpoint, and suddenly making a mysterious, wind-like
9343: rush backward and forward on the piano. Mr. Bult felt this buffoonery
9344: rather offensive and Polish, but—Miss Arrowpoint being there—did not
9345: like to move away.
9346: 
9347: “Herr Klesmer has cosmopolitan ideas,” said Miss Arrowpoint, trying to
9348: make the best of the situation. “He looks forward to a fusion of races.”
9349: 
9350: “With all my heart,” said Mr. Bult, willing to be gracious. “I was sure
9351: he had too much talent to be a mere musician.”
9352: 
9353: “Ah, sir, you are under some mistake there,” said Klesmer, firing up.
9354: “No man has too much talent to be a musician. Most men have too little.
9355: A creative artist is no more a mere musician than a great statesman is
9356: a mere politician. We are not ingenious puppets, sir, who live in a box
9357: and look out on the world only when it is gaping for amusement. We help
9358: to rule the nations and make the age as much as any other public men.
9359: We count ourselves on level benches with legislators. And a man who
9360: speaks effectively through music is compelled to something more
9361: difficult than parliamentary eloquence.”
9362: 
9363: With the last word Klesmer wheeled from the piano and walked away.
9364: 
9365: Miss Arrowpoint colored, and Mr. Bult observed, with his usual
9366: phlegmatic stolidity, “Your pianist does not think small beer of
9367: himself.”
9368: 
9369: “Herr Klesmer is something more than a pianist,” said Miss Arrowpoint,
9370: apologetically. “He is a great musician in the fullest sense of the
9371: word. He will rank with Schubert and Mendelssohn.”
9372: 
9373: “Ah, you ladies understand these things,” said Mr. Bult, none the less
9374: convinced that these things were frivolous because Klesmer had shown
9375: himself a coxcomb.
9376: 
9377: Catherine, always sorry when Klesmer gave himself airs, found an
9378: opportunity the next day in the music-room to say, “Why were you so
9379: heated last night with Mr. Bult? He meant no harm.”
9380: 
9381: “You wish me to be complaisant to him?” said Klesmer, rather fiercely.
9382: 
9383: “I think it is hardly worth your while to be other than civil.”
9384: 
9385: “You find no difficulty in tolerating him, then?—you have a respect
9386: for a political platitudinarian as insensible as an ox to everything he
9387: can’t turn into political capital. You think his monumental obtuseness
9388: suited to the dignity of the English gentleman.”
9389: 
9390: “I did not say that.”
9391: 
9392: “You mean that I acted without dignity, and you are offended with me.”
9393: 
9394: “Now you are slightly nearer the truth,” said Catherine, smiling.
9395: 
9396: “Then I had better put my burial-clothes in my portmanteau and set off
9397: at once.”
9398: 
9399: “I don’t see that. If I have to bear your criticism of my operetta, you
9400: should not mind my criticism of your impatience.”
9401: 
9402: “But I do mind it. You would have wished me to take his ignorant
9403: impertinence about a ‘mere musician’ without letting him know his
9404: place. I am to hear my gods blasphemed as well as myself insulted. But
9405: I beg pardon. It is impossible you should see the matter as I do. Even
9406: you can’t understand the wrath of the artist: he is of another caste
9407: for you.”
9408: 
9409: “That is true,” said Catherine, with some betrayal of feeling. “He is
9410: of a caste to which I look up—a caste above mine.”
9411: 
9412: Klesmer, who had been seated at a table looking over scores, started up
9413: and walked to a little distance, from which he said,
9414: 
9415: “That is finely felt—I am grateful. But I had better go, all the same.
9416: I have made up my mind to go, for good and all. You can get on
9417: exceedingly well without me: your operetta is on wheels—it will go of
9418: itself. And your Mr. Bull’s company fits me ‘wie die Faust ins Auge.’ I
9419: am neglecting my engagements. I must go off to St. Petersburg.”
9420: 
9421: There was no answer.
9422: 
9423: “You agree with me that I had better go?” said Klesmer, with some
9424: irritation.
9425: 
9426: “Certainly; if that is what your business and feeling prompt. I have
9427: only to wonder that you have consented to give us so much of your time
9428: in the last year. There must be treble the interest to you anywhere
9429: else. I have never thought of you consenting to come here as anything
9430: else than a sacrifice.”
9431: 
9432: “Why should I make the sacrifice?” said Klesmer, going to seat himself
9433: at the piano, and touching the keys so as to give with the delicacy of
9434: an echo in the far distance a melody which he had set to Heine’s “Ich
9435: hab’ dich geliebet und liebe dich noch.”
9436: 
9437: “That is the mystery,” said Catherine, not wanting to affect anything,
9438: but from mere agitation. From the same cause she was tearing a piece of
9439: paper into minute morsels, as if at a task of utmost multiplication
9440: imposed by a cruel fairy.
9441: 
9442: “You can conceive no motive?” said Klesmer, folding his arms.
9443: 
9444: “None that seems in the least probable.”
9445: 
9446: “Then I shall tell you. It is because you are to me the chief woman in
9447: the world—the throned lady whose colors I carry between my heart and
9448: my armor.”
9449: 
9450: Catherine’s hands trembled so much that she could no longer tear the
9451: paper: still less could her lips utter a word. Klesmer went on,
9452: 
9453: “This would be the last impertinence in me, if I meant to found
9454: anything upon it. That is out of the question. I meant no such thing.
9455: But you once said it was your doom to suspect every man who courted you
9456: of being an adventurer, and what made you angriest was men’s imputing
9457: to you the folly of believing that they courted you for your own sake.
9458: Did you not say so?”
9459: 
9460: “Very likely,” was the answer, in a low murmur.
9461: 
9462: “It was a bitter word. Well, at least one man who has seen women as
9463: plenty as flowers in May has lingered about you for your own sake. And
9464: since he is one whom you can never marry, you will believe him. There
9465: is an argument in favor of some other man. But don’t give yourself for
9466: a meal to a minotaur like Bult. I shall go now and pack. I shall make
9467: my excuses to Mrs. Arrowpoint.” Klesmer rose as he ended, and walked
9468: quickly toward the door.
9469: 
9470: “You must take this heap of manuscript,” then said Catherine, suddenly
9471: making a desperate effort. She had risen to fetch the heap from another
9472: table. Klesmer came back, and they had the length of the folio sheets
9473: between them.
9474: 
9475: “Why should I not marry the man who loves me, if I love him?” said
9476: Catherine. To her the effort was something like the leap of a woman
9477: from the deck into the lifeboat.
9478: 
9479: “It would be too hard—impossible—you could not carry it through. I am
9480: not worth what you would have to encounter. I will not accept the
9481: sacrifice. It would be thought a _mésalliance_ for you and I should be
9482: liable to the worst accusations.”
9483: 
9484: “Is it the accusations you are afraid of? I am afraid of nothing but
9485: that we should miss the passing of our lives together.”
9486: 
9487: The decisive word had been spoken: there was no doubt concerning the
9488: end willed by each: there only remained the way of arriving at it, and
9489: Catherine determined to take the straightest possible. She went to her
9490: father and mother in the library, and told them that she had promised
9491: to marry Klesmer.
9492: 
9493: Mrs. Arrowpoint’s state of mind was pitiable. Imagine Jean Jacques,
9494: after his essay on the corrupting influence of the arts, waking up among
9495: children of nature who had no idea of grilling the raw bone they offered
9496: him for breakfast with the primitive couvert of a flint knife; or Saint
9497: Just, after fervidly denouncing all recognition of pre-eminence,
9498: receiving a vote of thanks for the unbroken mediocrity of his speech,
9499: which warranted the dullest patriots in delivering themselves at equal
9500: length. Something of the same sort befell the authoress of “Tasso,” when
9501: what she had safely demanded of the dead Leonora was enacted by her own
9502: Catherine. It is hard for us to live up to our own eloquence, and keep
9503: pace with our winged words, while we are treading the solid earth and
9504: are liable to heavy dining. Besides, it has long been understood that
9505: the proprieties of literature are not those of practical life. Mrs.
9506: Arrowpoint naturally wished for the best of everything. She not only
9507: liked to feel herself at a higher level of literary sentiment than the
9508: ladies with whom she associated; she wished not to be behind them in any
9509: point of social consideration. While Klesmer was seen in the light of a
9510: patronized musician, his peculiarities were picturesque and acceptable:
9511: but to see him by a sudden flash in the light of her son-in-law gave her
9512: a burning sense of what the world would say. And the poor lady had been
9513: used to represent her Catherine as a model of excellence.
9514: 
9515: Under the first shock she forgot everything but her anger, and snatched
9516: at any phrase that would serve as a weapon.
9517: 
9518: “If Klesmer has presumed to offer himself to you, your father shall
9519: horsewhip him off the premises. Pray, speak, Mr. Arrowpoint.”
9520: 
9521: The father took his cigar from his mouth, and rose to the occasion by
9522: saying, “This will never do, Cath.”
9523: 
9524: “Do!” cried Mrs. Arrowpoint; “who in their senses ever thought it would
9525: do? You might as well say poisoning and strangling will not do. It is a
9526: comedy you have got up, Catherine. Else you are mad.”
9527: 
9528: “I am quite sane and serious, mamma, and Herr Klesmer is not to blame.
9529: He never thought of my marrying him. I found out that he loved me, and
9530: loving him, I told him I would marry him.”
9531: 
9532: “Leave that unsaid, Catherine,” said Mrs. Arrowpoint, bitterly. “Every
9533: one else will say that for you. You will be a public fable. Every one
9534: will say that you must have made an offer to a man who has been paid to
9535: come to the house—who is nobody knows what—a gypsy, a Jew, a mere
9536: bubble of the earth.”
9537: 
9538: “Never mind, mamma,” said Catherine, indignant in her turn. “We all
9539: know he is a genius—as Tasso was.”
9540: 
9541: “Those times were not these, nor is Klesmer Tasso,” said Mrs.
9542: Arrowpoint, getting more heated. “There is no sting in _that_ sarcasm,
9543: except the sting of undutifulness.”
9544: 
9545: “I am sorry to hurt you, mamma. But I will not give up the happiness of
9546: my life to ideas that I don’t believe in and customs I have no respect
9547: for.”
9548: 
9549: “You have lost all sense of duty, then? You have forgotten that you are
9550: our only child—that it lies with you to place a great property in the
9551: right hands?”
9552: 
9553: “What are the right hands? My grandfather gained the property in trade.”
9554: 
9555: “Mr. Arrowpoint, _will_ you sit by and hear this without speaking?”
9556: 
9557: “I am a gentleman, Cath. We expect you to marry a gentleman,” said the
9558: father, exerting himself.
9559: 
9560: “And a man connected with the institutions of this country,” said the
9561: mother. “A woman in your position has serious duties. Where duty and
9562: inclination clash, she must follow duty.”
9563: 
9564: “I don’t deny that,” said Catherine, getting colder in proportion to
9565: her mother’s heat. “But one may say very true things and apply them
9566: falsely. People can easily take the sacred word duty as a name for what
9567: they desire any one else to do.”
9568: 
9569: “Your parent’s desire makes no duty for you, then?”
9570: 
9571: “Yes, within reason. But before I give up the happiness of my life—”
9572: 
9573: “Catherine, Catherine, it will not be your happiness,” said Mrs.
9574: Arrowpoint, in her most raven-like tones.
9575: 
9576: “Well, what seems to me my happiness—before I give it up, I must see
9577: some better reason than the wish that I should marry a nobleman, or a
9578: man who votes with a party that he may be turned into a nobleman. I
9579: feel at liberty to marry the man I love and think worthy, unless some
9580: higher duty forbids.”
9581: 
9582: “And so it does, Catherine, though you are blinded and cannot see it.
9583: It is a woman’s duty not to lower herself. You are lowering yourself.
9584: Mr. Arrowpoint, will you tell your daughter what is her duty?”
9585: 
9586: “You must see, Catherine, that Klesmer is not the man for you,” said
9587: Mr. Arrowpoint. “He won’t do at the head of estates. He has a deuced
9588: foreign look—is an unpractical man.”
9589: 
9590: “I really can’t see what that has to do with it, papa. The land of
9591: England has often passed into the hands of foreigners—Dutch soldiers,
9592: sons of foreign women of bad character:—if our land were sold
9593: to-morrow it would very likely pass into the hands of some foreign
9594: merchant on ’Change. It is in everybody’s mouth that successful
9595: swindlers may buy up half the land in the country. How can I stem that
9596: tide?”
9597: 
9598: “It will never do to argue about marriage, Cath,” said Mr. Arrowpoint.
9599: “It’s no use getting up the subject like a parliamentary question. We
9600: must do as other people do. We must think of the nation and the public
9601: good.”
9602: 
9603: “I can’t see any public good concerned here, papa,” said Catherine.
9604: “Why is it to be expected of any heiress that she should carry the
9605: property gained in trade into the hands of a certain class? That seems
9606: to be a ridiculous mishmash of superannuated customs and false
9607: ambition. I should call it a public evil. People had better make a new
9608: sort of public good by changing their ambitions.”
9609: 
9610: “That is mere sophistry, Catherine,” said Mrs. Arrowpoint. “Because you
9611: don’t wish to marry a nobleman, you are not obliged to marry a
9612: mountebank or a charlatan.”
9613: 
9614: “I cannot understand the application of such words, mamma.”
9615: 
9616: “No, I dare say not,” rejoined Mrs. Arrowpoint, with significant scorn.
9617: “You have got to a pitch at which we are not likely to understand each
9618: other.”
9619: 
9620: “It can’t be done, Cath,” said Mr. Arrowpoint, wishing to substitute a
9621: better-humored reasoning for his wife’s impetuosity. “A man like
9622: Klesmer can’t marry such a property as yours. It can’t be done.”
9623: 
9624: “It certainly will not be done,” said Mrs. Arrowpoint, imperiously.
9625: “Where is the man? Let him be fetched.”
9626: 
9627: “I cannot fetch him to be insulted,” said Catherine. “Nothing will be
9628: achieved by that.”
9629: 
9630: “I suppose you would wish him to know that in marrying you he will not
9631: marry your fortune,” said Mrs. Arrowpoint.
9632: 
9633: “Certainly; if it were so, I should wish him to know it.”
9634: 
9635: “Then you had better fetch him.”
9636: 
9637: Catherine only went into the music-room and said, “Come.” She felt no
9638: need to prepare Klesmer.
9639: 
9640: “Herr Klesmer,” said Mrs. Arrowpoint, with a rather contemptuous
9641: stateliness, “it is unnecessary to repeat what has passed between us
9642: and our daughter. Mr. Arrowpoint will tell you our resolution.”
9643: 
9644: “Your marrying is out of the question,” said Mr. Arrowpoint, rather too
9645: heavily weighted with his task, and standing in an embarrassment
9646: unrelieved by a cigar. “It is a wild scheme altogether. A man has been
9647: called out for less.”
9648: 
9649: “You have taken a base advantage of our confidence,” burst in Mrs.
9650: Arrowpoint, unable to carry out her purpose and leave the burden of
9651: speech to her husband.
9652: 
9653: Klesmer made a low bow in silent irony.
9654: 
9655: “The pretension is ridiculous. You had better give it up and leave the
9656: house at once,” continued Mr. Arrowpoint. He wished to do without
9657: mentioning the money.
9658: 
9659: “I can give up nothing without reference to your daughter’s wish,” said
9660: Klesmer. “My engagement is to her.”
9661: 
9662: “It is useless to discuss the question,” said Mrs. Arrowpoint. “We
9663: shall never consent to the marriage. If Catherine disobeys us we shall
9664: disinherit her. You will not marry her fortune. It is right you should
9665: know that.”
9666: 
9667: “Madam, her fortune has been the only thing I have had to regret about
9668: her. But I must ask her if she will not think the sacrifice greater
9669: than I am worthy of.”
9670: 
9671: “It is no sacrifice to me,” said Catherine, “except that I am sorry to
9672: hurt my father and mother. I have always felt my fortune to be a
9673: wretched fatality of my life.”
9674: 
9675: “You mean to defy us, then?” said Mrs. Arrowpoint.
9676: 
9677: “I mean to marry Herr Klesmer,” said Catherine, firmly.
9678: 
9679: “He had better not count on our relenting,” said Mrs. Arrowpoint, whose
9680: manners suffered from that impunity in insult which has been reckoned
9681: among the privileges of women.
9682: 
9683: “Madam,” said Klesmer, “certain reasons forbid me to retort. But
9684: understand that I consider it out of the power of either of you, or of
9685: your fortune, to confer on me anything that I value. My rank as an
9686: artist is of my own winning, and I would not exchange it for any other.
9687: I am able to maintain your daughter, and I ask for no change in my life
9688: but her companionship.”
9689: 
9690: “You will leave the house, however,” said Mrs. Arrowpoint.
9691: 
9692: “I go at once,” said Klesmer, bowing and quitting the room.
9693: 
9694: “Let there be no misunderstanding, mamma,” said Catherine; “I consider
9695: myself engaged to Herr Klesmer, and I intend to marry him.”
9696: 
9697: The mother turned her head away and waved her hand in sign of dismissal.
9698: 
9699: “It’s all very fine,” said Mr. Arrowpoint, when Catherine was gone;
9700: “but what the deuce are we to do with the property?”
9701: 
9702: “There is Harry Brendall. He can take the name.”
9703: 
9704: “Harry Brendall will get through it all in no time,” said Mr.
9705: Arrowpoint, relighting his cigar.
9706: 
9707: And thus, with nothing settled but the determination of the lovers,
9708: Klesmer had left Quetcham.
9709: 
9710: 
9711: 
9712: 
9713: CHAPTER XXIII.
9714: 
9715:     Among the heirs of Art, as is the division of the promised land, each
9716:     has to win his portion by hard fighting: the bestowal is after the
9717:     manner of prophecy, and is a title without possession. To carry the
9718:     map of an ungotten estate in your pocket is a poor sort of copyhold.
9719:     And in fancy to cast his shoe over Eden is little warrant that a man
9720:     shall ever set the sole of his foot on an acre of his own there.
9721: 
9722:     The most obstinate beliefs that mortals entertain about themselves are
9723:     such as they have no evidence for beyond a constant, spontaneous
9724:     pulsing of their self-satisfaction—as it were a hidden seed of
9725:     madness, a confidence that they can move the world without precise
9726:     notion of standing-place or lever.
9727: 
9728: 
9729: “Pray go to church, mamma,” said Gwendolen the next morning. “I prefer
9730: seeing Herr Klesmer alone.” (He had written in reply to her note that
9731: he would be with her at eleven.)
9732: 
9733: “That is hardly correct, I think,” said Mrs. Davilow, anxiously.
9734: 
9735: “Our affairs are too serious for us to think of such nonsensical
9736: rules,” said Gwendolen, contemptuously. “They are insulting as well as
9737: ridiculous.”
9738: 
9739: “You would not mind Isabel sitting with you? She would be reading in a
9740: corner.”
9741: 
9742: “No; she could not: she would bite her nails and stare. It would be too
9743: irritating. Trust my judgment, mamma, I must be alone. Take them all to
9744: church.”
9745: 
9746: Gwendolen had her way, of course; only that Miss Merry and two of the
9747: girls stayed at home, to give the house a look of habitation by sitting
9748: at the dining-room windows.
9749: 
9750: It was a delicious Sunday morning. The melancholy waning sunshine of
9751: autumn rested on the half-strown grass and came mildly through the
9752: windows in slanting bands of brightness over the old furniture, and the
9753: glass panel that reflected the furniture; over the tapestried chairs
9754: with their faded flower-wreaths, the dark enigmatic pictures, the
9755: superannuated organ at which Gwendolen had pleased herself with acting
9756: Saint Cecelia on her first joyous arrival, the crowd of pallid, dusty
9757: knick-knacks seen through the open doors of the antechamber where she had
9758: achieved the wearing of her Greek dress as Hermione. This last memory
9759: was just now very busy in her; for had not Klesmer then been struck
9760: with admiration of her pose and expression? Whatever he had said,
9761: whatever she imagined him to have thought, was at this moment pointed
9762: with keenest interest for her: perhaps she had never before in her life
9763: felt so inwardly dependent, so consciously in need of another person’s
9764: opinion. There was a new fluttering of spirit within her, a new element
9765: of deliberation in her self-estimate which had hitherto been a blissful
9766: gift of intuition. Still it was the recurrent burden of her inward
9767: soliloquy that Klesmer had seen but little of her, and any unfavorable
9768: conclusion of his must have too narrow a foundation. She really felt
9769: clever enough for anything.
9770: 
9771: To fill up the time she collected her volumes and pieces of music, and
9772: laying them on the top of the piano, set herself to classify them. Then
9773: catching the reflection of her movements in the glass panel, she was
9774: diverted to the contemplation of the image there and walked toward it.
9775: Dressed in black, without a single ornament, and with the warm
9776: whiteness of her skin set off between her light-brown coronet of hair
9777: and her square-cut bodice, she might have tempted an artist to try
9778: again the Roman trick of a statue in black, white, and tawny marble.
9779: Seeing her image slowly advancing, she thought “I _am_ beautiful”—not
9780: exultingly, but with grave decision. Being beautiful was after all the
9781: condition on which she most needed external testimony. If any one
9782: objected to the turn of her nose or the form of her neck and chin, she
9783: had not the sense that she could presently show her power of attainment
9784: in these branches of feminine perfection.
9785: 
9786: There was not much time to fill up in this way before the sound of
9787: wheels, the loud ring, and the opening doors assured her that she was
9788: not by any accident to be disappointed. This slightly increased her
9789: inward flutter. In spite of her self-confidence, she dreaded Klesmer as
9790: part of that unmanageable world which was independent of her
9791: wishes—something vitriolic that would not cease to burn because you
9792: smiled or frowned at it. Poor thing! she was at a higher crisis of her
9793: woman’s fate than in her last experience with Grandcourt. The
9794: questioning then, was whether she should take a particular man as a
9795: husband. The inmost fold of her questioning now was whether she need
9796: take a husband at all—whether she could not achieve substantially for
9797: herself and know gratified ambition without bondage.
9798: 
9799: Klesmer made his most deferential bow in the wide doorway of the
9800: antechamber—showing also the deference of the finest gray kerseymere
9801: trousers and perfect gloves (the ‘masters of those who know’ are
9802: happily altogether human). Gwendolen met him with unusual gravity, and
9803: holding out her hand said, “It is most kind of you to come, Herr
9804: Klesmer. I hope you have not thought me presumptuous.”
9805: 
9806: “I took your wish as a command that did me honor,” said Klesmer, with
9807: answering gravity. He was really putting by his own affairs in order to
9808: give his utmost attention to what Gwendolen might have to say; but his
9809: temperament was still in a state of excitation from the events of
9810: yesterday, likely enough to give his expressions a more than usually
9811: biting edge.
9812: 
9813: Gwendolen for once was under too great a strain of feeling to remember
9814: formalities. She continued standing near the piano, and Klesmer took
9815: his stand near the other end of it with his back to the light and his
9816: terribly omniscient eyes upon her. No affectation was of use, and she
9817: began without delay.
9818: 
9819: “I wish to consult you, Herr Klesmer. We have lost all our fortune; we
9820: have nothing. I must get my own bread, and I desire to provide for my
9821: mamma, so as to save her from any hardship. The only way I can think
9822: of—and I should like it better than anything—is to be an actress—to
9823: go on the stage. But, of course, I should like to take a high position,
9824: and I thought—if you thought I could”—here Gwendolen became a little
9825: more nervous—“it would be better for me to be a singer—to study
9826: singing also.”
9827: 
9828: Klesmer put down his hat upon the piano, and folded his arms as if to
9829: concentrate himself.
9830: 
9831: “I know,” Gwendolen resumed, turning from pale to pink and back
9832: again—“I know that my method of singing is very defective; but I have
9833: been ill taught. I could be better taught; I could study. And you will
9834: understand my wish:—to sing and act too, like Grisi, is a much higher
9835: position. Naturally, I should wish to take as high rank as I can. And I
9836: can rely on your judgment. I am sure you will tell me the truth.”
9837: 
9838: Gwendolen somehow had the conviction that now she made this serious
9839: appeal the truth would be favorable.
9840: 
9841: Still Klesmer did not speak. He drew off his gloves quickly, tossed
9842: them into his hat, rested his hands on his hips, and walked to the
9843: other end of the room. He was filled with compassion for this girl: he
9844: wanted to put a guard on his speech. When he turned again, he looked at
9845: her with a mild frown of inquiry, and said with gentle though quick
9846: utterance, “You have never seen anything, I think, of artists and their
9847: lives?—I mean of musicians, actors, artists of that kind?”
9848: 
9849: “Oh, no,” said Gwendolen, not perturbed by a reference to this obvious
9850: fact in the history of a young lady hitherto well provided for.
9851: 
9852: “You are—pardon me,” said Klesmer, again pausing near the piano—“in
9853: coming to a conclusion on such a matter as this, everything must be
9854: taken into consideration—you are perhaps twenty?”
9855: 
9856: “I am twenty-one,” said Gwendolen, a slight fear rising in her. “Do you
9857: think I am too old?”
9858: 
9859: Klesmer pouted his under lip and shook his long fingers upward in a
9860: manner totally enigmatic.
9861: 
9862: “Many persons begin later than others,” said Gwendolen, betrayed by her
9863: habitual consciousness of having valuable information to bestow.
9864: 
9865: Klesmer took no notice, but said with more studied gentleness than
9866: ever, “You have probably not thought of an artistic career until now:
9867: you did not entertain the notion, the longing—what shall I say?—you
9868: did not wish yourself an actress, or anything of that sort, till the
9869: present trouble?”
9870: 
9871: “Not exactly: but I was fond of acting. I have acted; you saw me, if
9872: you remember—you saw me here in charades, and as Hermione,” said
9873: Gwendolen, really fearing that Klesmer had forgotten.
9874: 
9875: “Yes, yes,” he answered quickly, “I remember—I remember perfectly,”
9876: and again walked to the other end of the room. It was difficult for him
9877: to refrain from this kind of movement when he was in any argument
9878: either audible or silent.
9879: 
9880: Gwendolen felt that she was being weighed. The delay was unpleasant.
9881: But she did not yet conceive that the scale could dip on the wrong
9882: side, and it seemed to her only graceful to say, “I shall be very much
9883: obliged to you for taking the trouble to give me your advice, whatever
9884: it maybe.”
9885: 
9886: “Miss Harleth,” said Klesmer, turning toward her and speaking with a
9887: slight increase of accent, “I will veil nothing from you in this
9888: matter. I should reckon myself guilty if I put a false visage on
9889: things—made them too black or too white. The gods have a curse for him
9890: who willingly tells another the wrong road. And if I misled one who is
9891: so young, so beautiful—who, I trust, will find her happiness along the
9892: right road, I should regard myself as a—_Bösewicht_.” In the last word
9893: Klesmer’s voice had dropped to a loud whisper.
9894: 
9895: Gwendolen felt a sinking of heart under this unexpected solemnity, and
9896: kept a sort of fascinated gaze on Klesmer’s face, as he went on.
9897: 
9898: “You are a beautiful young lady—you have been brought up in ease—you
9899: have done what you would—you have not said to yourself, ‘I must know
9900: this exactly,’ ‘I must understand this exactly,’ ‘I must do this
9901: exactly,’”—in uttering these three terrible _musts_, Klesmer lifted up
9902: three long fingers in succession. “In sum, you have not been called
9903: upon to be anything but a charming young lady, whom it is an
9904: impoliteness to find fault with.”
9905: 
9906: He paused an instant; then resting his fingers on his hips again, and
9907: thrusting out his powerful chin, he said,
9908: 
9909: “Well, then, with that preparation, you wish to try the life of an
9910: artist; you wish to try a life of arduous, unceasing work,
9911: and—uncertain praise. Your praise would have to be earned, like your
9912: bread; and both would come slowly, scantily—what do I say?—they may
9913: hardly come at all.”
9914: 
9915: This tone of discouragement, which Klesmer had hoped might suffice
9916: without anything more unpleasant, roused some resistance in Gwendolen.
9917: With a slight turn of her head away from him, and an air of pique, she
9918: said,
9919: 
9920: “I thought that you, being an artist, would consider the life one of
9921: the most honorable and delightful. And if I can do nothing better?—I
9922: suppose I can put up with the same risks as other people do.”
9923: 
9924: “Do nothing better?” said Klesmer, a little fired. “No, my dear Miss
9925: Harleth, you could do nothing better—neither man nor woman could do
9926: anything better—if you could do what was best or good of its kind. I
9927: am not decrying the life of the true artist. I am exalting it. I say,
9928: it is out of the reach of any but choice organizations—natures framed
9929: to love perfection and to labor for it; ready, like all true lovers, to
9930: endure, to wait, to say, I am not yet worthy, but she—Art, my
9931: mistress—is worthy, and I will live to merit her. An honorable life?
9932: Yes. But the honor comes from the inward vocation and the hard-won
9933: achievement: there is no honor in donning the life as a livery.”
9934: 
9935: Some excitement of yesterday had revived in Klesmer and hurried him
9936: into speech a little aloof from his immediate friendly purpose. He had
9937: wished as delicately as possible to rouse in Gwendolen a sense of her
9938: unfitness for a perilous, difficult course; but it was his wont to be
9939: angry with the pretensions of incompetence, and he was in danger of
9940: getting chafed. Conscious of this, he paused suddenly. But Gwendolen’s
9941: chief impression was that he had not yet denied her the power of doing
9942: what would be good of its kind. Klesmer’s fervor seemed to be a sort of
9943: glamor such as he was prone to throw over things in general; and what
9944: she desired to assure him of was that she was not afraid of some
9945: preliminary hardships. The belief that to present herself in public on
9946: the stage must produce an effect such as she had been used to feel
9947: certain of in private life, was like a bit of her flesh—it was not to
9948: be peeled off readily, but must come with blood and pain. She said, in
9949: a tone of some insistence;
9950: 
9951: “I am quite prepared to bear hardships at first. Of course no one can
9952: become celebrated all at once. And it is not necessary that every one
9953: should be first-rate—either actresses or singers. If you would be so
9954: kind as to tell me what steps I should take, I shall have the courage
9955: to take them. I don’t mind going up hill. It will be easier than the
9956: dead level of being a governess. I will take any steps you recommend.”
9957: 
9958: Klesmer was convinced now that he must speak plainly.
9959: 
9960: “I will tell you the steps, not that I recommend, but that will be
9961: forced upon you. It is all one, so far, what your goal will
9962: be—excellence, celebrity, second, third rateness—it is all one. You
9963: must go to town under the protection of your mother. You must put
9964: yourself under training—musical, dramatic, theatrical:—whatever you
9965: desire to do you have to learn”—here Gwendolen looked as if she were
9966: going to speak, but Klesmer lifted up his hand and said, decisively, “I
9967: know. You have exercised your talents—you recite—you sing—from the
9968: drawing-room _Standpunkt_. My dear Fräulein, you must unlearn all that.
9969: You have not yet conceived what excellence is: you must unlearn your
9970: mistaken admirations. You must know what you have to strive for, and
9971: then you must subdue your mind and body to unbroken discipline. Your
9972: mind, I say. For you must not be thinking of celebrity: put that candle
9973: out of your eyes, and look only at excellence. You would of course earn
9974: nothing—you could get no engagement for a long while. You would need
9975: money for yourself and your family. But that,” here Klesmer frowned and
9976: shook his fingers as if to dismiss a triviality, “that could perhaps be
9977: found.”
9978: 
9979: Gwendolen turned pink and pale during this speech. Her pride had felt a
9980: terrible knife-edge, and the last sentence only made the smart keener.
9981: She was conscious of appearing moved, and tried to escape from her
9982: weakness by suddenly walking to a seat and pointing out a chair to
9983: Klesmer. He did not take it, but turned a little in order to face her
9984: and leaned against the piano. At that moment she wished that she had
9985: not sent for him: this first experience of being taken on some other
9986: ground than that of her social rank and her beauty was becoming bitter
9987: to her. Klesmer, preoccupied with a serious purpose, went on without
9988: change of tone.
9989: 
9990: “Now, what sort of issue might be fairly expected from all this
9991: self-denial? You would ask that. It is right that your eyes should be
9992: open to it. I will tell you truthfully. This issue would be uncertain,
9993: and, most probably, would not be worth much.”
9994: 
9995: At these relentless words Klesmer put out his lip and looked through
9996: his spectacles with the air of a monster impenetrable by beauty.
9997: 
9998: Gwendolen’s eyes began to burn, but the dread of showing weakness urged
9999: her to added self-control. She compelled herself to say, in a hard
10000: tone,
10001: 
10002: “You think I want talent, or am too old to begin.”
10003: 
10004: Klesmer made a sort of hum, and then descended on an emphatic “Yes! The
10005: desire and the training should have begun seven years ago—or a good
10006: deal earlier. A mountebank’s child who helps her father to earn
10007: shillings when she is six years old—a child that inherits a singing
10008: throat from a long line of choristers and learns to sing as it learns
10009: to talk, has a likelier beginning. Any great achievement in acting or
10010: in music grows with the growth. Whenever an artist has been able to
10011: say, ‘I came, I saw, I conquered,’ it has been at the end of patient
10012: practice. Genius at first is little more than a great capacity for
10013: receiving discipline. Singing and acting, like the fine dexterity of
10014: the juggler with his cups and balls, require a shaping of the organs
10015: toward a finer and finer certainty of effect. Your muscles—your whole
10016: frame—must go like a watch, true, true to a hair. That is the work of
10017: spring-time, before habits have been determined.”
10018: 
10019: “I did not pretend to genius,” said Gwendolen, still feeling that she
10020: might somehow do what Klesmer wanted to represent as impossible. “I
10021: only suppose that I might have a little talent—enough to improve.”
10022: 
10023: “I don’t deny that,” said Klesmer. “If you had been put in the right
10024: track some years ago and had worked well you might now have made a
10025: public singer, though I don’t think your voice would have counted for
10026: much in public. For the stage your personal charms and intelligence
10027: might then have told without the present drawback of inexperience—lack
10028: of discipline—lack of instruction.”
10029: 
10030: Certainly Klesmer seemed cruel, but his feeling was the reverse of
10031: cruel. Our speech, even when we are most single-minded, can never take
10032: its line absolutely from one impulse; but Klesmer’s was, as far as
10033: possible, directed by compassion for poor Gwendolen’s ignorant
10034: eagerness to enter on a course of which he saw all the miserable
10035: details with a definiteness which he could not if he would have
10036: conveyed to her mind.
10037: 
10038: Gwendolen, however, was not convinced. Her self-opinion rallied, and
10039: since the counselor whom she had called in gave a decision of such
10040: severe peremptoriness, she was tempted to think that his judgment was
10041: not only fallible but biased. It occurred to her that a simpler and
10042: wiser step for her to have taken would have been to send a letter
10043: through the post to the manager of a London theatre, asking him to make
10044: an appointment. She would make no further reference to her singing;
10045: Klesmer, she saw, had set himself against her singing. But she felt
10046: equal to arguing with him about her going on the stage, and she
10047: answered in a resistant tone,
10048: 
10049: “I understood, of course, that no one can be a finished actress at
10050: once. It may be impossible to tell beforehand whether I should succeed;
10051: but that seems to me a reason why I should try. I should have thought
10052: that I might have taken an engagement at a theatre meanwhile, so as to
10053: earn money and study at the same time.”
10054: 
10055: “Can’t be done, my dear Miss Harleth—I speak plainly—it can’t be
10056: done. I must clear your mind of these notions which have no more
10057: resemblance to reality than a pantomime. Ladies and gentlemen think
10058: that when they have made their toilet and drawn on their gloves they
10059: are as presentable on the stage as in a drawing-room. No manager thinks
10060: that. With all your grace and charm, if you were to present yourself as
10061: an aspirant to the stage, a manager would either require you to pay as
10062: an amateur for being allowed to perform or he would tell you to go and
10063: be taught—trained to bear yourself on the stage, as a horse, however
10064: beautiful, must be trained for the circus; to say nothing of that study
10065: which would enable you to personate a character consistently, and
10066: animate it with the natural language of face, gesture, and tone. For
10067: you to get an engagement fit for you straight away is out of the
10068: question.”
10069: 
10070: “I really cannot understand that,” said Gwendolen, rather
10071: haughtily—then, checking herself, she added in another tone—“I shall
10072: be obliged to you if you will explain how it is that such poor
10073: actresses get engaged. I have been to the theatre several times, and I
10074: am sure there were actresses who seemed to me to act not at all well
10075: and who were quite plain.”
10076: 
10077: “Ah, my dear Miss Harleth, that is the easy criticism of the buyer. We
10078: who buy slippers toss away this pair and the other as clumsy; but there
10079: went an apprenticeship to the making of them. Excuse me; you could not
10080: at present teach one of those actresses; but there is certainly much
10081: that she could teach you. For example, she can pitch her voice so as to
10082: be heard: ten to one you could not do it till after many trials. Merely
10083: to stand and move on the stage is an art—requires practice. It is
10084: understood that we are not now talking of a _comparse_ in a petty
10085: theatre who earns the wages of a needle-woman. That is out of the
10086: question for you.”
10087: 
10088: “Of course I must earn more than that,” said Gwendolen, with a sense of
10089: wincing rather than of being refuted, “but I think I could soon learn
10090: to do tolerably well all those little things you have mentioned. I am
10091: not so very stupid. And even in Paris, I am sure, I saw two actresses
10092: playing important ladies’ parts who were not at all ladies and quite
10093: ugly. I suppose I have no particular talent, but I _must_ think it is
10094: an advantage, even on the stage, to be a lady and not a perfect fright.”
10095: 
10096: “Ah, let us understand each other,” said Klesmer, with a flash of new
10097: meaning. “I was speaking of what you would have to go through if you
10098: aimed at becoming a real artist—if you took music and the drama as a
10099: higher vocation in which you would strive after excellence. On that
10100: head, what I have said stands fast. You would find—after your
10101: education in doing things slackly for one-and-twenty years—great
10102: difficulties in study; you would find mortifications in the treatment
10103: you would get when you presented yourself on the footing of skill. You
10104: would be subjected to tests; people would no longer feign not to see
10105: your blunders. You would at first only be accepted on trial. You would
10106: have to bear what I may call a glaring insignificance: any success must
10107: be won by the utmost patience. You would have to keep your place in a
10108: crowd, and after all it is likely you would lose it and get out of
10109: sight. If you determine to face these hardships and still try, you will
10110: have the dignity of a high purpose, even though you may have chosen
10111: unfortunately. You will have some merit, though you may win no prize.
10112: You have asked my judgment on your chances of winning. I don’t pretend
10113: to speak absolutely; but measuring probabilities, my judgment is:—you
10114: will hardly achieve more than mediocrity.”
10115: 
10116: Klesmer had delivered himself with emphatic rapidity, and now paused a
10117: moment. Gwendolen was motionless, looking at her hands, which lay over
10118: each other on her lap, till the deep-toned, long-drawn “_But_,” with
10119: which he resumed, had a startling effect, and made her look at him
10120: again.
10121: 
10122: “But—there are certainly other ideas, other dispositions with which a
10123: young lady may take up an art that will bring her before the public.
10124: She may rely on the unquestioned power of her beauty as a passport. She
10125: may desire to exhibit herself to an admiration which dispenses with
10126: skill. This goes a certain way on the stage: not in music: but on the
10127: stage, beauty is taken when there is nothing more commanding to be had.
10128: Not without some drilling, however: as I have said before,
10129: technicalities have in any case to be mastered. But these excepted, we
10130: have here nothing to do with art. The woman who takes up this career is
10131: not an artist: she is usually one who thinks of entering on a luxurious
10132: life by a short and easy road—perhaps by marriage—that is her most
10133: brilliant chance, and the rarest. Still, her career will not be
10134: luxurious to begin with: she can hardly earn her own poor bread
10135: independently at once, and the indignities she will be liable to are
10136: such as I will not speak of.”
10137: 
10138: “I desire to be independent,” said Gwendolen, deeply stung and
10139: confusedly apprehending some scorn for herself in Klesmer’s words.
10140: “That was my reason for asking whether I could not get an immediate
10141: engagement. Of course I cannot know how things go on about theatres.
10142: But I thought that I could have made myself independent. I have no
10143: money, and I will not accept help from any one.”
10144: 
10145: Her wounded pride could not rest without making this disclaimer. It was
10146: intolerable to her that Klesmer should imagine her to have expected
10147: other help from him than advice.
10148: 
10149: “That is a hard saying for your friends,” said Klesmer, recovering the
10150: gentleness of tone with which he had begun the conversation. “I have
10151: given you pain. That was inevitable. I was bound to put the truth, the
10152: unvarnished truth, before you. I have not said—I will not say—you
10153: will do wrong to choose the hard, climbing path of an endeavoring
10154: artist. You have to compare its difficulties with those of any less
10155: hazardous—any more private course which opens itself to you. If you
10156: take that more courageous resolve I will ask leave to shake hands with
10157: you on the strength of our freemasonry, where we are all vowed to the
10158: service of art, and to serve her by helping every fellow-servant.”
10159: 
10160: Gwendolen was silent, again looking at her hands. She felt herself very
10161: far away from taking the resolve that would enforce acceptance; and
10162: after waiting an instant or two, Klesmer went on with deepened
10163: seriousness.
10164: 
10165: “Where there is the duty of service there must be the duty of accepting
10166: it. The question is not one of personal obligation. And in relation to
10167: practical matters immediately affecting your future—excuse my
10168: permitting myself to mention in confidence an affair of my own. I am
10169: expecting an event which would make it easy for me to exert myself on
10170: your behalf in furthering your opportunities of instruction and
10171: residence in London—under the care, that is, of your family—without
10172: need for anxiety on your part. If you resolve to take art as a
10173: bread-study, you need only undertake the study at first; the bread will
10174: be found without trouble. The event I mean is my marriage—in fact—you
10175: will receive this as a matter of confidence—my marriage with Miss
10176: Arrowpoint, which will more than double such right as I have to be
10177: trusted by you as a friend. Your friendship will have greatly risen in
10178: value for _her_ by your having adopted that generous labor.”
10179: 
10180: Gwendolen’s face had begun to burn. That Klesmer was about to marry
10181: Miss Arrowpoint caused her no surprise, and at another moment she would
10182: have amused herself in quickly imagining the scenes that must have
10183: occurred at Quetcham. But what engrossed her feeling, what filled her
10184: imagination now, was the panorama of her own immediate future that
10185: Klesmer’s words seemed to have unfolded. The suggestion of Miss
10186: Arrowpoint as a patroness was only another detail added to its
10187: repulsiveness: Klesmer’s proposal to help her seemed an additional
10188: irritation after the humiliating judgment he had passed on her
10189: capabilities. His words had really bitten into her self-confidence and
10190: turned it into the pain of a bleeding wound; and the idea of presenting
10191: herself before other judges was now poisoned with the dread that they
10192: also might be harsh; they also would not recognize the talent she was
10193: conscious of. But she controlled herself, and rose from her seat before
10194: she made any answer. It seemed natural that she should pause. She went
10195: to the piano and looked absently at leaves of music, pinching up the
10196: corners. At last she turned toward Klesmer and said, with almost her
10197: usual air of proud equality, which in this interview had not been
10198: hitherto perceptible.
10199: 
10200: “I congratulate you sincerely, Herr Klesmer. I think I never saw any
10201: one so admirable as Miss Arrowpoint. And I have to thank you for every
10202: sort of kindness this morning. But I can’t decide now. If I make the
10203: resolve you have spoken of, I will use your permission—I will let you
10204: know. But I fear the obstacles are too great. In any case, I am deeply
10205: obliged to you. It was very bold of me to ask you to take this trouble.”
10206: 
10207: Klesmer’s inward remark was, “She will never let me know.” But with the
10208: most thorough respect in his manner, he said, “Command me at any time.
10209: There is an address on this card which will always find me with little
10210: delay.”
10211: 
10212: When he had taken up his hat and was going to make his bow, Gwendolen’s
10213: better self, conscious of an ingratitude which the clear-seeing Klesmer
10214: must have penetrated, made a desperate effort to find its way above the
10215: stifling layers of egoistic disappointment and irritation. Looking at
10216: him with a glance of the old gayety, she put out her hand, and said
10217: with a smile, “If I take the wrong road, it will not be because of your
10218: flattery.”
10219: 
10220: “God forbid that you should take any road but one where you will find
10221: and give happiness!” said Klesmer, fervently. Then, in foreign fashion,
10222: he touched her fingers lightly with his lips, and in another minute she
10223: heard the sound of his departing wheels getting more distant on the
10224: gravel.
10225: 
10226: Gwendolen had never in her life felt so miserable. No sob came, no
10227: passion of tears, to relieve her. Her eyes were burning; and the
10228: noonday only brought into more dreary clearness the absence of interest
10229: from her life. All memories, all objects, the pieces of music
10230: displayed, the open piano—the very reflection of herself in the
10231: glass—seemed no better than the packed-up shows of a departing fair.
10232: For the first time since her consciousness began, she was having a
10233: vision of herself on the common level, and had lost the innate sense
10234: that there were reasons why she should not be slighted, elbowed,
10235: jostled—treated like a passenger with a third-class ticket, in spite
10236: of private objections on her own part. She did not move about; the
10237: prospects begotten by disappointment were too oppressively
10238: preoccupying; she threw herself into the shadiest corner of a settee,
10239: and pressed her fingers over her burning eyelids. Every word that
10240: Klesmer had said seemed to have been branded into her memory, as most
10241: words are which bring with them a new set of impressions and make an
10242: epoch for us. Only a few hours before, the dawning smile of
10243: self-contentment rested on her lips as she vaguely imagined a future
10244: suited to her wishes: it seemed but the affair of a year or so for her
10245: to become the most approved Juliet of the time: or, if Klesmer
10246: encouraged her idea of being a singer, to proceed by more gradual steps
10247: to her place in the opera, while she won money and applause by
10248: occasional performances. Why not? At home, at school, among
10249: acquaintances, she had been used to have her conscious superiority
10250: admitted; and she had moved in a society where everything, from low
10251: arithmetic to high art, is of the amateur kind, politely supposed to
10252: fall short of perfection only because gentlemen and ladies are not
10253: obliged to do more than they like—otherwise they would probably give
10254: forth abler writings, and show themselves more commanding artists than
10255: any the world is at present obliged to put up with. The self-confident
10256: visions that had beguiled her were not of a highly exceptional kind;
10257: and she had at least shown some rationality in consulting the person
10258: who knew the most and had flattered her the least. In asking Klesmer’s
10259: advice, however, she had rather been borne up by a belief in his latent
10260: admiration than bent on knowing anything more unfavorable that might
10261: have lain behind his slight objections to her singing; and the truth
10262: she had asked for, with an expectation that it would be agreeable, had
10263: come like a lacerating thong.
10264: 
10265: “Too old—should have begun seven years ago—you will not, at best,
10266: achieve more than mediocrity—hard, incessant work, uncertain
10267: praise—bread coming slowly, scantily, perhaps not at
10268: all—mortifications, people no longer feigning not to see your
10269: blunders—glaring insignificance”—all these phrases rankled in her;
10270: and even more galling was the hint that she could only be accepted on
10271: the stage as a beauty who hoped to get a husband. The “indignities”
10272: that she might be visited with had no very definite form for her, but
10273: the mere association of anything called “indignity” with herself,
10274: roused a resentful alarm. And along with the vaguer images which were
10275: raised by those biting words, came the precise conception of
10276: disagreeables which her experience enabled her to imagine. How could
10277: she take her mamma and the four sisters to London, if it were not
10278: possible for her to earn money at once? And as for submitting to be a
10279: _protégée_, and asking her mamma to submit with her to the humiliation
10280: of being supported by Miss Arrowpoint—that was as bad as being a
10281: governess; nay, worse; for suppose the end of all her study to be as
10282: worthless as Klesmer clearly expected it to be, the sense of favors
10283: received and never repaid, would embitter the miseries of
10284: disappointment. Klesmer doubtless had magnificent ideas about helping
10285: artists; but how could he know the feelings of ladies in such matters?
10286: It was all over: she had entertained a mistaken hope; and there was an
10287: end of it.
10288: 
10289: “An end of it!” said Gwendolen, aloud, starting from her seat as she
10290: heard the steps and voices of her mamma and sisters coming in from
10291: church. She hurried to the piano and began gathering together her
10292: pieces of music with assumed diligence, while the expression on her
10293: pale face and in her burning eyes was what would have suited a woman
10294: enduring a wrong which she might not resent, but would probably revenge.
10295: 
10296: “Well, my darling,” said gentle Mrs. Davilow, entering, “I see by the
10297: wheel-marks that Klesmer has been here. Have you been satisfied with
10298: the interview?” She had some guesses as to its object, but felt timid
10299: about implying them.
10300: 
10301: “Satisfied, mamma? oh, yes,” said Gwendolen, in a high, hard tone, for
10302: which she must be excused, because she dreaded a scene of emotion. If
10303: she did not set herself resolutely to feign proud indifference, she
10304: felt that she must fall into a passionate outburst of despair, which
10305: would cut her mamma more deeply than all the rest of their calamities.
10306: 
10307: “Your uncle and aunt were disappointed at not seeing you,” said Mrs.
10308: Davilow, coming near the piano, and watching Gwendolen’s movements. “I
10309: only said that you wanted rest.”
10310: 
10311: “Quite right, mamma,” said Gwendolen, in the same tone, turning to put
10312: away some music.
10313: 
10314: “Am I not to know anything now, Gwendolen? Am I always to be in the
10315: dark?” said Mrs. Davilow, too keenly sensitive to her daughter’s manner
10316: and expression not to fear that something painful had occurred.
10317: 
10318: “There is really nothing to tell now, mamma,” said Gwendolen, in a
10319: still higher voice. “I had a mistaken idea about something I could do.
10320: Herr Klesmer has undeceived me. That is all.”
10321: 
10322: “Don’t look and speak in that way, my dear child: I cannot bear it,”
10323: said Mrs. Davilow, breaking down. She felt an undefinable terror.
10324: 
10325: Gwendolen looked at her a moment in silence, biting her inner lip; then
10326: she went up to her, and putting her hands on her mamma’s shoulders,
10327: said, with a drop in her voice to the lowest undertone, “Mamma, don’t
10328: speak to me now. It is useless to cry and waste our strength over what
10329: can’t be altered. You will live at Sawyer’s Cottage, and I am going to
10330: the bishop’s daughters. There is no more to be said. Things cannot be
10331: altered, and who cares? It makes no difference to any one else what we
10332: do. We must try not to care ourselves. We must not give way. I dread
10333: giving way. Help me to be quiet.”
10334: 
10335: Mrs. Davilow was like a frightened child under her daughter’s face and
10336: voice; her tears were arrested and she went away in silence.
10337: 
10338: 
10339: 
10340: 
10341: CHAPTER XXIV.
10342: 
10343:   “I question things but do not find
10344:   One that will answer to my mind:
10345:   And all the world appears unkind.”
10346:                             —WORDSWORTH.
10347: 
10348: 
10349: Gwendolen was glad that she had got through her interview with Klesmer
10350: before meeting her uncle and aunt. She had made up her mind now that
10351: there were only disagreeables before her, and she felt able to maintain
10352: a dogged calm in the face of any humiliation that might be proposed.
10353: 
10354: The meeting did not happen until the Monday, when Gwendolen went to the
10355: rectory with her mamma. They had called at Sawyer’s Cottage by the way,
10356: and had seen every cranny of the narrow rooms in a midday light,
10357: unsoftened by blinds and curtains; for the furnishing to be done by
10358: gleanings from the rectory had not yet begun.
10359: 
10360: “How _shall_ you endure it, mamma?” said Gwendolen, as they walked
10361: away. She had not opened her lips while they were looking round at the
10362: bare walls and floors, and the little garden with the cabbage-stalks,
10363: and the yew arbor all dust and cobwebs within. “You and the four girls
10364: all in that closet of a room, with the green and yellow paper pressing
10365: on your eyes? And without me?”
10366: 
10367: “It will be some comfort that you have not to bear it too, dear.”
10368: 
10369: “If it were not that I must get some money, I would rather be there
10370: than go to be a governess.”
10371: 
10372: “Don’t set yourself against it beforehand, Gwendolen. If you go to the
10373: palace you will have every luxury about you. And you know how much you
10374: have always cared for that. You will not find it so hard as going up
10375: and down those steep narrow stairs, and hearing the crockery rattle
10376: through the house, and the dear girls talking.”
10377: 
10378: “It is like a bad dream,” said Gwendolen, impetuously. “I cannot
10379: believe that my uncle will let you go to such a place. He ought to have
10380: taken some other steps.”
10381: 
10382: “Don’t be unreasonable, dear child. What could he have done?”
10383: 
10384: “That was for him to find out. It seems to me a very extraordinary
10385: world if people in our position must sink in this way all at once,”
10386: said Gwendolen, the other worlds with which she was conversant being
10387: constructed with a sense of fitness that arranged her own future
10388: agreeably.
10389: 
10390: It was her temper that framed her sentences under this entirely new
10391: pressure of evils: she could have spoken more suitably on the
10392: vicissitudes in other people’s lives, though it was never her
10393: aspiration to express herself virtuously so much as cleverly—a point
10394: to be remembered in extenuation of her words, which were usually worse
10395: than she was.
10396: 
10397: And, notwithstanding the keen sense of her own bruises, she was capable
10398: of some compunction when her uncle and aunt received her with a more
10399: affectionate kindness than they had ever shown before. She could not
10400: but be struck by the dignified cheerfulness with which they talked of
10401: the necessary economies in their way of living, and in the education of
10402: the boys. Mr. Gascoigne’s worth of character, a little obscured by
10403: worldly opportunities—as the poetic beauty of women is obscured by the
10404: demands of fashionable dressing—showed itself to great advantage under
10405: this sudden reduction of fortune. Prompt and methodical, he had set
10406: himself not only to put down his carriage, but to reconsider his worn
10407: suits of clothes, to leave off meat for breakfast, to do without
10408: periodicals, to get Edwy from school and arrange hours of study for all
10409: the boys under himself, and to order the whole establishment on the
10410: sparest footing possible. For all healthy people economy has its
10411: pleasures; and the rector’s spirit had spread through the household.
10412: Mrs. Gascoigne and Anna, who always made papa their model, really did
10413: not miss anything they cared about for themselves, and in all sincerity
10414: felt that the saddest part of the family losses was the change for Mrs.
10415: Davilow and her children.
10416: 
10417: Anna for the first time could merge her resentment on behalf of Rex in
10418: her sympathy with Gwendolen; and Mrs. Gascoigne was disposed to hope
10419: that trouble would have a salutary effect on her niece, without
10420: thinking it her duty to add any bitters by way of increasing the
10421: salutariness. They had both been busy devising how to get blinds and
10422: curtains for the cottage out of the household stores; but with delicate
10423: feeling they left these matters in the background, and talked at first
10424: of Gwendolen’s journey, and the comfort it was to her mamma to have her
10425: at home again.
10426: 
10427: In fact there was nothing for Gwendolen to take as a justification for
10428: extending her discontent with events to the persons immediately around
10429: her, and she felt shaken into a more alert attention, as if by a call
10430: to drill that everybody else was obeying, when her uncle began in a
10431: voice of firm kindness to talk to her of the efforts he had been making
10432: to get her a situation which would offer her as many advantages as
10433: possible. Mr. Gascoigne had not forgotten Grandcourt, but the
10434: possibility of further advances from that quarter was something too
10435: vague for a man of his good sense to be determined by it: uncertainties
10436: of that kind must not now slacken his action in doing the best he could
10437: for his niece under actual conditions.
10438: 
10439: “I felt that there was no time to be lost, Gwendolen; for a position in
10440: a good family where you will have some consideration is not to be had
10441: at a moment’s notice. And however long we waited we could hardly find
10442: one where you would be better off than at Bishop Mompert’s. I am known
10443: to both him and Mrs. Mompert, and that of course is an advantage to
10444: you. Our correspondence has gone on favorably; but I cannot be
10445: surprised that Mrs. Mompert wishes to see you before making an absolute
10446: engagement. She thinks of arranging for you to meet her at Wanchester
10447: when she is on her way to town. I dare say you will feel the interview
10448: rather trying for you, my dear; but you will have a little time to
10449: prepare your mind.”
10450: 
10451: “Do you know _why_ she wants to see me, uncle?” said Gwendolen, whose
10452: mind had quickly gone over various reasons that an imaginary Mrs.
10453: Mompert with three daughters might be supposed to entertain, reasons
10454: all of a disagreeable kind to the person presenting herself for
10455: inspection.
10456: 
10457: The rector smiled. “Don’t be alarmed, my dear. She would like to have a
10458: more precise idea of you than my report can give. And a mother is
10459: naturally scrupulous about a companion for her daughters. I have told
10460: her you are very young. But she herself exercises a close supervision
10461: over her daughters’ education, and that makes her less anxious as to
10462: age. She is a woman of taste and also of strict principle, and objects
10463: to having a French person in the house. I feel sure that she will think
10464: your manners and accomplishments as good as she is likely to find; and
10465: over the religious and moral tone of the education she, and indeed the
10466: bishop himself, will preside.”
10467: 
10468: Gwendolen dared not answer, but the repression of her decided dislike
10469: to the whole prospect sent an unusually deep flush over her face and
10470: neck, subsiding as quickly as it came. Anna, full of tender fears, put
10471: her little hand into her cousin’s, and Mr. Gascoigne was too kind a man
10472: not to conceive something of the trial which this sudden change must be
10473: for a girl like Gwendolen. Bent on giving a cheerful view of things, he
10474: went on, in an easy tone of remark, not as if answering supposed
10475: objections,
10476: 
10477: “I think so highly of the position, that I should have been tempted to
10478: try and get it for Anna, if she had been at all likely to meet Mrs.
10479: Mompert’s wants. It is really a home, with a continuance of education
10480: in the highest sense: ‘governess’ is a misnomer. The bishop’s views are
10481: of a more decidedly Low Church color than my own—he is a close friend
10482: of Lord Grampian’s; but, though privately strict, he is not by any
10483: means narrow in public matters. Indeed, he has created as little
10484: dislike in his diocese as any bishop on the bench. He has always
10485: remained friendly to me, though before his promotion, when he was an
10486: incumbent of this diocese, we had a little controversy about the Bible
10487: Society.”
10488: 
10489: The rector’s words were too pregnant with satisfactory meaning to
10490: himself for him to imagine the effect they produced in the mind of his
10491: niece. “Continuance of education”—“bishop’s views”—“privately
10492: strict”—“Bible Society,”—it was as if he had introduced a few snakes
10493: at large for the instruction of ladies who regarded them as all alike
10494: furnished with poison-bags, and, biting or stinging, according to
10495: convenience. To Gwendolen, already shrinking from the prospect open to
10496: her, such phrases came like the growing heat of a burning glass—not at
10497: all as the links of persuasive reflection which they formed for the
10498: good uncle. She began, desperately, to seek an alternative.
10499: 
10500: “There was another situation, I think, mamma spoke of?” she said, with
10501: determined self-mastery.
10502: 
10503: “Yes,” said the rector, in rather a deprecatory tone; “but that is in
10504: a school. I should not have the same satisfaction in your taking that.
10505: It would be much harder work, you are aware, and not so good in any
10506: other respect. Besides, you have not an equal chance of getting it.”
10507: 
10508: “Oh dear no,” said Mrs. Gascoigne, “it would be much harder for you, my
10509: dear—it would be much less appropriate. You might not have a bedroom to
10510: yourself.” And Gwendolen’s memories of school suggested other
10511: particulars which forced her to admit to herself that this alternative
10512: would be no relief. She turned to her uncle again and said, apparently
10513: in acceptance of his ideas,
10514: 
10515: “When is Mrs. Mompert likely to send for me?”
10516: 
10517: “That is rather uncertain, but she has promised not to entertain any
10518: other proposal till she has seen you. She has entered with much feeling
10519: into your position. It will be within the next fortnight, probably. But
10520: I must be off now. I am going to let part of my glebe uncommonly well.”
10521: 
10522: The rector ended very cheerfully, leaving the room with the
10523: satisfactory conviction that Gwendolen was going to adapt herself to
10524: circumstances like a girl of good sense. Having spoken appropriately,
10525: he naturally supposed that the effects would be appropriate; being
10526: accustomed, as a household and parish authority, to be asked to “speak
10527: to” refractory persons, with the understanding that the measure was
10528: morally coercive.
10529: 
10530: “What a stay Henry is to us all!” said Mrs. Gascoigne, when her husband
10531: had left the room.
10532: 
10533: “He is indeed,” said Mrs. Davilow, cordially. “I think cheerfulness is
10534: a fortune in itself. I wish I had it.”
10535: 
10536: “And Rex is just like him,” said Mrs. Gascoigne. “I must tell you the
10537: comfort we have had in a letter from him. I must read you a little
10538: bit,” she added, taking the letter from her pocket, while Anna looked
10539: rather frightened—she did not know why, except that it had been a rule
10540: with her not to mention Rex before Gwendolen.
10541: 
10542: The proud mother ran her eyes over the letter, seeking for sentences to
10543: read aloud. But apparently she had found it sown with what might seem
10544: to be closer allusions than she desired to the recent past, for she
10545: looked up, folding the letter, and saying,
10546: 
10547: “However, he tells us that our trouble has made a man of him; he sees a
10548: reason for any amount of work: he means to get a fellowship, to take
10549: pupils, to set one of his brothers going, to be everything that is most
10550: remarkable. The letter is full of fun—just like him. He says, ‘Tell
10551: mother she has put out an advertisement for a jolly good hard-working
10552: son, in time to hinder me from taking ship; and I offer myself for the
10553: place.’ The letter came on Friday. I never saw my husband so much moved
10554: by anything since Rex was born. It seemed a gain to balance our loss.”
10555: 
10556: This letter, in fact, was what had helped both Mrs. Gascoigne and Anna
10557: to show Gwendolen an unmixed kindliness; and she herself felt very
10558: amiably about it, smiling at Anna, and pinching her chin, as much as to
10559: say, “Nothing is wrong with you now, is it?” She had no gratuitously
10560: ill-natured feeling, or egoistic pleasure in making men miserable. She
10561: only had an intense objection to their making her miserable.
10562: 
10563: But when the talk turned on furniture for the cottage Gwendolen was not
10564: roused to show even a languid interest. She thought that she had done
10565: as much as could be expected of her this morning, and indeed felt at an
10566: heroic pitch in keeping to herself the struggle that was going on
10567: within her. The recoil of her mind from the only definite prospect
10568: allowed her, was stronger than even she had imagined beforehand. The
10569: idea of presenting herself before Mrs. Mompert in the first instance,
10570: to be approved or disapproved, came as pressure on an already painful
10571: bruise; even as a governess, it appeared she was to be tested and was
10572: liable to rejection. After she had done herself the violence to accept
10573: the bishop and his wife, they were still to consider whether they would
10574: accept her; it was at her peril that she was to look, speak, or be
10575: silent. And even when she had entered on her dismal task of
10576: self-constraint in the society of three girls whom she was bound
10577: incessantly to edify, the same process of inspection was to go on:
10578: there was always to be Mrs. Mompert’s supervision; always something or
10579: other would be expected of her to which she had not the slightest
10580: inclination; and perhaps the bishop would examine her on serious
10581: topics. Gwendolen, lately used to the social successes of a handsome
10582: girl, whose lively venturesomeness of talk has the effect of wit, and
10583: who six weeks before would have pitied the dullness of the bishop
10584: rather than have been embarrassed by him, saw the life before her as an
10585: entrance into a penitentiary. Wild thoughts of running away to be an
10586: actress, in spite of Klesmer, came to her with the lure of freedom; but
10587: his words still hung heavily on her soul; they had alarmed her pride
10588: and even her maidenly dignity: dimly she conceived herself getting
10589: amongst vulgar people who would treat her with rude familiarity—odious
10590: men, whose grins and smirks would not be seen through the strong
10591: grating of polite society. Gwendolen’s daring was not in the least that
10592: of the adventuress; the demand to be held a lady was in her very
10593: marrow; and when she had dreamed that she might be the heroine of the
10594: gaming-table, it was with the understanding that no one should treat
10595: her with the less consideration, or presume to look at her with irony
10596: as Deronda had done. To be protected and petted, and to have her
10597: susceptibilities consulted in every detail, had gone along with her
10598: food and clothing as matters of course in her life: even without any
10599: such warning as Klesmer’s she could not have thought it an attractive
10600: freedom to be thrown in solitary dependence on the doubtful civility of
10601: strangers. The endurance of the episcopal penitentiary was less
10602: repulsive than that; though here too she would certainly never be
10603: petted or have her susceptibilities consulted. Her rebellion against
10604: this hard necessity which had come just to her of all people in the
10605: world—to her whom all circumstances had concurred in preparing for
10606: something quite different—was exaggerated instead of diminished as one
10607: hour followed another, with the imagination of what she might have
10608: expected in her lot and what it was actually to be. The family
10609: troubles, she thought, were easier for every one than for her—even for
10610: poor dear mamma, because she had always used herself to not enjoying.
10611: As to hoping that if she went to the Momperts’ and was patient a little
10612: while, things might get better—it would be stupid to entertain hopes
10613: for herself after all that had happened: her talents, it appeared,
10614: would never be recognized as anything remarkable, and there was not a
10615: single direction in which probability seemed to flatter her wishes.
10616: Some beautiful girls who, like her, had read romances where even plain
10617: governesses are centres of attraction and are sought in marriage, might
10618: have solaced themselves a little by transporting such pictures into
10619: their own future; but even if Gwendolen’s experience had led her to
10620: dwell on love-making and marriage as her elysium, her heart was too
10621: much oppressed by what was near to her, in both the past and the
10622: future, for her to project her anticipations very far off. She had a
10623: world-nausea upon her, and saw no reason all through her life why she
10624: should wish to live. No religious view of trouble helped her: her
10625: troubles had in her opinion all been caused by other people’s
10626: disagreeable or wicked conduct; and there was really nothing pleasant
10627: to be counted on in the world: that was her feeling; everything else
10628: she had heard said about trouble was mere phrase-making not attractive
10629: enough for her to have caught it up and repeated it. As to the
10630: sweetness of labor and fulfilled claims; the interest of inward and
10631: outward activity; the impersonal delights of life as a perpetual
10632: discovery; the dues of courage, fortitude, industry, which it is mere
10633: baseness not to pay toward the common burden; the supreme worth of the
10634: teacher’s vocation;—these, even if they had been eloquently preached
10635: to her, could have been no more than faintly apprehended doctrines: the
10636: fact which wrought upon her was her invariable observation that for a
10637: lady to become a governess—to “take a situation”—was to descend in
10638: life and to be treated at best with a compassionate patronage. And poor
10639: Gwendolen had never dissociated happiness from personal pre-eminence
10640: and _éclat_. That where these threatened to forsake her, she should
10641: take life to be hardly worth the having, cannot make her so unlike the
10642: rest of us, men or women, that we should cast her out of our
10643: compassion; our moments of temptation to a mean opinion of things in
10644: general being usually dependent on some susceptibility about ourselves
10645: and some dullness to subjects which every one else would consider more
10646: important. Surely a young creature is pitiable who has the labyrinth of
10647: life before her and no clue—to whom distrust in herself and her good
10648: fortune has come as a sudden shock, like a rent across the path that
10649: she was treading carelessly.
10650: 
10651: In spite of her healthy frame, her irreconcilable repugnance affected
10652: her even physically; she felt a sort of numbness and could set about
10653: nothing; the least urgency, even that she should take her meals, was an
10654: irritation to her; the speech of others on any subject seemed
10655: unreasonable, because it did not include her feeling and was an
10656: ignorant claim on her. It was not in her nature to busy herself with
10657: the fancies of suicide to which disappointed young people are prone:
10658: what occupied and exasperated her was the sense that there was nothing
10659: for her but to live in a way she hated. She avoided going to the
10660: rectory again: it was too intolerable to have to look and talk as if
10661: she were compliant; and she could not exert herself to show interest
10662: about the furniture of that horrible cottage. Miss Merry was staying on
10663: purpose to help, and such people as Jocosa liked that sort of thing.
10664: Her mother had to make excuses for her not appearing, even when Anna
10665: came to see her. For that calm which Gwendolen had promised herself to
10666: maintain had changed into sick motivelessness: she thought, “I suppose
10667: I shall begin to pretend by-and-by, but why should I do it now?”
10668: 
10669: Her mother watched her with silent distress; and, lapsing into the
10670: habit of indulgent tenderness, she began to think what she imagined
10671: that Gwendolen was thinking, and to wish that everything should give
10672: way to the possibility of making her darling less miserable.
10673: 
10674: One day when she was in the black and yellow bedroom and her mother was
10675: lingering there under the pretext of considering and arranging
10676: Gwendolen’s articles of dress, she suddenly roused herself to fetch the
10677: casket which contained the ornaments.
10678: 
10679: “Mamma,” she began, glancing over the upper layer, “I had forgotten
10680: these things. Why didn’t you remind me of them? Do see about getting
10681: them sold. You will not mind about parting with them. You gave them all
10682: to me long ago.”
10683: 
10684: She lifted the upper tray and looked below.
10685: 
10686: “If we can do without them, darling, I would rather keep them for you,”
10687: said Mrs. Davilow, seating herself beside Gwendolen with a feeling of
10688: relief that she was beginning to talk about something. The usual
10689: relation between them had become reversed. It was now the mother who
10690: tried to cheer the daughter. “Why, how came you to put that pocket
10691: handkerchief in here?”
10692: 
10693: It was the handkerchief with the corner torn off which Gwendolen had
10694: thrust in with the turquoise necklace.
10695: 
10696: “It happened to be with the necklace—I was in a hurry,” said
10697: Gwendolen, taking the handkerchief away and putting it in her pocket.
10698: “Don’t sell the necklace, mamma,” she added, a new feeling having come
10699: over her about that rescue of it which had formerly been so offensive.
10700: 
10701: “No, dear, no; it was made out of your dear father’s chain. And I
10702: should prefer not selling the other things. None of them are of any
10703: great value. All my best ornaments were taken from me long ago.”
10704: 
10705: Mrs. Davilow colored. She usually avoided any reference to such facts
10706: about Gwendolen’s step-father as that he had carried off his wife’s
10707: jewelry and disposed of it. After a moment’s pause she went on,
10708: 
10709: “And these things have not been reckoned on for any expenses. Carry
10710: them with you.”
10711: 
10712: “That would be quite useless, mamma,” said Gwendolen, coldly.
10713: “Governesses don’t wear ornaments. You had better get me a gray frieze
10714: livery and a straw poke, such as my aunt’s charity children wear.”
10715: 
10716: “No, dear, no; don’t take that view of it. I feel sure the Momperts
10717: will like you the better for being graceful and elegant.”
10718: 
10719: “I am not at all sure what the Momperts will like me to be. It is
10720: enough that I am expected to be what they like,” said Gwendolen
10721: bitterly.
10722: 
10723: “If there is anything you would object to less—anything that could be
10724: done—instead of your going to the bishop’s, do say so, Gwendolen. Tell
10725: me what is in your heart. I will try for anything you wish,” said the
10726: mother, beseechingly. “Don’t keep things away from me. Let us bear them
10727: together.”
10728: 
10729: “Oh, mamma, there is nothing to tell. I can’t do anything better. I
10730: must think myself fortunate if they will have me. I shall get some
10731: money for you. That is the only thing I have to think of. I shall not
10732: spend any money this year: you will have all the eighty pounds. I don’t
10733: know how far that will go in housekeeping; but you need not stitch your
10734: poor fingers to the bone, and stare away all the sight that the tears
10735: have left in your dear eyes.”
10736: 
10737: Gwendolen did not give any caresses with her words as she had been used
10738: to do. She did not even look at her mother, but was looking at the
10739: turquoise necklace as she turned it over her fingers.
10740: 
10741: “Bless you for your tenderness, my good darling!” said Mrs. Davilow,
10742: with tears in her eyes. “Don’t despair because there are clouds now.
10743: You are so young. There may be great happiness in store for you yet.”
10744: 
10745: “I don’t see any reason for expecting it, mamma,” said Gwendolen, in a
10746: hard tone; and Mrs. Davilow was silent, thinking as she had often
10747: thought before—“What did happen between her and Mr. Grandcourt?”
10748: 
10749: “I _will_ keep this necklace, mamma,” said Gwendolen, laying it apart
10750: and then closing the casket. “But do get the other things sold, even if
10751: they will not bring much. Ask my uncle what to do with them. I shall
10752: certainly not use them again. I am going to take the veil. I wonder if
10753: all the poor wretches who have ever taken it felt as I do.”
10754: 
10755: “Don’t exaggerate evils, dear.”
10756: 
10757: “How can any one know that I exaggerate, when I am speaking of my own
10758: feeling? I did not say what any one else felt.”
10759: 
10760: She took out the torn handkerchief from her pocket again, and wrapped
10761: it deliberately round the necklace. Mrs. Davilow observed the action
10762: with some surprise, but the tone of her last words discouraged her from
10763: asking any question.
10764: 
10765: The “feeling” Gwendolen spoke of with an air of tragedy was not to be
10766: explained by the mere fact that she was going to be a governess: she
10767: was possessed by a spirit of general disappointment. It was not simply
10768: that she had a distaste for what she was called on to do: the distaste
10769: spread itself over the world outside her penitentiary, since she saw
10770: nothing very pleasant in it that seemed attainable by her even if she
10771: were free. Naturally her grievances did not seem to her smaller than
10772: some of her male contemporaries held theirs to be when they felt a
10773: profession too narrow for their powers, and had an _à priori_
10774: conviction that it was not worth while to put forth their latent
10775: abilities. Because her education had been less expensive than theirs,
10776: it did not follow that she should have wider emotions or a keener
10777: intellectual vision. Her griefs were feminine; but to her as a woman
10778: they were not the less hard to bear, and she felt an equal right to the
10779: Promethean tone.
10780: 
10781: But the movement of mind which led her to keep the necklace, to fold it
10782: up in the handkerchief, and rise to put it in her _nécessaire_, where
10783: she had first placed it when it had been returned to her, was more
10784: peculiar, and what would be called less reasonable. It came from that
10785: streak of superstition in her which attached itself both to her
10786: confidence and her terror—a superstition which lingers in an intense
10787: personality even in spite of theory and science; any dread or hope for
10788: self being stronger than all reasons for or against it. Why she should
10789: suddenly determine not to part with the necklace was not much clearer
10790: to her than why she should sometimes have been frightened to find
10791: herself in the fields alone: she had a confused state of emotion about
10792: Deronda—was it wounded pride and resentment, or a certain awe and
10793: exceptional trust? It was something vague and yet mastering, which
10794: impelled her to this action about the necklace. There is a great deal
10795: of unmapped country within us which would have to be taken into account
10796: in an explanation of our gusts and storms.
10797: 
10798: 
10799: 
10800: 
10801: CHAPTER XXV.
10802: 
10803:     How trace the why and wherefore in a mind reduced to the barrenness of
10804:     a fastidious egoism, in which all direct desires are dulled, and have
10805:     dwindled from motives into a vacillating expectation of motives: a
10806:     mind made up of moods, where a fitful impulse springs here and there
10807:     conspicuously rank amid the general weediness? ’Tis a condition apt to
10808:     befall a life too much at large, unmoulded by the pressure of
10809:     obligation. _Nam deteriores omnes sumus licentiæ_, or, as a more
10810:     familiar tongue might deliver it, _“As you like” is a bad finger-post._
10811: 
10812: 
10813: Potentates make known their intentions and affect the funds at a small
10814: expense of words. So when Grandcourt, after learning that Gwendolen had
10815: left Leubronn, incidentally pronounced that resort of fashion a beastly
10816: hole, worse than Baden, the remark was conclusive to Mr. Lush that his
10817: patron intended straightway to return to Diplow. The execution was sure
10818: to be slower than the intention, and, in fact, Grandcourt did loiter
10819: through the next day without giving any distinct orders about
10820: departure—perhaps because he discerned that Lush was expecting them:
10821: he lingered over his toilet, and certainly came down with a faded
10822: aspect of perfect distinction which made fresh complexions and hands
10823: with the blood in them, seem signs of raw vulgarity; he lingered on the
10824: terrace, in the gambling-rooms, in the reading-room, occupying himself
10825: in being indifferent to everybody and everything around him. When he
10826: met Lady Mallinger, however, he took some trouble—raised his hat,
10827: paused, and proved that he listened to her recommendation of the waters
10828: by replying, “Yes; I heard somebody say how providential it was that
10829: there always happened to be springs at gambling places.”
10830: 
10831: “Oh, that was a joke,” said innocent Lady Mallinger, misled by
10832: Grandcourt’s languid seriousness, “in imitation of the old one about
10833: the towns and the rivers, you know.”
10834: 
10835: “Ah, perhaps,” said Grandcourt, without change of expression. Lady
10836: Mallinger thought this worth telling to Sir Hugo, who said, “Oh, my
10837: dear, he is not a fool. You must not suppose that he can’t see a joke.
10838: He can play his cards as well as most of us.”
10839: 
10840: “He has never seemed to me a very sensible man,” said Lady Mallinger,
10841: in excuse of herself. She had a secret objection to meeting Grandcourt,
10842: who was little else to her than a large living sign of what she felt to
10843: be her failure as a wife—the not having presented Sir Hugo with a son.
10844: Her constant reflection was that her husband might fairly regret his
10845: choice, and if he had not been very good might have treated her with
10846: some roughness in consequence, gentlemen naturally disliking to be
10847: disappointed.
10848: 
10849: Deronda, too, had a recognition from Grandcourt, for which he was not
10850: grateful, though he took care to return it with perfect civility. No
10851: reasoning as to the foundations of custom could do away with the
10852: early-rooted feeling that his birth had been attended with injury for
10853: which his father was to blame; and seeing that but for this injury
10854: Grandcourt’s prospects might have been his, he was proudly resolute not
10855: to behave in any way that might be interpreted into irritation on that
10856: score. He saw a very easy descent into mean unreasoning rancor and
10857: triumph in others’ frustration; and being determined not to go down
10858: that ugly pit, he turned his back on it, clinging to the kindlier
10859: affections within him as a possession. Pride certainly helped him
10860: well—the pride of not recognizing a disadvantage for one’s self which
10861: vulgar minds are disposed to exaggerate, such as the shabby equipage of
10862: poverty: he would not have a man like Grandcourt suppose himself envied
10863: by him. But there is no guarding against interpretation. Grandcourt did
10864: believe that Deronda, poor devil, who he had no doubt was his cousin by
10865: the father’s side, inwardly winced under their mutual position;
10866: wherefore the presence of that less lucky person was more agreeable to
10867: him than it would otherwise have been. An imaginary envy, the idea that
10868: others feel their comparative deficiency, is the ordinary _cortège_ of
10869: egoism; and his pet dogs were not the only beings that Grandcourt liked
10870: to feel his power over in making them jealous. Hence he was civil
10871: enough to exchange several words with Deronda on the terrace about the
10872: hunting round Diplow, and even said, “You had better come over for a
10873: run or two when the season begins.”
10874: 
10875: Lush, not displeased with delay, amused himself very well, partly in
10876: gossiping with Sir Hugo and in answering his questions about
10877: Grandcourt’s affairs so far as they might affect his willingness to
10878: part with his interest in Diplow. Also about Grandcourt’s personal
10879: entanglements, the baronet knew enough already for Lush to feel
10880: released from silence on a sunny autumn day, when there was nothing
10881: more agreeable to do in lounging promenades than to speak freely of a
10882: tyrannous patron behind his back. Sir Hugo willingly inclined his ear
10883: to a little good-humored scandal, which he was fond of calling _traits
10884: de mœurs_; but he was strict in keeping such communications from
10885: hearers who might take them too seriously. Whatever knowledge he had of
10886: his nephew’s secrets, he had never spoken of it to Deronda, who
10887: considered Grandcourt a pale-blooded mortal, but was far from wishing
10888: to hear how the red corpuscles had been washed out of him. It was
10889: Lush’s policy and inclination to gratify everybody when he had no
10890: reason to the contrary; and the baronet always treated him well, as one
10891: of those easy-handled personages who, frequenting the society of
10892: gentlemen, without being exactly gentlemen themselves, can be the more
10893: serviceable, like the second-best articles of our wardrobe, which we
10894: use with a comfortable freedom from anxiety.
10895: 
10896: “Well, you will let me know the turn of events,” said Sir Hugo, “if
10897: this marriage seems likely to come off after all, or if anything else
10898: happens to make the want of money pressing. My plan would be much
10899: better for him than burdening Ryelands.”
10900: 
10901: “That’s true,” said Lush, “only it must not be urged on him—just
10902: placed in his way that the scent may tickle him. Grandcourt is not a
10903: man to be always led by what makes for his own interest; especially if
10904: you let him see that it makes for your interest too. I’m attached to
10905: him, of course. I’ve given up everything else for the sake of keeping
10906: by him, and it has lasted a good fifteen years now. He would not easily
10907: get any one else to fill my place. He’s a peculiar character, is
10908: Henleigh Grandcourt, and it has been growing on him of late years.
10909: However, I’m of a constant disposition, and I’ve been a sort of
10910: guardian to him since he was twenty; an uncommonly fascinating fellow
10911: he was then, to be sure—and could be now, if he liked. I’m attached to
10912: him; and it would be a good deal worse for him if he missed me at his
10913: elbow.”
10914: 
10915: Sir Hugo did not think it needful to express his sympathy or even
10916: assent, and perhaps Lush himself did not expect this sketch of his
10917: motives to be taken as exact. But how can a man avoid himself as a
10918: subject in conversation? And he must make some sort of decent toilet in
10919: words, as in cloth and linen. Lush’s listener was not severe: a member
10920: of Parliament could allow for the necessities of verbal toilet; and the
10921: dialogue went on without any change of mutual estimate.
10922: 
10923: However, Lush’s easy prospect of indefinite procrastination was cut off
10924: the next morning by Grandcourt’s saluting him with the question,
10925: 
10926: “Are you making all the arrangements for our starting by the Paris
10927: train?”
10928: 
10929: “I didn’t know you meant to start,” said Lush, not exactly taken by
10930: surprise.
10931: 
10932: “You might have known,” said Grandcourt, looking at the burned length
10933: of his cigar, and speaking in that lowered tone which was usual with
10934: him when he meant to express disgust and be peremptory. “Just see to
10935: everything, will you? and mind no brute gets into the same carriage
10936: with us. And leave my P. P. C. at the Mallingers’.”
10937: 
10938: In consequence they were at Paris the next day; but here Lush was
10939: gratified by the proposal or command that he should go straight on to
10940: Diplow and see that everything was right, while Grandcourt and the
10941: valet remained behind; and it was not until several days later that
10942: Lush received the telegram ordering the carriage to the Wanchester
10943: station.
10944: 
10945: He had used the interim actively, not only in carrying out Grandcourt’s
10946: orders about the stud and household, but in learning all he could of
10947: Gwendolen, and how things were going on at Offendene. What was the
10948: probable effect that the news of the family misfortunes would have on
10949: Grandcourt’s fitful obstinacy he felt to be quite incalculable. So far
10950: as the girl’s poverty might be an argument that she would accept an
10951: offer from him now in spite of any previous coyness, it might remove
10952: that bitter objection to risk a repulse which Lush divined to be one of
10953: Grandcourt’s deterring motives; on the other hand, the certainty of
10954: acceptance was just “the sort of thing” to make him lapse hither and
10955: thither with no more apparent will than a moth. Lush had had his patron
10956: under close observation for many years, and knew him perhaps better
10957: than he knew any other subject; but to know Grandcourt was to doubt
10958: what he would do in any particular case. It might happen that he would
10959: behave with an apparent magnanimity, like the hero of a modern French
10960: drama, whose sudden start into moral splendor after much lying and
10961: meanness, leaves you little confidence as to any part of his career
10962: that may follow the fall of the curtain. Indeed, what attitude would
10963: have been more honorable for a final scene than that of declining to
10964: seek an heiress for her money, and determining to marry the attractive
10965: girl who had none? But Lush had some general certainties about
10966: Grandcourt, and one was that of all inward movements those of
10967: generosity were least likely to occur in him. Of what use, however, is
10968: a general certainty that an insect will not walk with his head
10969: hindmost, when what you need to know is the play of inward stimulus
10970: that sends him hither and thither in a network of possible paths? Thus
10971: Lush was much at fault as to the probable issue between Grandcourt and
10972: Gwendolen, when what he desired was a perfect confidence that they
10973: would never be married. He would have consented willingly that
10974: Grandcourt should marry an heiress, or that he should marry Mrs.
10975: Glasher: in the one match there would have been the immediate abundance
10976: that prospective heirship could not supply, in the other there would
10977: have been the security of the wife’s gratitude, for Lush had always
10978: been Mrs. Glasher’s friend; and that the future Mrs. Grandcourt should
10979: not be socially received could not affect his private comfort. He would
10980: not have minded, either, that there should be no marriage in question
10981: at all; but he felt himself justified in doing his utmost to hinder a
10982: marriage with a girl who was likely to bring nothing but trouble to her
10983: husband—not to speak of annoyance if not ultimate injury to her
10984: husband’s old companion, whose future Mr. Lush earnestly wished to make
10985: as easy as possible, considering that he had well deserved such
10986: compensation for leading a dog’s life, though that of a dog who enjoyed
10987: many tastes undisturbed, and who profited by a large establishment. He
10988: wished for himself what he felt to be good, and was not conscious of
10989: wishing harm to any one else; unless perhaps it were just now a little
10990: harm to the inconvenient and impertinent Gwendolen. But the
10991: easiest-humored of luxury and music, the toad-eater the least liable to
10992: nausea, must be expected to have his susceptibilities. And Mr. Lush was
10993: accustomed to be treated by the world in general as an apt, agreeable
10994: fellow: he had not made up his mind to be insulted by more than one
10995: person.
10996: 
10997: With this imperfect preparation of a war policy, Lush was awaiting
10998: Grandcourt’s arrival, doing little more than wondering how the campaign
10999: would begin. The first day Grandcourt was much occupied with the
11000: stables, and amongst other things he ordered a groom to put a
11001: side-saddle on Criterion and let him review the horse’s paces. This
11002: marked indication of purpose set Lush on considering over again whether
11003: he should incur the ticklish consequences of speaking first, while he
11004: was still sure that no compromising step had been taken; and he rose
11005: the next morning almost resolved that if Grandcourt seemed in as good a
11006: humor as yesterday and entered at all into talk, he would let drop the
11007: interesting facts about Gwendolen and her family, just to see how they
11008: would work, and to get some guidance. But Grandcourt did not enter into
11009: talk, and in answer to a question even about his own convenience, no
11010: fish could have maintained a more unwinking silence. After he had read
11011: his letters he gave various orders to be executed or transmitted by
11012: Lush, and then thrust his shoulder toward that useful person, who
11013: accordingly rose to leave the room. But before he was out of the door
11014: Grandcourt turned his head slightly and gave a broken, languid “Oh.”
11015: 
11016: “What is it?” said Lush, who, it must have been observed, did not take
11017: his dusty puddings with a respectful air.
11018: 
11019: “Shut the door, will you? I can’t speak into the corridor.”
11020: 
11021: Lush closed the door, came forward, and chose to sit down.
11022: 
11023: After a little pause Grandcourt said, “Is Miss Harleth at Offendene?”
11024: He was quite certain that Lush had made it his business to inquire
11025: about her, and he had some pleasure in thinking that Lush did not want
11026: _him_ to inquire.
11027: 
11028: “Well, I hardly know,” said Lush, carelessly. “The family’s utterly
11029: done up. They and the Gascoignes too have lost all their money. It’s
11030: owing to some rascally banking business. The poor mother hasn’t a
11031: _sou_, it seems. She and the girls have to huddle themselves into a
11032: little cottage like a laborer’s.”
11033: 
11034: “Don’t lie to me, if you please,” said Grandcourt, in his lowest
11035: audible tone. “It’s not amusing, and it answers no other purpose.”
11036: 
11037: “What do you mean?” said Lush, more nettled than was common with
11038: him—the prospect before him being more than commonly disturbing.
11039: 
11040: “Just tell me the truth, will you?”
11041: 
11042: “It’s no invention of mine. I have heard the story from
11043: several—Bazley, Brackenshaw’s man, for one. He is getting a new tenant
11044: for Offendene.”
11045: 
11046: “I don’t mean that. Is Miss Harleth there, or is she not?” said
11047: Grandcourt, in his former tone.
11048: 
11049: “Upon my soul, I can’t tell,” said Lush, rather sulkily. “She may have
11050: left yesterday. I heard she had taken a situation as governess; she may
11051: be gone to it for what I know. But if you wanted to see her no doubt
11052: the mother would send for her back.” This sneer slipped off his tongue
11053: without strict intention.
11054: 
11055: “Send Hutchins to inquire whether she will be there to-morrow.” Lush did
11056: not move. Like many persons who have thought over beforehand what they
11057: shall say in given cases, he was impelled by an unexpected irritation
11058: to say some of those prearranged things before the cases were given.
11059: Grandcourt, in fact, was likely to get into a scrape so tremendous that
11060: it was impossible to let him take the first step toward it without
11061: remonstrance. Lush retained enough caution to use a tone of rational
11062: friendliness, still he felt his own value to his patron, and was
11063: prepared to be daring.
11064: 
11065: “It would be as well for you to remember, Grandcourt, that you are
11066: coming under closer fire now. There can be none of the ordinary
11067: flirting done, which may mean everything or nothing. You must make up
11068: your mind whether you wish to be accepted; and more than that, how you
11069: would like being refused. Either one or the other. You can’t be
11070: philandering after her again for six weeks.”
11071: 
11072: Grandcourt said nothing, but pressed the newspaper down on his knees
11073: and began to light another cigar. Lush took this as a sign that he was
11074: willing to listen, and was the more bent on using the opportunity; he
11075: wanted, if possible, to find out which would be the more potent cause
11076: of hesitation—probable acceptance or probable refusal.
11077: 
11078: “Everything has a more serious look now than it had before. There is
11079: her family to be provided for. You could not let your wife’s mother
11080: live in beggary. It will be a confoundedly hampering affair. Marriage
11081: will pin you down in a way you haven’t been used to; and in point of
11082: money you have not too much elbow-room. And after all, what will you
11083: get by it? You are master over your estates, present or future, as far
11084: as choosing your heir goes; it’s a pity to go on encumbering them for a
11085: mere whim, which you may repent of in a twelvemonth. I should be sorry
11086: to see you making a mess of your life in that way. If there were
11087: anything solid to be gained by the marriage, that would be a different
11088: affair.”
11089: 
11090: Lush’s tone had gradually become more and more unctuous in its
11091: friendliness of remonstrance, and he was almost in danger of forgetting
11092: that he was merely gambling in argument. When he left off, Grandcourt
11093: took his cigar out of his mouth, and looking steadily at the moist end
11094: while he adjusted the leaf with his delicate finger-tips, said,
11095: 
11096: “I knew before that you had an objection to my marrying Miss Harleth.”
11097: Here he made a little pause before he continued. “But I never
11098: considered that a reason against it.”
11099: 
11100: “I never supposed you did,” answered Lush, not unctuously but dryly.
11101: “It was not _that_ I urged as a reason. I should have thought it might
11102: have been a reason against it, after all your experience, that you
11103: would be acting like the hero of a ballad, and making yourself
11104: absurd—and all for what? You know you couldn’t make up your mind
11105: before. It’s impossible you can care much about her. And as for the
11106: tricks she is likely to play, you may judge of that from what you heard
11107: at Leubronn. However, what I wished to point out to you was, that there
11108: can be no shilly-shally now.”
11109: 
11110: “Perfectly,” said Grandcourt, looking round at Lush and fixing him with
11111: narrow eyes; “I don’t intend that there should be. I dare say it’s
11112: disagreeable to you. But if you suppose I care a damn for that you are
11113: most stupendously mistaken.”
11114: 
11115: “Oh, well,” said Lush, rising with his hands in his pockets, and
11116: feeling some latent venom still within him, “if you have made up your
11117: mind!—only there’s another aspect of the affair. I have been speaking
11118: on the supposition that it was absolutely certain she would accept you,
11119: and that destitution would have no choice. But I am not so sure that
11120: the young lady is to be counted on. She is kittle cattle to shoe, I
11121: think. And she had her reasons for running away before.” Lush had moved
11122: a step or two till he stood nearly in front of Grandcourt, though at
11123: some distance from him. He did not feel himself much restrained by
11124: consequences, being aware that the only strong hold he had on his
11125: present position was his serviceableness; and even after a quarrel the
11126: want of him was likely sooner or later to recur. He foresaw that
11127: Gwendolen would cause him to be ousted for a time, and his temper at
11128: this moment urged him to risk a quarrel.
11129: 
11130: “She had her reasons,” he repeated more significantly.
11131: 
11132: “I had come to that conclusion before,” said Grandcourt, with
11133: contemptuous irony.
11134: 
11135: “Yes, but I hardly think you know what her reasons were.”
11136: 
11137: “You do, apparently,” said Grandcourt, not betraying by so much as an
11138: eyelash that he cared for the reasons.
11139: 
11140: “Yes, and you had better know too, that you may judge of the influence
11141: you have over her if she swallows her reasons and accepts you. For my
11142: own part I would take odds against it. She saw Lydia in Cardell Chase
11143: and heard the whole story.”
11144: 
11145: Grandcourt made no immediate answer, and only went on smoking. He was
11146: so long before he spoke that Lush moved about and looked out of the
11147: windows, unwilling to go away without seeing some effect of his daring
11148: move. He had expected that Grandcourt would tax him with having
11149: contrived the affair, since Mrs. Glasher was then living at Gadsmere, a
11150: hundred miles off, and he was prepared to admit the fact: what he cared
11151: about was that Grandcourt should be staggered by the sense that his
11152: intended advances must be made to a girl who had that knowledge in her
11153: mind and had been scared by it. At length Grandcourt, seeing Lush turn
11154: toward him, looked at him again and said, contemptuously, “What
11155: follows?”
11156: 
11157: Here certainly was a “mate” in answer to Lush’s “check”; and though his
11158: exasperation with Grandcourt was perhaps stronger than it had ever been
11159: before, it would have been idiocy to act as if any further move could
11160: be useful. He gave a slight shrug with one shoulder, and was going to
11161: walk away, when Grandcourt, turning on his seat toward the table, said,
11162: as quietly as if nothing had occurred, “Oblige me by pushing that pen
11163: and paper here, will you?”
11164: 
11165: No thunderous, bullying superior could have exercised the imperious
11166: spell that Grandcourt did. Why, instead of being obeyed, he had never
11167: been told to go to a warmer place, was perhaps a mystery to those who
11168: found themselves obeying him. The pen and paper were pushed to him, and
11169: as he took them he said, “Just wait for this letter.”
11170: 
11171: He scrawled with ease, and the brief note was quickly addressed. “Let
11172: Hutchins go with it at once, will you?” said Grandcourt, pushing the
11173: letter away from him.
11174: 
11175: As Lush had expected, it was addressed to Miss Harleth, Offendene. When
11176: his irritation had cooled down he was glad there had been no explosive
11177: quarrel; but he felt sure that there was a notch made against him, and
11178: that somehow or other he was intended to pay. It was also clear to him
11179: that the immediate effect of his revelation had been to harden
11180: Grandcourt’s previous determination. But as to the particular movements
11181: that made this process in his baffling mind, Lush could only toss up
11182: his chin in despair of a theory.
11183: 
11184: 
11185: 
11186: 
11187: CHAPTER XXVI.
11188: 
11189:   He brings white asses laden with the freight
11190:   Of Tyrian vessels, purple, gold and balm,
11191:   To bribe my will: I’ll bid them chase him forth,
11192:   Nor let him breathe the taint of his surmise
11193:   On my secure resolve.
11194:                          Ay, ’tis secure:
11195:   And therefore let him come to spread his freight.
11196:   For firmness hath its appetite and craves
11197:   The stronger lure, more strongly to resist;
11198:   Would know the touch of gold to fling it off;
11199:   Scent wine to feel its lip the soberer;
11200:   Behold soft byssus, ivory, and plumes
11201:   To say, “They’re fair, but I will none of them,”
11202:   And flout Enticement in the very face.
11203: 
11204: 
11205: Mr. Gascoigne one day came to Offendene with what he felt to be the
11206: satisfactory news that Mrs. Mompert had fixed Tuesday in the following
11207: week for her interview with Gwendolen at Wanchester. He said nothing of
11208: his having incidentally heard that Mr. Grandcourt had returned to
11209: Diplow; knowing no more than she did that Leubronn had been the goal of
11210: her admirer’s journeying, and feeling that it would be unkind uselessly
11211: to revive the memory of a brilliant prospect under the present
11212: reverses. In his secret soul he thought of his niece’s unintelligible
11213: caprice with regret, but he vindicated her to himself by considering
11214: that Grandcourt had been the first to behave oddly, in suddenly walking
11215: away when there had the best opportunity for crowning his marked
11216: attentions. The rector’s practical judgment told him that his chief
11217: duty to his niece now was to encourage her resolutely to face the
11218: change in her lot, since there was no manifest promise of any event
11219: that would avert it.
11220: 
11221: “You will find an interest in varied experience, my dear, and I have no
11222: doubt you will be a more valuable woman for having sustained such a
11223: part as you are called to.”
11224: 
11225: “I cannot pretend to believe that I shall like it,” said Gwendolen, for
11226: the first time showing her uncle some petulance. “But I am quite aware
11227: that I am obliged to bear it.”
11228: 
11229: She remembered having submitted to his admonition on a different
11230: occasion when she was expected to like a very different prospect.
11231: 
11232: “And your good sense will teach you to behave suitably under it,” said
11233: Mr. Gascoigne, with a shade more gravity. “I feel sure that Mrs.
11234: Mompert will be pleased with you. You will know how to conduct yourself
11235: to a woman who holds in all senses the relation of a superior to you.
11236: This trouble has come on you young, but that makes it in some respects
11237: easier, and there is a benefit in all chastisement if we adjust our
11238: minds to it.”
11239: 
11240: This was precisely what Gwendolen was unable to do; and after her uncle
11241: was gone, the bitter tears, which had rarely come during the late
11242: trouble, rose and fell slowly as she sat alone. Her heart denied that
11243: the trouble was easier because she was young. When was she to have any
11244: happiness, if it did not come while she was young? Not that her visions
11245: of possible happiness for herself were as unmixed with necessary evil
11246: as they used to be—not that she could still imagine herself plucking
11247: the fruits of life without suspicion of their core. But this general
11248: disenchantment with the world—nay, with herself, since it appeared
11249: that she was not made for easy pre-eminence—only intensified her sense
11250: of forlornness; it was a visibly sterile distance enclosing the dreary
11251: path at her feet, in which she had no courage to tread. She was in that
11252: first crisis of passionate youthful rebellion against what is not fitly
11253: called pain, but rather the absence of joy—that first rage of
11254: disappointment in life’s morning, which we whom the years have subdued
11255: are apt to remember but dimly as part of our own experience, and so to
11256: be intolerant of its self-enclosed unreasonableness and impiety. What
11257: passion seems more absurd, when we have got outside it and looked at
11258: calamity as a collective risk, than this amazed anguish that I and not
11259: Thou, He or She, should be just the smitten one? Yet perhaps some who
11260: have afterward made themselves a willing fence before the breast of
11261: another, and have carried their own heart-wound in heroic silence—some
11262: who have made their deeds great, nevertheless began with this angry
11263: amazement at their own smart, and on the mere denial of their fantastic
11264: desires raged as if under the sting of wasps which reduced the universe
11265: for them to an unjust infliction of pain. This was nearly poor
11266: Gwendolen’s condition. What though such a reverse as hers had often
11267: happened to other girls? The one point she had been all her life
11268: learning to care for was that it had happened to _her_: it was what
11269: _she_ felt under Klesmer’s demonstration that she was not remarkable
11270: enough to command fortune by force of will and merit; it was what _she_
11271: would feel under the rigors of Mrs. Mompert’s constant expectation,
11272: under the dull demand that she should be cheerful with three Miss
11273: Momperts, under the necessity of showing herself entirely submissive,
11274: and keeping her thoughts to herself. To be a queen disthroned is not so
11275: hard as some other down-stepping: imagine one who had been made to
11276: believe in his own divinity finding all homage withdrawn, and himself
11277: unable to perform a miracle that would recall the homage and restore
11278: his own confidence. Something akin to this illusion and this
11279: helplessness had befallen the poor spoiled child, with the lovely lips
11280: and eyes and the majestic figure—which seemed now to have no magic in
11281: them.
11282: 
11283: She rose from the low ottoman where she had been sitting purposeless,
11284: and walked up and down the drawing-room, resting her elbow on one palm
11285: while she leaned down her cheek on the other, and a slow tear fell. She
11286: thought, “I have always, ever since I was little, felt that mamma was
11287: not a happy woman; and now I dare say I shall be more unhappy than she
11288: has been.”
11289: 
11290: Her mind dwelt for a few moments on the picture of herself losing her
11291: youth and ceasing to enjoy—not minding whether she did this or that:
11292: but such picturing inevitably brought back the image of her mother.
11293: 
11294: “Poor mamma! it will be still worse for her now. I can get a little
11295: money for her—that is all I shall care about now.” And then with an
11296: entirely new movement of her imagination, she saw her mother getting
11297: quite old and white, and herself no longer young but faded, and their
11298: two faces meeting still with memory and love, and she knowing what was
11299: in her mother’s mind—“Poor Gwen too is sad and faded now”—and then,
11300: for the first time, she sobbed, not in anger, but with a sort of tender
11301: misery.
11302: 
11303: Her face was toward the door, and she saw her mother enter. She barely
11304: saw that; for her eyes were large with tears, and she pressed her
11305: handkerchief against them hurriedly. Before she took it away she felt
11306: her mother’s arms round her, and this sensation, which seemed a
11307: prolongation of her inward vision, overcame her will to be reticent;
11308: she sobbed anew in spite of herself, as they pressed their cheeks
11309: together.
11310: 
11311: Mrs. Davilow had brought something in her hand which had already caused
11312: her an agitating anxiety, and she dared not speak until her darling had
11313: become calmer. But Gwendolen, with whom weeping had always been a
11314: painful manifestation to be resisted, if possible, again pressed her
11315: handkerchief against her eyes, and, with a deep breath, drew her head
11316: backward and looked at her mother, who was pale and tremulous.
11317: 
11318: “It was nothing, mamma,” said Gwendolen, thinking that her mother had
11319: been moved in this way simply by finding her in distress. “It is all
11320: over now.”
11321: 
11322: But Mrs. Davilow had withdrawn her arms, and Gwendolen perceived a
11323: letter in her hand.
11324: 
11325: “What is that letter?—worse news still?” she asked, with a touch of
11326: bitterness.
11327: 
11328: “I don’t know what you will think it, dear,” said Mrs. Davilow, keeping
11329: the letter in her hand. “You will hardly guess where it comes from.”
11330: 
11331: “Don’t ask me to guess anything,” said Gwendolen, rather impatiently,
11332: as if a bruise were being pressed.
11333: 
11334: “It is addressed to you, dear.”
11335: 
11336: Gwendolen gave the slightest perceptible toss of the head.
11337: 
11338: “It comes from Diplow,” said Mrs. Davilow, giving her the letter.
11339: 
11340: She knew Grandcourt’s indistinct handwriting, and her mother was not
11341: surprised to see her blush deeply; but watching her as she read, and
11342: wondering much what was the purport of the letter, she saw the color
11343: die out. Gwendolen’s lips even were pale as she turned the open note
11344: toward her mother. The words were few and formal:
11345: 
11346: Mr. Grandcourt presents his compliments to Miss Harleth, and begs to
11347: know whether he may be permitted to call at Offendene to-morrow after
11348: two and to see her alone. Mr. Grandcourt has just returned from
11349: Leubronn, where he had hoped to find Miss Harleth.
11350: 
11351: Mrs. Davilow read, and then looked at her daughter inquiringly, leaving
11352: the note in her hand. Gwendolen let it fall to the floor, and turned
11353: away.
11354: 
11355: “It must be answered, darling,” said Mrs. Davilow, timidly. “The man
11356: waits.”
11357: 
11358: Gwendolen sank on the settee, clasped her hands, and looked straight
11359: before her, not at her mother. She had the expression of one who had
11360: been startled by a sound and was listening to know what would come of
11361: it. The sudden change of the situation was bewildering. A few minutes
11362: before she was looking along an inescapable path of repulsive monotony,
11363: with hopeless inward rebellion against the imperious lot which left her
11364: no choice: and lo, now, a moment of choice was come. Yet—was it
11365: triumph she felt most or terror? Impossible for Gwendolen not to feel
11366: some triumph in a tribute to her power at a time when she was first
11367: tasting the bitterness of insignificance: again she seemed to be
11368: getting a sort of empire over her own life. But how to use it? Here
11369: came the terror. Quick, quick, like pictures in a book beaten open with
11370: a sense of hurry, came back vividly, yet in fragments, all that she had
11371: gone through in relation to Grandcourt—the allurements, the
11372: vacillations, the resolve to accede, the final repulsion; the incisive
11373: face of that dark-eyed lady with the lovely boy: her own pledge (was it
11374: a pledge not to marry him?)—the new disbelief in the worth of men and
11375: things for which that scene of disclosure had become a symbol. That
11376: unalterable experience made a vision at which in the first agitated
11377: moment, before tempering reflections could suggest themselves, her
11378: native terror shrank.
11379: 
11380: Where was the good of choice coming again? What did she wish? Anything
11381: different? No! And yet in the dark seed-growths of consciousness a new
11382: wish was forming itself—“I wish I had never known it!” Something,
11383: anything she wished for that would have saved her from the dread to let
11384: Grandcourt come.
11385: 
11386: It was no long while—yet it seemed long to Mrs. Davilow, before she
11387: thought it well to say, gently,
11388: 
11389: “It will be necessary for you to write, dear. Or shall I write an
11390: answer for you—which you will dictate?”
11391: 
11392: “No, mamma,” said Gwendolen, drawing a deep breath. “But please lay me
11393: out the pen and paper.”
11394: 
11395: That was gaining time. Was she to decline Grandcourt’s visit—close the
11396: shutters—not even look out on what would happen?—though with the
11397: assurance that she should remain just where she was? The young activity
11398: within her made a warm current through her terror and stirred toward
11399: something that would be an event—toward an opportunity in which she
11400: could look and speak with the former effectiveness. The interest of the
11401: morrow was no longer at a deadlock.
11402: 
11403: “There is really no reason on earth why you should be so alarmed at the
11404: man’s waiting a few minutes, mamma,” said Gwendolen, remonstrantly, as
11405: Mrs. Davilow, having prepared the writing materials, looked toward her
11406: expectantly. “Servants expect nothing else than to wait. It is not to
11407: be supposed that I must write on the instant.”
11408: 
11409: “No, dear,” said Mrs. Davilow, in the tone of one corrected, turning to
11410: sit down and take up a bit of work that lay at hand; “he can wait
11411: another quarter of an hour, if you like.”
11412: 
11413: It was very simple speech and action on her part, but it was what might
11414: have been subtly calculated. Gwendolen felt a contradictory desire to
11415: be hastened: hurry would save her from deliberate choice.
11416: 
11417: “I did not mean him to wait long enough for that needlework to be
11418: finished,” she said, lifting her hands to stroke the backward curves of
11419: her hair, while she rose from her seat and stood still.
11420: 
11421: “But if you don’t feel able to decide?” said Mrs. Davilow,
11422: sympathizingly.
11423: 
11424: “I _must_ decide,” said Gwendolen, walking to the writing-table and
11425: seating herself. All the while there was a busy under-current in her,
11426: like the thought of a man who keeps up a dialogue while he is
11427: considering how he can slip away. Why should she not let him come? It
11428: bound her to nothing. He had been to Leubronn after her: of course he
11429: meant a direct unmistakable renewal of the suit which before had been
11430: only implied. What then? She could reject him. Why was she to deny
11431: herself the freedom of doing this—which she would like to do?
11432: 
11433: “If Mr. Grandcourt has only just returned from Leubronn,” said Mrs.
11434: Davilow, observing that Gwendolen leaned back in her chair after taking
11435: the pen in her hand—“I wonder whether he has heard of our misfortunes?”
11436: 
11437: “That could make no difference to a man in his position,” said
11438: Gwendolen, rather contemptuously,
11439: 
11440: “It would to some men,” said Mrs. Davilow. “They would not like to take
11441: a wife from a family in a state of beggary almost, as we are. Here we
11442: are at Offendene with a great shell over us, as usual. But just imagine
11443: his finding us at Sawyer’s Cottage. Most men are afraid of being bored
11444: or taxed by a wife’s family. If Mr. Grandcourt did know, I think it a
11445: strong proof of his attachment to you.”
11446: 
11447: Mrs. Davilow spoke with unusual emphasis: it was the first time she had
11448: ventured to say anything about Grandcourt which would necessarily seem
11449: intended as an argument in favor of him, her habitual impression being
11450: that such arguments would certainly be useless and might be worse. The
11451: effect of her words now was stronger than she could imagine: they
11452: raised a new set of possibilities in Gwendolen’s mind—a vision of what
11453: Grandcourt might do for her mother if she, Gwendolen, did—what she was
11454: not going to do. She was so moved by a new rush of ideas that, like one
11455: conscious of being urgently called away, she felt that the immediate
11456: task must be hastened: the letter must be written, else it might be
11457: endlessly deferred. After all, she acted in a hurry, as she had wished
11458: to do. To act in a hurry was to have a reason for keeping away from an
11459: absolute decision, and to leave open as many issues as possible.
11460: 
11461: She wrote: “Miss Harleth presents her compliments to Mr. Grandcourt.
11462: She will be at home after two o’clock to-morrow.”
11463: 
11464: Before addressing the note she said, “Pray ring the bell, mamma, if
11465: there is any one to answer it.” She really did not know who did the
11466: work of the house.
11467: 
11468: It was not till after the letter had been taken away and Gwendolen had
11469: risen again, stretching out one arm and then resting it on her head,
11470: with a low moan which had a sound of relief in it, that Mrs. Davilow
11471: ventured to ask,
11472: 
11473: “What did you say, Gwen?”
11474: 
11475: “I said that I should be at home,” answered Gwendolen, rather loftily.
11476: Then after a pause, “You must not expect, because Mr. Grandcourt is
11477: coming, that anything is going to happen, mamma.”
11478: 
11479: “I don’t allow myself to expect anything, dear. I desire you to follow
11480: your own feeling. You have never told me what that was.”
11481: 
11482: “What is the use of telling?” said Gwendolen, hearing a reproach in
11483: that true statement. “When I have anything pleasant to tell, you may be
11484: sure I will tell you.”
11485: 
11486: “But Mr. Grandcourt will consider that you have already accepted him,
11487: in allowing him to come. His note tells you plainly enough that he is
11488: coming to make you an offer.”
11489: 
11490: “Very well; and I wish to have the pleasure of refusing him.”
11491: 
11492: Mrs. Davilow looked up in wonderment, but Gwendolen implied her wish
11493: not to be questioned further by saying,
11494: 
11495: “Put down that detestable needlework, and let us walk in the avenue. I
11496: am stifled.”
11497: 
11498: 
11499: 
11500: 
11501: CHAPTER XXVII.
11502: 
11503:   Desire has trimmed the sails, and Circumstance
11504:   Brings but the breeze to fill them.
11505: 
11506: 
11507: While Grandcourt on his beautiful black Yarico, the groom behind him on
11508: Criterion, was taking the pleasant ride from Diplow to Offendene,
11509: Gwendolen was seated before the mirror while her mother gathered up the
11510: lengthy mass of light-brown hair which she had been carefully brushing.
11511: 
11512: “Only gather it up easily and make a coil, mamma,” said Gwendolen.
11513: 
11514: “Let me bring you some earrings, Gwen,” said Mrs. Davilow, when the
11515: hair was adjusted, and they were both looking at the reflection in the
11516: glass. It was impossible for them not to notice that the eyes looked
11517: brighter than they had done of late, that there seemed to be a shadow
11518: lifted from the face, leaving all the lines once more in their placid
11519: youthfulness. The mother drew some inference that made her voice rather
11520: cheerful. “You do want your earrings?”
11521: 
11522: “No, mamma; I shall not wear any ornaments, and I shall put on my black
11523: silk. Black is the only wear when one is going to refuse an offer,”
11524: said Gwendolen, with one of her old smiles at her mother, while she
11525: rose to throw off her dressing-gown.
11526: 
11527: “Suppose the offer is not made after all,” said Mrs. Davilow, not
11528: without a sly intention.
11529: 
11530: “Then that will be because I refuse it beforehand,” said Gwendolen. “It
11531: comes to the same thing.”
11532: 
11533: There was a proud little toss of the head as she said this; and when
11534: she walked down-stairs in her long black robes, there was just that
11535: firm poise of head and elasticity of form which had lately been
11536: missing, as in a parched plant. Her mother thought, “She is quite
11537: herself again. It must be pleasure in his coming. Can her mind be
11538: really made up against him?”
11539: 
11540: Gwendolen would have been rather angry if that thought had been
11541: uttered; perhaps all the more because through the last twenty hours,
11542: with a brief interruption of sleep, she had been so occupied with
11543: perpetually alternating images and arguments for and against the
11544: possibility of her marrying Grandcourt, that the conclusion which she
11545: had determined on beforehand ceased to have any hold on her
11546: consciousness: the alternate dip of counterbalancing thoughts begotten
11547: of counterbalancing desires had brought her into a state in which no
11548: conclusion could look fixed to her. She would have expressed her
11549: resolve as before; but it was a form out of which the blood had been
11550: sucked—no more a part of quivering life than the “God’s will be done”
11551: of one who is eagerly watching chances. She did not mean to accept
11552: Grandcourt; from the first moment of receiving his letter she had meant
11553: to refuse him; still, that could not but prompt her to look the
11554: unwelcome reasons full in the face until she had a little less awe of
11555: them, could not hinder her imagination from filling out her knowledge
11556: in various ways, some of which seemed to change the aspect of what she
11557: knew. By dint of looking at a dubious object with a constructive
11558: imagination, one can give it twenty different shapes. Her indistinct
11559: grounds of hesitation before the interview at the Whispering Stones, at
11560: present counted for nothing; they were all merged in the final
11561: repulsion. If it had not been for that day in Cardell Chase, she said
11562: to herself now, there would have been no obstacle to her marrying
11563: Grandcourt. On that day and after it, she had not reasoned and
11564: balanced; she had acted with a force of impulse against which all
11565: questioning was no more than a voice against a torrent. The impulse had
11566: come—not only from her maidenly pride and jealousy, not only from the
11567: shock of another woman’s calamity thrust close on her vision, but—from
11568: her dread of wrong-doing, which was vague, it was true, and aloof from
11569: the daily details of her life, but not the less strong. Whatever was
11570: accepted as consistent with being a lady she had no scruple about; but
11571: from the dim region of what was called disgraceful, wrong, guilty, she
11572: shrunk with mingled pride and terror; and even apart from shame, her
11573: feeling would have made her place any deliberate injury of another in
11574: the region of guilt.
11575: 
11576: But now—did she know exactly what was the state of the case with
11577: regard to Mrs. Glasher and her children? She had given a sort of
11578: promise—had said, “I will not interfere with your wishes.” But would
11579: another woman who married Grandcourt be in fact the decisive obstacle
11580: to her wishes, or be doing her and her boy any real injury? Might it
11581: not be just as well, nay better, that Grandcourt should marry? For what
11582: could not a woman do when she was married, if she knew how to assert
11583: herself? Here all was constructive imagination. Gwendolen had about as
11584: accurate a conception of marriage—that is to say, of the mutual
11585: influences, demands, duties of man and woman in the state of
11586: matrimony—as she had of magnetic currents and the law of storms.
11587: 
11588: “Mamma managed badly,” was her way of summing up what she had seen of
11589: her mother’s experience: she herself would manage quite differently.
11590: And the trials of matrimony were the last theme into which Mrs. Davilow
11591: could choose to enter fully with this daughter.
11592: 
11593: “I wonder what mamma and my uncle would say if they knew about Mrs.
11594: Glasher!” thought Gwendolen in her inward debating; not that she could
11595: imagine herself telling them, even if she had not felt bound to
11596: silence. “I wonder what anybody would say; or what they would say to
11597: Mr. Grandcourt’s marrying some one else and having other children!” To
11598: consider what “anybody” would say, was to be released from the
11599: difficulty of judging where everything was obscure to her when feeling
11600: had ceased to be decisive. She had only to collect her memories, which
11601: proved to her that “anybody” regarded the illegitimate children as more
11602: rightfully to be looked shy on and deprived of social advantages than
11603: illegitimate fathers. The verdict of “anybody” seemed to be that she
11604: had no reason to concern herself greatly on behalf of Mrs. Glasher and
11605: her children.
11606: 
11607: But there was another way in which they had caused her concern. What
11608: others might think could not do away with a feeling which in the first
11609: instance would hardly be too strongly described as indignation and
11610: loathing that she should have been expected to unite herself with an
11611: outworn life, full of backward secrets which must have been more keenly
11612: felt than any association with _her_. True, the question of love on her
11613: own part had occupied her scarcely at all in relation to Grandcourt.
11614: The desirability of marriage for her had always seemed due to other
11615: feeling than love; and to be enamored was the part of the man, on whom
11616: the advances depended. Gwendolen had found no objection to Grandcourt’s
11617: way of being enamored before she had had that glimpse of his past,
11618: which she resented as if it had been a deliberate offense against her.
11619: His advances to _her_ were deliberate, and she felt a retrospective
11620: disgust for them. Perhaps other men’s lives were of the same kind—full
11621: of secrets which made the ignorant suppositions of the women they
11622: wanted to marry a farce at which they were laughing in their sleeves.
11623: 
11624: These feelings of disgust and indignation had sunk deep; and though
11625: other troublous experience in the last weeks had dulled them from
11626: passion into remembrance, it was chiefly their reverberating activity
11627: which kept her firm to the understanding with herself, that she was not
11628: going to accept Grandcourt. She had never meant to form a new
11629: determination; she had only been considering what might be thought or
11630: said. If anything could have induced her to change, it would have been
11631: the prospect of making all things easy for “poor mamma:” that, she
11632: admitted, was a temptation. But no! she was going to refuse him.
11633: Meanwhile, the thought that he was coming to be refused was
11634: inspiriting: she had the white reins in her hands again; there was a
11635: new current in her frame, reviving her from the beaten-down
11636: consciousness in which she had been left by the interview with Klesmer.
11637: She was not now going to crave an opinion of her capabilities; she was
11638: going to exercise her power.
11639: 
11640: Was this what made her heart palpitate annoyingly when she heard the
11641: horse’s footsteps on the gravel?—when Miss Merry, who opened the door
11642: to Grandcourt, came to tell her that he was in the drawing-room? The
11643: hours of preparation and the triumph of the situation were apparently
11644: of no use: she might as well have seen Grandcourt coming suddenly on
11645: her in the midst of her despondency. While walking into the
11646: drawing-room, she had to concentrate all her energy in that
11647: self-control, which made her appear gravely gracious—as she gave her
11648: hand to him, and answered his hope that she was quite well in a voice
11649: as low and languid as his own. A moment afterward, when they were both
11650: of them seated on two of the wreath-painted chairs—Gwendolen upright
11651: with downcast eyelids, Grandcourt about two yards distant, leaning one
11652: arm over the back of his chair and looking at her, while he held his
11653: hat in his left hand—any one seeing them as a picture would have
11654: concluded that they were in some stage of love-making suspense. And
11655: certainly the love-making had begun: she already felt herself being
11656: wooed by this silent man seated at an agreeable distance, with the
11657: subtlest atmosphere of attar of roses and an attention bent wholly on
11658: her. And he also considered himself to be wooing: he was not a man to
11659: suppose that his presence carried no consequences; and he was exactly
11660: the man to feel the utmost piquancy in a girl whom he had not found
11661: quite calculable.
11662: 
11663: “I was disappointed not to find you at Leubronn,” he began, his usual
11664: broken drawl having just a shade of amorous languor in it. “The place
11665: was intolerable without you. A mere kennel of a place. Don’t you think
11666: so?”
11667: 
11668: “I can’t judge what it would be without myself,” said Gwendolen,
11669: turning her eyes on him, with some recovered sense of mischief. “_With_
11670: myself I like it well enough to have stayed longer, if I could. But I
11671: was obliged to come home on account of family troubles.”
11672: 
11673: “It was very cruel of you to go to Leubronn,” said Grandcourt, taking
11674: no notice of the troubles, on which Gwendolen—she hardly knew
11675: why—wished that there should be a clear understanding at once. “You
11676: must have known that it would spoil everything: you knew you were the
11677: heart and soul of everything that went on. Are you quite reckless about
11678: me?”
11679: 
11680: It would be impossible to say “yes” in a tone that would be taken
11681: seriously; equally impossible to say “no;” but what else could she say?
11682: In her difficulty, she turned down her eyelids again and blushed over
11683: face and neck. Grandcourt saw her in a new phase, and believed that she
11684: was showing her inclination. But he was determined that she should show
11685: it more decidedly.
11686: 
11687: “Perhaps there is some deeper interest? Some attraction—some
11688: engagement—which it would have been only fair to make me aware of? Is
11689: there any man who stands between us?”
11690: 
11691: Inwardly the answer framed itself. “No; but there is a woman.” Yet how
11692: could she utter this? Even if she had not promised that woman to be
11693: silent, it would have been impossible for her to enter on the subject
11694: with Grandcourt. But how could she arrest his wooing by beginning to
11695: make a formal speech—“I perceive your intention—it is most
11696: flattering, etc.”? A fish honestly invited to come and be eaten has a
11697: clear course in declining, but how if it finds itself swimming against
11698: a net? And apart from the network, would she have dared at once to say
11699: anything decisive? Gwendolen had not time to be clear on that point. As
11700: it was, she felt compelled to silence, and after a pause, Grandcourt
11701: said,
11702: 
11703: “Am I to understand that some one else is preferred?”
11704: 
11705: Gwendolen, now impatient of her own embarrassment, determined to rush
11706: at the difficulty and free herself. She raised her eyes again and said
11707: with something of her former clearness and defiance, “No”—wishing him
11708: to understand, “What then? I may not be ready to take _you_.” There was
11709: nothing that Grandcourt could not understand which he perceived likely
11710: to affect his _amour propre_.
11711: 
11712: “The last thing I would do, is to importune you. I should not hope to
11713: win you by making myself a bore. If there were no hope for me, I would
11714: ask you to tell me so at once, that I might just ride away to—no
11715: matter where.”
11716: 
11717: Almost to her own astonishment, Gwendolen felt a sudden alarm at the
11718: image of Grandcourt finally riding away. What would be left her then?
11719: Nothing but the former dreariness. She liked him to be there. She
11720: snatched at the subject that would defer any decisive answer.
11721: 
11722: “I fear you are not aware of what has happened to us. I have lately had
11723: to think so much of my mamma’s troubles, that other subjects have been
11724: quite thrown into the background. She has lost all her fortune, and we
11725: are going to leave this place. I must ask you to excuse my seeming
11726: preoccupied.”
11727: 
11728: In eluding a direct appeal Gwendolen recovered some of her
11729: self-possession. She spoke with dignity and looked straight at
11730: Grandcourt, whose long, narrow, impenetrable eyes met hers, and
11731: mysteriously arrested them: mysteriously; for the subtly-varied drama
11732: between man and woman is often such as can hardly be rendered in words
11733: put together like dominoes, according to obvious fixed marks. The word
11734: of all work, Love, will no more express the myriad modes of mutual
11735: attraction, than the word Thought can inform you what is passing
11736: through your neighbor’s mind. It would be hard to tell on which
11737: side—Gwendolen’s or Grandcourt’s—the influence was more mixed. At
11738: that moment his strongest wish was to be completely master of this
11739: creature—this piquant combination of maidenliness and mischief: that
11740: she knew things which had made her start away from him, spurred him to
11741: triumph over that repugnance; and he was believing that he should
11742: triumph. And she—ah, piteous equality in the need to dominate!—she
11743: was overcome like the thirsty one who is drawn toward the seeming water
11744: in the desert, overcome by the suffused sense that here in this man’s
11745: homage to her lay the rescue from helpless subjection to an oppressive
11746: lot.
11747: 
11748: All the while they were looking at each other; and Grandcourt said,
11749: slowly and languidly, as if it were of no importance, other things
11750: having been settled,
11751: 
11752: “You will tell me now, I hope, that Mrs. Davilow’s loss of fortune will
11753: not trouble you further. You will trust me to prevent it from weighing
11754: upon her. You will give me the claim to provide against that.”
11755: 
11756: The little pauses and refined drawlings with which this speech was
11757: uttered, gave time for Gwendolen to go through the dream of a life. As
11758: the words penetrated her, they had the effect of a draught of wine,
11759: which suddenly makes all things easier, desirable things not so wrong,
11760: and people in general less disagreeable. She had a momentary phantasmal
11761: love for this man who chose his words so well, and who was a mere
11762: incarnation of delicate homage. Repugnance, dread, scruples—these were
11763: dim as remembered pains, while she was already tasting relief under the
11764: immediate pain of hopelessness. She imagined herself already springing
11765: to her mother, and being playful again. Yet when Grandcourt had ceased
11766: to speak, there was an instant in which she was conscious of being at
11767: the turning of the ways.
11768: 
11769: “You are very generous,” she said, not moving her eyes, and speaking
11770: with a gentle intonation.
11771: 
11772: “You accept what will make such things a matter of course?” said
11773: Grandcourt, without any new eagerness. “You consent to become my wife?”
11774: 
11775: This time Gwendolen remained quite pale. Something made her rise from
11776: her seat in spite of herself and walk to a little distance. Then she
11777: turned and with her hands folded before her stood in silence.
11778: 
11779: Grandcourt immediately rose too, resting his hat on the chair, but
11780: still keeping hold of it. The evident hesitation of this destitute girl
11781: to take his splendid offer stung him into a keenness of interest such
11782: as he had not known for years. None the less because he attributed her
11783: hesitation entirely to her knowledge about Mrs. Glasher. In that
11784: attitude of preparation, he said,
11785: 
11786: “Do you command me to go?” No familiar spirit could have suggested to
11787: him more effective words.
11788: 
11789: “No,” said Gwendolen. She could not let him go: that negative was a
11790: clutch. She seemed to herself to be, after all, only drifted toward the
11791: tremendous decision—but drifting depends on something besides the
11792: currents when the sails have been set beforehand.
11793: 
11794: “You accept my devotion?” said Grandcourt, holding his hat by his side
11795: and looking straight into her eyes, without other movement. Their eyes
11796: meeting in that way seemed to allow any length of pause: but wait as
11797: long as she would, how could she contradict herself? What had she
11798: detained him for? He had shut out any explanation.
11799: 
11800: “Yes,” came as gravely from Gwendolen’s lips as if she had been
11801: answering to her name in a court of justice. He received it gravely,
11802: and they still looked at each other in the same attitude. Was there
11803: ever such a way before of accepting the bliss-giving “Yes”? Grandcourt
11804: liked better to be at that distance from her, and to feel under a
11805: ceremony imposed by an indefinable prohibition that breathed from
11806: Gwendolen’s bearing.
11807: 
11808: But he did at length lay down his hat and advance to take her hand,
11809: just pressing his lips upon it and letting it go again. She thought his
11810: behavior perfect, and gained a sense of freedom which made her almost
11811: ready to be mischievous. Her “Yes” entailed so little at this moment
11812: that there was nothing to screen the reversal of her gloomy prospects;
11813: her vision was filled by her own release from the Momperts, and her
11814: mother’s release from Sawyer’s Cottage. With a happy curl of the lips,
11815: she said,
11816: 
11817: “Will you not see mamma? I will fetch her.”
11818: 
11819: “Let us wait a little,” said Grandcourt, in his favorite attitude,
11820: having his left forefinger and thumb in his waist-coat pocket, and with
11821: his right hand caressing his whisker, while he stood near Gwendolen and
11822: looked at her—not unlike a gentleman who has a felicitous introduction
11823: at an evening party.
11824: 
11825: “Have you anything else to say to me?” said Gwendolen, playfully.
11826: 
11827: “Yes—I know having things said to you is a great bore,” said
11828: Grandcourt, rather sympathetically.
11829: 
11830: “Not when they are things I like to hear.”
11831: 
11832: “Will it bother you to be asked how soon we can be married?”
11833: 
11834: “I think it will, to-day,” said Gwendolen, putting up her chin saucily.
11835: 
11836: “Not to-day, then, but to-morrow. Think of it before I come to-morrow.
11837: In a fortnight—or three weeks—as soon as possible.”
11838: 
11839: “Ah, you think you will be tired of my company,” said Gwendolen. “I
11840: notice when people are married the husband is not so much with his wife
11841: as when they are engaged. But perhaps I shall like that better, too.”
11842: 
11843: She laughed charmingly.
11844: 
11845: “You shall have whatever you like,” said Grandcourt.
11846: 
11847: “And nothing that I don’t like?—please say that; because I think I
11848: dislike what I don’t like more than I like what I like,” said
11849: Gwendolen, finding herself in the woman’s paradise, where all her
11850: nonsense is adorable.
11851: 
11852: Grandcourt paused; these were subtilties in which he had much
11853: experience of his own. “I don’t know—this is such a brute of a world,
11854: things are always turning up that one doesn’t like. I can’t always
11855: hinder your being bored. If you like to ride Criterion, I can’t hinder
11856: his coming down by some chance or other.”
11857: 
11858: “Ah, my friend Criterion, how is he?”
11859: 
11860: “He is outside: I made the groom ride him, that you might see him. He
11861: had the side-saddle on for an hour or two yesterday. Come to the window
11862: and look at him.”
11863: 
11864: They could see the two horses being taken slowly round the sweep, and
11865: the beautiful creatures, in their fine grooming, sent a thrill of
11866: exultation through Gwendolen. They were the symbols of command and
11867: luxury, in delightful contrast with the ugliness of poverty and
11868: humiliation at which she had lately been looking close.
11869: 
11870: “Will you ride Criterion to-morrow?” said Grandcourt. “If you will,
11871: everything shall be arranged.”
11872: 
11873: “I should like it of all things,” said Gwendolen. “I want to lose
11874: myself in a gallop again. But now I must go and fetch mamma.”
11875: 
11876: “Take my arm to the door, then,” said Grandcourt, and she accepted.
11877: Their faces were very near each other, being almost on a level, and he
11878: was looking at her. She thought his manners as a lover more agreeable
11879: than any she had seen described. She had no alarm lest he meant to kiss
11880: her, and was so much at her ease, that she suddenly paused in the
11881: middle of the room and said half archly, half earnestly,
11882: 
11883: “Oh, while I think of it—there is something I dislike that you can
11884: save me from. I do _not_ like Mr. Lush’s company.”
11885: 
11886: “You shall not have it. I’ll get rid of him.”
11887: 
11888: “You are not fond of him yourself?”
11889: 
11890: “Not in the least. I let him hang on me because he has always been a
11891: poor devil,” said Grandcourt, in an _adagio_ of utter indifference.
11892: “They got him to travel with me when I was a lad. He was always that
11893: coarse-haired kind of brute—sort of cross between a hog and a
11894: _dilettante_.”
11895: 
11896: Gwendolen laughed. All that seemed kind and natural enough:
11897: Grandcourt’s fastidiousness enhanced the kindness. And when they
11898: reached the door, his way of opening it for her was the perfection of
11899: easy homage. Really, she thought, he was likely to be the least
11900: disagreeable of husbands.
11901: 
11902: Mrs. Davilow was waiting anxiously in her bedroom when Gwendolen
11903: entered, stepped toward her quickly, and kissing her on both cheeks
11904: said in a low tone, “Come down, mamma, and see Mr. Grandcourt. I am
11905: engaged to him.”
11906: 
11907: “My darling child,” said Mrs. Davilow, with a surprise that was rather
11908: solemn than glad.
11909: 
11910: “Yes,” said Gwendolen, in the same tone, and with a quickness which
11911: implied that it was needless to ask questions. “Everything is settled.
11912: You are not going to Sawyer’s Cottage, I am not going to be inspected
11913: by Mrs. Mompert, and everything is to be as I like. So come down with
11914: me immediately.”
11915: 
11916: 
11917: 
11918: 
11919: BOOK IV.—GWENDOLEN GETS HER CHOICE.
11920: 
11921: 
11922: CHAPTER XXVIII.
11923: 
11924:     “Il est plus aisé de connoître l’homme en général que de connoître un
11925:      homme en particulier.”—LA ROCHEFOUCAULD.
11926: 
11927: 
11928: An hour after Grandcourt had left, the important news of Gwendolen’s
11929: engagement was known at the rectory, and Mr. and Mrs. Gascoigne, with
11930: Anna, spent the evening at Offendene.
11931: 
11932: “My dear, let me congratulate you on having created a strong
11933: attachment,” said the rector. “You look serious, and I don’t wonder at
11934: it: a life-long union is a solemn thing. But from the way Mr. Grandcourt
11935: has acted and spoken I think we may already see some good arising out
11936: of our adversity. It has given you an opportunity of observing your
11937: future husband’s delicate liberality.”
11938: 
11939: Mr. Gascoigne referred to Grandcourt’s mode of implying that he would
11940: provide for Mrs. Davilow—a part of the love-making which Gwendolen had
11941: remembered to cite to her mother with perfect accuracy.
11942: 
11943: “But I have no doubt that Mr. Grandcourt would have behaved quite as
11944: handsomely if you had not gone away to Germany, Gwendolen, and had been
11945: engaged to him, as you no doubt might have been, more than a month
11946: ago,” said Mrs. Gascoigne, feeling that she had to discharge a duty on
11947: this occasion. “But now there is no more room for caprice; indeed, I
11948: trust you have no inclination to any. A woman has a great debt of
11949: gratitude to a man who perseveres in making her such an offer. But no
11950: doubt you feel properly.”
11951: 
11952: “I am not at all sure that I do, aunt,” said Gwendolen, with saucy
11953: gravity. “I don’t know everything it is proper to feel on being
11954: engaged.”
11955: 
11956: The rector patted her shoulder and smiled as at a bit of innocent
11957: naughtiness, and his wife took his behavior as an indication that she
11958: was not to be displeased. As for Anna, she kissed Gwendolen and said,
11959: “I do hope you will be happy,” but then sank into the background and
11960: tried to keep the tears back too. In the late days she had been
11961: imagining a little romance about Rex—how if he still longed for
11962: Gwendolen her heart might be softened by trouble into love, so that
11963: they could by-and-by be married. And the romance had turned to a prayer
11964: that she, Anna, might be able to rejoice like a good sister, and only
11965: think of being useful in working for Gwendolen, as long as Rex was not
11966: rich. But now she wanted grace to rejoice in something else. Miss Merry
11967: and the four girls, Alice with the high shoulders, Bertha and Fanny the
11968: whisperers, and Isabel the listener, were all present on this family
11969: occasion, when everything seemed appropriately turning to the honor and
11970: glory of Gwendolen, and real life was as interesting as “Sir Charles
11971: Grandison.” The evening passed chiefly in decisive remarks from the
11972: rector, in answer to conjectures from the two elder ladies. According
11973: to him, the case was not one in which he could think it his duty to
11974: mention settlements: everything must, and doubtless would safely be
11975: left to Mr. Grandcourt.
11976: 
11977: “I should like to know exactly what sort of places Ryelands and
11978: Gadsmere are,” said Mrs. Davilow.
11979: 
11980: “Gadsmere, I believe, is a secondary place,” said Mr. Gascoigne; “But
11981: Ryelands I know to be one of our finest seats. The park is extensive
11982: and the woods of a very valuable order. The house was built by Inigo
11983: Jones, and the ceilings are painted in the Italian style. The estate is
11984: said to be worth twelve thousand a year, and there are two livings, one
11985: a rectory, in the gift of the Grandcourts. There may be some burdens on
11986: the land. Still, Mr. Grandcourt was an only child.”
11987: 
11988: “It would be most remarkable,” said Mrs. Gascoigne, “if he were to
11989: become Lord Stannery in addition to everything else. Only think: there
11990: is the Grandcourt estate, the Mallinger estate, _and_ the baronetcy,
11991: _and_ the peerage,”—she was marking off the items on her fingers, and
11992: paused on the fourth while she added, “but they say there will be no
11993: land coming to him with the peerage.” It seemed a pity there was
11994: nothing for the fifth finger.
11995: 
11996: “The peerage,” said the rector, judiciously, “must be regarded as a
11997: remote chance. There are two cousins between the present peer and Mr.
11998: Grandcourt. It is certainly a serious reflection how death and other
11999: causes do sometimes concentrate inheritances on one man. But an excess
12000: of that kind is to be deprecated. To be Sir Mallinger Grandcourt
12001: Mallinger—I suppose that will be his style—with corresponding
12002: properties, is a valuable talent enough for any man to have committed
12003: to him. Let us hope it will be well used.”
12004: 
12005: “And what a position for the wife, Gwendolen!” said Mrs. Gascoigne; “a
12006: great responsibility indeed. But you must lose no time in writing to
12007: Mrs. Mompert, Henry. It is a good thing that you have an engagement of
12008: marriage to offer as an excuse, else she might feel offended. She is
12009: rather a high woman.”
12010: 
12011: “I am rid of that horror,” thought Gwendolen, to whom the name of
12012: Mompert had become a sort of Mumbo-jumbo. She was very silent through
12013: the evening, and that night could hardly sleep at all in her little
12014: white bed. It was a rarity in her strong youth to be wakeful: and
12015: perhaps a still greater rarity for her to be careful that her mother
12016: should not know of her restlessness. But her state of mind was
12017: altogether new: she who had been used to feel sure of herself, and
12018: ready to manage others, had just taken a decisive step which she had
12019: beforehand thought that she would not take—nay, perhaps, was bound not
12020: to take. She could not go backward now; she liked a great deal of what
12021: lay before her; and there was nothing for her to like if she went back.
12022: But her resolution was dogged by the shadow of that previous resolve
12023: which had at first come as the undoubting movement of her whole being.
12024: While she lay on her pillow with wide-open eyes, “looking on darkness
12025: which the blind do see,” she was appalled by the idea that she was
12026: going to do what she had once started away from with repugnance. It was
12027: new to her that a question of right or wrong in her conduct should
12028: rouse her terror; she had known no compunction that atoning caresses
12029: and presents could not lay to rest. But here had come a moment when
12030: something like a new consciousness was awaked. She seemed on the edge
12031: of adopting deliberately, as a notion for all the rest of her life,
12032: what she had rashly said in her bitterness, when her discovery had
12033: driven her away to Leubronn:—that it did not signify what she did; she
12034: had only to amuse herself as best she could. That lawlessness, that
12035: casting away of all care for justification, suddenly frightened her: it
12036: came to her with the shadowy array of possible calamity behind
12037: it—calamity which had ceased to be a mere name for her; and all the
12038: infiltrated influences of disregarded religious teaching, as well as
12039: the deeper impressions of something awful and inexorable enveloping
12040: her, seemed to concentrate themselves in the vague conception of
12041: avenging power. The brilliant position she had longed for, the imagined
12042: freedom she would create for herself in marriage, the deliverance from
12043: the dull insignificance of her girlhood—all immediately before her;
12044: and yet they had come to her hunger like food with the taint of
12045: sacrilege upon it, which she must snatch with terror. In the darkness
12046: and loneliness of her little bed, her more resistant self could not act
12047: against the first onslaught of dread after her irrevocable decision.
12048: That unhappy-faced woman and her children—Grandcourt and his relations
12049: with her—kept repeating themselves in her imagination like the
12050: clinging memory of a disgrace, and gradually obliterated all other
12051: thought, leaving only the consciousness that she had taken those scenes
12052: into her life. Her long wakefulness seemed a delirium; a faint, faint
12053: light penetrated beside the window-curtain; the chillness increased.
12054: She could bear it no longer, and cried “Mamma!”
12055: 
12056: “Yes, dear,” said Mrs. Davilow, immediately, in a wakeful voice.
12057: 
12058: “Let me come to you.”
12059: 
12060: She soon went to sleep on her mother’s shoulder, and slept on till
12061: late, when, dreaming of a lit-up ball-room, she opened her eyes on her
12062: mother standing by the bedside with a small packet in her hand.
12063: 
12064: “I am sorry to wake you, darling, but I thought it better to give you
12065: this at once. The groom has brought Criterion; he has come on another
12066: horse, and says he is to stay here.”
12067: 
12068: Gwendolen sat up in bed and opened the packet. It was a delicate
12069: enameled casket, and inside was a splendid diamond ring with a letter
12070: which contained a folded bit of colored paper and these words:
12071: 
12072:     Pray wear this ring when I come at twelve in sign of our betrothal. I
12073:     enclose a check drawn in the name of Mr. Gascoigne, for immediate
12074:     expenses. Of course Mrs. Davilow will remain at Offendene, at least
12075:     for some time. I hope, when I come, you will have granted me an early
12076:     day, when you may begin to command me at a shorter distance.—Yours
12077:     devotedly,
12078: 
12079:                                          H. M. GRANDCOURT.
12080: 
12081: The check was for five hundred pounds, and Gwendolen turned it toward
12082: her mother, with the letter.
12083: 
12084: “How very kind and delicate!” said Mrs. Davilow, with much feeling.
12085: “But I really should like better not to be dependent on a son-in-law. I
12086: and the girls could get along very well.”
12087: 
12088: “Mamma, if you say that again, I will not marry him,” said Gwendolen,
12089: angrily.
12090: 
12091: “My dear child, I trust you are not going to marry only for my sake,”
12092: said Mrs. Davilow, deprecatingly.
12093: 
12094: Gwendolen tossed her head on the pillow away from her mother, and let
12095: the ring lie. She was irritated at this attempt to take away a motive.
12096: Perhaps the deeper cause of her irritation was the consciousness that
12097: she was not going to marry solely for her mamma’s sake—that she was
12098: drawn toward the marriage in ways against which stronger reasons than
12099: her mother’s renunciation were yet not strong enough to hinder her. She
12100: had waked up to the signs that she was irrevocably engaged, and all the
12101: ugly visions, the alarms, the arguments of the night, must be met by
12102: daylight, in which probably they would show themselves weak. “What I
12103: long for is your happiness, dear,” continued Mrs. Davilow, pleadingly.
12104: “I will not say anything to vex you. Will you not put on the ring?”
12105: 
12106: For a few moments Gwendolen did not answer, but her thoughts were
12107: active. At last she raised herself with a determination to do as she
12108: would do if she had started on horseback, and go on with spirit,
12109: whatever ideas might be running in her head.
12110: 
12111: “I thought the lover always put on the betrothal ring himself,” she
12112: said laughingly, slipping the ring on her finger, and looking at it
12113: with a charming movement of her head. “I know why he has sent it,” she
12114: added, nodding at her mamma.
12115: 
12116: “Why?”
12117: 
12118: “He would rather make me put it on than ask me to let him do it. Aha!
12119: he is very proud. But so am I. We shall match each other. I should hate
12120: a man who went down on his knees, and came fawning on me. He really is
12121: not disgusting.”
12122: 
12123: “That is very moderate praise, Gwen.”
12124: 
12125: “No, it is not, for a man,” said Gwendolen gaily. “But now I must get
12126: up and dress. Will you come and do my hair, mamma, dear,” she went on,
12127: drawing down her mamma’s face to caress it with her own cheeks, “and
12128: not be so naughty any more as to talk of living in poverty? You must
12129: bear to be made comfortable, even if you don’t like it. And Mr.
12130: Grandcourt behaves perfectly, now, does he not?”
12131: 
12132: “Certainly he does,” said Mrs. Davilow, encouraged, and persuaded that
12133: after all Gwendolen was fond of her betrothed. She herself thought him
12134: a man whose attentions were likely to tell on a girl’s feeling. Suitors
12135: must often be judged as words are, by the standing and the figure they
12136: make in polite society: it is difficult to know much else of them. And
12137: all the mother’s anxiety turned not on Grandcourt’s character, but on
12138: Gwendolen’s mood in accepting him.
12139: 
12140: The mood was necessarily passing through a new phase this morning. Even
12141: in the hour of making her toilet, she had drawn on all the knowledge
12142: she had for grounds to justify her marriage. And what she most dwelt on
12143: was the determination, that when she was Grandcourt’s wife, she would
12144: urge him to the most liberal conduct toward Mrs. Glasher’s children.
12145: 
12146: “Of what use would it be to her that I should not marry him? He could
12147: have married her if he liked; but he did _not_ like. Perhaps she is to
12148: blame for that. There must be a great deal about her that I know
12149: nothing of. And he must have been good to her in many ways, else she
12150: would not have wanted to marry him.”
12151: 
12152: But that last argument at once began to appear doubtful. Mrs. Glasher
12153: naturally wished to exclude other children who would stand between
12154: Grandcourt and her own: and Gwendolen’s comprehension of this feeling
12155: prompted another way of reconciling claims.
12156: 
12157: “Perhaps we shall have no children. I hope we shall not. And he might
12158: leave the estate to the pretty little boy. My uncle said that Mr.
12159: Grandcourt could do as he liked with the estates. Only when Sir Hugo
12160: Mallinger dies there will be enough for two.”
12161: 
12162: This made Mrs. Glasher appear quite unreasonable in demanding that her
12163: boy should be sole heir; and the double property was a security that
12164: Grandcourt’s marriage would do her no wrong, when the wife was
12165: Gwendolen Harleth with all her proud resolution not to be fairly
12166: accused. This maiden had been accustomed to think herself blameless;
12167: other persons only were faulty.
12168: 
12169: It was striking, that in the hold which this argument of her doing no
12170: wrong to Mrs. Glasher had taken on her mind, her repugnance to the idea
12171: of Grandcourt’s past had sunk into a subordinate feeling. The terror
12172: she had felt in the night-watches at overstepping the border of
12173: wickedness by doing what she had at first felt to be wrong, had dulled
12174: any emotions about his conduct. She was thinking of him, whatever he
12175: might be, as a man over whom she was going to have indefinite power;
12176: and her loving him having never been a question with her, any
12177: agreeableness he had was so much gain. Poor Gwendolen had no awe of
12178: unmanageable forces in the state of matrimony, but regarded it as
12179: altogether a matter of management, in which she would know how to act.
12180: In relation to Grandcourt’s past she encouraged new doubts whether he
12181: were likely to have differed much from other men; and she devised
12182: little schemes for learning what was expected of men in general.
12183: 
12184: But whatever else might be true in the world, her hair was dressed
12185: suitably for riding, and she went down in her riding-habit, to avoid
12186: delay before getting on horseback. She wanted to have her blood stirred
12187: once more with the intoxication of youth, and to recover the daring
12188: with which she had been used to think of her course in life. Already a
12189: load was lifted off her; for in daylight and activity it was less
12190: oppressive to have doubts about her choice, than to feel that she had
12191: no choice but to endure insignificance and servitude.
12192: 
12193: “Go back and make yourself look like a duchess, mamma,” she said,
12194: turning suddenly as she was going down-stairs. “Put your point-lace
12195: over your head. I must have you look like a duchess. You must not take
12196: things humbly.”
12197: 
12198: When Grandcourt raised her left hand gently and looked at the ring, she
12199: said gravely, “It was very good of you to think of everything and send
12200: me that packet.”
12201: 
12202: “You will tell me if there is anything I forget?” he said, keeping the
12203: hand softly within his own. “I will do anything you wish.”
12204: 
12205: “But I am very unreasonable in my wishes,” said Gwendolen, smiling.
12206: 
12207: “Yes, I expect that. Women always are.”
12208: 
12209: “Then I will not be unreasonable,” said Gwendolen, taking away her hand
12210: and tossing her head saucily. “I will not be told that I am what women
12211: always are.”
12212: 
12213: “I did not say that,” said Grandcourt, looking at her with his usual
12214: gravity. “You are what no other woman is.”
12215: 
12216: “And what is that, pray?” said Gwendolen, moving to a distance with a
12217: little air of menace.
12218: 
12219: Grandcourt made his pause before he answered. “You are the woman I
12220: love.”
12221: 
12222: “Oh, what nice speeches!” said Gwendolen, laughing. The sense of that
12223: love which he must once have given to another woman under strange
12224: circumstances was getting familiar.
12225: 
12226: “Give me a nice speech in return. Say when we are to be married.”
12227: 
12228: “Not yet. Not till we have had a gallop over the downs. I am so thirsty
12229: for that, I can think of nothing else. I wish the hunting had begun.
12230: Sunday the twentieth, twenty-seventh, Monday, Tuesday.” Gwendolen was
12231: counting on her fingers with the prettiest nod while she looked at
12232: Grandcourt, and at last swept one palm over the other while she said
12233: triumphantly, “It will begin in ten days!”
12234: 
12235: “Let us be married in ten days, then,” said Grandcourt, “and we shall
12236: not be bored about the stables.”
12237: 
12238: “What do women always say in answer to that?” said Gwendolen,
12239: mischievously.
12240: 
12241: “They agree to it,” said the lover, rather off his guard.
12242: 
12243: “Then I will not!” said Gwendolen, taking up her gauntlets and putting
12244: them on, while she kept her eyes on him with gathering fun in them.
12245: 
12246: The scene was pleasant on both sides. A cruder lover would have lost
12247: the view of her pretty ways and attitudes, and spoiled all by stupid
12248: attempts at caresses, utterly destructive of drama. Grandcourt
12249: preferred the drama; and Gwendolen, left at ease, found her spirits
12250: rising continually as she played at reigning. Perhaps if Klesmer had
12251: seen more of her in this unconscious kind of acting, instead of when
12252: she was trying to be theatrical, he might have rated her chance higher.
12253: 
12254: When they had had a glorious gallop, however, she was in a state of
12255: exhilaration that disposed her to think well of hastening the marriage
12256: which would make her life all of apiece with this splendid kind of
12257: enjoyment. She would not debate any more about an act to which she had
12258: committed herself; and she consented to fix the wedding on that day
12259: three weeks, notwithstanding the difficulty of fulfilling the customary
12260: laws of the _trousseau_.
12261: 
12262: Lush, of course, was made aware of the engagement by abundant signs,
12263: without being formally told. But he expected some communication as a
12264: consequence of it, and after a few days he became rather impatient
12265: under Grandcourt’s silence, feeling sure that the change would affect
12266: his personal prospects, and wishing to know exactly how. His tactics no
12267: longer included any opposition—which he did not love for its own sake.
12268: He might easily cause Grandcourt a great deal of annoyance, but it
12269: would be to his own injury, and to create annoyance was not a motive
12270: with him. Miss Gwendolen he would certainly not have been sorry to
12271: frustrate a little, but—after all there was no knowing what would
12272: come. It was nothing new that Grandcourt should show a perverse
12273: wilfulness; yet in his freak about this girl he struck Lush rather
12274: newly as something like a man who was _fey_—led on by an ominous
12275: fatality; and that one born to his fortune should make a worse business
12276: of his life than was necessary, seemed really pitiable. Having
12277: protested against the marriage, Lush had a second-sight for its evil
12278: consequences. Grandcourt had been taking the pains to write letters and
12279: give orders himself instead of employing Lush, and appeared to be
12280: ignoring his usefulness, even choosing, against the habit of years, to
12281: breakfast alone in his dressing-room. But a _tête-à-tête_ was not to be
12282: avoided in a house empty of guests; and Lush hastened to use an
12283: opportunity of saying—it was one day after dinner, for there were
12284: difficulties in Grandcourt’s dining at Offendene,
12285: 
12286: “And when is the marriage to take place?”
12287: 
12288: Grandcourt, who drank little wine, had left the table and was lounging,
12289: while he smoked, in an easy chair near the hearth, where a fire of oak
12290: boughs was gaping to its glowing depths, and edging them with a
12291: delicate tint of ashes delightful to behold. The chair of red-brown
12292: velvet brocade was a becoming background for his pale-tinted, well-cut
12293: features and exquisite long hands. Omitting the cigar, you might have
12294: imagined him a portrait by Moroni, who would have rendered wonderfully
12295: the impenetrable gaze and air of distinction; and a portrait by that
12296: great master would have been quite as lively a companion as Grandcourt
12297: was disposed to be. But he answered without unusual delay.
12298: 
12299: “On the tenth.”
12300: 
12301: “I suppose you intend to remain here.”
12302: 
12303: “We shall go to Ryelands for a little while; but we shall return here
12304: for the sake of the hunting.”
12305: 
12306: After this word there was the languid inarticulate sound frequent with
12307: Grandcourt when he meant to continue speaking, and Lush waited for
12308: something more. Nothing came, and he was going to put another question,
12309: when the inarticulate sound began again and introduced the mildly
12310: uttered suggestion,
12311: 
12312: “You had better make some new arrangement for yourself.”
12313: 
12314: “What! I am to cut and run?” said Lush, prepared to be good-tempered on
12315: the occasion.
12316: 
12317: “Something of that kind.”
12318: 
12319: “The bride objects to me. I hope she will make up to you for the want
12320: of my services.”
12321: 
12322: “I can’t help your being so damnably disagreeable to women,” said
12323: Grandcourt, in soothing apology.
12324: 
12325: “To one woman, if you please.”
12326: 
12327: “It makes no difference since she is the one in question.”
12328: 
12329: “I suppose I am not to be turned adrift after fifteen years without
12330: some provision.”
12331: 
12332: “You must have saved something out of me.”
12333: 
12334: “Deuced little. I have often saved something for you.”
12335: 
12336: “You can have three hundred a year. But you must live in town and be
12337: ready to look after things when I want you. I shall be rather hard up.”
12338: 
12339: “If you are not going to be at Ryelands this winter, I might run down
12340: there and let you know how Swinton goes on.”
12341: 
12342: “If you like. I don’t care a toss where you are, so that you keep out
12343: of sight.”
12344: 
12345: “Much obliged,” said Lush, able to take the affair more easily than he
12346: had expected. He was supported by the secret belief that he should
12347: by-and-by be wanted as much as ever.
12348: 
12349: “Perhaps you will not object to packing up as soon as possible,” said
12350: Grandcourt. “The Torringtons are coming, and Miss Harleth will be
12351: riding over here.”
12352: 
12353: “With all my heart. Can’t I be of use in going to Gadsmere?”
12354: 
12355: “No. I am going myself.”
12356: 
12357: “About your being rather hard up. Have you thought of that plan—”
12358: 
12359: “Just leave me alone, will you?” said Grandcourt, in his lowest audible
12360: tone, tossing his cigar into the fire, and rising to walk away.
12361: 
12362: He spent the evening in the solitude of the smaller drawing-room,
12363: where, with various new publications on the table of the kind a
12364: gentleman may like to have on hand without touching, he employed
12365: himself (as a philosopher might have done) in sitting meditatively on
12366: the sofa and abstaining from literature—political, comic, cynical, or
12367: romantic. In this way hours may pass surprisingly soon, without the
12368: arduous invisible chase of philosophy; not from love of thought, but
12369: from hatred of effort—from a state of the inward world, something like
12370: premature age, where the need for action lapses into a mere image of
12371: what has been, is, and may or might be; where impulse is born and dies
12372: in a phantasmal world, pausing in rejection of even a shadowy
12373: fulfillment. That is a condition which often comes with whitening hair;
12374: and sometimes, too, an intense obstinacy and tenacity of rule, like the
12375: main trunk of an exorbitant egoism, conspicuous in proportion as the
12376: varied susceptibilities of younger years are stripped away.
12377: 
12378: But Grandcourt’s hair, though he had not much of it, was of a fine,
12379: sunny blonde, and his moods were not entirely to be explained as ebbing
12380: energy. We mortals have a strange spiritual chemistry going on within
12381: us, so that a lazy stagnation or even a cottony milkiness may be
12382: preparing one knows not what biting or explosive material. The navvy
12383: waking from sleep and without malice heaving a stone to crush the life
12384: out of his still sleeping comrade, is understood to lack the trained
12385: motive which makes a character fairly calculable in its actions; but by
12386: a roundabout course even a gentleman may make of himself a chancy
12387: personage, raising an uncertainty as to what he may do next, that sadly
12388: spoils companionship.
12389: 
12390: Grandcourt’s thoughts this evening were like the circlets one sees in a
12391: dark pool, continually dying out and continually started again by some
12392: impulse from below the surface. The deeper central impulse came from
12393: the image of Gwendolen; but the thoughts it stirred would be
12394: imperfectly illustrated by a reference to the amatory poets of all
12395: ages. It was characteristic that he got none of his satisfaction from
12396: the belief that Gwendolen was in love with him; and that love had
12397: overcome the jealous resentment which had made her run away from him.
12398: On the contrary, he believed that this girl was rather exceptional in
12399: the fact that, in spite of his assiduous attention to her, she was not
12400: in love with him; and it seemed to him very likely that if it had not
12401: been for the sudden poverty which had come over her family, she would
12402: not have accepted him. From the very first there had been an
12403: exasperating fascination in the tricksiness with which she had—not met
12404: his advances, but—wheeled away from them. She had been brought to
12405: accept him in spite of everything—brought to kneel down like a horse
12406: under training for the arena, though she might have an objection to it
12407: all the while. On the whole, Grandcourt got more pleasure out of this
12408: notion than he could have done out of winning a girl of whom he was
12409: sure that she had a strong inclination for him personally. And yet this
12410: pleasure in mastering reluctance flourished along with the habitual
12411: persuasion that no woman whom he favored could be quite indifferent to
12412: his personal influence; and it seemed to him not unlikely that
12413: by-and-by Gwendolen might be more enamored of him than he of her. In
12414: any case, she would have to submit; and he enjoyed thinking of her as
12415: his future wife, whose pride and spirit were suited to command every
12416: one but himself. He had no taste for a woman who was all tenderness to
12417: him, full of petitioning solicitude and willing obedience. He meant to
12418: be master of a woman who would have liked to master him, and who
12419: perhaps would have been capable of mastering another man.
12420: 
12421: Lush, having failed in his attempted reminder to Grandcourt, thought it
12422: well to communicate with Sir Hugo, in whom, as a man having perhaps
12423: interest enough to command the bestowal of some place where the work
12424: was light, gentlemanly, and not ill-paid, he was anxious to cultivate a
12425: sense of friendly obligation, not feeling at all secure against the
12426: future need of such a place. He wrote the following letter, and
12427: addressed it to Park Lane, whither he knew the family had returned from
12428: Leubronn:
12429: 
12430:     MY DEAR SIR HUGO—Since we came home the marriage has been absolutely
12431:     decided on, and is to take place in less than three weeks. It is so
12432:     far the worse for him that her mother has lately lost all her fortune,
12433:     and he will have to find supplies. Grandcourt, I know, is feeling the
12434:     want of cash; and unless some other plan is resorted to, he will be
12435:     raising money in a foolish way. I am going to leave Diplow
12436:     immediately, and I shall not be able to start the topic. What I should
12437:     advise is, that Mr. Deronda, who I know has your confidence, should
12438:     propose to come and pay a short visit here, according to invitation
12439:     (there are going to be other people in the house), and that you should
12440:     put him fully in possession of your wishes and the possible extent of
12441:     your offer. Then, that he should introduce the subject to Grandcourt
12442:     so as not to imply that you suspect any particular want of money on
12443:     his part, but only that there is a strong wish on yours. What I have
12444:     formerly said to him has been in the way of a conjecture that you
12445:     might be willing to give a good sum for his chance of Diplow; but if
12446:     Mr. Deronda came armed with a definite offer, that would take another
12447:     sort of hold. Ten to one he will not close for some time to come; but
12448:     the proposal will have got a stronger lodgment in his mind; and though
12449:     at present he has a great notion of the hunting here, I see a
12450:     likelihood, under the circumstances, that he will get a distaste for
12451:     the neighborhood, and there will be the notion of the money sticking
12452:     by him without being urged. I would bet on your ultimate success. As I
12453:     am not to be exiled to Siberia, but am to be within call, it is
12454:     possible that, by and by, I may be of more service to you. But at
12455:     present I can think of no medium so good as Mr. Deronda. Nothing puts
12456:     Grandcourt in worse humor than having the lawyers thrust their paper
12457:     under his nose uninvited.
12458: 
12459:     Trusting that your visit to Leubronn has put you in excellent
12460:     condition  for the winter, I remain, my dear Sir Hugo, yours very
12461:     faithfully,
12462: 
12463:     THOMAS CRANMER LUSH.
12464: 
12465: Sir Hugo, having received this letter at breakfast, handed it to
12466: Deronda, who, though he had chambers in town, was somehow hardly ever
12467: in them, Sir Hugo not being contented without him. The chatty baronet
12468: would have liked a young companion even if there had been no peculiar
12469: reasons for attachment between them: one with a fine harmonious
12470: unspoiled face fitted to keep up a cheerful view of posterity and
12471: inheritance generally, notwithstanding particular disappointments; and
12472: his affection for Deronda was not diminished by the deep-lying though
12473: not obtrusive difference in their notions and tastes. Perhaps it was
12474: all the stronger; acting as the same sort of difference does between a
12475: man and a woman in giving a piquancy to the attachment which subsists
12476: in spite of it. Sir Hugo did not think unapprovingly of himself; but he
12477: looked at men and society from a liberal-menagerie point of view, and
12478: he had a certain pride in Deronda’s differing from him, which, if it
12479: had found voice, might have said—“You see this fine young fellow—not
12480: such as you see every day, is he?—he belongs to me in a sort of way. I
12481: brought him up from a child; but you would not ticket him off easily,
12482: he has notions of his own, and he’s as far as the poles asunder from
12483: what I was at his age.” This state of feeling was kept up by the mental
12484: balance in Deronda, who was moved by an affectionateness such as we are
12485: apt to call feminine, disposing him to yield in ordinary details, while
12486: he had a certain inflexibility of judgment, and independence of
12487: opinion, held to be rightfully masculine.
12488: 
12489: When he had read the letter, he returned it without speaking, inwardly
12490: wincing under Lush’s mode of attributing a neutral usefulness to him in
12491: the family affairs.
12492: 
12493: “What do you say, Dan? It would be pleasant enough for you. You have
12494: not seen the place for a good many years now, and you might have a
12495: famous run with the harriers if you went down next week,” said Sir Hugo.
12496: 
12497: “I should not go on that account,” said Deronda, buttering his bread
12498: attentively. He had an objection to this transparent kind of
12499: persuasiveness, which all intelligent animals are seen to treat with
12500: indifference. If he went to Diplow he should be doing something
12501: disagreeable to oblige Sir Hugo.
12502: 
12503: “I think Lush’s notion is a good one. And it would be a pity to lose
12504: the occasion.”
12505: 
12506: “That is a different matter—if you think my going of importance to
12507: your object,” said Deronda, still with that aloofness of manner which
12508: implied some suppression. He knew that the baronet had set his heart on
12509: the affair.
12510: 
12511: “Why, you will see the fair gambler, the Leubronn Diana, I shouldn’t
12512: wonder,” said Sir Hugo, gaily. “We shall have to invite her to the
12513: Abbey, when they are married,” he added, turning to Lady Mallinger, as
12514: if she too had read the letter.
12515: 
12516: “I cannot conceive whom you mean,” said Lady Mallinger, who in fact had
12517: not been listening, her mind having been taken up with her first sips
12518: of coffee, the objectionable cuff of her sleeve, and the necessity of
12519: carrying Theresa to the dentist—innocent and partly laudable
12520: preoccupations, as the gentle lady’s usually were. Should her
12521: appearance be inquired after, let it be said that she had reddish
12522: blonde hair (the hair of the period), a small Roman nose, rather
12523: prominent blue eyes and delicate eyelids, with a figure which her
12524: thinner friends called fat, her hands showing curves and dimples like a
12525: magnified baby’s.
12526: 
12527: “I mean that Grandcourt is going to marry the girl you saw at
12528: Leubronn—don’t you remember her—the Miss Harleth who used to play at
12529: roulette.”
12530: 
12531: “Dear me! Is that a good match for him?”
12532: 
12533: “That depends on the sort of goodness he wants,” said Sir Hugo,
12534: smiling. “However, she and her friends have nothing, and she will bring
12535: him expenses. It’s a good match for my purposes, because if I am
12536: willing to fork out a sum of money, he may be willing to give up his
12537: chance of Diplow, so that we shall have it out and out, and when I die
12538: you will have the consolation of going to the place you would like to
12539: go to—wherever I may go.”
12540: 
12541: “I wish you would not talk of dying in that light way, dear.”
12542: 
12543: “It’s rather a heavy way, Lou, for I shall have to pay a heavy
12544: sum—forty thousand, at least.”
12545: 
12546: “But why are we to invite them to the Abbey?” said Lady Mallinger. “I
12547: do _not_ like women who gamble, like Lady Cragstone.”
12548: 
12549: “Oh, you will not mind her for a week. Besides, she is not like Lady
12550: Cragstone because she gambled a little, any more than I am like a
12551: broker because I’m a Whig. I want to keep Grandcourt in good humor, and
12552: to let him see plenty of this place, that he may think the less of
12553: Diplow. I don’t know yet whether I shall get him to meet me in this
12554: matter. And if Dan were to go over on a visit there, he might hold out
12555: the bait to him. It would be doing me a great service.” This was meant
12556: for Deronda.
12557: 
12558: “Daniel is not fond of Mr. Grandcourt, I think, is he?” said Lady
12559: Mallinger, looking at Deronda inquiringly.
12560: 
12561: “There is no avoiding everybody one doesn’t happen to be fond of,” said
12562: Deronda. “I will go to Diplow—I don’t know that I have anything better
12563: to do—since Sir Hugo wishes it.”
12564: 
12565: “That’s a trump!” said Sir Hugo, well pleased. “And if you don’t find
12566: it very pleasant, it’s so much experience. Nothing used to come amiss
12567: to me when I was young. You must see men and manners.”
12568: 
12569: “Yes; but I have seen that man, and something of his manners too,” said
12570: Deronda.
12571: 
12572: “Not nice manners, I think,” said Lady Mallinger.
12573: 
12574: “Well, you see they succeed with your sex,” said Sir Hugo, provokingly.
12575: “And he was an uncommonly good-looking fellow when he was two or three
12576: and twenty—like his father. He doesn’t take after his father in
12577: marrying the heiress, though. If he had got Miss Arrowpoint and my land
12578: too, confound him, he would have had a fine principality.”
12579: 
12580: Deronda, in anticipating the projected visit, felt less disinclination
12581: than when consenting to it. The story of that girl’s marriage did
12582: interest him: what he had heard through Lush of her having run away
12583: from the suit of the man she was now going to take as a husband, had
12584: thrown a new sort of light on her gambling; and it was probably the
12585: transition from that fevered worldliness into poverty which had urged
12586: her acceptance where she must in some way have felt repulsion. All this
12587: implied a nature liable to difficulty and struggle—elements of life
12588: which had a predominant attraction for his sympathy, due perhaps to his
12589: early pain in dwelling on the conjectured story of his own existence.
12590: Persons attracted him, as Hans Meyrick had done, in proportion to the
12591: possibility of his defending them, rescuing them, telling upon their
12592: lives with some sort of redeeming influence; and he had to resist an
12593: inclination, easily accounted for, to withdraw coldly from the
12594: fortunate. But in the movement which had led him to repurchase
12595: Gwendolen’s necklace for her, and which was at work in him still, there
12596: was something beyond his habitual compassionate fervor—something due
12597: to the fascination of her womanhood. He was very open to that sort of
12598: charm, and mingled it with the consciously Utopian pictures of his own
12599: future; yet any one able to trace the folds of his character might have
12600: conceived that he would be more likely than many less passionate men to
12601: love a woman without telling her of it. Sprinkle food before a
12602: delicate-eared bird: there is nothing he would more willingly take, yet
12603: he keeps aloof, because of his sensibility to checks which to you are
12604: imperceptible. And one man differs from another, as we all differ from
12605: the Bosjesman, in a sensibility to checks, that come from variety of
12606: needs, spiritual or other. It seemed to foreshadow that capability of
12607: reticence in Deronda that his imagination was much occupied with two
12608: women, to neither of whom would he have held it possible that he should
12609: ever make love. Hans Meyrick had laughed at him for having something of
12610: the knight-errant in his disposition; and he would have found his proof
12611: if he had known what was just now going on in Deronda’s mind about
12612: Mirah and Gwendolen.
12613: 
12614: Deronda wrote without delay to announce his visit to Diplow, and
12615: received in reply a polite assurance that his coming would give great
12616: pleasure. That was not altogether untrue. Grandcourt thought it
12617: probable that the visit was prompted by Sir Hugo’s desire to court him
12618: for a purpose which he did not make up his mind to resist; and it was
12619: not a disagreeable idea to him that this fine fellow, whom he believed
12620: to be his cousin under the rose, would witness, perhaps with some
12621: jealousy, Henleigh Mallinger Grandcourt play the commanding part of
12622: betrothed lover to a splendid girl whom the cousin had already looked
12623: at with admiration.
12624: 
12625: Grandcourt himself was not jealous of anything unless it threatened his
12626: mastery—which he did not think himself likely to lose.
12627: 
12628: 
12629: 
12630: 
12631: CHAPTER XXIX.
12632: 
12633:   “Surely whoever speaks to me in the right voice,
12634:      him or her I shall follow.
12635:   As the water follows the moon, silently,
12636:      with fluid steps anywhere around the globe.”
12637:                                     —WALT WHITMAN.
12638: 
12639: 
12640: “Now my cousins are at Diplow,” said Grandcourt, “will you go
12641: there?—to-morrow? The carriage shall come for Mrs. Davilow. You can
12642: tell me what you would like done in the rooms. Things must be put in
12643: decent order while we are away at Ryelands. And to-morrow is the only
12644: day.”
12645: 
12646: He was sitting sideways on a sofa in the drawing-room at Offendene, one
12647: hand and elbow resting on the back, and the other hand thrust between
12648: his crossed knees—in the attitude of a man who is much interested in
12649: watching the person next to him. Gwendolen, who had always disliked
12650: needlework, had taken to it with apparent zeal since her engagement,
12651: and now held a piece of white embroidery which, on examination, would
12652: have shown many false stitches. During the last eight or nine days
12653: their hours had been chiefly spent on horseback, but some margin had
12654: always been left for this more difficult sort of companionship, which,
12655: however, Gwendolen had not found disagreeable. She was very well
12656: satisfied with Grandcourt. His answers to her lively questions about
12657: what he had seen and done in his life, bore drawling very well. From
12658: the first she had noticed that he knew what to say; and she was
12659: constantly feeling not only that he had nothing of the fool in his
12660: composition, but that by some subtle means he communicated to her the
12661: impression that all the folly lay with other people, who did what he
12662: did not care to do. A man who seems to have been able to command the
12663: best, has a sovereign power of depreciation. Then Grandcourt’s behavior
12664: as a lover had hardly at all passed the limit of an amorous homage
12665: which was inobtrusive as a wafted odor of roses, and spent all its
12666: effects in a gratified vanity. One day, indeed, he had kissed not her
12667: cheek but her neck a little below her ear; and Gwendolen, taken by
12668: surprise, had started up with a marked agitation which made him rise
12669: too and say, “I beg your pardon—did I annoy you?” “Oh, it was
12670: nothing,” said Gwendolen, rather afraid of herself, “only I cannot
12671: bear—to be kissed under my ear.” She sat down again with a little
12672: playful laugh, but all the while she felt her heart beating with a
12673: vague fear: she was no longer at liberty to flout him as she had
12674: flouted poor Rex. Her agitation seemed not uncomplimentary, and he had
12675: been contented not to transgress again.
12676: 
12677: To-day a slight rain hindered riding; but to compensate, a package had
12678: come from London, and Mrs. Davilow had just left the room after
12679: bringing in for admiration the beautiful things (of Grandcourt’s
12680: ordering) which lay scattered about on the tables. Gwendolen was just
12681: then enjoying the scenery of her life. She let her hands fall on her
12682: lap, and said with a pretty air of perversity,
12683: 
12684: “Why is to-morrow the only day?”
12685: 
12686: “Because the next day is the first with the hounds,” said Grandcourt.
12687: 
12688: “And after that?”
12689: 
12690: “After that I must go away for a couple of days—it’s a bore—but I
12691: shall go one day and come back the next.” Grandcourt noticed a change
12692: in her face, and releasing his hand from under his knees, he laid it on
12693: hers, and said, “You object to my going away?”
12694: 
12695: “It’s no use objecting,” said Gwendolen, coldly. She was resisting to
12696: the utmost her temptation to tell him that she suspected to whom he was
12697: going—the temptation to make a clean breast, speaking without
12698: restraint.
12699: 
12700: “Yes it is,” said Grandcourt, enfolding her hand. “I will put off
12701: going. And I will travel at night, so as only to be away one day.” He
12702: thought that he knew the reason of what he inwardly called this bit of
12703: temper, and she was particularly fascinating to him at this moment.
12704: 
12705: “Then don’t put off going, but travel at night,” said Gwendolen,
12706: feeling that she could command him, and finding in this peremptoriness
12707: a small outlet for her irritation.
12708: 
12709: “Then you will go to Diplow to-morrow?”
12710: 
12711: “Oh, yes, if you wish it,” said Gwendolen, in a high tone of careless
12712: assent. Her concentration in other feelings had really hindered her
12713: from taking notice that her hand was being held.
12714: 
12715: “How you treat us poor devils of men!” said Grandcourt, lowering his
12716: tone. “We are always getting the worst of it.”
12717: 
12718: “_Are_ you?” said Gwendolen, in a tone of inquiry, looking at him more
12719: naively than usual. She longed to believe this commonplace _badinage_
12720: as the serious truth about her lover: in that case, she too was
12721: justified. If she knew everything, Mrs. Glasher would appear more
12722: blamable than Grandcourt. “_Are_ you always getting the worst?”
12723: 
12724: “Yes. Are you as kind to me as I am to you?” said Grandcourt, looking
12725: into her eyes with his narrow gaze.
12726: 
12727: Gwendolen felt herself stricken. She was conscious of having received
12728: so much, that her sense of command was checked, and sank away in the
12729: perception that, look around her as she might, she could not turn back:
12730: it was as if she had consented to mount a chariot where another held
12731: the reins; and it was not in her nature to leap out in the eyes of the
12732: world. She had not consented in ignorance, and all she could say now
12733: would be a confession that she had not been ignorant. Her right to
12734: explanation was gone. All she had to do now was to adjust herself, so
12735: that the spikes of that unwilling penance which conscience imposed
12736: should not gall her. With a sort of mental shiver, she resolutely
12737: changed her mental attitude. There had been a little pause, during
12738: which she had not turned away her eyes; and with a sudden break into a
12739: smile, she said,
12740: 
12741: “If I were as kind to you as you are to me, that would spoil your
12742: generosity: it would no longer be as great as it could be—and it is
12743: that now.”
12744: 
12745: “Then I am not to ask for one kiss,” said Grandcourt, contented to pay
12746: a large price for this new kind of love-making, which introduced
12747: marriage by the finest contrast.
12748: 
12749: “Not one?” said Gwendolen, getting saucy, and nodding at him defiantly.
12750: 
12751: He lifted her little left hand to his lips, and then released it
12752: respectfully. Clearly it was faint praise to say of him that he was not
12753: disgusting: he was almost charming; and she felt at this moment that it
12754: was not likely she could ever have loved another man better than this
12755: one. His reticence gave her some inexplicable, delightful consciousness.
12756: 
12757: “Apropos,” she said, taking up her work again, “is there any one
12758: besides Captain and Mrs. Torrington at Diplow?—or do you leave them
12759: _tête-à-tête_? I suppose he converses in cigars, and she answers with
12760: her chignon.”
12761: 
12762: “She has a sister with her,” said Grandcourt, with his shadow of a
12763: smile, “and there are two men besides—one of them you know, I believe.”
12764: 
12765: “Ah, then, I have a poor opinion of him,” said Gwendolen, shaking her
12766: head.
12767: 
12768: “You saw him at Leubronn—young Deronda—a young fellow with the
12769: Mallingers.”
12770: 
12771: Gwendolen felt as if her heart were making a sudden gambol, and her
12772: fingers, which tried to keep a firm hold on her work, got cold.
12773: 
12774: “I never spoke to him,” she said, dreading any discernible change in
12775: herself. “Is he not disagreeable?”
12776: 
12777: “No, not particularly,” said Grandcourt, in his most languid way. “He
12778: thinks a little too much of himself. I thought he had been introduced
12779: to you.”
12780: 
12781: “No. Some one told me his name the evening before I came away. That was
12782: all. What is he?”
12783: 
12784: “A sort of ward of Sir Hugo Mallinger’s. Nothing of any consequence.”
12785: 
12786: “Oh, poor creature! How very unpleasant for him!” said Gwendolen,
12787: speaking from the lip, and not meaning any sarcasm. “I wonder if it has
12788: left off raining!” she added, rising and going to look out of the
12789: window.
12790: 
12791: Happily it did not rain the next day, and Gwendolen rode to Diplow on
12792: Criterion as she had done on that former day when she returned with her
12793: mother in the carriage. She always felt the more daring for being in
12794: her riding-dress; besides having the agreeable belief that she looked
12795: as well as possible in it—a sustaining consciousness in any meeting
12796: which seems formidable. Her anger toward Deronda had changed into a
12797: superstitious dread—due, perhaps, to the coercion he had exercised
12798: over her thought—lest the first interference of his in her life might
12799: foreshadow some future influence. It is of such stuff that
12800: superstitions are commonly made: an intense feeling about ourselves
12801: which makes the evening star shine at us with a threat, and the
12802: blessing of a beggar encourage us. And superstitions carry consequences
12803: which often verify their hope or their foreboding.
12804: 
12805: The time before luncheon was taken up for Gwendolen by going over the
12806: rooms with Mrs. Torrington and Mrs. Davilow; and she thought it likely
12807: that if she saw Deronda, there would hardly be need for more than a bow
12808: between them. She meant to notice him as little as possible.
12809: 
12810: And after all she found herself under an inward compulsion too strong
12811: for her pride. From the first moment of their being in the room
12812: together, she seemed to herself to be doing nothing but notice him;
12813: everything else was automatic performance of an habitual part.
12814: 
12815: When he took his place at lunch, Grandcourt had said, “Deronda, Miss
12816: Harleth tells me you were not introduced to her at Leubronn?”
12817: 
12818: “Miss Harleth hardly remembers me, I imagine,” said Deronda, looking at
12819: her quite simply, as they bowed. “She was intensely occupied when I saw
12820: her.”
12821: 
12822: Now, did he suppose that she had not suspected him of being the person
12823: who redeemed her necklace?
12824: 
12825: “On the contrary. I remember you very well,” said Gwendolen, feeling
12826: rather nervous, but governing herself and looking at him in return with
12827: new examination. “You did not approve of my playing at roulette.”
12828: 
12829: “How did you come to that conclusion?” said Deronda, gravely.
12830: 
12831: “Oh, you cast an evil eye on my play,” said Gwendolen, with a turn of
12832: her head and a smile. “I began to lose as soon as you came to look on.
12833: I had always been winning till then.”
12834: 
12835: “Roulette in such a kennel as Leubronn is a horrid bore,” said
12836: Grandcourt.
12837: 
12838: “_I_ found it a bore when I began to lose,” said Gwendolen. Her face
12839: was turned toward Grandcourt as she smiled and spoke, but she gave a
12840: sidelong glance at Deronda, and saw his eyes fixed on her with a look
12841: so gravely penetrating that it had a keener edge for her than his
12842: ironical smile at her losses—a keener edge than Klesmer’s judgment.
12843: She wheeled her neck round as if she wanted to listen to what was being
12844: said by the rest, while she was only thinking of Deronda. His face had
12845: that disturbing kind of form and expression which threatens to affect
12846: opinion—as if one’s standard was somehow wrong. (Who has not seen men
12847: with faces of this corrective power till they frustrated it by speech
12848: or action?) His voice, heard now for the first time, was to
12849: Grandcourt’s toneless drawl, which had been in her ears every day, as
12850: the deep notes of a violoncello to the broken discourse of poultry and
12851: other lazy gentry in the afternoon sunshine. Grandcourt, she inwardly
12852: conjectured, was perhaps right in saying that Deronda thought too much
12853: of himself:—a favorite way of explaining a superiority that
12854: humiliates. However the talk turned on the rinderpest and Jamaica, and
12855: no more was said about roulette. Grandcourt held that the Jamaica negro
12856: was a beastly sort of baptist Caliban; Deronda said he had always felt
12857: a little with Caliban, who naturally had his own point of view and
12858: could sing a good song; Mrs. Davilow observed that her father had an
12859: estate in Barbadoes, but that she herself had never been in the West
12860: Indies; Mrs. Torrington was sure she should never sleep in her bed if
12861: she lived among blacks; her husband corrected her by saying that the
12862: blacks would be manageable enough if it were not for the half-breeds;
12863: and Deronda remarked that the whites had to thank themselves for the
12864: half-breeds.
12865: 
12866: While this polite pea-shooting was going on, Gwendolen trifled with her
12867: jelly, and looked at every speaker in turn that she might feel at ease
12868: in looking at Deronda.
12869: 
12870: “I wonder what he thinks of me, really? He must have felt interested in
12871: me, else he would not have sent me my necklace. I wonder what he thinks
12872: of my marriage? What notions has he to make him so grave about things?
12873: Why is he come to Diplow?”
12874: 
12875: These questions ran in her mind as the voice of an uneasy longing to be
12876: judged by Deronda with unmixed admiration—a longing which had had its
12877: seed in her first resentment at his critical glance. Why did she care
12878: so much about the opinion of this man who was “nothing of any
12879: consequence”? She had no time to find the reason—she was too much
12880: engaged in caring. In the drawing-room, when something had called
12881: Grandcourt away, she went quite unpremeditatedly up to Deronda, who was
12882: standing at a table apart, turning over some prints, and said to him,
12883: 
12884: “Shall you hunt to-morrow, Mr. Deronda?”
12885: 
12886: “Yes, I believe so.”
12887: 
12888: “You don’t object to hunting, then?”
12889: 
12890: “I find excuses for it. It is a sin I am inclined to—when I can’t get
12891: boating or cricketing.”
12892: 
12893: “Do you object to my hunting?” said Gwendolen, with a saucy movement of
12894: the chin.
12895: 
12896: “I have no right to object to anything you choose to do.”
12897: 
12898: “You thought you had a right to object to my gambling,” persisted
12899: Gwendolen.
12900: 
12901: “I was sorry for it. I am not aware that I told you of my objection,”
12902: said Deronda, with his usual directness of gaze—a large-eyed gravity,
12903: innocent of any intention. His eyes had a peculiarity which has drawn
12904: many men into trouble; they were of a dark yet mild intensity which
12905: seemed to express a special interest in every one on whom he fixed
12906: them, and might easily help to bring on him those claims which ardently
12907: sympathetic people are often creating in the minds of those who need
12908: help. In mendicant fashion we make the goodness of others a reason for
12909: exorbitant demands on them. That sort of effect was penetrating
12910: Gwendolen.
12911: 
12912: “You hindered me from gambling again,” she answered. But she had no
12913: sooner spoken than she blushed over face and neck; and Deronda blushed,
12914: too, conscious that in the little affair of the necklace he had taken a
12915: questionable freedom.
12916: 
12917: It was impossible to speak further; and she turned away to a window,
12918: feeling that she had stupidly said what she had not meant to say, and
12919: yet being rather happy that she had plunged into this mutual
12920: understanding. Deronda also did not dislike it. Gwendolen seemed more
12921: decidedly attractive than before; and certainly there had been changes
12922: going on within her since that time at Leubronn: the struggle of mind
12923: attending a conscious error had wakened something like a new soul,
12924: which had better, but also worse, possibilities than her former poise
12925: of crude self-confidence: among the forces she had come to dread was
12926: something within her that troubled satisfaction.
12927: 
12928: That evening Mrs. Davilow said, “Was it really so, or only a joke of
12929: yours, about Mr. Deronda’s spoiling your play, Gwen?”
12930: 
12931: Her curiosity had been excited, and she could venture to ask a question
12932: that did not concern Mr. Grandcourt.
12933: 
12934: “Oh, it merely happened that he was looking on when I began to lose,”
12935: said Gwendolen, carelessly. “I noticed him.”
12936: 
12937: “I don’t wonder at that: he is a striking young man. He puts me in mind
12938: of Italian paintings. One would guess, without being told, that there
12939: was foreign blood in his veins.”
12940: 
12941: “Is there?” said Gwendolen.
12942: 
12943: “Mrs. Torrington says so. I asked particularly who he was, and she told
12944: me that his mother was some foreigner of high rank.”
12945: 
12946: “His mother?” said Gwendolen, rather sharply. “Then who was his father?”
12947: 
12948: “Well—every one says he is the son of Sir Hugo Mallinger, who brought
12949: him up; though he passes for a ward. She says, if Sir Hugo Mallinger
12950: could have done as he liked with his estates, he would have left them
12951: to this Mr. Deronda, since he has no legitimate son.”
12952: 
12953: Gwendolen was silent; but her mother observed so marked an effect in
12954: her face that she was angry with herself for having repeated Mrs.
12955: Torrington’s gossip. It seemed, on reflection, unsuited to the ear of
12956: her daughter, for whom Mrs. Davilow disliked what is called knowledge
12957: of the world; and indeed she wished that she herself had not had any of
12958: it thrust upon her.
12959: 
12960: An image which had immediately arisen in Gwendolen’s mind was that of
12961: the unknown mother—no doubt a dark-eyed woman—probably sad. Hardly
12962: any face could be less like Deronda’s than that represented as Sir
12963: Hugo’s in a crayon portrait at Diplow. A dark-eyed woman, no longer
12964: young, had become “stuff o’ the conscience” to Gwendolen.
12965: 
12966: That night when she had got into her little bed, and only a dim light
12967: was burning, she said,
12968: 
12969: “Mamma, have men generally children before they are married?”
12970: 
12971: “No, dear, no,” said Mrs. Davilow. “Why do you ask such a question?”
12972: (But she began to think that she saw the why.)
12973: 
12974: “If it were so, I ought to know,” said Gwendolen, with some indignation.
12975: 
12976: “You are thinking of what I said about Mr. Deronda and Sir Hugo
12977: Mallinger. That is a very unusual case, dear.”
12978: 
12979: “Does Lady Mallinger know?”
12980: 
12981: “She knows enough to satisfy her. That is quite clear, because Mr.
12982: Deronda has lived with them.”
12983: 
12984: “And people think no worse of him?”
12985: 
12986: “Well, of course he is under some disadvantage: it is not as if he were
12987: Lady Mallinger’s son. He does not inherit the property, and he is not
12988: of any consequence in the world. But people are not obliged to know
12989: anything about his birth; you see, he is very well received.”
12990: 
12991: “I wonder whether he knows about it; and whether he is angry with his
12992: father?”
12993: 
12994: “My dear child, why should you think of that?”
12995: 
12996: “Why?” said Gwendolen, impetuously, sitting up in her bed. “Haven’t
12997: children reason to be angry with their parents? How can they help their
12998: parents marrying or not marrying?”
12999: 
13000: But a consciousness rushed upon her, which made her fall back again on
13001: her pillow. It was not only what she would have felt months
13002: before—that she might seem to be reproaching her mother for that
13003: second marriage of hers; what she chiefly felt now was that she had
13004: been led on to a condemnation which seemed to make her own marriage a
13005: forbidden thing.
13006: 
13007: There was no further talk, and till sleep came over her Gwendolen lay
13008: struggling with the reasons against that marriage—reasons which
13009: pressed upon her newly now that they were unexpectedly mirrored in the
13010: story of a man whose slight relations with her had, by some hidden
13011: affinity, bitten themselves into the most permanent layers of feeling.
13012: It was characteristic that, with all her debating, she was never
13013: troubled by the question whether the indefensibleness of her marriage
13014: did not include the fact that she had accepted Grandcourt solely as a
13015: man whom it was convenient for her to marry, not in the least as one to
13016: whom she would be binding herself in duty. Gwendolen’s ideas were
13017: pitiably crude; but many grand difficulties of life are apt to force
13018: themselves on us in our crudity. And to judge wisely, I suppose we must
13019: know how things appear to the unwise; that kind of appearance making
13020: the larger part of the world’s history.
13021: 
13022: In the morning there was a double excitement for her. She was going to
13023: hunt, from which scruples about propriety had threatened to hinder her,
13024: until it was found that Mrs. Torrington was horsewoman enough to
13025: accompany her—going to hunt for the first time since her escapade with
13026: Rex; and she was going again to see Deronda, in whom, since last night,
13027: her interest had so gathered that she expected, as people do about
13028: revealed celebrities, to see something in his appearance which she had
13029: missed before.
13030: 
13031: What was he going to be? What sort of life had he before him—he being
13032: nothing of any consequence? And with only a little difference in events
13033: he might have been as important as Grandcourt, nay—her imagination
13034: inevitably went into that direction—might have held the very estates
13035: which Grandcourt was to have. But now, Deronda would probably some day
13036: see her mistress of the Abbey at Topping, see her bearing the title
13037: which would have been his own wife’s. These obvious, futile thoughts of
13038: what might have been, made a new epoch for Gwendolen. She, whose
13039: unquestionable habit it had been to take the best that came to her for
13040: less than her own claim, had now to see the position which tempted her
13041: in a new light, as a hard, unfair exclusion of others. What she had now
13042: heard about Deronda seemed to her imagination to throw him into one
13043: group with Mrs. Glasher and her children; before whom she felt herself
13044: in an attitude of apology—she who had hitherto been surrounded by a
13045: group that in her opinion had need be apologetic to her. Perhaps
13046: Deronda himself was thinking of these things. Could he know of Mrs.
13047: Glasher? If he knew that she knew, he would despise her; but he could
13048: have no such knowledge. Would he, without that, despise her for
13049: marrying Grandcourt? His possible judgment of her actions was telling
13050: on her as importunately as Klesmer’s judgment of her powers; but she
13051: found larger room for resistance to a disapproval of her marriage,
13052: because it is easier to make our conduct seem justifiable to ourselves
13053: than to make our ability strike others. “How can I help it?” is not our
13054: favorite apology for incompetency. But Gwendolen felt some strength in
13055: saying,
13056: 
13057: “How can I help what other people have done? Things would not come
13058: right if I were to turn round now and declare that I would not marry
13059: Mr. Grandcourt.” And such turning round was out of the question. The
13060: horses in the chariot she had mounted were going at full speed.
13061: 
13062: This mood of youthful, elated desperation had a tidal recurrence. She
13063: could dare anything that lay before her sooner than she could choose to
13064: go backward, into humiliation; and it was even soothing to think that
13065: there would now be as much ill-doing in the one as in the other. But
13066: the immediate delightful fact was the hunt, where she would see
13067: Deronda, and where he would see her; for always lurking ready to
13068: obtrude before other thoughts about him was the impression that he was
13069: very much interested in her. But to-day she was resolved not to repeat
13070: her folly of yesterday, as if she were anxious to say anything to him.
13071: Indeed, the hunt would be too absorbing.
13072: 
13073: And so it was for a long while. Deronda was there, and within her sight
13074: very often; but this only added to the stimulus of a pleasure which
13075: Gwendolen had only once before tasted, and which seemed likely always
13076: to give a delight independent of any crosses, except such as took away
13077: the chance of riding. No accident happened to throw them together; the
13078: run took them within convenient reach of home, and the agreeable
13079: sombreness of the gray November afternoon, with a long stratum of
13080: yellow light in the west, Gwendolen was returning with the company from
13081: Diplow, who were attending her on the way to Offendene. Now the sense
13082: of glorious excitement was over and gone, she was getting irritably
13083: disappointed that she had had no opportunity of speaking to Deronda,
13084: whom she would not see again, since he was to go away in a couple of
13085: days. What was she going to say? That was not quite certain. She wanted
13086: to speak to him. Grandcourt was by her side; Mrs. Torrington, her
13087: husband, and another gentleman in advance; and Deronda’s horse she
13088: could hear behind. The wish to speak to him and have him speaking to
13089: her was becoming imperious; and there was no chance of it unless she
13090: simply asserted her will and defied everything. Where the order of
13091: things could give way to Miss Gwendolen, it must be made to do so. They
13092: had lately emerged from a wood of pines and beeches, where the twilight
13093: stillness had a repressing effect, which increased her impatience. The
13094: horse-hoofs again heard behind at some little distance were a growing
13095: irritation. She reined in her horse and looked behind her; Grandcourt
13096: after a few paces, also paused; but she, waving her whip and nodding
13097: sideways with playful imperiousness, said, “Go on! I want to speak to
13098: Mr. Deronda.”
13099: 
13100: Grandcourt hesitated; but that he would have done after any
13101: proposition. It was an awkward situation for him. No gentleman, before
13102: marriage, could give the emphasis of refusal to a command delivered in
13103: this playful way. He rode on slowly, and she waited till Deronda came
13104: up. He looked at her with tacit inquiry, and she said at once, letting
13105: her horse go alongside of his,
13106: 
13107: “Mr. Deronda, you must enlighten my ignorance. I want to know why you
13108: thought it wrong for me to gamble. Is it because I am a woman?”
13109: 
13110: “Not altogether; but I regretted it the more because you were a woman,”
13111: said Deronda, with an irrepressible smile. Apparently it must be
13112: understood between them now that it was he who sent the necklace. “I
13113: think it would be better for men not to gamble. It is a besotting kind
13114: of taste, likely to turn into a disease. And, besides, there is
13115: something revolting to me in raking a heap of money together, and
13116: internally chuckling over it, when others are feeling the loss of it. I
13117: should even call it base, if it were more than an exceptional lapse.
13118: There are enough inevitable turns of fortune which force us to see that
13119: our gain is another’s loss:—that is one of the ugly aspects of life.
13120: One would like to reduce it as much as one could, not get amusement out
13121: of exaggerating it.” Deronda’s voice had gathered some indignation
13122: while he was speaking.
13123: 
13124: “But you do admit that we can’t help things,” said Gwendolen, with a
13125: drop in her tone. The answer had not been anything like what she had
13126: expected. “I mean that things are so in spite of us; we can’t always
13127: help it that our gain is another’s loss.”
13128: 
13129: “Clearly. Because of that, we should help it where we can.”
13130: 
13131: Gwendolen, biting her lip inside, paused a moment, and then forcing
13132: herself to speak with an air of playfulness again, said,
13133: 
13134: “But why should you regret it more because I am a woman?”
13135: 
13136: “Perhaps because we need that you should be better than we are.”
13137: 
13138: “But suppose _we_ need that men should be better than we are,” said
13139: Gwendolen with a little air of “check!”
13140: 
13141: “That is rather a difficulty,” said Deronda, smiling. “I suppose I
13142: should have said, we each of us think it would be better for the other
13143: to be good.”
13144: 
13145: “You see, I needed you to be better than I was—and you thought so,”
13146: said Gwendolen, nodding and laughing, while she put her horse forward
13147: and joined Grandcourt, who made no observation.
13148: 
13149: “Don’t you want to know what I had to say to Mr. Deronda?” said
13150: Gwendolen, whose own pride required her to account for her conduct.
13151: 
13152: “A—no,” said Grandcourt, coldly.
13153: 
13154: “Now that is the first impolite word you have spoken—that you don’t
13155: wish to hear what I had to say,” said Gwendolen, playing at a pout.
13156: 
13157: “I wish to hear what you say to me—not to other men,” said Grandcourt.
13158: 
13159: “Then you wish to hear this. I wanted to make him tell me why he
13160: objected to my gambling, and he gave me a little sermon.”
13161: 
13162: “Yes—but excuse me the sermon.” If Gwendolen imagined that Grandcourt
13163: cared about her speaking to Deronda, he wished her to understand that
13164: she was mistaken. But he was not fond of being told to ride on. She saw
13165: he was piqued, but did not mind. She had accomplished her object of
13166: speaking again to Deronda before he raised his hat and turned with the
13167: rest toward Diplow, while her lover attended her to Offendene, where he
13168: was to bid farewell before a whole day’s absence on the unspecified
13169: journey. Grandcourt had spoken truth in calling the journey a bore: he
13170: was going by train to Gadsmere.
13171: 
13172: 
13173: 
13174: 
13175: CHAPTER XXX.
13176: 
13177:   No penitence and no confessional,
13178:   No priest ordains it, yet they’re forced to sit
13179:   Amid deep ashes of their vanished years.
13180: 
13181: 
13182: Imagine a rambling, patchy house, the best part built of gray stone,
13183: and red-tiled, a round tower jutting at one of the corners, the mellow
13184: darkness of its conical roof surmounted by a weather-cock making an
13185: agreeable object either amidst the gleams and greenth of summer or the
13186: low-hanging clouds and snowy branches of winter: the ground shady with
13187: spreading trees: a great tree flourishing on one side, backward some
13188: Scotch firs on a broken bank where the roots hung naked, and beyond, a
13189: rookery: on the other side a pool overhung with bushes, where the
13190: water-fowl fluttered and screamed: all around, a vast meadow which
13191: might be called a park, bordered by an old plantation and guarded by
13192: stone lodges which looked like little prisons. Outside the gate the
13193: country, once entirely rural and lovely, now black with coal mines, was
13194: chiefly peopled by men and brethren with candles stuck in their hats,
13195: and with a diabolic complexion which laid them peculiarly open to
13196: suspicion in the eyes of the children at Gadsmere—Mrs. Glasher’s four
13197: beautiful children, who had dwelt there for about three years. Now, in
13198: November, when the flower-beds were empty, the trees leafless, and the
13199: pool blackly shivering, one might have said that the place was sombrely
13200: in keeping with the black roads and black mounds which seemed to put
13201: the district in mourning;—except when the children were playing on the
13202: gravel with the dogs for their companions. But Mrs. Glasher, under her
13203: present circumstances, liked Gadsmere as well as she would have liked
13204: any other abode. The complete seclusion of the place, which the
13205: unattractiveness of the country secured, was exactly to her taste. When
13206: she drove her two ponies with a waggonet full of children, there were
13207: no gentry in carriages to be met, only men of business in gigs; at
13208: church there were no eyes she cared to avoid, for the curate’s wife and
13209: the curate himself were either ignorant of anything to her
13210: disadvantage, or ignored it: to them she was simply a widow lady, the
13211: tenant of Gadsmere; and the name of Grandcourt was of little interest
13212: in that district compared with the names of Fletcher and Gawcome, the
13213: lessees of the collieries.
13214: 
13215: It was full ten years since the elopement of an Irish officer’s
13216: beautiful wife with young Grandcourt, and a consequent duel where the
13217: bullets wounded the air only, had made some little noise. Most of those
13218: who remembered the affair now wondered what had become of that Mrs.
13219: Glasher, whose beauty and brilliancy had made her rather conspicuous to
13220: them in foreign places, where she was known to be living with young
13221: Grandcourt.
13222: 
13223: That he should have disentangled himself from that connection seemed
13224: only natural and desirable. As to her, it was thought that a woman who
13225: was understood to have forsaken her child along with her husband had
13226: probably sunk lower. Grandcourt had of course got weary of her. He was
13227: much given to the pursuit of women: but a man in his position would by
13228: this time desire to make a suitable marriage with the fair young
13229: daughter of a noble house. No one talked of Mrs. Glasher now, any more
13230: than they talked of the victim in a trial for manslaughter ten years
13231: before: she was a lost vessel after whom nobody would send out an
13232: expedition of search; but Grandcourt was seen in harbor with his colors
13233: flying, registered as seaworthy as ever.
13234: 
13235: Yet, in fact, Grandcourt had never disentangled himself from Mrs.
13236: Glasher. His passion for her had been the strongest and most lasting he
13237: had ever known; and though it was now as dead as the music of a cracked
13238: flute, it had left a certain dull disposedness, which, on the death of
13239: her husband three years before, had prompted in him a vacillating
13240: notion of marrying her, in accordance with the understanding often
13241: expressed between them during the days of his first ardor. At that
13242: early time Grandcourt would willingly have paid for the freedom to be
13243: won by a divorce; but the husband would not oblige him, not wanting to
13244: be married again himself, and not wishing to have his domestic habits
13245: printed in evidence.
13246: 
13247: The altered poise which the years had brought in Mrs. Glasher was just
13248: the reverse. At first she was comparatively careless about the
13249: possibility of marriage. It was enough that she had escaped from a
13250: disagreeable husband and found a sort of bliss with a lover who had
13251: completely fascinated her—young, handsome, amorous, and living in the
13252: best style, with equipage and conversation of the kind to be expected
13253: in young men of fortune who have seen everything. She was an
13254: impassioned, vivacious woman, fond of adoration, exasperated by five
13255: years of marital rudeness; and the sense of release was so strong upon
13256: her that it stilled anxiety for more than she actually enjoyed. An
13257: equivocal position was of no importance to her then; she had no envy
13258: for the honors of a dull, disregarded wife: the one spot which spoiled
13259: her vision of her new pleasant world, was the sense that she left her
13260: three-year-old boy, who died two years afterward, and whose first tones
13261: saying “mamma” retained a difference from those of the children that
13262: came after. But now the years had brought many changes besides those in
13263: the contour of her cheek and throat; and that Grandcourt should marry
13264: her had become her dominant desire. The equivocal position which she
13265: had not minded about for herself was now telling upon her through her
13266: children, whom she loved with a devotion charged with the added passion
13267: of atonement. She had no repentance except in this direction. If
13268: Grandcourt married her, the children would be none the worse off for
13269: what had passed: they would see their mother in a dignified position,
13270: and they would be at no disadvantage with the world: her son could be
13271: made his father’s heir. It was the yearning for this result which gave
13272: the supreme importance to Grandcourt’s feeling for her; her love for
13273: him had long resolved itself into anxiety that he should give her the
13274: unique, permanent claim of a wife, and she expected no other happiness
13275: in marriage than the satisfaction of her maternal love and
13276: pride—including her pride for herself in the presence of her children.
13277: For the sake of that result she was prepared even with a tragic
13278: firmness to endure anything quietly in marriage; and she had acuteness
13279: enough to cherish Grandcourt’s flickering purpose negatively, by not
13280: molesting him with passionate appeals and with scene-making. In her, as
13281: in every one else who wanted anything of him, his incalculable turns,
13282: and his tendency to harden under beseeching, had created a reasonable
13283: dread:—a slow discovery, of which no presentiment had been given in
13284: the bearing of a youthful lover with a fine line of face and the
13285: softest manners. But reticence had necessarily cost something to this
13286: impassioned woman, and she was the bitterer for it. There is no
13287: quailing—even that forced on the helpless and injured—which has not
13288: an ugly obverse: the withheld sting was gathering venom. She was
13289: absolutely dependent on Grandcourt; for though he had been always
13290: liberal in expenses for her, he had kept everything voluntary on his
13291: part; and with the goal of marriage before her, she would ask for
13292: nothing less. He had said that he would never settle anything except by
13293: will; and when she was thinking of alternatives for the future it often
13294: occurred to her that, even if she did not become Grandcourt’s wife, he
13295: might never have a son who would have a legitimate claim on him, and
13296: the end might be that her son would be made heir to the best part of
13297: his estates. No son at that early age could promise to have more of his
13298: father’s physique. But her becoming Grandcourt’s wife was so far from
13299: being an extravagant notion of possibility, that even Lush had
13300: entertained it, and had said that he would as soon bet on it as on any
13301: other likelihood with regard to his familiar companion. Lush, indeed,
13302: on inferring that Grandcourt had a preconception of using his residence
13303: at Diplow in order to win Miss Arrowpoint, had thought it well to fan
13304: that project, taking it as a tacit renunciation of the marriage with
13305: Mrs. Glasher, which had long been a mark for the hovering and wheeling
13306: of Grandcourt’s caprice. But both prospects had been negatived by
13307: Gwendolen’s appearance on the scene; and it was natural enough for Mrs.
13308: Glasher to enter with eagerness into Lush’s plan of hindering that new
13309: danger by setting up a barrier in the mind of the girl who was being
13310: sought as a bride. She entered into it with an eagerness which had
13311: passion in it as well as purpose, some of the stored-up venom
13312: delivering itself in that way.
13313: 
13314: After that, she had heard from Lush of Gwendolen’s departure, and the
13315: probability that all danger from her was got rid of; but there had been
13316: no letter to tell her that the danger had returned and had become a
13317: certainty. She had since then written to Grandcourt, as she did
13318: habitually, and he had been longer than usual in answering. She was
13319: inferring that he might intend coming to Gadsmere at the time when he
13320: was actually on the way; and she was not without hope—what
13321: construction of another’s mind is not strong wishing equal to?—that a
13322: certain sickening from that frustrated courtship might dispose him to
13323: slip the more easily into the old track of intention.
13324: 
13325: Grandcourt had two grave purposes in coming to Gadsmere: to convey the
13326: news of his approaching marriage in person, in order to make this first
13327: difficulty final; and to get from Lydia his mother’s diamonds, which
13328: long ago he had confided to her and wished her to wear. Her person
13329: suited diamonds, and made them look as if they were worth some of the
13330: money given for them. These particular diamonds were not mountains of
13331: light—they were mere peas and haricots for the ears, neck and hair;
13332: but they were worth some thousands, and Grandcourt necessarily wished
13333: to have them for his wife. Formerly when he had asked Lydia to put them
13334: into his keeping again, simply on the ground that they would be safer
13335: and ought to be deposited at the bank, she had quietly but absolutely
13336: refused, declaring that they were quite safe; and at last had said, “If
13337: you ever marry another woman I will give them up to her: are you going
13338: to marry another woman?” At that time Grandcourt had no motive which
13339: urged him to persist, and he had this grace in him, that the
13340: disposition to exercise power either by cowing or disappointing others
13341: or exciting in them a rage which they dared not express—a disposition
13342: which was active in him as other propensities became languid—had
13343: always been in abeyance before Lydia. A severe interpreter might say
13344: that the mere facts of their relation to each other, the melancholy
13345: position of this woman who depended on his will, made a standing
13346: banquet for his delight in dominating. But there was something else
13347: than this in his forbearance toward her: there was the surviving though
13348: metamorphosed effect of the power she had had over him; and it was this
13349: effect, the fitful dull lapse toward solicitations that once had the
13350: zest now missing from life, which had again and again inclined him to
13351: espouse a familiar past rather than rouse himself to the expectation of
13352: novelty. But now novelty had taken hold of him and urged him to make
13353: the most of it.
13354: 
13355: Mrs. Glasher was seated in the pleasant room where she habitually
13356: passed her mornings with her children round her. It had a square
13357: projecting window and looked on broad gravel and grass, sloping toward
13358: a little brook that entered the pool. The top of a low, black cabinet,
13359: the old oak table, the chairs in tawny leather, were littered with the
13360: children’s toys, books and garden garments, at which a maternal lady in
13361: pastel looked down from the walls with smiling indulgence. The children
13362: were all there. The three girls, seated round their mother near the
13363: window, were miniature portraits of her—dark-eyed, delicate-featured
13364: brunettes with a rich bloom on their cheeks, their little nostrils and
13365: eyebrows singularly finished as if they were tiny women, the eldest
13366: being barely nine. The boy was seated on the carpet at some distance,
13367: bending his blonde head over the animals from a Noah’s ark, admonishing
13368: them separately in a voice of threatening command, and occasionally
13369: licking the spotted ones to see if the colors would hold. Josephine,
13370: the eldest, was having her French lesson; and the others, with their
13371: dolls on their laps, sat demurely enough for images of the Madonna.
13372: Mrs. Glasher’s toilet had been made very carefully—each day now she
13373: said to herself that Grandcourt might come in. Her head, which, spite
13374: of emaciation, had an ineffaceable beauty in the fine profile, crisp
13375: curves of hair, and clearly-marked eyebrows, rose impressively above
13376: her bronze-colored silk and velvet, and the gold necklace which
13377: Grandcourt had first clasped round her neck years ago. Not that she had
13378: any pleasure in her toilet; her chief thought of herself seen in the
13379: glass was, “How changed!”—but such good in life as remained to her she
13380: would keep. If her chief wish were fulfilled, she could imagine herself
13381: getting the comeliness of a matron fit for the highest rank. The little
13382: faces beside her, almost exact reductions of her own, seemed to tell of
13383: the blooming curves which had once been where now was sunken pallor.
13384: But the children kissed the pale cheeks and never found them deficient.
13385: That love was now the one end of her life.
13386: 
13387: Suddenly Mrs. Glasher turned away her head from Josephine’s book and
13388: listened. “Hush, dear! I think some one is coming.”
13389: 
13390: Henleigh the boy jumped up and said, “Mamma, is it the miller with my
13391: donkey?”
13392: 
13393: He got no answer, and going up to his mamma’s knee repeated his
13394: question in an insistent tone. But the door opened, and the servant
13395: announced Mr. Grandcourt. Mrs. Glasher rose in some agitation. Henleigh
13396: frowned at him in disgust at his not being the miller, and the three
13397: little girls lifted up their dark eyes to him timidly. They had none of
13398: them any particular liking for this friend of mamma’s—in fact, when he
13399: had taken Mrs. Glasher’s hand and then turned to put his other hand on
13400: Henleigh’s head, that energetic scion began to beat the friend’s arm
13401: away with his fists. The little girls submitted bashfully to be patted
13402: under the chin and kissed, but on the whole it seemed better to send
13403: them into the garden, where they were presently dancing and chatting
13404: with the dogs on the gravel.
13405: 
13406: “How far are you come?” said Mrs. Glasher, as Grandcourt put away his
13407: hat and overcoat.
13408: 
13409: “From Diplow,” he answered slowly, seating himself opposite her and
13410: looking at her with an unnoting gaze which she noted.
13411: 
13412: “You are tired, then.”
13413: 
13414: “No, I rested at the Junction—a hideous hole. These railway journeys
13415: are always a confounded bore. But I had coffee and smoked.”
13416: 
13417: Grandcourt drew out his handkerchief, rubbed his face, and in returning
13418: the handkerchief to his pocket looked at his crossed knee and blameless
13419: boot, as if any stranger were opposite to him, instead of a woman
13420: quivering with a suspense which every word and look of his was to
13421: incline toward hope or dread. But he was really occupied with their
13422: interview and what it was likely to include. Imagine the difference in
13423: rate of emotion between this woman whom the years had worn to a more
13424: conscious dependence and sharper eagerness, and this man whom they were
13425: dulling into a more neutral obstinacy.
13426: 
13427: “I expected to see you—it was so long since I had heard from you. I
13428: suppose the weeks seem longer at Gadsmere than they do at Diplow,” said
13429: Mrs. Glasher. She had a quick, incisive way of speaking that seemed to
13430: go with her features, as the tone and _timbre_ of a violin go with its
13431: form.
13432: 
13433: “Yes,” drawled Grandcourt. “But you found the money paid into the bank.”
13434: 
13435: “Oh, yes,” said Mrs. Glasher, curtly, tingling with impatience. Always
13436: before—at least she fancied so—Grandcourt had taken more notice of
13437: her and the children than he did to-day.
13438: 
13439: “Yes,” he resumed, playing with his whisker, and at first not looking
13440: at her, “the time has gone on at rather a rattling pace with me;
13441: generally it is slow enough. But there has been a good deal happening,
13442: as you know”—here he turned his eyes upon her.
13443: 
13444: “What do I know?” said she, sharply.
13445: 
13446: He left a pause before he said, without change of manner, “That I was
13447: thinking of marrying. You saw Miss Harleth?”
13448: 
13449: “_She_ told you that?”
13450: 
13451: The pale cheeks looked even paler, perhaps from the fierce brightness
13452: in the eyes above them.
13453: 
13454: “No. Lush told me,” was the slow answer. It was as if the thumb-screw
13455: and the iron boot were being placed by creeping hands within sight of
13456: the expectant victim.
13457: 
13458: “Good God! say at once that you are going to marry her,” she burst out,
13459: passionately, her knees shaking and her hands tightly clasped.
13460: 
13461: “Of course, this kind of thing must happen some time or other, Lydia,”
13462: said he; really, now the thumb-screw was on, not wishing to make the
13463: pain worse.
13464: 
13465: “You didn’t always see the necessity.”
13466: 
13467: “Perhaps not. I see it now.”
13468: 
13469: In those few undertoned words of Grandcourt’s she felt as absolute a
13470: resistance as if her thin fingers had been pushing at a fast shut iron
13471: door. She knew her helplessness, and shrank from testing it by any
13472: appeal—shrank from crying in a dead ear and clinging to dead knees,
13473: only to see the immovable face and feel the rigid limbs. She did not
13474: weep nor speak; she was too hard pressed by the sudden certainty which
13475: had as much of chill sickness in it as of thought and emotion. The
13476: defeated clutch of struggling hope gave her in these first moments a
13477: horrible sensation. At last she rose, with a spasmodic effort, and,
13478: unconscious of every thing but her wretchedness, pressed her forehead
13479: against the hard, cold glass of the window. The children, playing on
13480: the gravel, took this as a sign that she wanted them, and, running
13481: forward, stood in front of her with their sweet faces upturned
13482: expectantly. This roused her: she shook her head at them, waved them
13483: off, and overcome with this painful exertion, sank back in the nearest
13484: chair.
13485: 
13486: Grandcourt had risen too. He was doubly annoyed—at the scene itself,
13487: and at the sense that no imperiousness of his could save him from it;
13488: but the task had to be gone through, and there was the administrative
13489: necessity of arranging things so that there should be as little
13490: annoyance as possible in the future. He was leaning against the corner
13491: of the fire-place. She looked up at him and said, bitterly,
13492: 
13493: “All this is of no consequence to you. I and the children are
13494: importunate creatures. You wish to get away again and be with Miss
13495: Harleth.”
13496: 
13497: “Don’t make the affair more disagreeable than it need be. Lydia. It is
13498: of no use to harp on things that can’t be altered. Of course, its
13499: deucedly disagreeable to me to see you making yourself miserable. I’ve
13500: taken this journey to tell you what you must make up your mind to—you
13501: and the children will be provided for as usual—and there’s an end of
13502: it.”
13503: 
13504: Silence. She dared not answer. This woman with the intense, eager look
13505: had had the iron of the mother’s anguish in her soul, and it had made
13506: her sometimes capable of a repression harder than shrieking and
13507: struggle. But underneath the silence there was an outlash of hatred and
13508: vindictiveness: she wished that the marriage might make two others
13509: wretched, besides herself. Presently he went on,
13510: 
13511: “It will be better for you. You may go on living here. But I think of
13512: by-and-by settling a good sum on you and the children, and you can live
13513: where you like. There will be nothing for you to complain of then.
13514: Whatever happens, you will feel secure. Nothing could be done
13515: beforehand. Every thing has gone on in a hurry.”
13516: 
13517: Grandcourt ceased his slow delivery of sentences. He did not expect her
13518: to thank him, but he considered that she might reasonably be contented;
13519: if it were possible for Lydia to be contented. She showed no change,
13520: and after a minute he said,
13521: 
13522: “You have never had any reason to fear that I should be illiberal. I
13523: don’t care a curse about the money.”
13524: 
13525: “If you did care about it, I suppose you would not give it us,” said
13526: Lydia. The sarcasm was irrepressible.
13527: 
13528: “That’s a devilishly unfair thing to say,” Grandcourt replied, in a
13529: lower tone; “and I advise you not to say that sort of thing again.”
13530: 
13531: “Should you punish me by leaving the children in beggary?” In spite of
13532: herself, the one outlet of venom had brought the other.
13533: 
13534: “There is no question about leaving the children in beggary,” said
13535: Grandcourt, still in his low voice. “I advise you not to say things
13536: that you will repent of.”
13537: 
13538: “I am used to repenting,” said she, bitterly. “Perhaps you will repent.
13539: You have already repented of loving me.”
13540: 
13541: “All this will only make it uncommonly difficult for us to meet again.
13542: What friend have you besides me?”
13543: 
13544: “Quite true.”
13545: 
13546: The words came like a low moan. At the same moment there flashed
13547: through her the wish that after promising himself a better happiness
13548: than that he had had with her, he might feel a misery and loneliness
13549: which would drive him back to her to find some memory of a time when he
13550: was young, glad, and hopeful. But no! he would go scathless; it was she
13551: that had to suffer.
13552: 
13553: With this the scorching words were ended. Grandcourt had meant to stay
13554: till evening; he wished to curtail his visit, but there was no suitable
13555: train earlier than the one he had arranged to go by, and he had still
13556: to speak to Lydia on the second object of his visit, which like a
13557: second surgical operation seemed to require an interval. The hours had
13558: to go by; there was eating to be done; the children came in—all this
13559: mechanism of life had to be gone through with the dreary sense of
13560: constraint which is often felt in domestic quarrels of a commoner kind.
13561: To Lydia it was some slight relief for her stifled fury to have the
13562: children present: she felt a savage glory in their loveliness, as if it
13563: would taunt Grandcourt with his indifference to her and them—a secret
13564: darting of venom which was strongly imaginative. He acquitted himself
13565: with all the advantage of a man whose grace of bearing has long been
13566: moulded on an experience of boredom—nursed the little Antonia, who sat
13567: with her hands crossed and eyes upturned to his bald head, which struck
13568: her as worthy of observation—and propitiated Henleigh by promising him
13569: a beautiful saddle and bridle. It was only the two eldest girls who had
13570: known him as a continual presence; and the intervening years had
13571: overlaid their infantine memories with a bashfulness which Grandcourt’s
13572: bearing was not likely to dissipate. He and Lydia occasionally, in the
13573: presence of the servants, made a conventional remark; otherwise they
13574: never spoke; and the stagnant thought in Grandcourt’s mind all the
13575: while was of his own infatuation in having given her those diamonds,
13576: which obliged him to incur the nuisance of speaking about them. He had
13577: an ingrained care for what he held to belong to his caste, and about
13578: property he liked to be lordly; also he had a consciousness of
13579: indignity to himself in having to ask for anything in the world. But
13580: however he might assert his independence of Mrs. Glasher’s past, he had
13581: made a past for himself which was a stronger yoke than any he could
13582: impose. He must ask for the diamonds which he had promised to Gwendolen.
13583: 
13584: At last they were alone again, with the candles above them, face to
13585: face with each other. Grandcourt looked at his watch, and then said, in
13586: an apparently indifferent drawl, “There is one thing I had to mention,
13587: Lydia. My diamonds—you have them.”
13588: 
13589: “Yes, I have them,” she answered promptly, rising and standing with her
13590: arms thrust down and her fingers threaded, while Grandcourt sat still.
13591: She had expected the topic, and made her resolve about it. But she
13592: meant to carry out her resolve, if possible, without exasperating him.
13593: During the hours of silence she had longed to recall the words which
13594: had only widened the breach between them.
13595: 
13596: “They are in this house, I suppose?”
13597: 
13598: “No; not in this house.”
13599: 
13600: “I thought you said you kept them by you.”
13601: 
13602: “When I said so it was true. They are in the bank at Dudley.”
13603: 
13604: “Get them away, will you? I must make an arrangement for your
13605: delivering them to some one.”
13606: 
13607: “Make no arrangement. They shall be delivered to the person you
13608: intended them for. _I_ will make the arrangement.”
13609: 
13610: “What do you mean?”
13611: 
13612: “What I say. I have always told you that I would give them up to your
13613: wife. I shall keep my word. She is not your wife yet.”
13614: 
13615: “This is foolery,” said Grandcourt, with undertoned disgust. It was too
13616: irritating that this indulgence of Lydia had given her a sort of
13617: mastery over him in spite of dependent condition.
13618: 
13619: She did not speak. He also rose now, but stood leaning against the
13620: mantle-piece with his side-face toward her.
13621: 
13622: “The diamonds must be delivered to me before my marriage,” he began
13623: again.
13624: 
13625: “What is your wedding-day?”
13626: 
13627: “The tenth. There is no time to be lost.”
13628: 
13629: “And where do you go after the marriage?”
13630: 
13631: He did not reply except by looking more sullen. Presently he said, “You
13632: must appoint a day before then, to get them from the bank and meet
13633: me—or somebody else I will commission;—it’s a great nuisance. Mention
13634: a day.”
13635: 
13636: “No; I shall not do that. They shall be delivered to her safely. I
13637: shall keep my word.”
13638: 
13639: “Do you mean to say,” said Grandcourt, just audibly, turning to face
13640: her, “that you will not do as I tell you?”
13641: 
13642: “Yes, I mean that,” was the answer that leaped out, while her eyes
13643: flashed close to him. The poor creature was immediately conscious that
13644: if her words had any effect on her own lot, the effect must be
13645: mischievous, and might nullify all the remaining advantage of her long
13646: patience. But the word had been spoken.
13647: 
13648: He was in a position the most irritating to him. He could not shake her
13649: nor touch her hostilely; and if he could, the process would not bring
13650: his mother’s diamonds. He shrank from the only sort of threat that
13651: would frighten her—if she believed it. And in general, there was
13652: nothing he hated more than to be forced into anything like violence
13653: even in words: his will must impose itself without trouble. After
13654: looking at her for a moment, he turned his side-face toward her again,
13655: leaning as before, and said,
13656: 
13657: “Infernal idiots that women are!”
13658: 
13659: “Why will you not tell me where you are going after the marriage? I
13660: could be at the wedding if I liked, and learn in that way,” said Lydia,
13661: not shrinking from the one suicidal form of threat within her power.
13662: 
13663: “Of course, if you like, you can play the mad woman,” said Grandcourt,
13664: with _sotto voce_ scorn. “It is not to be supposed that you will wait
13665: to think what good will come of it—or what you owe to me.”
13666: 
13667: He was in a state of disgust and embitterment quite new in the history
13668: of their relation to each other. It was undeniable that this woman,
13669: whose life he had allowed to send such deep suckers into his, had a
13670: terrible power of annoyance in her; and the rash hurry of his
13671: proceedings had left her opportunities open. His pride saw very ugly
13672: possibilities threatening it, and he stood for several minutes in
13673: silence reviewing the situation—considering how he could act upon her.
13674: Unlike himself she was of a direct nature, with certain simple
13675: strongly-colored tendencies, and there was one often-experienced effect
13676: which he thought he could count upon now. As Sir Hugo had said of him,
13677: Grandcourt knew how to play his cards upon occasion.
13678: 
13679: He did not speak again, but looked at his watch, rang the bell, and
13680: ordered the vehicle to be brought round immediately. Then he removed
13681: farther from her, walked as if in expectation of a summons, and
13682: remained silent without turning his eyes upon her.
13683: 
13684: She was suffering the horrible conflict of self-reproach and tenacity.
13685: She saw beforehand Grandcourt leaving her without even looking at her
13686: again—herself left behind in lonely uncertainty—hearing nothing from
13687: him—not knowing whether she had done her children harm—feeling that
13688: she had perhaps made him hate her;—all the wretchedness of a creature
13689: who had defeated her own motives. And yet she could not bear to give up
13690: a purpose which was a sweet morsel to her vindictiveness. If she had
13691: not been a mother she would willingly have sacrificed herself to her
13692: revenge—to what she felt to be the justice of hindering another from
13693: getting happiness by willingly giving her over to misery. The two
13694: dominant passions were at struggle. She must satisfy them both.
13695: 
13696: “Don’t let us part in anger, Henleigh,” she began, without changing her
13697: voice or attitude: “it is a very little thing I ask. If I were refusing
13698: to give anything up that you call yours it would be different: that
13699: would be a reason for treating me as if you hated me. But I ask such a
13700: little thing. If you will tell me where you are going on the
13701: wedding-day I will take care that the diamonds shall be delivered to
13702: her without scandal. Without scandal,” she repeated entreatingly.
13703: 
13704: “Such preposterous whims make a woman odious,” said Grandcourt, not
13705: giving way in look or movement. “What is the use of talking to mad
13706: people?”
13707: 
13708: “Yes, I am foolish—loneliness has made me foolish—indulge me.” Sobs
13709: rose as she spoke. “If you will indulge me in this one folly I will be
13710: very meek—I will never trouble you.” She burst into hysterical crying,
13711: and said again almost with a scream—“I will be very meek after that.”
13712: 
13713: There was a strange mixture of acting and reality in this passion. She
13714: kept hold of her purpose as a child might tighten its hand over a small
13715: stolen thing, crying and denying all the while. Even Grandcourt was
13716: wrought upon by surprise: this capricious wish, this childish violence,
13717: was as unlike Lydia’s bearing as it was incongruous with her person.
13718: Both had always had a stamp of dignity on them. Yet she seemed more
13719: manageable in this state than in her former attitude of defiance. He
13720: came close up to her again, and said, in his low imperious tone, “Be
13721: quiet, and hear what I tell you, I will never forgive you if you
13722: present yourself again and make a scene.”
13723: 
13724: She pressed her handkerchief against her face, and when she could speak
13725: firmly said, in the muffled voice that follows sobbing, “I will not—if
13726: you will let me have my way—I promise you not to thrust myself forward
13727: again. I have never broken my word to you—how many have you broken to
13728: me? When you gave me the diamonds to wear you were not thinking of
13729: having another wife. And I now give them up—I don’t reproach you—I
13730: only ask you to let me give them up in my own way. Have I not borne it
13731: well? Everything is to be taken away from me, and when I ask for a
13732: straw, a chip—you deny it me.” She had spoken rapidly, but after a
13733: little pause she said more slowly, her voice freed from its muffled
13734: tone: “I will not bear to have it denied me.”
13735: 
13736: Grandcourt had a baffling sense that he had to deal with something like
13737: madness; he could only govern by giving way. The servant came to say
13738: the fly was ready. When the door was shut again Grandcourt said
13739: sullenly, “We are going to Ryelands then.”
13740: 
13741: “They shall be delivered to her there,” said Lydia, with decision.
13742: 
13743: “Very well, I am going.” He felt no inclination even to take her hand:
13744: she had annoyed him too sorely. But now that she had gained her point,
13745: she was prepared to humble herself that she might propitiate him.
13746: 
13747: “Forgive me; I will never vex you again,” she said, with beseeching
13748: looks. Her inward voice said distinctly—“It is only I who have to
13749: forgive.” Yet she was obliged to ask forgiveness.
13750: 
13751: “You had better keep that promise. You have made me feel uncommonly ill
13752: with your folly,” said Grandcourt, apparently choosing this statement
13753: as the strongest possible use of language.
13754: 
13755: “Poor thing!” cried Lydia, with a faint smile;—was he aware of the
13756: minor fact that he made her feel ill this morning?
13757: 
13758: But with the quick transition natural to her, she was now ready to coax
13759: him if he would let her, that they might part in some degree
13760: reconciled. She ventured to lay her hand on his shoulder, and he did
13761: not move away from her: she had so far succeeded in alarming him, that
13762: he was not sorry for these proofs of returned subjection.
13763: 
13764: “Light a cigar,” she said, soothingly, taking the case from his
13765: breast-pocket and opening it.
13766: 
13767: Amidst such caressing signs of mutual fear they parted. The effect that
13768: clung and gnawed within Grandcourt was a sense of imperfect mastery.

13773: CHAPTER XXXI.
13774: 
13775:         “A wild dedication of yourselves
13776:   To unpath’d waters, undreamed shores.”
13777:                             —SHAKESPEARE.
13778: 
13779: 
13780: On the day when Gwendolen Harleth was married and became Mrs.
13781: Grandcourt, the morning was clear and bright, and while the sun was low
13782: a slight frost crisped the leaves. The bridal party was worth seeing,
13783: and half Pennicote turned out to see it, lining the pathway up to the
13784: church. An old friend of the rector’s performed the marriage ceremony,
13785: the rector himself acting as father, to the great advantage of the
13786: procession. Only two faces, it was remarked, showed signs of
13787: sadness—Mrs. Davilow’s and Anna’s. The mother’s delicate eyelids were
13788: pink, as if she had been crying half the night; and no one was
13789: surprised that, splendid as the match was, she should feel the parting
13790: from a daughter who was the flower of her children and of her own life.
13791: It was less understood why Anna should be troubled when she was being
13792: so well set off by the bridesmaid’s dress. Every one else seemed to
13793: reflect the brilliancy of the occasion—the bride most of all. Of her
13794: it was agreed that as to figure and carriage she was worthy to be a
13795: “lady o’ title”: as to face, perhaps it might be thought that a title
13796: required something more rosy; but the bridegroom himself not being
13797: fresh-colored—being indeed, as the miller’s wife observed, very much
13798: of her own husband’s complexion—the match was the more complete.
13799: Anyhow he must be very fond of her; and it was to be hoped that he
13800: would never cast it up to her that she had been going out to service as
13801: a governess, and her mother to live at Sawyer’s Cottage—vicissitudes
13802: which had been much spoken of in the village. The miller’s daughter of
13803: fourteen could not believe that high gentry behaved badly to their
13804: wives, but her mother instructed her—“Oh, child, men’s men: gentle or
13805: simple, they’re much of a muchness. I’ve heard my mother say Squire
13806: Pelton used to take his dogs and a long whip into his wife’s room, and
13807: flog ’em there to frighten her; and my mother was lady’s-maid there at
13808: the very time.”
13809: 
13810: “That’s unlucky talk for a wedding, Mrs. Girdle,” said the tailor. “A
13811: quarrel may end wi’ the whip, but it begins wi’ the tongue, and it’s
13812: the women have got the most o’ that.”
13813: 
13814: “The Lord gave it ’em to use, I suppose,” said Mrs. Girdle. “_He_ never
13815: meant you to have it all your own way.”
13816: 
13817: “By what I can make out from the gentleman as attends to the grooming
13818: at Offendene,” said the tailor, “this Mr. Grandcourt has wonderful
13819: little tongue. Everything must be done dummy-like without his ordering.”
13820: 
13821: “Then he’s the more whip, I doubt,” said Mrs. Girdle. “_She’s_ got
13822: tongue enough, I warrant her. See, there they come out together!”
13823: 
13824: “What wonderful long corners she’s got to her eyes!” said the tailor.
13825: “She makes you feel comical when she looks at you.”
13826: 
13827: Gwendolen, in fact, never showed more elasticity in her bearing, more
13828: lustre in her long brown glance: she had the brilliancy of strong
13829: excitement, which will sometimes come even from pain. It was not pain,
13830: however, that she was feeling: she had wrought herself up to much the
13831: same condition as that in which she stood at the gambling-table when
13832: Deronda was looking at her, and she began to lose. There was an
13833: enjoyment in it: whatever uneasiness a growing conscience had created
13834: was disregarded as an ailment might have been, amidst the gratification
13835: of that ambitious vanity and desire for luxury within her which it
13836: would take a great deal of slow poisoning to kill. This morning she
13837: could not have said truly that she repented her acceptance of
13838: Grandcourt, or that any fears in hazy perspective could hinder the
13839: glowing effect of the immediate scene in which she was the central
13840: object. That she was doing something wrong—that a punishment might be
13841: hanging over her—that the woman to whom she had given a promise and
13842: broken it, was thinking of her in bitterness and misery with a just
13843: reproach—that Deronda with his way of looking into things very likely
13844: despised her for marrying Grandcourt, as he had despised her for
13845: gambling—above all, that the cord which united her with this lover and
13846: which she had heretofore held by the hand, was now being flung over her
13847: neck,—all this yeasty mingling of dimly understood facts with vague
13848: but deep impressions, and with images half real, half fantastic, had
13849: been disturbing her during the weeks of her engagement. Was that
13850: agitating experience nullified this morning? No: it was surmounted and
13851: thrust down with a sort of exulting defiance as she felt herself
13852: standing at the game of life with many eyes upon her, daring everything
13853: to win much—or if to lose, still with _éclat_ and a sense of
13854: importance. But this morning a losing destiny for herself did not press
13855: upon her as a fear: she thought that she was entering on a fuller power
13856: of managing circumstances—with all the official strength of marriage,
13857: which some women made so poor a use of. That intoxication of youthful
13858: egoism out of which she had been shaken by trouble, humiliation, and a
13859: new sense of culpability, had returned upon her under a newly-fed
13860: strength of the old fumes. She did not in the least present the ideal
13861: of the tearful, tremulous bride. Poor Gwendolen, whom some had judged
13862: much too forward and instructed in the world’s ways!—with her erect
13863: head and elastic footstep she was walking among illusions; and yet,
13864: too, there was an under-consciousness of her that she was a little
13865: intoxicated.
13866: 
13867: “Thank God you bear it so well, my darling!” said Mrs. Davilow, when
13868: she had helped Gwendolen to doff her bridal white and put on her
13869: traveling dress. All the trembling had been done by the poor mother,
13870: and her agitation urged Gwendolen doubly to take the morning as if it
13871: were a triumph.
13872: 
13873: “Why, you might have said that, if I had been going to Mrs. Mompert’s,
13874: you dear, sad, incorrigible mamma!” said Gwendolen just putting her
13875: hands to her mother’s cheeks with laughing tenderness—then retreating
13876: a little and spreading out her arms as if to exhibit herself: “Here am
13877: I—Mrs. Grandcourt! what else would you have me, but what I am sure to
13878: be? You know you were ready to die with vexation when you thought that
13879: I would not be Mrs. Grandcourt.”
13880: 
13881: “Hush, hush, my child, for heaven’s sake!” said Mrs. Davilow, almost in
13882: a whisper. “How can I help feeling it when I am parting from you. But I
13883: can bear anything gladly if you are happy.”
13884: 
13885: “Not gladly, mamma, no!” said Gwendolen, shaking her head, with a
13886: bright smile. “Willingly you would bear it, but always sorrowfully.
13887: Sorrowing is your sauce; you can take nothing without it.” Then,
13888: clasping her mother’s shoulders and raining kisses first on one cheek
13889: and then on the other between her words, she said, gaily, “And you
13890: shall sorrow over my having everything at my beck—and enjoying
13891: everything glorious—splendid houses—and horses—and diamonds, I shall
13892: have diamonds—and going to court—and being Lady Certainly—and Lady
13893: Perhaps—and grand here—and tantivy there—and always loving you
13894: better than anybody else in the world.”
13895: 
13896: “My sweet child!—But I shall not be jealous if you love your husband
13897: better; and he will expect to be first.”
13898: 
13899: Gwendolen thrust out her lips and chin with a pretty grimace, saying,
13900: “Rather a ridiculous expectation. However, I don’t mean to treat him
13901: ill, unless he deserves it.”
13902: 
13903: Then the two fell into a clinging embrace, and Gwendolen could not
13904: hinder a rising sob when she said, “I wish you were going with me,
13905: mamma.”
13906: 
13907: But the slight dew on her long eyelashes only made her the more
13908: charming when she gave her hand to Grandcourt to be led to the carriage.
13909: 
13910: The rector looked in on her to give a final “Good-bye; God bless you;
13911: we shall see you again before long,” and then returned to Mrs. Davilow,
13912: saying half cheerfully, half solemnly,
13913: 
13914: “Let us be thankful, Fanny. She is in a position well suited to her,
13915: and beyond what I should have dared to hope for. And few women can have
13916: been chosen more entirely for their own sake. You should feel yourself
13917: a happy mother.”
13918: 
13919:        *       *       *       *       *
13920: 
13921: There was a railway journey of some fifty miles before the new husband
13922: and wife reached the station near Ryelands. The sky had veiled itself
13923: since the morning, and it was hardly more than twilight when they
13924: entered the park-gates, but still Gwendolen, looking out of the
13925: carriage-window as they drove rapidly along, could see the grand
13926: outlines and the nearer beauties of the scene—the long winding drive
13927: bordered with evergreens backed by huge gray stems: then the opening of
13928: wide grassy spaces and undulations studded with dark clumps; till at
13929: last came a wide level where the white house could be seen, with a
13930: hanging wood for a background, and the rising and sinking balustrade
13931: of a terrace in front.
13932: 
13933: Gwendolen had been at her liveliest during the journey, chatting
13934: incessantly, ignoring any change in their mutual position since
13935: yesterday; and Grandcourt had been rather ecstatically quiescent, while
13936: she turned his gentle seizure of her hand into a grasp of his hand by
13937: both hers, with an increased vivacity as of a kitten that will not sit
13938: quiet to be petted. She was really getting somewhat febrile in her
13939: excitement; and now in this drive through the park her usual
13940: susceptibility to changes of light and scenery helped to make her heart
13941: palpitate newly. Was it at the novelty simply, or the almost incredible
13942: fulfilment about to be given to her girlish dreams of being
13943: “somebody”—walking through her own furlong of corridor and under her
13944: own ceilings of an out-of-sight loftiness, where her own painted Spring
13945: was shedding painted flowers, and her own fore-shortened Zephyrs were
13946: blowing their trumpets over her; while her own servants, lackeys in
13947: clothing but men in bulk and shape, were as nought in her presence, and
13948: revered the propriety of her insolence to them:—being in short the
13949: heroine of an admired play without the pains of art? Was it alone the
13950: closeness of this fulfilment which made her heart flutter? or was it
13951: some dim forecast, the insistent penetration of suppressed experience,
13952: mixing the expectation of a triumph with the dread of a crisis? Hers
13953: was one of the natures in which exultation inevitably carries an
13954: infusion of dread ready to curdle and declare itself.
13955: 
13956: She fell silent in spite of herself as they approached the gates, and
13957: when her husband said, “Here we are at home!” and for the first time
13958: kissed her on the lips, she hardly knew of it: it was no more than the
13959: passive acceptance of a greeting in the midst of an absorbing show. Was
13960: not all her hurrying life of the last three months a show, in which her
13961: consciousness was a wondering spectator? After the half-willful
13962: excitement of the day, a numbness had come over her personality.
13963: 
13964: But there was a brilliant light in the hall—warmth, matting, carpets,
13965: full-length portraits, Olympian statues, assiduous servants. Not many
13966: servants, however: only a few from Diplow in addition to those
13967: constantly in charge of the house; and Gwendolen’s new maid, who had
13968: come with her, was taken under guidance by the housekeeper. Gwendolen
13969: felt herself being led by Grandcourt along a subtly-scented corridor,
13970: into an ante-room where she saw an open doorway sending out a rich glow
13971: of light and color.
13972: 
13973: “These are our dens,” said Grandcourt. “You will like to be quiet here
13974: till dinner. We shall dine early.”
13975: 
13976: He pressed her hand to his lips and moved away, more in love than he
13977: had ever expected to be.
13978: 
13979: Gwendolen, yielded up her hat and mantle, threw herself into a chair by
13980: the glowing hearth, and saw herself repeated in glass panels with all
13981: her faint-green satin surroundings. The housekeeper had passed into
13982: this boudoir from the adjoining dressing-room and seemed disposed to
13983: linger, Gwendolen thought, in order to look at the new mistress of
13984: Ryelands, who, however, being impatient for solitude said to her, “Will
13985: you tell Hudson when she has put out my dress to leave everything? I
13986: shall not want her again, unless I ring.”
13987: 
13988: The housekeeper, coming forward, said, “Here is a packet, madam, which
13989: I was ordered to give into nobody’s hands but yours, when you were
13990: alone. The person who brought it said it was a present particularly
13991: ordered by Mr. Grandcourt; but he was not to know of its arrival till
13992: he saw you wear it. Excuse me, madam; I felt it right to obey orders.”
13993: 
13994: Gwendolen took the packet and let it lie on her lap till she heard the
13995: doors close. It came into her mind that the packet might contain the
13996: diamonds which Grandcourt had spoken of as being deposited somewhere
13997: and to be given to her on her marriage. In this moment of confused
13998: feeling and creeping luxurious languor she was glad of this
13999: diversion—glad of such an event as having her own diamonds to try on.
14000: 
14001: Within all the sealed paper coverings was a box, but within the box
14002: there _was_ a jewel-case; and now she felt no doubt that she had the
14003: diamonds. But on opening the case, in the same instant that she saw
14004: them gleam she saw a letter lying above them. She knew the handwriting
14005: of the address. It was as if an adder had lain on them. Her heart gave
14006: a leap which seemed to have spent all her strength; and as she opened
14007: the bit of thin paper, it shook with the trembling of her hands. But it
14008: was legible as print, and thrust its words upon her.
14009: 
14010:     These diamonds, which were once given with ardent love to Lydia
14011:     Glasher, she passes on to you. You have broken your word to her, that
14012:     you might possess what was hers. Perhaps you think of being happy, as
14013:     she once was, and of having beautiful children such as hers, who will
14014:     thrust hers aside. God is too just for that. The man you have married
14015:     has a withered heart. His best young love was mine: you could not take
14016:     that from me when you took the rest. It is dead: but I am the grave
14017:     in which your chance of happiness is buried as well as mine. You had
14018:     your warning. You have chosen to injure me and my children. He had
14019:     meant to marry me. He would have married me at last, if you had not
14020:     broken your word. You will have your punishment. I desire it with all
14021:     my soul.
14022: 
14023:     Will you give him this letter to set him against me and ruin us
14024:     more—me and my children? Shall you like to stand before your husband
14025:     with these diamonds on you, and these words of mine in his thoughts and
14026:     yours? Will he think you have any right to complain when he has made
14027:     you miserable? You took him with your eyes open. The willing wrong you
14028:     have done me will be your curse.
14029: 
14030: It seemed at first as if Gwendolen’s eyes were spell-bound in reading
14031: the horrible words of the letter over and over again as a doom of
14032: penance; but suddenly a new spasm of terror made her lean forward and
14033: stretch out the paper toward the fire, lest accusation and proof at
14034: once should meet all eyes. It flew like a feather from her trembling
14035: fingers and was caught up in a great draught of flame. In her movement
14036: the casket fell on the floor and the diamonds rolled out. She took no
14037: notice, but fell back in her chair again helpless. She could not see
14038: the reflections of herself then; they were like so many women petrified
14039: white; but coming near herself you might have seen the tremor in her
14040: lips and hands. She sat so for a long while, knowing little more than
14041: that she was feeling ill, and that those written words kept repeating
14042: themselves to her.
14043: 
14044: Truly here were poisoned gems, and the poison had entered into this
14045: poor young creature.
14046: 
14047: After that long while, there was a tap at the door and Grandcourt
14048: entered, dressed for dinner. The sight of him brought a new nervous
14049: shock, and Gwendolen screamed again and again with hysterical violence.
14050: He had expected to see her dressed and smiling, ready to be led down.
14051: He saw her pallid, shrieking as it seemed with terror, the jewels
14052: scattered around her on the floor. Was it a fit of madness?
14053: 
14054: In some form or other the furies had crossed his threshold.
14055: 
14056: 
14057: 
14058: 
14059: CHAPTER XXXII.
14060: 
14061:     In all ages it hath been a favorite text that a potent love hath the
14062:     nature of an isolated fatality, whereto the mind’s opinions and wonted
14063:     resolves are altogether alien; as, for example, Daphnis his frenzy,
14064:     wherein it had little availed him to have been convinced of Heraclitus
14065:     his doctrine; or the philtre-bred passion of Tristan, who, though he
14066:     had been as deep as Duns Scotus, would have had his reasoning marred
14067:     by that cup too much; or Romeo in his sudden taking for Juliet,
14068:     wherein any objections he might have held against Ptolemy had made
14069:     little difference to his discourse under the balcony. Yet all love is
14070:     not such, even though potent; nay, this passion hath as large scope as
14071:     any for allying itself with every operation of the soul: so that it
14072:     shall acknowledge an effect from the imagined light of unproven
14073:     firmaments, and have its scale set to the grander orbits of what hath
14074:     been and shall be.
14075: 
14076: 
14077: Deronda, on his return to town, could assure Sir Hugo of his having
14078: lodged in Grandcourt’s mind a distinct understanding that he could get
14079: fifty thousand pounds by giving up a prospect which was probably
14080: distant, and not absolutely certain; but he had no further sign of
14081: Grandcourt’s disposition in the matter than that he was evidently
14082: inclined to keep up friendly communications.
14083: 
14084: “And what did you think of the future bride on a nearer survey?” said
14085: Sir Hugo.
14086: 
14087: “I thought better of her than I did in Leubronn. Roulette was not a
14088: good setting for her; it brought out something of the demon. At Diplow
14089: she seemed much more womanly and attractive—less hard and
14090: self-possessed. I thought her mouth and eyes had quite a different
14091: expression.”
14092: 
14093: “Don’t flirt with her too much, Dan,” said Sir Hugo, meaning to be
14094: agreeably playful. “If you make Grandcourt savage when they come to the
14095: Abbey at Christmas, it will interfere with my affairs.”
14096: 
14097: “I can stay in town, sir.”
14098: 
14099: “No, no. Lady Mallinger and the children can’t do without you at
14100: Christmas. Only don’t make mischief—unless you can get up a duel, and
14101: manage to shoot Grandcourt, which might be worth a little
14102: inconvenience.”
14103: 
14104: “I don’t think you ever saw me flirt,” said Deronda, not amused.
14105: 
14106: “Oh, haven’t I, though?” said Sir Hugo, provokingly. “You are always
14107: looking tenderly at the women, and talking to them in a Jesuitical way.
14108: You are a dangerous young fellow—a kind of Lovelace who will make the
14109: Clarissas run after you instead of you running after them.”
14110: 
14111: What was the use of being exasperated at a tasteless joke?—only the
14112: exasperation comes before the reflection on utility. Few friendly
14113: remarks are more annoying than the information that we are always
14114: seeming to do what we never mean to do. Sir Hugo’s notion of flirting,
14115: it was to be hoped, was rather peculiar; for his own part, Deronda was
14116: sure that he had never flirted. But he was glad that the baronet had no
14117: knowledge about the repurchase of Gwendolen’s necklace to feed his
14118: taste for this kind of rallying.
14119: 
14120: He would be on his guard in future; for example, in his behavior at
14121: Mrs. Meyrick’s, where he was about to pay his first visit since his
14122: arrival from Leubronn. For Mirah was certainly a creature in whom it
14123: was difficult not to show a tender kind of interest both by looks and
14124: speech.
14125: 
14126: Mrs. Meyrick had not failed to send Deronda a report of Mirah’s
14127: well-being in her family. “We are getting fonder of her every day,” she
14128: had written. “At breakfast-time we all look toward the door with
14129: expectation to see her come in; and we watch her and listen to her as
14130: if she were a native from a new country. I have not heard a word from
14131: her lips that gives me a doubt about her. She is quite contented and
14132: full of gratitude. My daughters are learning from her, and they hope to
14133: get her other pupils; for she is anxious not to eat the bread of
14134: idleness, but to work, like my girls. Mab says our life has become like
14135: a fairy tale, and all she is afraid of is that Mirah will turn into a
14136: nightingale again and fly away from us. Her voice is just perfect: not
14137: loud and strong, but searching and melting, like the thoughts of what
14138: has been. That is the way old people like me feel a beautiful voice.”
14139: 
14140: But Mrs. Meyrick did not enter into particulars which would have
14141: required her to say that Amy and Mab, who had accompanied Mirah to the
14142: synagogue, found the Jewish faith less reconcilable with their wishes
14143: in her case than in that of Scott’s Rebecca. They kept silence out of
14144: delicacy to Mirah, with whom her religion was too tender a subject to
14145: be touched lightly; but after a while Amy, who was much of a practical
14146: reformer, could not restrain a question.
14147: 
14148: “Excuse me, Mirah, but _does_ it seem quite right to you that the women
14149: should sit behind rails in a gallery apart?”
14150: 
14151: “Yes, I never thought of anything else,” said Mirah, with mild surprise.
14152: 
14153: “And you like better to see the men with their hats on?” said Mab,
14154: cautiously proposing the smallest item of difference.
14155: 
14156: “Oh, yes. I like what I have always seen there, because it brings back
14157: to me the same feelings—the feelings I would not part with for
14158: anything else in the world.”
14159: 
14160: After this, any criticism, whether of doctrine or practice, would have
14161: seemed to these generous little people an inhospitable cruelty. Mirah’s
14162: religion was of one fibre with her affections, and had never presented
14163: itself to her as a set of propositions.
14164: 
14165: “She says herself she is a very bad Jewess, and does not half know her
14166: people’s religion,” said Amy, when Mirah was gone to bed. “Perhaps it
14167: would gradually melt away from her, and she would pass into
14168: Christianity like the rest of the world, if she got to love us very
14169: much, and never found her mother. It is so strange to be of the Jews’
14170: religion now.”
14171: 
14172: “Oh, oh, oh!” cried Mab. “I wish I were not such a hideous Christian.
14173: How can an ugly Christian, who is always dropping her work, convert a
14174: beautiful Jewess, who has not a fault?”
14175: 
14176: “It may be wicked of me,” said shrewd Kate, “but I cannot help wishing
14177: that her mother may not be found. There might be something unpleasant.”
14178: 
14179: “I don’t think it, my dear,” said Mrs. Meyrick. “I believe Mirah is cut
14180: out after the pattern of her mother. And what a joy it would be to her
14181: to have such a daughter brought back again! But a mother’s feelings are
14182: not worth reckoning, I suppose” (she shot a mischievous glance at her
14183: own daughters), “and a dead mother is worth more than a living one?”
14184: 
14185: “Well, and so she may be, little mother,” said Kate; “but we would
14186: rather hold you cheaper, and have you alive.”
14187: 
14188: Not only the Meyricks, whose various knowledge had been acquired by the
14189: irregular foraging to which clever girls have usually been reduced, but
14190: Deronda himself, with all his masculine instruction, had been roused by
14191: this apparition of Mirah to the consciousness of knowing hardly
14192: anything about modern Judaism or the inner Jewish history. The Chosen
14193: People have been commonly treated as a people chosen for the sake of
14194: somebody else; and their thinking as something (no matter exactly what)
14195: that ought to have been entirely otherwise; and Deronda, like his
14196: neighbors, had regarded Judaism as a sort of eccentric fossilized form
14197: which an accomplished man might dispense with studying, and leave to
14198: specialists. But Mirah, with her terrified flight from one parent, and
14199: her yearning after the other, had flashed on him the hitherto neglected
14200: reality that Judaism was something still throbbing in human lives,
14201: still making for them the only conceivable vesture of the world; and in
14202: the idling excursion on which he immediately afterward set out with Sir
14203: Hugo he began to look for the outsides of synagogues, and the title of
14204: books about the Jews. This awakening of a new interest—this passing
14205: from the supposition that we hold the right opinions on a subject we
14206: are careless about, to a sudden care for it, and a sense that our
14207: opinions were ignorance—is an effectual remedy for _ennui_, which,
14208: unhappily, cannot be secured on a physician’s prescription; but Deronda
14209: had carried it with him, and endured his weeks of lounging all the
14210: better. It was on this journey that he first entered a Jewish
14211: synagogue—at Frankfort—where his party rested on a Friday. In
14212: exploring the Juden-gasse, which he had seen long before, he remembered
14213: well enough its picturesque old houses; what his eyes chiefly dwelt on
14214: now were the human types there; and his thought, busily connecting them
14215: with the past phases of their race, stirred that fibre of historic
14216: sympathy which had helped to determine in him certain traits worth
14217: mentioning for those who are interested in his future. True, when a
14218: young man has a fine person, no eccentricity of manners, the education
14219: of a gentleman, and a present income, it is not customary to feel a
14220: prying curiosity about his way of thinking, or his peculiar tastes. He
14221: may very well be settled in life as an agreeable clever young fellow
14222: without passing a special examination on those heads. Later, when he is
14223: getting rather slovenly and portly, his peculiarities are more
14224: distinctly discerned, and it is taken as a mercy if they are not highly
14225: objectionable. But any one wishing to understand the effect of
14226: after-events on Deronda should know a little more of what he was at
14227: five-and-twenty than was evident in ordinary intercourse.
14228: 
14229: It happened that the very vividness of his impressions had often made
14230: him the more enigmatic to his friends, and had contributed to an
14231: apparent indefiniteness in his sentiments. His early-wakened
14232: sensibility and reflectiveness had developed into a many-sided
14233: sympathy, which threatened to hinder any persistent course of action:
14234: as soon as he took up any antagonism, though only in thought, he seemed
14235: to himself like the Sabine warriors in the memorable story—with
14236: nothing to meet his spear but flesh of his flesh, and objects that he
14237: loved. His imagination had so wrought itself to the habit of seeing
14238: things as they probably appeared to others, that a strong partisanship,
14239: unless it were against an immediate oppression, had become an
14240: insincerity for him. His plenteous, flexible sympathy had ended by
14241: falling into one current with that reflective analysis which tends to
14242: neutralize sympathy. Few men were able to keep themselves clearer of
14243: vices than he; yet he hated vices mildly, being used to think of them
14244: less in the abstract than as a part of mixed human natures having an
14245: individual history, which it was the bent of his mind to trace with
14246: understanding and pity. With the same innate balance he was fervidly
14247: democratic in his feeling for the multitude, and yet, through his
14248: affections and imagination, intensely conservative; voracious of
14249: speculations on government and religion, yet loth to part with
14250: long-sanctioned forms which, for him, were quick with memories and
14251: sentiments that no argument could lay dead. We fall on the leaning
14252: side; and Deronda suspected himself of loving too well the losing
14253: causes of the world. Martyrdom changes sides, and he was in danger of
14254: changing with it, having a strong repugnance to taking up that clue of
14255: success which the order of the world often forces upon us and makes it
14256: treason against the common weal to reject. And yet his fear of falling
14257: into an unreasoning narrow hatred made a check for him: he apologized
14258: for the heirs of privilege; he shrank with dislike from the loser’s
14259: bitterness and the denunciatory tone of the unaccepted innovator. A too
14260: reflective and diffusive sympathy was in danger of paralyzing in him
14261: that indignation against wrong and that selectness of fellowship which
14262: are the conditions of moral force; and in the last few years of
14263: confirmed manhood he had become so keenly aware of this that what he
14264: most longed for was either some external event, or some inward light,
14265: that would urge him into a definite line of action, and compress his
14266: wandering energy. He was ceasing to care for knowledge—he had no
14267: ambition for practice—unless they could both be gathered up into one
14268: current with his emotions; and he dreaded, as if it were a
14269: dwelling-place of lost souls, that dead anatomy of culture which turns
14270: the universe into a mere ceaseless answer to queries, and knows, not
14271: everything, but everything else about everything—as if one should be
14272: ignorant of nothing concerning the scent of violets except the scent
14273: itself for which one had no nostril. But how and whence was the needed
14274: event to come?—the influence that would justify partiality, and make
14275: him what he longed to be, yet was unable to make himself—an organic
14276: part of social life, instead of roaming in it like a yearning
14277: disembodied spirit, stirred with a vague social passion, but without
14278: fixed local habitation to render fellowship real? To make a little
14279: difference for the better was what he was not contented to live
14280: without; but how to make it? It is one thing to see your road, another
14281: to cut it. He found some of the fault in his birth and the way he had
14282: been brought up, which had laid no special demands on him and had given
14283: him no fixed relationship except one of a doubtful kind; but he did not
14284: attempt to hide from himself that he had fallen into a meditative
14285: numbness, and was gliding farther and farther from that life of
14286: practically energetic sentiment which he would have proclaimed (if he
14287: had been inclined to proclaim anything) to be the best of all life, and
14288: for himself the only way worth living. He wanted some way of keeping
14289: emotion and its progeny of sentiments—which make the savors of
14290: life—substantial and strong in the face of a reflectiveness that
14291: threatened to nullify all differences. To pound the objects of
14292: sentiment into small dust, yet keep sentiment alive and active, was
14293: something like the famous recipe for making cannon—to first take a
14294: round hole and then enclose it with iron; whatever you do keeping fast
14295: hold of your round hole. Yet how distinguish what our will may wisely
14296: save in its completeness, from the heaping of cat-mummies and the
14297: expensive cult of enshrined putrefactions?
14298: 
14299: Something like this was the common under-current in Deronda’s mind
14300: while he was reading law or imperfectly attending to polite
14301: conversation. Meanwhile he had not set about one function in particular
14302: with zeal and steadiness. Not an admirable experience, to be proposed
14303: as an ideal; but a form of struggle before break of day which some
14304: young men since the patriarch have had to pass through, with more or
14305: less of bruising if not laming.
14306: 
14307: I have said that under his calm exterior he had a fervor which made him
14308: easily feel the presence of poetry in everyday events; and the forms of
14309: the Juden-gasse, rousing the sense of union with what is remote, set
14310: him musing on two elements of our historic life which that sense raises
14311: into the same region of poetry;—the faint beginnings of faiths and
14312: institutions, and their obscure lingering decay; the dust and withered
14313: remnants with which they are apt to be covered, only enhancing for the
14314: awakened perception the impressiveness either of a sublimely
14315: penetrating life, as in the twin green leaves that will become the
14316: sheltering tree, or of a pathetic inheritance in which all the grandeur
14317: and the glory have become a sorrowing memory.
14318: 
14319: This imaginative stirring, as he turned out of the Juden-gasse, and
14320: continued to saunter in the warm evening air, meaning to find his way
14321: to the synagogue, neutralized the repellent effect of certain ugly
14322: little incidents on his way. Turning into an old book-shop to ask the
14323: exact time of service at the synagogue, he was affectionately directed
14324: by a precocious Jewish youth, who entered cordially into his wanting,
14325: not the fine new building of the Reformed but the old Rabbinical school
14326: of the orthodox; and then cheated him like a pure Teuton, only with
14327: more amenity, in his charge for a book quite out of request as one
14328: “nicht so leicht zu bekommen.” Meanwhile at the opposite counter a deaf
14329: and grisly tradesman was casting a flinty look at certain cards,
14330: apparently combining advantages of business with religion, and
14331: shoutingly proposed to him in Jew-dialect by a dingy man in a tall coat
14332: hanging from neck to heel, a bag in hand, and a broad low hat
14333: surmounting his chosen nose—who had no sooner disappeared than another
14334: dingy man of the same pattern issued from the background glooms of the
14335: shop and also shouted in the same dialect. In fact, Deronda saw various
14336: queer-looking Israelites not altogether without guile, and just
14337: distinguishable from queer-looking Christians of the same mixed
14338: _morale_. In his anxiety about Mirah’s relatives, he had lately been
14339: thinking of vulgar Jews with a sort of personal alarm. But a little
14340: comparison will often diminish our surprise and disgust at the
14341: aberrations of Jews and other dissidents whose lives do not offer a
14342: consistent or lovely pattern of their creed; and this evening Deronda,
14343: becoming more conscious that he was falling into unfairness and
14344: ridiculous exaggeration, began to use that corrective comparison: he
14345: paid his thaler too much, without prejudice to his interests in the
14346: Hebrew destiny, or his wish to find the _Rabbinische Schule_, which he
14347: arrived at by sunset, and entered with a good congregation of men.
14348: 
14349: He happened to take his seat in a line with an elderly man from whom he
14350: was distant enough to glance at him more than once as rather a
14351: noticeable figure—his ample white beard and felt hat framing a profile
14352: of that fine contour which may as easily be Italian as Hebrew. He
14353: returned Deronda’s notice till at last their eyes met; an undesirable
14354: chance with unknown persons, and a reason to Deronda for not looking
14355: again; but he immediately found an open prayer-book pushed toward him
14356: and had to bow his thanks. However, the congregation had mustered, the
14357: reader had mounted to the _almemor_ or platform, and the service began.
14358: Deronda, having looked enough at the German translation of the Hebrew
14359: in the book before him to know that he was chiefly hearing Psalms and
14360: Old Testament passages or phrases, gave himself up to that strongest
14361: effect of chanted liturgies which is independent of detailed verbal
14362: meaning—like the effect of an Allegri’s _Miserere_ or a Palestrina’s
14363: _Magnificat_. The most powerful movement of feeling with a liturgy is
14364: the prayer which seeks for nothing special, but is a yearning to escape
14365: from the limitations of our own weakness and an invocation of all Good
14366: to enter and abide with us; or else a self-oblivious lifting up of
14367: Gladness, a _Gloria in excelsis_ that such Good exists; both the
14368: yearning and the exaltation gathering their utmost force from the sense
14369: of communion in a form which has expressed them both, for long
14370: generations of struggling fellow-men. The Hebrew liturgy, like others,
14371: has its transitions of litany, lyric, proclamation, dry statement and
14372: blessing; but this evening, all were one for Deronda: the chant of the
14373: _Chazaris_ or Reader’s grand wide-ranging voice with its passage from
14374: monotony to sudden cries, the outburst of sweet boys’ voices from the
14375: little choir, the devotional swaying of men’s bodies backward and
14376: forward, the very commonness of the building and shabbiness of the
14377: scene where a national faith, which had penetrated the thinking of half
14378: the world, and moulded the splendid forms of that world’s religion, was
14379: finding a remote, obscure echo—all were blent for him as one
14380: expression of a binding history, tragic and yet glorious. He wondered
14381: at the strength of his own feeling; it seemed beyond the occasion—what
14382: one might imagine to be a divine influx in the darkness, before there
14383: was any vision to interpret. The whole scene was a coherent strain, its
14384: burden a passionate regret, which, if he had known the liturgy for the
14385: Day of Reconciliation, he might have clad in its antithetic burden;
14386: “Happy the eye which saw all these things; but verily to hear only of
14387: them afflicts our soul. Happy the eye that saw our temple and the joy
14388: of our congregation; but verily to hear only of them afflicts our soul.
14389: Happy the eye that saw the fingers when tuning every kind of song; but
14390: verily to hear only of them afflicts our soul.”
14391: 
14392: But with the cessation of the devotional sounds and the movement of
14393: many indifferent faces and vulgar figures before him there darted into
14394: his mind the frigid idea that he had probably been alone in his
14395: feeling, and perhaps the only person in the congregation for whom the
14396: service was more than a dull routine. There was just time for this
14397: chilling thought before he had bowed to his civil neighbor and was
14398: moving away with the rest—when he felt a hand on his arm, and turning
14399: with the rather unpleasant sensation which this abrupt sort of claim is
14400: apt to bring, he saw close to him the white-bearded face of that
14401: neighbor, who said to him in German, “Excuse me, young gentleman—allow
14402: me—what is your parentage—your mother’s family—her maiden name?”
14403: 
14404: Deronda had a strongly resistant feeling: he was inclined to shake off
14405: hastily the touch on his arm; but he managed to slip it away and said
14406: coldly, “I am an Englishman.”
14407: 
14408: The questioner looked at him dubiously still for an instant, then just
14409: lifted his hat and turned away; whether under a sense of having made a
14410: mistake or of having been repulsed, Deronda was uncertain. In his walk
14411: back to the hotel he tried to still any uneasiness on the subject by
14412: reflecting that he could not have acted differently. How could he say
14413: that he did not know the name of his mother’s family to that total
14414: stranger?—who indeed had taken an unwarrantable liberty in the
14415: abruptness of his question, dictated probably by some fancy of likeness
14416: such as often occurs without real significance. The incident, he said
14417: to himself, was trivial; but whatever import it might have, his inward
14418: shrinking on the occasion was too strong for him to be sorry that he
14419: had cut it short. It was a reason, however, for his not mentioning the
14420: synagogue to the Mallingers—in addition to his usual inclination to
14421: reticence on anything that the baronet would have been likely to call
14422: Quixotic enthusiasm. Hardly any man could be more good-natured than Sir
14423: Hugo; indeed in his kindliness especially to women, he did actions
14424: which others would have called romantic; but he never took a romantic
14425: view of them, and in general smiled at the introduction of motives on a
14426: grand scale, or of reasons that lay very far off. This was the point of
14427: strongest difference between him and Deronda, who rarely ate at
14428: breakfast without some silent discursive flight after grounds for
14429: filling up his day according to the practice of his contemporaries.
14430: 
14431: This halt at Frankfort was taken on their way home, and its impressions
14432: were kept the more actively vibrating in him by the duty of caring for
14433: Mirah’s welfare. That question about his parentage, which if he had not
14434: both inwardly and outwardly shaken it off as trivial, would have seemed
14435: a threat rather than a promise of revelation, and reinforced his
14436: anxiety as to the effect of finding Mirah’s relatives and his resolve
14437: to proceed with caution. If he made any unpleasant discovery, was he
14438: bound to a disclosure that might cast a new net of trouble around her?
14439: He had written to Mrs. Meyrick to announce his visit at four o’clock,
14440: and he found Mirah seated at work with only Mrs. Meyrick and Mab, the
14441: open piano, and all the glorious company of engravings. The dainty
14442: neatness of her hair and dress, the glow of tranquil happiness in a
14443: face where a painter need have changed nothing if he had wanted to put
14444: it in front of the host singing “peace on earth and good will to men,”
14445: made a contrast to his first vision of her that was delightful to
14446: Deronda’s eyes. Mirah herself was thinking of it, and immediately on
14447: their greeting said,
14448: 
14449: “See how different I am from the miserable creature by the river! all
14450: because you found me and brought me to the very best.”
14451: 
14452: “It was my good chance to find you,” said Deronda. “Any other man would
14453: have been glad to do what I did.”
14454: 
14455: “That is not the right way to be thinking about it,” said Mirah,
14456: shaking her head with decisive gravity, “I think of what really was. It
14457: was you, and not another, who found me and were good to me.”
14458: 
14459: “I agree with Mirah,” said Mrs. Meyrick. “Saint Anybody is a bad saint
14460: to pray to.”
14461: 
14462: “Besides, Anybody could not have brought me to you,” said Mirah,
14463: smiling at Mrs. Meyrick. “And I would rather be with you than with any
14464: one else in the world except my mother. I wonder if ever a poor little
14465: bird, that was lost and could not fly, was taken and put into a warm
14466: nest where was a mother and sisters who took to it so that everything
14467: came naturally, as if it had been always there. I hardly thought before
14468: that the world could ever be as happy and without fear as it is to me
14469: now.” She looked meditative a moment, and then said, “sometimes I am a
14470: _little_ afraid.”
14471: 
14472: “What is it you are afraid of?” said Deronda with anxiety.
14473: 
14474: “That when I am turning at the corner of a street I may meet my father.
14475: It seems dreadful that I should be afraid of meeting him. That is my
14476: only sorrow,” said Mirah, plaintively.
14477: 
14478: “It is surely not very probable,” said Deronda, wishing that it were
14479: less so; then, not to let the opportunity escape—“Would it be a great
14480: grief to you now if you were never to meet your mother?”
14481: 
14482: She did not answer immediately, but meditated again, with her eyes
14483: fixed on the opposite wall. Then she turned them on Deronda and said
14484: firmly, as if she had arrived at the exact truth, “I want her to know
14485: that I have always loved her, and if she is alive I want to comfort
14486: her. She may be dead. If she were I should long to know where she was
14487: buried; and to know whether my brother lives, to say Kaddish in memory
14488: of her. But I will try not to grieve. I have thought much for so
14489: many years of her being dead. And I shall have her with me in my mind,
14490: as I have always had. We can never be really parted. I think I have
14491: never sinned against her. I have always tried not to do what would hurt
14492: her. Only, she might be sorry that I was not a good Jewess.”
14493: 
14494: “In what way are you not a good Jewess?” said Deronda.
14495: 
14496: “I am ignorant, and we never observed the laws, but lived among
14497: Christians just as they did. But I have heard my father laugh at the
14498: strictness of the Jews about their food and all customs, and their not
14499: liking Christians. I think my mother was strict; but she could never
14500: want me not to like those who are better to me than any of my own
14501: people I have ever known. I think I could obey in other things that she
14502: wished but not in that. It is so much easier to me to share in love
14503: than in hatred. I remember a play I read in German—since I have been
14504: here it has come into my mind—where the heroine says something like
14505: that.”
14506: 
14507: “_Antigone_,” said Deronda.
14508: 
14509: “Ah, you know it. But I do not believe that my mother would wish me not
14510: to love my best friends. She would be grateful to them.” Here Mirah had
14511: turned to Mrs. Meyrick, and with a sudden lighting up of her whole
14512: countenance, she said, “Oh, if we ever do meet and know each other as
14513: we are now, so that I could tell what would comfort her—I should be so
14514: full of blessedness my soul would know no want but to love her!”
14515: 
14516: “God bless you, child!” said Mrs. Meyrick, the words escaping
14517: involuntarily from her motherly heart. But to relieve the strain of
14518: feeling she looked at Deronda and said, “It is curious that Mirah, who
14519: remembers her mother so well it is as if she saw her, cannot recall her
14520: brother the least bit—except the feeling of having been carried by him
14521: when she was tired, and of his being near her when she was in her
14522: mother’s lap. It must be that he was rarely at home. He was already
14523: grown up. It is a pity her brother should be quite a stranger to her.”
14524: 
14525: “He is good; I feel sure Ezra is good,” said Mirah, eagerly. “He loved
14526: my mother—he would take care of her. I remember more of him than that.
14527: I remember my mother’s voice once calling, ‘Ezra!’ and then his
14528: answering from a distance ‘Mother!’”—Mirah had changed her voice a
14529: little in each of these words and had given them a loving
14530: intonation—“and then he came close to us. I feel sure he is good. I
14531: have always taken comfort from that.”
14532: 
14533: It was impossible to answer this either with agreement or doubt. Mrs.
14534: Meyrick and Deronda exchanged a quick glance: about this brother she
14535: felt as painfully dubious as he did. But Mirah went on, absorbed in her
14536: memories,
14537: 
14538: “Is it not wonderful how I remember the voices better than anything
14539: else? I think they must go deeper into us than other things. I have
14540: often fancied heaven might be made of voices.”
14541: 
14542: “Like your singing—yes,” said Mab, who had hitherto kept a modest
14543: silence, and now spoke bashfully, as was her wont in the presence of
14544: Prince Camaralzaman—“Ma, do ask Mirah to sing. Mr. Deronda has not
14545: heard her.”
14546: 
14547: “Would it be disagreeable to you to sing now?” said Deronda, with a
14548: more deferential gentleness than he had ever been conscious of before.
14549: 
14550: “Oh, I shall like it,” said Mirah. “My voice has come back a little
14551: with rest.”
14552: 
14553: Perhaps her ease of manner was due to something more than the
14554: simplicity of her nature. The circumstances of her life made her think
14555: of everything she did as work demanded from her, in which affectation
14556: had nothing to do; and she had begun her work before self-consciousness
14557: was born.
14558: 
14559: She immediately rose and went to the piano—a somewhat worn instrument
14560: that seemed to get the better of its infirmities under the firm touch
14561: of her small fingers as she preluded. Deronda placed himself where he
14562: could see her while she sang; and she took everything as quietly as if
14563: she had been a child going to breakfast.
14564: 
14565: Imagine her—it is always good to imagine a human creature in whom
14566: bodily loveliness seems as properly one with the entire being as the
14567: bodily loveliness of those wondrous transparent orbs of life that we
14568: find in the sea—imagine her with her dark hair brushed from her
14569: temples, but yet showing certain tiny rings there which had cunningly
14570: found their own way back, the mass of it hanging behind just to the
14571: nape of the little neck in curly fibres, such as renew themselves at
14572: their own will after being bathed into straightness like that of
14573: water-grasses. Then see the perfect cameo her profile makes, cut in a
14574: duskish shell, where by some happy fortune there pierced a gem-like
14575: darkness for the eye and eyebrow; the delicate nostrils defined enough
14576: to be ready for sensitive movements, the finished ear, the firm curves
14577: of the chin and neck, entering into the expression of a refinement
14578: which was not feebleness.
14579: 
14580: She sang Beethoven’s “Per pietà non dirmi addio” with a subdued but
14581: searching pathos which had that essential of perfect singing, the
14582: making one oblivious of art or manner, and only possessing one with the
14583: song. It was the sort of voice that gives the impression of being meant
14584: like a bird’s wooing for an audience near and beloved. Deronda began by
14585: looking at her, but felt himself presently covering his eyes with his
14586: hand, wanting to seclude the melody in darkness; then he refrained from
14587: what might seem oddity, and was ready to meet the look of mute appeal
14588: which she turned toward him at the end.
14589: 
14590: “I think I never enjoyed a song more than that,” he said, gratefully.
14591: 
14592: “You like my singing? I am so glad,” she said, with a smile of delight.
14593: “It has been a great pain to me, because it failed in what it was
14594: wanted for. But now we think I can use it to get my bread. I have
14595: really been taught well. And now I have two pupils, that Miss Meyrick
14596: found for me. They pay me nearly two crowns for their two lessons.”
14597: 
14598: “I think I know some ladies who would find you many pupils after
14599: Christmas,” said Deronda. “You would not mind singing before any one
14600: who wished to hear you?”
14601: 
14602: “Oh no, I want to do something to get money. I could teach reading and
14603: speaking, Mrs. Meyrick thinks. But if no one would learn of me, that is
14604: difficult.” Mirah smiled with a touch of merriment he had not seen in
14605: her before. “I dare say I should find her poor—I mean my mother. I
14606: should want to get money for her. And I can not always live on charity;
14607: though”—here she turned so as to take all three of her companions in
14608: one glance—“it is the sweetest charity in all the world.”
14609: 
14610: “I should think you can get rich,” said Deronda, smiling. “Great ladies
14611: will perhaps like you to teach their daughters. We shall see. But now
14612: do sing again to us.”
14613: 
14614: She went on willingly, singing with ready memory various things by
14615: Gordigiani and Schubert; then, when she had left the piano, Mab said,
14616: entreatingly, “Oh, Mirah, if you would not mind singing the little
14617: hymn.”
14618: 
14619: “It is too childish,” said Mirah. “It is like lisping.”
14620: 
14621: “What is the hymn?” said Deronda.
14622: 
14623: “It is the Hebrew hymn she remembers her mother singing over her when
14624: she lay in her cot,” said Mrs. Meyrick.
14625: 
14626: “I should like very much to hear it,” said Deronda, “if you think I am
14627: worthy to hear what is so sacred.”
14628: 
14629: “I will sing it if you like,” said Mirah, “but I don’t sing real
14630: words—only here and there a syllable like hers—the rest is lisping.
14631: Do you know Hebrew? because if you do, my singing will seem childish
14632: nonsense.”
14633: 
14634: Deronda shook his head. “It will be quite good Hebrew to me.”
14635: 
14636: Mirah crossed her little feet and hands in her easiest attitude, and
14637: then lifted up her head at an angle which seemed to be directed to some
14638: invisible face bent over her, while she sang a little hymn of quaint
14639: melancholy intervals, with syllables that really seemed childish
14640: lisping to her audience; the voice in which she gave it forth had
14641: gathered even a sweeter, more cooing tenderness than was heard in her
14642: other songs.
14643: 
14644: “If I were ever to know the real words, I should still go on in my old
14645: way with them,” said Mirah, when she had repeated the hymn several
14646: times.
14647: 
14648: “Why not?” said Deronda. “The lisped syllables are very full of
14649: meaning.”
14650: 
14651: “Yes, indeed,” said Mrs. Meyrick. “A mother hears something of a lisp
14652: in her children’s talk to the very last. Their words are not just what
14653: everybody else says, though they may be spelled the same. If I were to
14654: live till my Hans got old, I should still see the boy in him. A
14655: mother’s love, I often say, is like a tree that has got all the wood in
14656: it, from the very first it made.”
14657: 
14658: “Is not that the way with friendship, too?” said Deronda, smiling. “We
14659: must not let the mothers be too arrogant.”
14660: 
14661: The little woman shook her head over her darning.
14662: 
14663: “It is easier to find an old mother than an old friend. Friendships
14664: begin with liking or gratitude—roots that can be pulled up. Mother’s
14665: love begins deeper down.”
14666: 
14667: “Like what you were saying about the influence of voices,” said
14668: Deronda, looking at Mirah. “I don’t think your hymn would have had more
14669: expression for me if I had known the words. I went to the synagogue at
14670: Frankfort before I came home, and the service impressed me just as much
14671: as if I had followed the words—perhaps more.”
14672: 
14673: “Oh, was it great to you? Did it go to your heart?” said Mirah,
14674: eagerly. “I thought none but our people would feel that. I thought it
14675: was all shut away like a river in a deep valley, where only heaven
14676: saw—I mean—” she hesitated, feeling that she could not disentangle
14677: her thought from its imagery.
14678: 
14679: “I understand,” said Deronda. “But there is not really such a
14680: separation—deeper down, as Mrs. Meyrick says. Our religion is chiefly
14681: a Hebrew religion; and since Jews are men, their religious feelings
14682: must have much in common with those of other men—just as their poetry,
14683: though in one sense peculiar, has a great deal in common with the
14684: poetry of other nations. Still it is to be expected that a Jew would
14685: feel the forms of his people’s religion more than one of another
14686: race—and yet”—here Deronda hesitated in his turn—“that is perhaps
14687: not always so.”
14688: 
14689: “Ah no,” said Mirah, sadly. “I have seen that. I have seen them mock.
14690: Is it not like mocking your parents?—like rejoicing in your parents’
14691: shame?”
14692: 
14693: “Some minds naturally rebel against whatever they were brought up in,
14694: and like the opposite; they see the faults in what is nearest to them,”
14695: said Deronda apologetically.
14696: 
14697: “But you are not like that,” said Mirah, looking at him with
14698: unconscious fixedness.
14699: 
14700: “No, I think not,” said Deronda; “but you know I was not brought up as
14701: a Jew.”
14702: 
14703: “Ah, I am always forgetting,” said Mirah, with a look of disappointed
14704: recollection, and slightly blushing.
14705: 
14706: Deronda also felt rather embarrassed, and there was an awkward pause,
14707: which he put an end to by saying playfully,
14708: 
14709: “Whichever way we take it, we have to tolerate each other; for if we
14710: all went in opposition to our teaching, we must end in difference, just
14711: the same.”
14712: 
14713: “To be sure. We should go on forever in zig-zags,” said Mrs. Meyrick.
14714: “I think it is very weak-minded to make your creed up by the rule of
14715: the contrary. Still one may honor one’s parents, without following
14716: their notions exactly, any more than the exact cut of their clothing.
14717: My father was a Scotch Calvinist and my mother was a French Calvinist;
14718: I am neither quite Scotch, nor quite French, nor two Calvinists rolled
14719: into one, yet I honor my parents’ memory.”
14720: 
14721: “But I could not make myself not a Jewess,” said Mirah, insistently,
14722: “even if I changed my belief.”
14723: 
14724: “No, my dear. But if Jews and Jewesses went on changing their religion,
14725: and making no difference between themselves and Christians, there would
14726: come a time when there would be no Jews to be seen,” said Mrs. Meyrick,
14727: taking that consummation very cheerfully.
14728: 
14729: “Oh, please not to say that,” said Mirah, the tears gathering. “It is
14730: the first unkind thing you ever said. I will not begin that. I will
14731: never separate myself from my mother’s people. I was forced to fly from
14732: my father; but if he came back in age and weakness and want, and needed
14733: me, should I say, ‘This is not my father’? If he had shame, I must
14734: share it. It was he who was given to me for my father, and not another.
14735: And so it is with my people. I will always be a Jewess. I will love
14736: Christians when they are good, like you. But I will always cling to my
14737: people. I will always worship with them.”
14738: 
14739: As Mirah had gone on speaking she had become possessed with a sorrowful
14740: passion—fervent, not violent. Holding her little hands tightly clasped
14741: and looking at Mrs. Meyrick with beseeching, she seemed to Deronda a
14742: personification of that spirit which impelled men after a long
14743: inheritance of professed Catholicism to leave wealth and high place and
14744: risk their lives in flight, that they might join their own people and
14745: say, “I am a Jew.”
14746: 
14747: “Mirah, Mirah, my dear child, you mistake me!” said Mrs. Meyrick,
14748: alarmed. “God forbid I should want you to do anything against your
14749: conscience. I was only saying what might be if the world went on. But I
14750: had better have left the world alone, and not wanted to be over-wise.
14751: Forgive me, come! we will not try to take you from anybody you feel has
14752: more right to you.”
14753: 
14754: “I would do anything else for you. I owe you my life,” said Mirah, not
14755: yet quite calm.
14756: 
14757: “Hush, hush, now,” said Mrs. Meyrick. “I have been punished enough for
14758: wagging my tongue foolishly—making an almanac for the Millennium, as
14759: my husband used to say.”
14760: 
14761: “But everything in the world must come to an end some time. We must
14762: bear to think of that,” said Mab, unable to hold her peace on this
14763: point. She had already suffered from a bondage of tongue which
14764: threatened to become severe if Mirah were to be too much indulged in
14765: this inconvenient susceptibility to innocent remarks.
14766: 
14767: Deronda smiled at the irregular, blonde face, brought into strange
14768: contrast by the side of Mirah’s—smiled, Mab thought, rather
14769: sarcastically as he said, “That prospect of everything coming to an
14770: end will not guide us far in practice. Mirah’s feelings, she tells us,
14771: are concerned with what is.”
14772: 
14773: Mab was confused and wished she had not spoken, since Mr. Deronda
14774: seemed to think that she had found fault with Mirah; but to have spoken
14775: once is a tyrannous reason for speaking again, and she said,
14776: 
14777: “I only meant that we must have courage to hear things, else there is
14778: hardly anything we can talk about.” Mab felt herself unanswerable here,
14779: inclining to the opinion of Socrates: “What motive has a man to live,
14780: if not for the pleasure of discourse?”
14781: 
14782: Deronda took his leave soon after, and when Mrs. Meyrick went outside
14783: with him to exchange a few words about Mirah, he said, “Hans is to
14784: share my chambers when he comes at Christmas.”
14785: 
14786: “You have written to Rome about that?” said Mrs. Meyrick, her face
14787: lighting up. “How very good and thoughtful of you! You mentioned Mirah,
14788: then?”
14789: 
14790: “Yes, I referred to her. I concluded he knew everything from you.”
14791: 
14792: “I must confess my folly. I have not yet written a word about her. I
14793: have always been meaning to do it, and yet have ended my letter without
14794: saying a word. And I told the girls to leave it to me. However!—Thank
14795: you a thousand times.”
14796: 
14797: Deronda divined something of what was in the mother’s mind, and his
14798: divination reinforced a certain anxiety already present in him. His
14799: inward colloquy was not soothing. He said to himself that no man could
14800: see this exquisite creature without feeling it possible to fall in love
14801: with her; but all the fervor of his nature was engaged on the side of
14802: precaution. There are personages who feel themselves tragic because
14803: they march into a palpable morass, dragging another with them, and then
14804: cry out against all the gods. Deronda’s mind was strongly set against
14805: imitating them.
14806: 
14807: “I have my hands on the reins now,” he thought, “and I will not drop
14808: them. I shall go there as little as possible.”
14809: 
14810: He saw the reasons acting themselves out before him. How could he be
14811: Mirah’s guardian and claim to unite with Mrs. Meyrick, to whose charge
14812: he had committed her, if he showed himself as a lover—whom she did not
14813: love—whom she would not marry? And if he encouraged any germ of
14814: lover’s feeling in himself it would lead up to that issue. Mirah’s was
14815: not a nature that would bear dividing against itself; and even if love
14816: won her consent to marry a man who was not of her race and religion,
14817: she would never be happy in acting against that strong native bias
14818: which would still reign in her conscience as remorse.
14819: 
14820: Deronda saw these consequences as we see any danger of marring our own
14821: work well begun. It was a delight to have rescued this child acquainted
14822: with sorrow, and to think of having placed her little feet in protected
14823: paths. The creature we help to save, though only a half-reared linnet,
14824: bruised and lost by the wayside—how we watch and fence it, and dote on
14825: its signs of recovery! Our pride becomes loving, our self is a not-self
14826: for whose sake we become virtuous, when we set to some hidden work of
14827: reclaiming a life from misery and look for our triumph in the secret
14828: joy—“This one is the better for me.”
14829: 
14830: “I would as soon hold out my finger to be bitten off as set about
14831: spoiling her peace,” said Deronda. “It was one of the rarest bits of
14832: fortune that I should have had friends like the Meyricks to place her
14833: with—generous, delicate friends without any loftiness in their ways,
14834: so that her dependence on them is not only safety but happiness. There
14835: could be no refuge to replace that, if it were broken up. But what is
14836: the use of my taking the vows and settling everything as it should be,
14837: if that marplot Hans comes and upsets it all?”
14838: 
14839: Few things were more likely. Hans was made for mishaps: his very limbs
14840: seemed more breakable than other people’s—his eyes more of a resort
14841: for uninvited flies and other irritating guests. But it was impossible
14842: to forbid Hans’s coming to London. He was intending to get a studio
14843: there and make it his chief home; and to propose that he should defer
14844: coming on some ostensible ground, concealing the real motive of winning
14845: time for Mirah’s position to become more confirmed and independent, was
14846: impracticable. Having no other resource Deronda tried to believe that
14847: both he and Mrs. Meyrick were foolishly troubling themselves about one
14848: of those endless things called probabilities, which never occur; but he
14849: did not quite succeed in his trying; on the contrary, he found himself
14850: going inwardly through a scene where on the first discovery of Hans’s
14851: inclination he gave him a very energetic warning—suddenly checked,
14852: however, by the suspicion of personal feeling that his warmth might be
14853: creating in Hans. He could come to no result, but that the position was
14854: peculiar, and that he could make no further provision against dangers
14855: until they came nearer. To save an unhappy Jewess from drowning
14856: herself, would not have seemed a startling variation among police
14857: reports; but to discover in her so rare a creature as Mirah, was an
14858: exceptional event which might well bring exceptional consequences.
14859: Deronda would not let himself for a moment dwell on any supposition
14860: that the consequences might enter deeply into his own life. The image
14861: of Mirah had never yet had that penetrating radiation which would have
14862: been given to it by the idea of her loving him. When this sort of
14863: effluence is absent from the fancy (whether from the fact or not) a man
14864: may go far in devotedness without perturbation.
14865: 
14866: As to the search for Mirah’s mother and brother, Deronda took what she
14867: had said to-day as a warrant for deferring any immediate measures. His
14868: conscience was not quite easy in this desire for delay, any more than
14869: it was quite easy in his not attempting to learn the truth about his
14870: own mother: in both cases he felt that there might be an unfulfilled
14871: duty to a parent, but in both cases there was an overpowering
14872: repugnance to the possible truth, which threw a turning weight into the
14873: scale of argument.
14874: 
14875: “At least, I will look about,” was his final determination. “I may find
14876: some special Jewish machinery. I will wait till after Christmas.”
14877: 
14878: What should we all do without the calendar, when we want to put off a
14879: disagreeable duty? The admirable arrangements of the solar system, by
14880: which our time is measured, always supply us with a term before which
14881: it is hardly worth while to set about anything we are disinclined to.
14882: 
14883: 
14884: 
14885: 
14886: CHAPTER XXXIII.
14887: 
14888:     “No man,” says a Rabbi, by way of indisputable instance, “may turn the
14889:     bones of his father and mother into spoons”—sure that his hearers
14890:     felt the checks against that form of economy. The market for spoons
14891:     has never expanded enough for any one to say, “Why not?” and to argue
14892:     that human progress lies in such an application of material. The only
14893:     check to be alleged is a sentiment, which will coerce none who do not
14894:     hold that sentiments are the better part of the world’s wealth.
14895: 
14896: 
14897: Deronda meanwhile took to a less fashionable form of exercise than
14898: riding in Rotten Row. He went often rambling in those parts of London
14899: which are most inhabited by common Jews. He walked to the synagogues at
14900: times of service, he looked into shops, he observed faces:—a process
14901: not very promising of particular discovery. Why did he not address
14902: himself to an influential Rabbi or other member of a Jewish community,
14903: to consult on the chances of finding a mother named Cohen, with a son
14904: named Ezra, and a lost daughter named Mirah? He thought of doing
14905: so—after Christmas. The fact was, notwithstanding all his sense of
14906: poetry in common things, Deronda, where a keen personal interest was
14907: aroused, could not, more than the rest of us, continuously escape
14908: suffering from the pressure of that hard unaccommodating Actual, which
14909: has never consulted our taste and is entirely unselect. Enthusiasm, we
14910: know, dwells at ease among ideas, tolerates garlic breathed in the
14911: middle ages, and sees no shabbiness in the official trappings of
14912: classic processions: it gets squeamish when ideals press upon it as
14913: something warmly incarnate, and can hardly face them without fainting.
14914: Lying dreamily in a boat, imagining one’s self in quest of a beautiful
14915: maiden’s relatives in Cordova elbowed by Jews in the time of
14916: Ibn-Gebirol, all the physical incidents can be borne without shock. Or
14917: if the scenery of St. Mary Axe and Whitechapel were imaginatively
14918: transported to the borders of the Rhine at the end of the eleventh
14919: century, when in the ears listening for the signals of the Messiah, the
14920: Hep! Hep! Hep! of the Crusaders came like the bay of blood-hounds; and
14921: in the presence of those devilish missionaries with sword and firebrand
14922: the crouching figure of the reviled Jew turned round erect, heroic,
14923: flashing with sublime constancy in the face of torture and death—what
14924: would the dingy shops and unbeautiful faces signify to the thrill of
14925: contemplative emotion? But the fervor of sympathy with which we
14926: contemplate a grandiose martyrdom is feeble compared with the
14927: enthusiasm that keeps unslacked where there is no danger, no
14928: challenge—nothing but impartial midday falling on commonplace, perhaps
14929: half-repulsive, objects which are really the beloved ideas made flesh.
14930: Here undoubtedly lies the chief poetic energy: in the force of
14931: imagination that pierces or exalts the solid fact, instead of floating
14932: among cloud-pictures. To glory in a prophetic vision of knowledge
14933: covering the earth, is an easier exercise of believing imagination than
14934: to see its beginning in newspaper placards, staring at you from the
14935: bridge beyond the corn-fields; and it might well happen to most of us
14936: dainty people that we were in the thick of the battle of Armageddon
14937: without being aware of anything more than the annoyance of a little
14938: explosive smoke and struggling on the ground immediately about us.
14939: 
14940: It lay in Deronda’s nature usually to contemn the feeble, fastidious
14941: sympathy which shrinks from the broad life of mankind; but now, with
14942: Mirah before him as a living reality, whose experience he had to care
14943: for, he saw every common Jew and Jewess in the light of a comparison
14944: with her, and had a presentiment of the collision between her idea of
14945: the unknown mother and brother and the discovered fact—a presentiment
14946: all the keener in him because of a suppressed consciousness that a not
14947: unlike possibility of collision might lie hidden in his own lot. Not
14948: that he would have looked with more complacency of expectation at
14949: wealthy Jews, outdoing the lords of the Philistines in their sports;
14950: but since there was no likelihood of Mirah’s friends being found among
14951: that class, their habits did not immediately affect him. In this mood
14952: he rambled, without expectation of a more pregnant result than a little
14953: preparation of his own mind, perhaps for future theorizing as well as
14954: practice—very much as if, Mirah being related to Welsh miners, he had
14955: gone to look more closely at the ways of those people, not without
14956: wishing at the same time to get a little light of detail on the history
14957: of Strikes.
14958: 
14959: He really did not long to find anybody in particular; and when, as his
14960: habit was, he looked at the name over a shop door, he was well content
14961: that it was not Ezra Cohen. I confess, he particularly desired that
14962: Ezra Cohen should not keep a shop. Wishes are held to be ominous;
14963: according to which belief the order of the world is so arranged that if
14964: you have an impious objection to a squint, your offspring is the more
14965: likely to be born with one; also, that if you happened to desire a
14966: squint you would not get it. This desponding view of probability the
14967: hopeful entirely reject, taking their wishes as good and sufficient
14968: security for all kinds of fulfilment. Who is absolutely neutral?
14969: Deronda happening one morning to turn into a little side street out of
14970: the noise and obstructions of Holborn, felt the scale dip on the
14971: desponding side.
14972: 
14973: He was rather tired of the streets and had paused to hail a hansom cab
14974: which he saw coming, when his attention was caught by some fine old
14975: clasps in chased silver displayed in the window at his right hand. His
14976: first thought was that Lady Mallinger, who had a strictly Protestant
14977: taste for such Catholic spoils, might like to have these missal-clasps
14978: turned into a bracelet: then his eyes traveled over the other contents
14979: of the window, and he saw that the shop was that kind of pawnbroker’s
14980: where the lead is given to jewelry, lace and all equivocal objects
14981: introduced as _bric-à-brac_. A placard in one corner
14982: announced—_Watches and Jewelry exchanged and repaired_. But his survey
14983: had been noticed from within, and a figure appeared at the door,
14984: looking round at him and saying in a tone of cordial encouragement,
14985: “Good day, sir.” The instant was enough for Deronda to see the face,
14986: unmistakably Jewish, belonged to a young man about thirty, and wincing
14987: from the shopkeeper’s persuasiveness that would probably follow, he had
14988: no sooner returned the “good day,” than he passed to the other side of
14989: the street and beckoned to the cabman to draw up there. From that
14990: station he saw the name over the shop window—_Ezra Cohen_.
14991: 
14992: There might be a hundred Ezra Cohens lettered above shop windows, but
14993: Deronda had not seen them. Probably the young man interested in a
14994: possible customer was Ezra himself; and he was about the age to be
14995: expected in Mirah’s brother, who was grown up while she was still a
14996: little child. But Deronda’s first endeavor as he drove homeward was to
14997: convince himself that there was not the slightest warrantable
14998: presumption of this Ezra being Mirah’s brother; and next, that even if,
14999: in spite of good reasoning, he turned out to be that brother, while on
15000: inquiry the mother was found to be dead, it was not
15001: his—Deronda’s—duty to make known the discovery to Mirah. In
15002: inconvenient disturbance of this conclusion there came his
15003: lately-acquired knowledge that Mirah would have a religious desire to
15004: know of her mother’s death, and also to learn whether her brother were
15005: living. How far was he justified in determining another life by his own
15006: notions? Was it not his secret complaint against the way in which
15007: others had ordered his own life, that he had not open daylight on all
15008: its relations, so that he had not, like other men, the full guidance of
15009: primary duties?
15010: 
15011: The immediate relief from this inward debate was the reflection that he
15012: had not yet made any real discovery, and that by looking into the facts
15013: more closely he should be certified that there was no demand on him for
15014: any decision whatever. He intended to return to that shop as soon as he
15015: could conveniently, and buy the clasps for Lady Mallinger. But he was
15016: hindered for several days by Sir Hugo, who, about to make an
15017: after-dinner speech on a burning topic, wanted Deronda to forage for
15018: him on the legal part of the question, besides wasting time every day
15019: on argument which always ended in a drawn battle. As on many other
15020: questions, they held different sides, but Sir Hugo did not mind this,
15021: and when Deronda put his point well, said, with a mixture of
15022: satisfaction and regret,
15023: 
15024: “Confound it, Dan! why don’t you make an opportunity of saying these
15025: things in public? You’re wrong, you know. You won’t succeed. You’ve got
15026: the massive sentiment—the heavy artillery of the country against you.
15027: But it’s all the better ground for a young man to display himself on.
15028: When I was your age, I should have taken it. And it would be quite as
15029: well for you to be in opposition to me here and there. It would throw
15030: you more into relief. If you would seize an occasion of this sort to
15031: make an impression, you might be in Parliament in no time. And you know
15032: that would gratify me.”
15033: 
15034: “I am sorry not to do what would gratify you, sir,” said Deronda. “But
15035: I cannot persuade myself to look at politics as a profession.”
15036: 
15037: “Why not? if a man is not born into public life by his position in the
15038: country, there’s no way for him but to embrace it by his own efforts.
15039: The business of the country must be done—her Majesty’s Government
15040: carried on, as the old Duke said. And it never could be, my boy, if
15041: everybody looked at politics as if they were prophecy, and demanded an
15042: inspired vocation. If you are to get into Parliament, it won’t do to
15043: sit still and wait for a call either from heaven or constituents.”
15044: 
15045: “I don’t want to make a living out of opinions,” said Deronda;
15046: “especially out of borrowed opinions. Not that I mean to blame other
15047: men. I dare say many better fellows than I don’t mind getting on to a
15048: platform to praise themselves, and giving their word of honor for a
15049: party.”
15050: 
15051: “I’ll tell you what, Dan,” said Sir Hugo, “a man who sets his face
15052: against every sort of humbug is simply a three-cornered, impracticable
15053: fellow. There’s a bad style of humbug, but there is also a good
15054: style—one that oils the wheels and makes progress possible. If you are
15055: to rule men, you must rule them through their own ideas; and I agree
15056: with the Archbishop at Naples who had a St. Januarius procession
15057: against the plague. It’s no use having an Order in Council against
15058: popular shallowness. There is no action possible without a little
15059: acting.”
15060: 
15061: “One may be obliged to give way to an occasional necessity,” said
15062: Deronda. “But it is one thing to say, ‘In this particular case I am
15063: forced to put on this foolscap and grin,’ and another to buy a pocket
15064: foolscap and practice myself in grinning. I can’t see any real public
15065: expediency that does not keep an ideal before it which makes a limit of
15066: deviation from the direct path. But if I were to set up for a public
15067: man I might mistake my success for public expediency.”
15068: 
15069: It was after this dialogue, which was rather jarring to him, that
15070: Deronda set out on his meditated second visit to Ezra Cohen’s. He
15071: entered the street at the end opposite to the Holborn entrance, and an
15072: inward reluctance slackened his pace while his thoughts were
15073: transferring what he had just been saying about public expediency to
15074: the entirely private difficulty which brought him back again into this
15075: unattractive thoroughfare. It might soon become an immediate practical
15076: question with him how far he could call it a wise expediency to conceal
15077: the fact of close kindred. Such questions turning up constantly in life
15078: are often decided in a rough-and-ready way; and to many it will appear
15079: an over-refinement in Deronda that he should make any great point of a
15080: matter confined to his own knowledge. But we have seen the reasons why
15081: he had come to regard concealment as a bane of life, and the necessity
15082: of concealment as a mark by which lines of action were to be avoided.
15083: The prospect of being urged against the confirmed habit of his mind was
15084: naturally grating. He even paused here and there before the most
15085: plausible shop-windows for a gentleman to look into, half inclined to
15086: decide that he would not increase his knowledge about that modern Ezra,
15087: who was certainly not a leader among his people—a hesitation which
15088: proved how, in a man much given to reasoning, a bare possibility may
15089: weigh more than the best-clad likelihood; for Deronda’s reasoning had
15090: decided that all likelihood was against this man’s being Mirah’s
15091: brother.
15092: 
15093: One of the shop-windows he paused before was that of a second-hand
15094: book-shop, where, on a narrow table outside, the literature of the ages
15095: was represented in judicious mixture, from the immortal verse of Homer
15096: to the mortal prose of the railway novel. That the mixture was
15097: judicious was apparent from Deronda’s finding in it something that he
15098: wanted—namely, that wonderful bit of autobiography, the life of the
15099: Polish Jew, Salomon Maimon; which, as he could easily slip it into his
15100: pocket, he took from its place, and entered the shop to pay for,
15101: expecting to see behind the counter a grimy personage showing that
15102: _nonchalance_ about sales which seems to belong universally to the
15103: second-hand book-business. In most other trades you find generous men
15104: who are anxious to sell you their wares for your own welfare; but even
15105: a Jew will not urge Simson’s Euclid on you with an affectionate
15106: assurance that you will have pleasure in reading it, and that he wishes
15107: he had twenty more of the article, so much is it in request. One is led
15108: to fear that a second-hand bookseller may belong to that unhappy class
15109: of men who have no belief in the good of what they get their living by,
15110: yet keep conscience enough to be morose rather than unctuous in their
15111: vocation.
15112: 
15113: But instead of the ordinary tradesman, he saw, on the dark background
15114: of books in the long narrow shop, a figure that was somewhat startling
15115: in its unusualness. A man in threadbare clothing, whose age was
15116: difficult to guess—from the dead yellowish flatness of the flesh,
15117: something like an old ivory carving—was seated on a stool against some
15118: bookshelves that projected beyond the short counter, doing nothing more
15119: remarkable than reading yesterday’s _Times_; but when he let the paper
15120: rest on his lap and looked at the incoming customer, the thought
15121: glanced through Deronda that precisely such a physiognomy as that might
15122: possibly have been seen in a prophet of the Exile, or in some New
15123: Hebrew poet of the mediæval time. It was a fine typical Jewish face,
15124: wrought into intensity of expression apparently by a strenuous eager
15125: experience in which all the satisfaction had been indirect and far off,
15126: and perhaps by some bodily suffering also, which involved that absence
15127: of ease in the present. The features were clear-cut, not large; the
15128: brow not high but broad, and fully defined by the crisp black hair. It
15129: might never have been a particularly handsome face, but it must always
15130: have been forcible; and now with its dark, far-off gaze, and yellow
15131: pallor in relief on the gloom of the backward shop, one might have
15132: imagined one’s self coming upon it in some past prison of the
15133: Inquisition, which a mob had suddenly burst upon; while the look fixed
15134: on an incidental customer seemed eager and questioning enough to have
15135: been turned on one who might have been a messenger either of delivery
15136: or of death. The figure was probably familiar and unexciting enough to
15137: the inhabitants of this street; but to Deronda’s mind it brought so
15138: strange a blending of the unwonted with the common, that there was a
15139: perceptible interval of mutual observation before he asked his
15140: question; “What is the price of this book?”
15141: 
15142: After taking the book and examining the fly-leaves without rising, the
15143: supposed bookseller said, “There is no mark, and Mr. Ram is not in now.
15144: I am keeping the shop while he is gone to dinner. What are you disposed
15145: to give for it?” He held the book close on his lap with his hand on it
15146: and looked examiningly at Deronda, over whom there came the
15147: disagreeable idea, that possibly this striking personage wanted to see
15148: how much could be got out of a customer’s ignorance of prices. But
15149: without further reflection he said, “Don’t you know how much it is
15150: worth?”
15151: 
15152: “Not its market-price. May I ask have you read it?”
15153: 
15154: “No. I have read an account of it, which makes me want to buy it.”
15155: 
15156: “You are a man of learning—you are interested in Jewish history?” This
15157: was said in a deepened tone of eager inquiry.
15158: 
15159: “I am certainly interested in Jewish history,” said Deronda, quietly,
15160: curiosity overcoming his dislike to the sort of inspection as well as
15161: questioning he was under.
15162: 
15163: But immediately the strange Jew rose from his sitting posture, and
15164: Deronda felt a thin hand pressing his arm tightly, while a hoarse,
15165: excited voice, not much above a loud whisper, said,
15166: 
15167: “You are perhaps of our race?”
15168: 
15169: Deronda colored deeply, not liking the grasp, and then answered with a
15170: slight shake of the head, “No.” The grasp was relaxed, the hand
15171: withdrawn, the eagerness of the face collapsed into uninterested
15172: melancholy, as if some possessing spirit which had leaped into the eyes
15173: and gestures had sunk back again to the inmost recesses of the frame;
15174: and moving further off as he held out the little book, the stranger
15175: said in a tone of distant civility, “I believe Mr. Ram will be
15176: satisfied with half-a-crown, sir.”
15177: 
15178: The effect of this change on Deronda—he afterward smiled when he
15179: recalled it—was oddly embarrassing and humiliating, as if some high
15180: dignitary had found him deficient and given him his _congé_. There was
15181: nothing further to be said, however: he paid his half-crown and carried
15182: off his _Salomon Maimon’s Lebensgeschichte_ with a mere “good-morning.”
15183: 
15184: He felt some vexation at the sudden arrest of the interview, and the
15185: apparent prohibition that he should know more of this man, who was
15186: certainly something out of the common way—as different probably as a
15187: Jew could well be from Ezra Cohen, through whose door Deronda was
15188: presently entering, and whose flourishing face glistening on the way to
15189: fatness was hanging over the counter in negotiation with some one on
15190: the other side of the partition, concerning two plated stoppers and
15191: three teaspoons, which lay spread before him. Seeing Deronda enter, he
15192: called out “Mother! Mother!” and then with a familiar nod and smile,
15193: said, “Coming, sir—coming directly.”
15194: 
15195: Deronda could not help looking toward the door from the back with some
15196: anxiety, which was not soothed when he saw a vigorous woman beyond
15197: fifty enter and approach to serve him. Not that there was anything very
15198: repulsive about her: the worst that could be said was that she had that
15199: look of having made her toilet with little water, and by twilight,
15200: which is common to unyouthful people of her class, and of having
15201: presumably slept in her large earrings, if not in her rings and
15202: necklace. In fact, what caused a sinking of heart in Deronda was her
15203: not being so coarse and ugly as to exclude the idea of her being
15204: Mirah’s mother. Any one who has looked at a face to try and discern
15205: signs of known kinship in it will understand his process of
15206: conjecture—how he tried to think away the fat which had gradually
15207: disguised the outlines of youth, and to discern what one may call the
15208: elementary expressions of the face. He was sorry to see no absolute
15209: negative to his fears. Just as it was conceivable that this Ezra,
15210: brought up to trade, might resemble the scapegrace father in everything
15211: but his knowledge and talent, so it was not impossible that this mother
15212: might have had a lovely refined daughter whose type of feature and
15213: expression was like Mirah’s. The eyebrows had a vexatious similarity of
15214: line; and who shall decide how far a face may be masked when the
15215: uncherishing years have thrust it far onward in the ever-new procession
15216: of youth and age? The good-humor of the glance remained and shone out
15217: in a motherly way at Deronda, as she said, in a mild guttural tone,
15218: 
15219: “How can I serve you, sir?”
15220: 
15221: “I should like to look at the silver clasps in the window,” said
15222: Deronda; “the larger ones, please, in the corner there.”
15223: 
15224: They were not quite easy to get at from the mother’s station, and the
15225: son seeing this called out, “I’ll reach ’em, mother; I’ll reach ’em,”
15226: running forward with alacrity, and then handing the clasps to Deronda
15227: with the smiling remark,
15228: 
15229: “Mother’s too proud: she wants to do everything herself. That’s why I
15230: called her to wait on you, sir. When there’s a particular gentleman
15231: customer, sir, I daren’t do any other than call her. But I can’t let
15232: her do herself mischief with stretching.”
15233: 
15234: Here Mr. Cohen made way again for his parent, who gave a little
15235: guttural, amiable laugh while she looked at Deronda, as much as to say,
15236: “This boy will be at his jokes, but you see he’s the best son in the
15237: world,” and evidently the son enjoyed pleasing her, though he also
15238: wished to convey an apology to his distinguished customer for not
15239: giving him the advantage of his own exclusive attention.
15240: 
15241: Deronda began to examine the clasps as if he had many points to observe
15242: before he could come to a decision.
15243: 
15244: “They are only three guineas, sir,” said the mother, encouragingly.
15245: 
15246: “First-rate workmanship, sir—worth twice the money; only I get ’em a
15247: bargain from Cologne,” said the son, parenthetically, from a distance.
15248: 
15249: Meanwhile two new customers entered, and the repeated call, “Addy!”
15250: brought from the back of the shop a group that Deronda turned frankly
15251: to stare at, feeling sure that the stare would be held complimentary.
15252: The group consisted of a black-eyed young woman who carried a
15253: black-eyed little one, its head already covered with black curls, and
15254: deposited it on the counter, from which station it looked round with
15255: even more than the usual intelligence of babies: also a robust boy of
15256: six and a younger girl, both with black eyes and black-ringed
15257: hair—looking more Semitic than their parents, as the puppy lions show
15258: the spots of far-off progenitors. The young woman answering to
15259: “Addy”—a sort of paroquet in a bright blue dress, with coral necklace
15260: and earrings, her hair set up in a huge bush—looked as complacently
15261: lively and unrefined as her husband; and by a certain difference from
15262: the mother deepened in Deronda the unwelcome impression that the latter
15263: was not so utterly common a Jewess as to exclude her being the mother
15264: of Mirah. While that thought was glancing through his mind, the boy had
15265: run forward into the shop with an energetic stamp, and setting himself
15266: about four feet from Deronda, with his hands in the pockets of his
15267: miniature knickerbockers, looked at him with a precocious air of
15268: survey. Perhaps it was chiefly with a diplomatic design to linger and
15269: ingratiate himself that Deronda patted the boy’s head, saying,
15270: 
15271: “What is your name, sirrah?”
15272: 
15273: “Jacob Alexander Cohen,” said the small man, with much ease and
15274: distinctness.
15275: 
15276: “You are not named after your father, then?”
15277: 
15278: “No, after my grandfather; he sells knives and razors and scissors—my
15279: grandfather does,” said Jacob, wishing to impress the stranger with
15280: that high connection. “He gave me this knife.” Here a pocket-knife was
15281: drawn forth, and the small fingers, both naturally and artificially
15282: dark, opened two blades and a cork-screw with much quickness.
15283: 
15284: “Is not that a dangerous plaything?” said Deronda, turning to the
15285: grandmother.
15286: 
15287: “_He_’ll never hurt himself, bless you!” said she, contemplating her
15288: grandson with placid rapture.
15289: 
15290: “Have _you_ got a knife?” says Jacob, coming closer. His small voice
15291: was hoarse in its glibness, as if it belonged to an aged commercial
15292: soul, fatigued with bargaining through many generations.
15293: 
15294: “Yes. Do you want to see it?” said Deronda, taking a small penknife
15295: from his waistcoat-pocket.
15296: 
15297: Jacob seized it immediately and retreated a little, holding the two
15298: knives in his palms and bending over them in meditative comparison. By
15299: this time the other clients were gone, and the whole family had
15300: gathered to the spot, centering their attention on the marvelous Jacob:
15301: the father, mother, and grandmother behind the counter, with baby held
15302: staggering thereon, and the little girl in front leaning at her
15303: brother’s elbow to assist him in looking at the knives.
15304: 
15305: “Mine’s the best,” said Jacob, at last, returning Deronda’s knife as if
15306: he had been entertaining the idea of exchange and had rejected it.
15307: 
15308: Father and mother laughed aloud with delight. “You won’t find Jacob
15309: choosing the worst,” said Mr. Cohen, winking, with much confidence in
15310: the customer’s admiration. Deronda, looking at the grandmother, who had
15311: only an inward silent laugh, said,
15312: 
15313: “Are these the only grandchildren you have?”
15314: 
15315: “All. This is my only son,” she answered in a communicative tone,
15316: Deronda’s glance and manner as usual conveying the impression of
15317: sympathetic interest—which on this occasion answered his purpose well.
15318: It seemed to come naturally enough that he should say,
15319: 
15320: “And you have no daughter?”
15321: 
15322: There was an instantaneous change in the mother’s face. Her lips closed
15323: more firmly, she looked down, swept her hands outward on the counter,
15324: and finally turned her back on Deronda to examine some Indian
15325: handkerchiefs that hung in pawn behind her. Her son gave a significant
15326: glance, set up his shoulders an instant and just put his fingers to his
15327: lips,—then said quickly, “I think you’re a first-rate gentleman in the
15328: city, sir, if I may be allowed to guess.”
15329: 
15330: “No,” said Deronda, with a preoccupied air, “I have nothing to do with
15331: the city.”
15332: 
15333: “That’s a bad job. I thought you might be the young principal of a
15334: first-rate firm,” said Mr. Cohen, wishing to make amends for the check
15335: on his customer’s natural desire to know more of him and his. “But you
15336: understand silver-work, I see.”
15337: 
15338: “A little,” said Deronda, taking up the clasps a moment and laying them
15339: down again. That unwelcome bit of circumstantial evidence had made his
15340: mind busy with a plan which was certainly more like acting than
15341: anything he had been aware of in his own conduct before. But the bare
15342: possibility that more knowledge might nullify the evidence now
15343: overpowered the inclination to rest in uncertainty.
15344: 
15345: “To tell you the truth,” he went on, “my errand is not so much to buy
15346: as to borrow. I dare say you go into rather heavy transactions
15347: occasionally.”
15348: 
15349: “Well, sir, I’ve accommodated gentlemen of distinction—I’m proud to
15350: say it. I wouldn’t exchange my business with any in the world. There’s
15351: none more honorable, nor more charitable, nor more necessary for all
15352: classes, from the good lady who wants a little of the ready for the
15353: baker, to a gentleman like yourself, sir, who may want it for
15354: amusement. I like my business, I like my street, and I like my shop. I
15355: wouldn’t have it a door further down. And I wouldn’t be without a
15356: pawn-shop, sir, to be the Lord Mayor. It puts you in connection with
15357: the world at large. I say it’s like the government revenue—it embraces
15358: the brass as well as the gold of the country. And a man who doesn’t get
15359: money, sir, can’t accommodate. Now, what can I do for _you_, sir?”
15360: 
15361: If an amiable self-satisfaction is the mark of earthly bliss, Solomon
15362: in all his glory was a pitiable mortal compared with Mr. Cohen—clearly
15363: one of those persons, who, being in excellent spirits about themselves,
15364: are willing to cheer strangers by letting them know it. While he was
15365: delivering himself with lively rapidity, he took the baby from his wife
15366: and holding it on his arm presented his features to be explored by its
15367: small fists. Deronda, not in a cheerful mood, was rashly pronouncing
15368: this Ezra Cohen to be the most unpoetic Jew he had ever met with in
15369: books or life: his phraseology was as little as possible like that of
15370: the Old Testament: and no shadow of a suffering race distinguished his
15371: vulgarity of soul from that of a prosperous, pink-and-white huckster of
15372: the purest English lineage. It is naturally a Christian feeling that a
15373: Jew ought not to be conceited. However, this was no reason for not
15374: persevering in his project, and he answered at once in adventurous
15375: ignorance of technicalities,
15376: 
15377: “I have a fine diamond ring to offer as security—not with me at this
15378: moment, unfortunately, for I am not in the habit of wearing it. But I
15379: will come again this evening and bring it with me. Fifty pounds at once
15380: would be a convenience to me.”
15381: 
15382: “Well, you know, this evening is the Sabbath, young gentleman,” said
15383: Cohen, “and I go to the _Shool_. The shop will be closed. But
15384: accommodation is a work of charity; if you can’t get here before, and
15385: are any ways pressed—why, I’ll look at your diamond. You’re perhaps
15386: from the West End—a longish drive?”
15387: 
15388: “Yes; and your Sabbath begins early at this season. I could be here by
15389: five—will that do?” Deronda had not been without hope that by asking
15390: to come on a Friday evening he might get a better opportunity of
15391: observing points in the family character, and might even be able to put
15392: some decisive question.
15393: 
15394: Cohen assented; but here the marvelous Jacob, whose _physique_
15395: supported a precocity that would have shattered a Gentile of his years,
15396: showed that he had been listening with much comprehension by saying,
15397: “You are coming again. Have you got any more knives at home?”
15398: 
15399: “I think I have one,” said Deronda, smiling down at him.
15400: 
15401: “Has it two blades and a hook—and a white handle like that?” said
15402: Jacob, pointing to the waistcoat-pocket.
15403: 
15404: “I dare say it has.”
15405: 
15406: “Do you like a cork-screw?” said Jacob, exhibiting that article in his
15407: own knife again, and looking up with serious inquiry.
15408: 
15409: “Yes,” said Deronda, experimentally.
15410: 
15411: “Bring your knife, then, and we’ll shwop,” said Jacob, returning the
15412: knife to his pocket, and stamping about with the sense that he had
15413: concluded a good transaction.
15414: 
15415: The grandmother had now recovered her usual manners, and the whole
15416: family watched Deronda radiantly when he caressingly lifted the little
15417: girl, to whom he had not hitherto given attention, and seating her on
15418: the counter, asked for her name also. She looked at him in silence, and
15419: put her fingers to her gold earrings, which he did not seem to have
15420: noticed.
15421: 
15422: “Adelaide Rebekah is her name,” said her mother, proudly. “Speak to the
15423: gentleman, lovey.”
15424: 
15425: “Shlav’m Shabbes fyock on,” said Adelaide Rebekah.
15426: 
15427: “Her Sabbath frock, she means,” said the father, in explanation.
15428: “She’ll have her Sabbath frock on this evening.”
15429: 
15430: “And will you let me see you in it, Adelaide?” said Deronda, with that
15431: gentle intonation which came very easily to him.
15432: 
15433: “Say yes, lovey—yes, if you please, sir,” said her mother, enchanted
15434: with this handsome young gentleman, who appreciated remarkable children.
15435: 
15436: “And will you give me a kiss this evening?” said Deronda with a hand on
15437: each of her little brown shoulders.
15438: 
15439: Adelaide Rebekah (her miniature crinoline and monumental features
15440: corresponded with the combination of her names) immediately put up her
15441: lips to pay the kiss in advance; whereupon her father rising in still
15442: more glowing satisfaction with the general meritoriousness of his
15443: circumstances, and with the stranger who was an admiring witness, said
15444: cordially,
15445: 
15446: “You see there’s somebody will be disappointed if you don’t come this
15447: evening, sir. You won’t mind sitting down in our family place and
15448: waiting a bit for me, if I’m not in when you come, sir? I’ll stretch a
15449: point to accommodate a gent of your sort. Bring the diamond, and I’ll
15450: see what I can do for you.”
15451: 
15452: Deronda thus left the most favorable impression behind him, as a
15453: preparation for more easy intercourse. But for his own part those
15454: amenities had been carried on under the heaviest spirits. If these were
15455: really Mirah’s relatives, he could not imagine that even her fervid
15456: filial piety could give the reunion with them any sweetness beyond such
15457: as could be found in the strict fulfillment of a painful duty. What did
15458: this vaunting brother need? And with the most favorable supposition
15459: about the hypothetic mother, Deronda shrank from the image of a first
15460: meeting between her and Mirah, and still more from the idea of Mirah’s
15461: domestication with this family. He took refuge in disbelief. To find an
15462: Ezra Cohen when the name was running in your head was no more
15463: extraordinary than to find a Josiah Smith under like circumstances; and
15464: as to the coincidence about the daughter, it would probably turn out to
15465: be a difference. If, however, further knowledge confirmed the more
15466: undesirable conclusion, what would be wise expediency?—to try and
15467: determine the best consequences by concealment, or to brave other
15468: consequences for the sake of that openness which is the sweet fresh air
15469: of our moral life.
15470: 
15471: 
15472: 
15473: 
15474: CHAPTER XXXIV.
15475: 
15476:         “Er ist geheissen
15477:   Israel. Ihn hat verwandelt
15478:   Hexenspruch in einen Hund.
15479:        *       *       *       *       *
15480:   Aber jeden Freitag Abend,
15481:   In der Dämm’rungstunde, plötzlich
15482:   Weicht der Zauber, und der Hund
15483:   Wird aufs Neu’ ein menschlich Wesen.”
15484:                     —HEINE: _Prinzessin Sabbath_.
15485: 
15486: 
15487: When Deronda arrived at five o’clock, the shop was closed and the door
15488: was opened for him by the Christian servant. When she showed him into
15489: the room behind the shop he was surprised at the prettiness of the
15490: scene. The house was old, and rather extensive at the back: probably
15491: the large room he now entered was gloomy by daylight, but now it was
15492: agreeably lit by a fine old brass lamp with seven oil-lights hanging
15493: above the snow-white cloth spread on the central table. The ceiling and
15494: walls were smoky, and all the surroundings were dark enough to throw
15495: into relief the human figures, which had a Venetian glow of coloring.
15496: The grandmother was arrayed in yellowish brown with a large gold chain
15497: in lieu of the necklace, and by this light her yellow face with its
15498: darkly-marked eyebrows and framing roll of gray hair looked as handsome
15499: as was necessary for picturesque effect. Young Mrs. Cohen was clad in
15500: red and black, with a string of large artificial pearls wound round and
15501: round her neck: the baby lay asleep in the cradle under a scarlet
15502: counterpane; Adelaide Rebekah was in braided amber, and Jacob Alexander
15503: was in black velveteen with scarlet stockings. As the four pairs of
15504: black eyes all glistened a welcome at Deronda, he was almost ashamed of
15505: the supercilious dislike these happy-looking creatures had raised in
15506: him by daylight. Nothing could be more cordial than the greeting he
15507: received, and both mother and grandmother seemed to gather more dignity
15508: from being seen on the private hearth, showing hospitality. He looked
15509: round with some wonder at the old furniture: the oaken bureau and high
15510: side-table must surely be mere matters of chance and economy, and not
15511: due to the family taste. A large dish of blue and yellow ware was set
15512: up on the side-table, and flanking it were two old silver vessels; in
15513: front of them a large volume in darkened vellum with a deep-ribbed
15514: back. In the corner at the farther end was an open door into an inner
15515: room, where there was also a light.
15516: 
15517: Deronda took in these details by parenthetic glances while he met
15518: Jacob’s pressing solicitude about the knife. He had taken the pains to
15519: buy one with the requisites of the hook and white handle, and produced
15520: it on demand, saying,
15521: 
15522: “Is that the sort of thing you want, Jacob?”
15523: 
15524: It was subjected to a severe scrutiny, the hook and blades were opened,
15525: and the article of barter with the cork-screw was drawn forth for
15526: comparison.
15527: 
15528: “Why do you like a hook better than a cork-screw?” said Deronda.
15529: 
15530: “’Caush I can get hold of things with a hook. A cork-screw won’t go into
15531: anything but corks. But it’s better for you, you can draw corks.”
15532: 
15533: “You agree to change, then?” said Deronda, observing that the
15534: grandmother was listening with delight.
15535: 
15536: “What else have you got in your pockets?” said Jacob, with deliberative
15537: seriousness.
15538: 
15539: “Hush, hush, Jacob, love,” said the grandmother. And Deronda, mindful
15540: of discipline, answered,
15541: 
15542: “I think I must not tell you that. Our business was with the knives.”
15543: 
15544: Jacob looked up into his face scanningly for a moment or two, and
15545: apparently arriving at his conclusions, said gravely,
15546: 
15547: “I’ll shwop,” handing the cork-screw knife to Deronda, who pocketed it
15548: with corresponding gravity.
15549: 
15550: Immediately the small son of Shem ran off into the next room, whence
15551: his voice was heard in rapid chat; and then ran back again—when,
15552: seeing his father enter, he seized a little velveteen hat which lay on
15553: a chair and put it on to approach him. Cohen kept on his own hat, and
15554: took no notice of the visitor, but stood still while the two children
15555: went up to him and clasped his knees: then he laid his hands on each in
15556: turn and uttered his Hebrew benediction; whereupon the wife, who had
15557: lately taken baby from the cradle, brought it up to her husband and
15558: held it under his outstretched hands, to be blessed in its sleep. For
15559: the moment, Deronda thought that this pawnbroker, proud of his
15560: vocation, was not utterly prosaic.
15561: 
15562: “Well, sir, you found your welcome in my family, I think,” said Cohen,
15563: putting down his hat and becoming his former self. “And you’ve been
15564: punctual. Nothing like a little stress here,” he added, tapping his
15565: side pocket as he sat down. “It’s good for us all in our turn. I’ve
15566: felt it when I’ve had to make up payments. I began to fit every sort of
15567: box. It’s bracing to the mind. Now then! let us see, let us see.”
15568: 
15569: “That is the ring I spoke of,” said Deronda, taking it from his finger.
15570: “I believe it cost a hundred pounds. It will be a sufficient pledge to
15571: you for fifty, I think. I shall probably redeem it in a month or so.”
15572: 
15573: Cohen’s glistening eyes seemed to get a little nearer together as he
15574: met the ingenuous look of this crude young gentleman, who apparently
15575: supposed that redemption was a satisfaction to pawnbrokers. He took the
15576: ring, examined and returned it, saying with indifference, “Good, good.
15577: We’ll talk of it after our meal. Perhaps you’ll join us, if you’ve no
15578: objection. Me and my wife’ll feel honored, and so will mother; won’t
15579: you, mother?”
15580: 
15581: The invitation was doubly echoed, and Deronda gladly accepted it. All
15582: now turned and stood round the table. No dish was at present seen
15583: except one covered with a napkin; and Mrs. Cohen had placed a china
15584: bowl near her husband that he might wash his hands in it. But after
15585: putting on his hat again, he paused, and called in a loud voice,
15586: “Mordecai!”
15587: 
15588: Can this be part of the religious ceremony? thought Deronda, not
15589: knowing what might be expected of the ancient hero. But he heard a
15590: “Yes” from the next room, which made him look toward the open door; and
15591: there, to his astonishment, he saw the figure of the enigmatic Jew whom
15592: he had this morning met with in the book-shop. Their eyes met, and
15593: Mordecai looked as much surprised as Deronda—neither in his surprise
15594: making any sign of recognition. But when Mordecai was seating himself
15595: at the end of the table, he just bent his head to the guest in a cold
15596: and distant manner, as if the disappointment of the morning remained a
15597: disagreeable association with this new acquaintance.
15598: 
15599: Cohen now washed his hands, pronouncing Hebrew words the while:
15600: afterward, he took off the napkin covering the dish and disclosed the
15601: two long flat loaves besprinkled with seed—the memorial of the manna
15602: that fed the wandering forefathers—and breaking off small pieces gave
15603: one to each of the family, including Adelaide Rebekah, who stood on the
15604: chair with her whole length exhibited in her amber-colored garment, her
15605: little Jewish nose lengthened by compression of the lip in the effort
15606: to make a suitable appearance. Cohen then uttered another Hebrew
15607: blessing, and after that, the male heads were uncovered, all seated
15608: themselves, and the meal went on without any peculiarity that
15609: interested Deronda. He was not very conscious of what dishes he ate
15610: from; being preoccupied with a desire to turn the conversation in a way
15611: that would enable him to ask some leading question; and also thinking
15612: of Mordecai, between whom and himself there was an exchange of
15613: fascinated, half-furtive glances. Mordecai had no handsome Sabbath
15614: garment, but instead of the threadbare rusty black coat of the morning
15615: he wore one of light drab, which looked as if it had once been a
15616: handsome loose paletot now shrunk with washing; and this change of
15617: clothing gave a still stronger accentuation to his dark-haired, eager
15618: face which might have belonged to the prophet Ezekiel—also probably
15619: not modish in the eyes of contemporaries. It was noticeable that the
15620: thin tails of the fried fish were given to Mordecai; and in general the
15621: sort of share assigned to a poor relation—no doubt a “survival” of
15622: prehistoric practice, not yet generally admitted to be superstitious.
15623: 
15624: Mr. Cohen kept up the conversation with much liveliness, introducing as
15625: subjects always in taste (the Jew is proud of his loyalty) the Queen
15626: and the Royal Family, the Emperor and Empress of the French—into which
15627: both grandmother and wife entered with zest. Mrs. Cohen the younger
15628: showed an accurate memory of distinguished birthdays; and the elder
15629: assisted her son in informing the guest of what occurred when the
15630: Emperor and Empress were in England and visited the city ten years
15631: before.
15632: 
15633: “I dare say you know all about it better than we do, sir,” said Cohen,
15634: repeatedly, by way of preface to full information; and the interesting
15635: statements were kept up in a trio.
15636: 
15637: “Our baby is named _Eu_genie Esther,” said young Mrs. Cohen,
15638: vivaciously.
15639: 
15640: “It’s wonderful how the Emperor’s like a cousin of mine in the face,”
15641: said the grandmother; “it struck me like lightning when I caught sight
15642: of him. I couldn’t have thought it.”
15643: 
15644: “Mother and me went to see the Emperor and Empress at the Crystal
15645: Palace,” said Mr. Cohen. “I had a fine piece of work to take care of,
15646: mother; she might have been squeezed flat—though she was pretty near
15647: as lusty then as she is now. I said if I had a hundred mothers I’d
15648: never take one of ’em to see the Emperor and Empress at the Crystal
15649: Palace again; and you may think a man can’t afford it when he’s got but
15650: one mother—not if he’d ever so big an insurance on her.” He stroked
15651: his mother’s shoulder affectionately, and chuckled a little at his own
15652: humor.
15653: 
15654: “Your mother has been a widow a long while, perhaps,” said Deronda,
15655: seizing his opportunity. “That has made your care for her the more
15656: needful.”
15657: 
15658: “Ay, ay, it’s a good many _yore-zeit_ since I had to manage for her and
15659: myself,” said Cohen quickly. “I went early to it. It’s that makes you a
15660: sharp knife.”
15661: 
15662: “What does—what makes a sharp knife, father?” said Jacob, his cheek
15663: very much swollen with sweet-cake.
15664: 
15665: The father winked at his guest and said, “Having your nose put on the
15666: grindstone.”
15667: 
15668: Jacob slipped from his chair with the piece of sweet-cake in his hand,
15669: and going close up to Mordecai, who had been totally silent hitherto,
15670: said, “What does that mean—putting my nose to the grindstone?”
15671: 
15672: “It means that you are to bear being hurt without making a noise,” said
15673: Mordecai, turning his eyes benignantly on the small face close to his.
15674: Jacob put the corner of the cake into Mordecai’s mouth as an invitation
15675: to bite, saying meanwhile, “I shan’t though,” and keeping his eyes on
15676: the cake to observe how much of it went in this act of generosity.
15677: Mordecai took a bite and smiled, evidently meaning to please the lad,
15678: and the little incident made them both look more lovable. Deronda,
15679: however, felt with some vexation that he had taken little by his
15680: question.
15681: 
15682: “I fancy that is the right quarter for learning,” said he, carrying on
15683: the subject that he might have an excuse for addressing Mordecai, to
15684: whom he turned and said, “You have been a great student, I imagine?”
15685: 
15686: “I have studied,” was the quiet answer. “And you?—You know German by
15687: the book you were buying.”
15688: 
15689: “Yes, I have studied in Germany. Are you generally engaged in
15690: bookselling?” said Deronda.
15691: 
15692: “No; I only go to Mr. Ram’s shop every day to keep it while he goes to
15693: meals,” said Mordecai, who was now looking at Deronda with what seemed
15694: a revival of his original interest: it seemed as if the face had some
15695: attractive indication for him which now neutralized the former
15696: disappointment. After a slight pause, he said, “Perhaps you know
15697: Hebrew?”
15698: 
15699: “I am sorry to say, not at all.”
15700: 
15701: Mordecai’s countenance fell: he cast down his eyelids, looking at his
15702: hands, which lay crossed before him, and said no more. Deronda had now
15703: noticed more decisively than in their former interview a difficulty in
15704: breathing, which he thought must be a sign of consumption.
15705: 
15706: “I’ve had something else to do than to get book-learning,” said Mr.
15707: Cohen,—“I’ve had to make myself knowing about useful things. I know
15708: stones well,”—here he pointed to Deronda’s ring. “I’m not afraid of
15709: taking that ring of yours at my own valuation. But now,” he added, with
15710: a certain drop in his voice to a lower, more familiar nasal, “what do
15711: you want for it?”
15712: 
15713: “Fifty or sixty pounds,” Deronda answered, rather too carelessly.
15714: 
15715: Cohen paused a little, thrust his hands into his pockets, fixed on
15716: Deronda a pair of glistening eyes that suggested a miraculous
15717: guinea-pig, and said, “Couldn’t do you that. Happy to oblige, but
15718: couldn’t go that lengths. Forty pound—say forty—I’ll let you have
15719: forty on it.”
15720: 
15721: Deronda was aware that Mordecai had looked up again at the words
15722: implying a monetary affair, and was now examining him again, while he
15723: said, “Very well, I shall redeem it in a month or so.”
15724: 
15725: “Good. I’ll make you out the ticket by-and-by,” said Cohen,
15726: indifferently. Then he held up his finger as a sign that conversation
15727: must be deferred. He, Mordecai and Jacob put on their hats, and Cohen
15728: opened a thanksgiving, which was carried on by responses, till Mordecai
15729: delivered himself alone at some length, in a solemn chanting tone, with
15730: his chin slightly uplifted and his thin hands clasped easily before
15731: him. Not only in his accent and tone, but in his freedom from the
15732: self-consciousness which has reference to others’ approbation, there
15733: could hardly have been a stronger contrast to the Jew at the other end
15734: of the table. It was an unaccountable conjunction—the presence among
15735: these common, prosperous, shopkeeping types, of a man who, in an
15736: emaciated threadbare condition, imposed a certain awe on Deronda, and
15737: an embarrassment at not meeting his expectations.
15738: 
15739: No sooner had Mordecai finished his devotional strain, than rising,
15740: with a slight bend of his head to the stranger, he walked back into his
15741: room, and shut the door behind him.
15742: 
15743: “That seems to be rather a remarkable man,” said Deronda, turning to
15744: Cohen, who immediately set up his shoulders, put out his tongue
15745: slightly, and tapped his own brow. It was clearly to be understood that
15746: Mordecai did not come up to the standard of sanity which was set by Mr.
15747: Cohen’s view of men and things.
15748: 
15749: “Does he belong to your family?” said Deronda.
15750: 
15751: This idea appeared to be rather ludicrous to the ladies as well as to
15752: Cohen, and the family interchanged looks of amusement.
15753: 
15754: “No, no,” said Cohen. “Charity! charity! he worked for me, and when he
15755: got weaker and weaker I took him in. He’s an incumbrance; but he brings
15756: a blessing down, and he teaches the boy. Besides, he does the repairing
15757: at the watches and jewelry.”
15758: 
15759: Deronda hardly abstained from smiling at this mixture of kindliness and
15760: the desire to justify it in the light of a calculation; but his
15761: willingness to speak further of Mordecai, whose character was made the
15762: more enigmatically striking by these new details, was baffled. Mr.
15763: Cohen immediately dismissed the subject by reverting to the
15764: “accommodation,” which was also an act of charity, and proceeded to
15765: make out the ticket, get the forty pounds, and present them both in
15766: exchange for the diamond ring. Deronda, feeling that it would be hardly
15767: delicate to protract his visit beyond the settlement of the business
15768: which was its pretext, had to take his leave, with no more decided
15769: result than the advance of forty pounds and the pawn-ticket in his
15770: breast-pocket, to make a reason for returning when he came up to town
15771: after Christmas. He was resolved that he would then endeavor to gain a
15772: little more insight into the character and history of Mordecai; from
15773: whom also he might gather something decisive about the Cohens—for
15774: example, the reason why it was forbidden to ask Mrs. Cohen the elder
15775: whether she had a daughter.

15780: BOOK V.—MORDECAI.
15781: 
15782: 
15783: CHAPTER XXXV.
15784: 
15785:     Were uneasiness of conscience measured by extent of crime, human
15786:     history had been different, and one should look to see the contrivers
15787:     of greedy wars and the mighty marauders of the money-market in one
15788:     troop of self-lacerating penitents with the meaner robber and
15789:     cut-purse and the murderer that doth his butchery in small with his own
15790:     hand. No doubt wickedness hath its rewards to distribute; but who so
15791:     wins in this devil’s game must needs be baser, more cruel, more brutal
15792:     than the order of this planet will allow for the multitude born of
15793:     woman, the most of these carrying a form of conscience—a fear which
15794:     is the shadow of justice, a pity which is the shadow of love—that
15795:     hindereth from the prize of serene wickedness, itself difficult of
15796:     maintenance in our composite flesh.
15797: 
15798: 
15799: On the twenty-ninth of December Deronda knew that the Grandcourts had
15800: arrived at the Abbey, but he had had no glimpse of them before he went
15801: to dress for dinner. There had been a splendid fall of snow, allowing
15802: the party of children the rare pleasures of snow-balling and
15803: snow-building, and in the Christmas holidays the Mallinger girls were
15804: content with no amusement unless it were joined in and managed by
15805: “cousin,” as they had always called Deronda. After that outdoor
15806: exertion he had been playing billiards, and thus the hours had passed
15807: without his dwelling at all on the prospect of meeting Gwendolen at
15808: dinner. Nevertheless that prospect was interesting to him; and when, a
15809: little tired and heated with working at amusement, he went to his room
15810: before the half-hour bell had rung, he began to think of it with some
15811: speculation on the sort of influence her marriage with Grandcourt would
15812: have on her, and on the probability that there would be some
15813: discernible shades of change in her manner since he saw her at Diplow,
15814: just as there had been since his first vision of her at Leubronn.
15815: 
15816: “I fancy there are some natures one could see growing or degenerating
15817: every day, if one watched them,” was his thought. “I suppose some of us
15818: go on faster than others: and I am sure she is a creature who keeps
15819: strong traces of anything that has once impressed her. That little
15820: affair of the necklace, and the idea that somebody thought her gambling
15821: wrong, had evidently bitten into her. But such impressibility leads
15822: both ways: it may drive one to desperation as soon as to anything
15823: better. And whatever fascinations Grandcourt may have for capricious
15824: tastes—good heavens! who can believe that he would call out the tender
15825: affections in daily companionship? One might be tempted to horsewhip
15826: him for the sake of getting some show of passion into his face and
15827: speech. I’m afraid she married him out of ambition—to escape poverty.
15828: But why did she run out of his way at first? The poverty came after,
15829: though. Poor thing! she may have been urged into it. How can one feel
15830: anything else than pity for a young creature like that—full of unused
15831: life—ignorantly rash—hanging all her blind expectations on that
15832: remnant of a human being.”
15833: 
15834: Doubtless the phrases which Deronda’s meditation applied to the
15835: bridegroom were the less complimentary for the excuses and pity in
15836: which it clad the bride. His notion of Grandcourt as a “remnant” was
15837: founded on no particular knowledge, but simply on the impression which
15838: ordinary polite intercourse had given him that Grandcourt had worn out
15839: all his natural healthy interest in things.
15840: 
15841: In general, one may be sure that whenever a marriage of any mark takes
15842: place, male acquaintances are likely to pity the bride, female
15843: acquaintances the bridegroom: each, it is thought, might have done
15844: better; and especially where the bride is charming, young gentlemen on
15845: the scene are apt to conclude that she can have no real attachment to a
15846: fellow so uninteresting to themselves as her husband, but has married
15847: him on other grounds. Who, under such circumstances, pities the
15848: husband? Even his female friends are apt to think his position
15849: retributive: he should have chosen some one else. But perhaps Deronda
15850: may be excused that he did not prepare any pity for Grandcourt, who had
15851: never struck acquaintances as likely to come out of his experiences
15852: with more suffering than he inflicted; whereas, for Gwendolen, young,
15853: headlong, eager for pleasure, fed with the flattery which makes a
15854: lovely girl believe in her divine right to rule—how quickly might life
15855: turn from expectancy to a bitter sense of the irremediable! After what
15856: he had seen of her he must have had rather dull feelings not to have
15857: looked forward with some interest to her entrance into the room. Still,
15858: since the honeymoon was already three weeks in the distance, and
15859: Gwendolen had been enthroned, not only at Ryelands, but at Diplow, she
15860: was likely to have composed her countenance with suitable manifestation
15861: or concealment, not being one who would indulge the curious by a
15862: helpless exposure of her feelings.
15863: 
15864: A various party had been invited to meet the new couple; the old
15865: aristocracy was represented by Lord and Lady Pentreath; the old gentry
15866: by young Mr. and Mrs. Fitzadam of the Worcestershire branch of the
15867: Fitzadams; politics and the public good, as specialized in the cider
15868: interest, by Mr. Fenn, member for West Orchards, accompanied by his two
15869: daughters; Lady Mallinger’s family, by her brother, Mr. Raymond, and
15870: his wife; the useful bachelor element by Mr. Sinker, the eminent
15871: counsel, and by Mr. Vandernoodt, whose acquaintance Sir Hugo had found
15872: pleasant enough at Leubronn to be adopted in England.
15873: 
15874: All had assembled in the drawing-room before the new couple appeared.
15875: Meanwhile, the time was being passed chiefly in noticing the
15876: children—various little Raymonds, nephews and nieces of Lady
15877: Mallinger’s with her own three girls, who were always allowed to appear
15878: at this hour. The scene was really delightful—enlarged by full-length
15879: portraits with deep back-grounds, inserted in the cedar
15880: paneling—surmounted by a ceiling that glowed with the rich colors of
15881: the coats of arms ranged between the sockets—illuminated almost as
15882: much by the red fire of oak-boughs as by the pale wax-lights—stilled
15883: by the deep-piled carpet and by the high English breeding that subdues
15884: all voices; while the mixture of ages, from the white-haired Lord and
15885: Lady Pentreath to the four-year-old Edgar Raymond, gave a varied charm
15886: to the living groups. Lady Mallinger, with fair matronly roundness and
15887: mildly prominent blue eyes, moved about in her black velvet, carrying a
15888: tiny white dog on her arm as a sort of finish to her costume; the
15889: children were scattered among the ladies, while most of the gentlemen
15890: were standing rather aloof, conversing with that very moderate vivacity
15891: observable during the long minutes before dinner. Deronda was a little
15892: out of the circle in a dialogue fixed upon him by Mr. Vandernoodt, a
15893: man of the best Dutch blood imported at the revolution: for the rest,
15894: one of those commodious persons in society who are nothing particular
15895: themselves, but are understood to be acquainted with the best in every
15896: department; close-clipped, pale-eyed, _nonchalant_, as good a foil as
15897: could well be found to the intense coloring and vivid gravity of
15898: Deronda.
15899: 
15900: He was talking of the bride and bridegroom, whose appearance was being
15901: waited for. Mr. Vandernoodt was an industrious gleaner of personal
15902: details, and could probably tell everything about a great philosopher
15903: or physicist except his theories or discoveries; he was now implying
15904: that he had learned many facts about Grandcourt since meeting him at
15905: Leubronn.
15906: 
15907: “Men who have seen a good deal of life don’t always end by choosing
15908: their wives so well. He has had rather an anecdotic history—gone
15909: rather deep into pleasures, I fancy, lazy as he is. But, of course, you
15910: know all about him.”
15911: 
15912: “No, really,” said Deronda, in an indifferent tone. “I know little more
15913: of him than that he is Sir Hugo’s nephew.”
15914: 
15915: But now the door opened and deferred any satisfaction of Mr.
15916: Vandernoodt’s communicativeness.
15917: 
15918: The scene was one to set off any figure of distinction that entered on
15919: it, and certainly when Mr. and Mrs. Grandcourt entered, no beholder
15920: could deny that their figures had distinction. The bridegroom had
15921: neither more nor less easy perfection of costume, neither more nor less
15922: well-cut impassibility of face, than before his marriage. It was to be
15923: supposed of him that he would put up with nothing less than the best in
15924: outward equipment, wife included; and the bride was what he might have
15925: been expected to choose. “By George, I think she’s handsomer, if
15926: anything!” said Mr. Vandernoodt. And Deronda was of the same opinion,
15927: but he said nothing. The white silk and diamonds—it may seem strange,
15928: but she did wear diamonds on her neck, in her ears, in her hair—might
15929: have something to do with the new imposingness of her beauty, which
15930: flashed on him as more unquestionable if not more thoroughly
15931: satisfactory than when he had first seen her at the gaming-table. Some
15932: faces which are peculiar in their beauty are like original works of
15933: art: for the first time they are almost always met with question. But
15934: in seeing Gwendolen at Diplow, Deronda had discerned in her more than
15935: he had expected of that tender appealing charm which we call womanly.
15936: Was there any new change since then? He distrusted his impressions; but
15937: as he saw her receiving greetings with what seemed a proud cold
15938: quietude and a superficial smile, there seemed to be at work within her
15939: the same demonic force that had possessed her when she took him in her
15940: resolute glance and turned away a loser from the gaming-table. There
15941: was no time for more of a conclusion—no time even for him to give his
15942: greeting before the summons to dinner.
15943: 
15944: He sat not far from opposite to her at table, and could sometimes hear
15945: what she said in answer to Sir Hugo, who was at his liveliest in
15946: conversation with her; but though he looked toward her with the
15947: intention of bowing, she gave him no opportunity of doing so for some
15948: time. At last Sir Hugo, who might have imagined that they had already
15949: spoken to each other, said, “Deronda, you will like to hear what Mrs.
15950: Grandcourt tells me about your favorite Klesmer.”
15951: 
15952: Gwendolen’s eyelids had been lowered, and Deronda, already looking at
15953: her, thought he discovered a quivering reluctance as she was obliged to
15954: raise them and return his unembarrassed bow and smile, her own smile
15955: being one of the lip merely. It was but an instant, and Sir Hugo
15956: continued without pause,
15957: 
15958: “The Arrowpoints have condoned the marriage, and he is spending the
15959: Christmas with his bride at Quetcham.”
15960: 
15961: “I suppose he will be glad of it for the sake of his wife, else I dare
15962: say he would not have minded keeping at a distance,” said Deronda.
15963: 
15964: “It’s a sort of troubadour story,” said Lady Pentreath, an easy,
15965: deep-voiced old lady; “I’m glad to find a little romance left among us.
15966: I think our young people now are getting too worldly wise.”
15967: 
15968: “It shows the Arrowpoints’ good sense, however, to have adopted the
15969: affair, after the fuss in the paper,” said Sir Hugo. “And disowning
15970: your own child because of a _mésalliance_ is something like disowning
15971: your one eye: everybody knows it’s yours, and you have no other to make
15972: an appearance with.”
15973: 
15974: “As to _mésalliance_, there’s no blood on any side,” said Lady
15975: Pentreath. “Old Admiral Arrowpoint was one of Nelson’s men, you know—a
15976: doctor’s son. And we all know how the mother’s money came.”
15977: 
15978: “If they were any _mésalliance_ in the case, I should say it was on
15979: Klesmer’s side,” said Deronda.
15980: 
15981: “Ah, you think it is a case of the immortal marrying the mortal. What
15982: is your opinion?” said Sir Hugo, looking at Gwendolen.
15983: 
15984: “I have no doubt that Herr Klesmer thinks himself immortal. But I dare
15985: say his wife will burn as much incense before him as he requires,” said
15986: Gwendolen. She had recovered any composure that she might have lost.
15987: 
15988: “Don’t you approve of a wife burning incense before her husband?” said
15989: Sir Hugo, with an air of jocoseness.
15990: 
15991: “Oh, yes,” said Gwendolen, “if it were only to make others believe in
15992: him.” She paused a moment and then said with more gayety, “When Herr
15993: Klesmer admires his own genius, it will take off some of the absurdity
15994: if his wife says Amen.”
15995: 
15996: “Klesmer is no favorite of yours, I see,” said Sir Hugo.
15997: 
15998: “I think very highly of him, I assure you,” said Gwendolen. “His genius
15999: is quite above my judgment, and I know him to be exceedingly generous.”
16000: 
16001: She spoke with the sudden seriousness which is often meant to correct
16002: an unfair or indiscreet sally, having a bitterness against Klesmer in
16003: her secret soul which she knew herself unable to justify. Deronda was
16004: wondering what he should have thought of her if he had never heard of
16005: her before: probably that she put on a little hardness and defiance by
16006: way of concealing some painful consciousness—if, indeed, he could
16007: imagine her manners otherwise than in the light of his suspicion. But
16008: why did she not recognize him with more friendliness?
16009: 
16010: Sir Hugo, by way of changing the subject, said to her, “Is not this a
16011: beautiful room? It was part of the refectory of the Abbey. There was a
16012: division made by those pillars and the three arches, and afterward they
16013: were built up. Else it was half as large again originally. There used
16014: to be rows of Benedictines sitting where we are sitting. Suppose we
16015: were suddenly to see the lights burning low and the ghosts of the old
16016: monks rising behind all our chairs!”
16017: 
16018: “Please don’t!” said Gwendolen, with a playful shudder. “It is very
16019: nice to come after ancestors and monks, but they should know their
16020: places and keep underground. I should be rather frightened to go about
16021: this house all alone. I suppose the old generations must be angry with
16022: us because we have altered things so much.”
16023: 
16024: “Oh, the ghosts must be of all political parties,” said Sir Hugo. “And
16025: those fellows who wanted to change things while they lived and couldn’t
16026: do it must be on our side. But if you would not like to go over the
16027: house alone, you will like to go in company, I hope. You and Grandcourt
16028: ought to see it all. And we will ask Deronda to go round with us. He is
16029: more learned about it than I am.” The baronet was in the most
16030: complaisant of humors.
16031: 
16032: Gwendolen stole a glance at Deronda, who must have heard what Sir Hugo
16033: said, for he had his face turned toward them helping himself to an
16034: _entrée_; but he looked as impassive as a picture. At the notion of
16035: Deronda’s showing her and Grandcourt the place which was to be theirs,
16036: and which she with painful emphasis remembered might have been his
16037: (perhaps, if others had acted differently), certain thoughts had rushed
16038: in—thoughts repeated within her, but now returning on an occasion
16039: embarrassingly new; and was conscious of something furtive and awkward
16040: in her glance which Sir Hugo must have noticed. With her usual
16041: readiness of resource against betrayal, she said, playfully, “You don’t
16042: know how much I am afraid of Mr. Deronda.”
16043: 
16044: “How’s that? Because you think him too learned?” said Sir Hugo, whom
16045: the peculiarity of her glance had not escaped.
16046: 
16047: “No. It is ever since I first saw him at Leubronn. Because when he came
16048: to look on at the roulette-table, I began to lose. He cast an evil eye
16049: on my play. He didn’t approve it. He has told me so. And now whatever I
16050: do before him, I am afraid he will cast an evil eye upon it.”
16051: 
16052: “Gad! I’m rather afraid of him myself when he doesn’t approve,” said
16053: Sir Hugo, glancing at Deronda; and then turning his face toward
16054: Gwendolen, he said less audibly, “I don’t think ladies generally object
16055: to have his eyes upon them.” The baronet’s small chronic complaint of
16056: facetiousness was at this moment almost as annoying to Gwendolen as it
16057: often was to Deronda.
16058: 
16059: “I object to any eyes that are critical,” she said, in a cool, high
16060: voice, with a turn of her neck. “Are there many of these old rooms left
16061: in the Abbey?”
16062: 
16063: “Not many. There is a fine cloistered court with a long gallery above
16064: it. But the finest bit of all is turned into stables. It is part of the
16065: old church. When I improved the place I made the most of every other
16066: bit; but it was out of my reach to change the stables, so the horses
16067: have the benefit of the fine old choir. You must go and see it.”
16068: 
16069: “I shall like to see the horses as well as the building,” said
16070: Gwendolen.
16071: 
16072: “Oh, I have no stud to speak of. Grandcourt will look with contempt at
16073: my horses,” said Sir Hugo. “I’ve given up hunting, and go on in a
16074: jog-trot way, as becomes an old gentlemen with daughters. The fact is,
16075: I went in for doing too much at this place. We all lived at Diplow for
16076: two years while the alterations were going on: Do you like Diplow?”
16077: 
16078: “Not particularly,” said Gwendolen, with indifference. One would have
16079: thought that the young lady had all her life had more family seats than
16080: she cared to go to.
16081: 
16082: “Ah! it will not do after Ryelands,” said Sir Hugo, well pleased.
16083: “Grandcourt, I know, took it for the sake of the hunting. But he found
16084: something so much better there,” added the baronet, lowering his voice,
16085: “that he might well prefer it to any other place in the world.”
16086: 
16087: “It has one attraction for me,” said Gwendolen, passing over this
16088: compliment with a chill smile, “that it is within reach of Offendene.”
16089: 
16090: “I understand that,” said Sir Hugo, and then let the subject drop.
16091: 
16092: What amiable baronet can escape the effect of a strong desire for a
16093: particular possession? Sir Hugo would have been glad that Grandcourt,
16094: with or without reason, should prefer any other place to Diplow; but
16095: inasmuch as in the pure process of wishing we can always make the
16096: conditions of our gratification benevolent, he did wish that
16097: Grandcourt’s convenient disgust for Diplow should not be associated
16098: with his marriage with this very charming bride. Gwendolen was much to
16099: the baronet’s taste, but, as he observed afterward to Lady Mallinger,
16100: he should never have taken her for a young girl who had married beyond
16101: her expectations.
16102: 
16103: Deronda had not heard much of this conversation, having given his
16104: attention elsewhere, but the glimpses he had of Gwendolen’s manner
16105: deepened the impression that it had something newly artificial.
16106: 
16107: Later, in the drawing-room, Deronda, at somebody’s request, sat down to
16108: the piano and sang. Afterward, Mrs. Raymond took his place; and on
16109: rising he observed that Gwendolen had left her seat, and had come to
16110: this end of the room, as if to listen more fully, but was now standing
16111: with her back to every one, apparently contemplating a fine cowled head
16112: carved in ivory which hung over a small table. He longed to go to her
16113: and speak. Why should he not obey such an impulse, as he would have
16114: done toward any other lady in the room? Yet he hesitated some moments,
16115: observing the graceful lines of her back, but not moving.
16116: 
16117: If you have any reason for not indulging a wish to speak to a fair
16118: woman, it is a bad plan to look long at her back: the wish to see what
16119: it screens becomes the stronger. There may be a very sweet smile on the
16120: other side. Deronda ended by going to the end of the small table, at
16121: right angles to Gwendolen’s position, but before he could speak she had
16122: turned on him no smile, but such an appealing look of sadness, so
16123: utterly different from the chill effort of her recognition at table,
16124: that his speech was checked. For what was an appreciative space of time
16125: to both, though the observation of others could not have measured it,
16126: they looked at each other—she seeming to take the deep rest of
16127: confession, he with an answering depth of sympathy that neutralized all
16128: other feelings.
16129: 
16130: “Will you not join in the music?” he said, by way of meeting the
16131: necessity for speech.
16132: 
16133: That her look of confession had been involuntary was shown by that just
16134: perceptible shake and change of countenance with which she roused
16135: herself to reply calmly, “I join in it by listening. I am fond of
16136: music.”
16137: 
16138: “Are you not a musician?”
16139: 
16140: “I have given a great deal of time to music. But I have not talent
16141: enough to make it worth while. I shall never sing again.”
16142: 
16143: “But if you are fond of music, it will always be worth while in
16144: private, for your own delight. I make it a virtue to be content with my
16145: middlingness,” said Deronda, smiling; “it is always pardonable, so that
16146: one does not ask others to take it for superiority.”
16147: 
16148: “I cannot imitate you,” said Gwendolen, recovering her tone of
16149: artificial vivacity. “To be middling with me is another phrase for
16150: being dull. And the worst fault I have to find with the world is that
16151: it is dull. Do you know, I am going to justify gambling in spite of
16152: you. It is a refuge from dullness.”
16153: 
16154: “I don’t admit the justification,” said Deronda. “I think what we call
16155: the dullness of things is a disease in ourselves. Else how can any one
16156: find an intense interest in life? And many do.”
16157: 
16158: “Ah, I see! The fault I find in the world is my own fault,” said
16159: Gwendolen, smiling at him. Then after a moment, looking up at the ivory
16160: again, she said, “Do _you_ never find fault with the world or with
16161: others?”
16162: 
16163: “Oh, yes. When I am in a grumbling mood.”
16164: 
16165: “And hate people? Confess you hate them when they stand in your
16166: way—when their gain is your loss? That is your own phrase, you know.”
16167: 
16168: “We are often standing in each other’s way when we can’t help it. I
16169: think it is stupid to hate people on that ground.”
16170: 
16171: “But if they injure you and could have helped it?” said Gwendolen with
16172: a hard intensity unaccountable in incidental talk like this.
16173: 
16174: Deronda wondered at her choice of subjects. A painful impression
16175: arrested his answer a moment, but at last he said, with a graver,
16176: deeper intonation, “Why, then, after all, I prefer my place to theirs.”
16177: 
16178: “There I believe you are right,” said Gwendolen, with a sudden little
16179: laugh, and turned to join the group at the piano.
16180: 
16181: Deronda looked around for Grandcourt, wondering whether he followed his
16182: bride’s movements with any attention; but it was rather undiscerning to
16183: him to suppose that he could find out the fact. Grandcourt had a
16184: delusive mood of observing whatever had an interest for him, which
16185: could be surpassed by no sleepy-eyed animal on the watch for prey. At
16186: that moment he was plunged in the depth of an easy chair, being talked
16187: to by Mr. Vandernoodt, who apparently thought the acquaintance of such
16188: a bridegroom worth cultivating; and an incautious person might have
16189: supposed it safe to telegraph secrets in front of him, the common
16190: prejudice being that your quick observer is one whose eyes have quick
16191: movements. Not at all. If you want a respectable witness who will see
16192: nothing inconvenient, choose a vivacious gentleman, very much on the
16193: alert, with two eyes wide open, a glass in one of them, and an entire
16194: impartiality as to the purpose of looking. If Grandcourt cared to keep
16195: any one under his power he saw them out of the corners of his long
16196: narrow eyes, and if they went behind him he had a constructive process
16197: by which he knew what they were doing there. He knew perfectly well
16198: where his wife was, and how she was behaving. Was he going to be a
16199: jealous husband? Deronda imagined that to be likely; but his
16200: imagination was as much astray about Grandcourt as it would have been
16201: about an unexplored continent where all the species were peculiar. He
16202: did not conceive that he himself was a likely subject of jealousy, or
16203: that he should give any pretext for it; but the suspicion that a wife
16204: is not happy naturally leads one to speculate on the husband’s private
16205: deportment; and Deronda found himself after one o’clock in the morning
16206: in the rather ludicrous position of sitting up severely holding a
16207: Hebrew grammar in his hands (for somehow, in deference to Mordecai, he
16208: had begun to study Hebrew), with the consciousness that he had been in
16209: that attitude nearly an hour, and had thought of nothing but Gwendolen
16210: and her husband. To be an unusual young man means for the most part to
16211: get a difficult mastery over the usual, which is often like the sprite
16212: of ill-luck you pack up your goods to escape from, and see grinning at
16213: you from the top of your luggage van. The peculiarities of Deronda’s
16214: nature had been acutely touched by the brief incident and words which
16215: made the history of his intercourse with Gwendolen; and this evening’s
16216: slight addition had given them an importunate recurrence. It was not
16217: vanity—it was ready sympathy that had made him alive to a certain
16218: appealingness in her behavior toward him; and the difficulty with which
16219: she had seemed to raise her eyes to bow to him, in the first instance,
16220: was to be interpreted now by that unmistakable look of involuntary
16221: confidence which she had afterward turned on him under the
16222: consciousness of his approach.
16223: 
16224: “What is the use of it all?” thought Deronda, as he threw down his
16225: grammar, and began to undress. “I can’t do anything to help her—nobody
16226: can, if she has found out her mistake already. And it seems to me that
16227: she has a dreary lack of the ideas that might help her. Strange and
16228: piteous to think what a center of wretchedness a delicate piece of
16229: human flesh like that might be, wrapped round with fine
16230: raiment, her ears pierced for gems, her head held loftily, her mouth
16231: all smiling pretense, the poor soul within her sitting in sick distaste
16232: of all things! But what do I know of her? There may be a demon in her
16233: to match the worst husband, for what I can tell. She was clearly an
16234: ill-educated, worldly girl: perhaps she is a coquette.”
16235: 
16236: This last reflection, not much believed in, was a self-administered
16237: dose of caution, prompted partly by Sir Hugo’s much-contemned joking on
16238: the subject of flirtation. Deronda resolved not to volunteer any
16239: _tête-à-tête_ with Gwendolen during the days of her stay at the Abbey;
16240: and he was capable of keeping a resolve in spite of much inclination to
16241: the contrary.
16242: 
16243: But a man cannot resolve about a woman’s actions, least of all about
16244: those of a woman like Gwendolen, in whose nature there was a
16245: combination of proud reserve with rashness, of perilously poised terror
16246: with defiance, which might alternately flatter and disappoint control.
16247: Few words could less represent her than “coquette.” She had native love
16248: of homage, and belief in her own power; but no cold artifice for the
16249: sake of enslaving. And the poor thing’s belief in her power, with her
16250: other dreams before marriage, had often to be thrust aside now like the
16251: toys of a sick child, which it looks at with dull eyes, and has no
16252: heart to play with, however it may try.
16253: 
16254: The next day at lunch Sir Hugo said to her, “The thaw has gone on like
16255: magic, and it’s so pleasant out of doors just now—shall we go and see
16256: the stables and the other odd bits about the place?”
16257: 
16258: “Yes, pray,” said Gwendolen. “You will like to see the stables,
16259: Henleigh?” she added, looking at her husband.
16260: 
16261: “Uncommonly,” said Grandcourt, with an indifference which seemed to
16262: give irony to the word, as he returned her look. It was the first time
16263: Deronda had seen them speak to each other since their arrival, and he
16264: thought their exchange of looks as cold or official as if it had been a
16265: ceremony to keep up a charter. Still, the English fondness for reserve
16266: will account for much negation; and Grandcourt’s manners with an extra
16267: veil of reserve over them might be expected to present the extreme type
16268: of the national taste.
16269: 
16270: “Who else is inclined to make the tour of the house and premises?” said
16271: Sir Hugo. “The ladies must muffle themselves; there is only just about
16272: time to do it well before sunset. You will go, Dan, won’t you?”
16273: 
16274: “Oh, yes,” said Deronda, carelessly, knowing that Sir Hugo would think
16275: any excuse disobliging.
16276: 
16277: “All meet in the library, then, when they are ready—say in half an
16278: hour,” said the baronet. Gwendolen made herself ready with wonderful
16279: quickness, and in ten minutes came down into the library in her sables,
16280: plume, and little thick boots. As soon as she entered the room she was
16281: aware that some one else was there: it was precisely what she had hoped
16282: for. Deronda was standing with his back toward her at the far end of
16283: the room, and was looking over a newspaper. How could little thick
16284: boots make any noise on an Axminster carpet? And to cough would have
16285: seemed an intended signaling which her pride could not condescend to;
16286: also, she felt bashful about walking up to him and letting him know
16287: that she was there, though it was her hunger to speak to him which had
16288: set her imagination on constructing this chance of finding him, and had
16289: made her hurry down, as birds hover near the water which they dare not
16290: drink. Always uneasily dubious about his opinion of her, she felt a
16291: peculiar anxiety to-day, lest he might think of her with contempt, as
16292: one triumphantly conscious of being Grandcourt’s wife, the future lady
16293: of this domain. It was her habitual effort now to magnify the
16294: satisfactions of her pride, on which she nourished her strength; but
16295: somehow Deronda’s being there disturbed them all. There was not the
16296: faintest touch of coquetry in the attitude of her mind toward him: he
16297: was unique to her among men, because he had impressed her as being not
16298: her admirer but her superior: in some mysterious way he was becoming a
16299: part of her conscience, as one woman whose nature is an object of
16300: reverential belief may become a new conscience to a man.
16301: 
16302: And now he would not look round and find out that she was there! The
16303: paper crackled in his hand, his head rose and sank, exploring those
16304: stupid columns, and he was evidently stroking his beard; as if this
16305: world were a very easy affair to her. Of course all the rest of the
16306: company would soon be down, and the opportunity of her saying something
16307: to efface her flippancy of the evening before, would be quite gone. She
16308: felt sick with irritation—so fast do young creatures like her absorb
16309: misery through invisible suckers of their own fancies—and her face had
16310: gathered that peculiar expression which comes with a mortification to
16311: which tears are forbidden.
16312: 
16313: At last he threw down the paper and turned round.
16314: 
16315: “Oh, you are there already,” he said, coming forward a step or two: “I
16316: must go and put on my coat.”
16317: 
16318: He turned aside and walked out of the room. This was behaving quite
16319: badly. Mere politeness would have made him stay to exchange some words
16320: before leaving her alone. It was true that Grandcourt came in with Sir
16321: Hugo immediately after, so that the words must have been too few to be
16322: worth anything. As it was, they saw him walking from the library door.
16323: 
16324: “A—you look rather ill,” said Grandcourt, going straight up to her,
16325: standing in front of her, and looking into her eyes. “Do you feel equal
16326: to the walk?”
16327: 
16328: “Yes, I shall like it,” said Gwendolen, without the slightest movement
16329: except this of the lips.
16330: 
16331: “We could put off going over the house, you know, and only go out of
16332: doors,” said Sir Hugo, kindly, while Grandcourt turned aside.
16333: 
16334: “Oh, dear no!” said Gwendolen, speaking with determination; “let us put
16335: off nothing. I want a long walk.”
16336: 
16337: The rest of the walking party—two ladies and two gentlemen besides
16338: Deronda—had now assembled; and Gwendolen rallying, went with due
16339: cheerfulness by the side of Sir Hugo, paying apparently an equal
16340: attention to the commentaries Deronda was called upon to give on the
16341: various architectural fragments, to Sir Hugo’s reasons for not
16342: attempting to remedy the mixture of the undisguised modern with the
16343: antique—which in his opinion only made the place the more truly
16344: historical. On their way to the buttery and kitchen they took the
16345: outside of the house and paused before a beautiful pointed doorway,
16346: which was the only old remnant in the east front.
16347: 
16348: “Well, now, to my mind,” said Sir Hugo, “that is more interesting
16349: standing as it is in the middle of what is frankly four centuries
16350: later, than if the whole front had been dressed up in a pretense of the
16351: thirteenth century. Additions ought to smack of the time when they are
16352: made and carry the stamp of their period. I wouldn’t destroy any old
16353: bits, but that notion of reproducing the old is a mistake, I think. At
16354: least, if a man likes to do it he must pay for his whistle. Besides,
16355: where are you to stop along that road—making loopholes where you don’t
16356: want to peep, and so on? You may as well ask me to wear out the stones
16357: with kneeling; eh, Grandcourt?”
16358: 
16359: “A confounded nuisance,” drawled Grandcourt. “I hate fellows wanting to
16360: howl litanies—acting the greatest bores that have ever existed.”
16361: 
16362: “Well, yes, that’s what their romanticism must come to,” said Sir Hugo,
16363: in a tone of confidential assent—“that is if they carry it out
16364: logically.”
16365: 
16366: “I think that way of arguing against a course because it may be ridden
16367: down to an absurdity would soon bring life to a standstill,” said
16368: Deronda. “It is not the logic of human action, but of a roasting-jack,
16369: that must go on to the last turn when it has been once wound up. We can
16370: do nothing safely without some judgment as to where we are to stop.”
16371: 
16372: “I find the rule of the pocket the best guide,” said Sir Hugo,
16373: laughingly. “And as for most of your new-old building, you had need to
16374: hire men to scratch and chip it all over artistically to give it an
16375: elderly-looking surface; which at the present rate of labor would not
16376: answer.”
16377: 
16378: “Do you want to keep up the old fashions, then, Mr. Deronda?” said
16379: Gwendolen, taking advantage of the freedom of grouping to fall back a
16380: little, while Sir Hugo and Grandcourt went on.
16381: 
16382: “Some of them. I don’t see why we should not use our choice there as we
16383: do elsewhere—or why either age or novelty by itself is an argument for
16384: or against. To delight in doing things because our fathers did them is
16385: good if it shuts out nothing better; it enlarges the range of
16386: affection—and affection is the broadest basis of good in life.”
16387: 
16388: “Do you think so?” said Gwendolen with a little surprise. “I should
16389: have thought you cared most about ideas, knowledge, wisdom, and all
16390: that.”
16391: 
16392: “But to care about _them_ is a sort of affection,” said Deronda,
16393: smiling at her sudden _naïveté_. “Call it attachment; interest, willing
16394: to bear a great deal for the sake of being with them and saving them
16395: from injury. Of course, it makes a difference if the objects of
16396: interest are human beings; but generally in all deep affections the
16397: objects are a mixture—half persons and half ideas—sentiments and
16398: affections flow in together.”
16399: 
16400: “I wonder whether I understand that,” said Gwendolen, putting up her
16401: chin in her old saucy manner. “I believe I am not very affectionate;
16402: perhaps you mean to tell me, that is the reason why I don’t see much
16403: good in life.”
16404: 
16405: “No, I did _not_ mean to tell you that; but I admit that I should think
16406: it true if I believed what you say of yourself,” said Deronda, gravely.
16407: 
16408: Here Sir Hugo and Grandcourt turned round and paused.
16409: 
16410: “I never can get Mr. Deronda to pay me a compliment,” said Gwendolen.
16411: “I have quite a curiosity to see whether a little flattery can be
16412: extracted from him.”
16413: 
16414: “Ah!” said Sir Hugo, glancing at Deronda, “the fact is, it is useless
16415: to flatter a bride. We give it up in despair. She has been so fed on
16416: sweet speeches that every thing we say seems tasteless.”
16417: 
16418: “Quite true,” said Gwendolen, bending her head and smiling. “Mr.
16419: Grandcourt won me by neatly-turned compliments. If there had been one
16420: word out of place it would have been fatal.”
16421: 
16422: “Do you hear that?” said Sir Hugo, looking at the husband.
16423: 
16424: “Yes,” said Grandcourt, without change of countenance. “It’s a deucedly
16425: hard thing to keep up, though.”
16426: 
16427: All this seemed to Sir Hugo a natural playfulness between such a
16428: husband and wife; but Deronda wondered at the misleading alternations
16429: in Gwendolen’s manner, which at one moment seemed to excite sympathy by
16430: childlike indiscretion, at another to repel it by proud concealment. He
16431: tried to keep out of her way by devoting himself to Miss Juliet Fenn, a
16432: young lady whose profile had been so unfavorably decided by
16433: circumstances over which she had no control, that Gwendolen some months
16434: ago had felt it impossible to be jealous of her. Nevertheless, when
16435: they were seeing the kitchen—a part of the original building in
16436: perfect preservation—the depth of shadow in the niches of the
16437: stone-walls and groined vault, the play of light from the huge glowing
16438: fire on polished tin, brass, and copper, the fine resonance that came
16439: with every sound of voice or metal, were all spoiled for Gwendolen, and
16440: Sir Hugo’s speech about them was made rather importunate, because
16441: Deronda was discoursing to the other ladies and kept at a distance from
16442: her. It did not signify that the other gentlemen took the opportunity
16443: of being near her: of what use in the world was their admiration while
16444: she had an uneasy sense that there was some standard in Deronda’s mind
16445: which measured her into littleness? Mr. Vandernoodt, who had the mania
16446: of always describing one thing while you were looking at another, was
16447: quite intolerable with his insistence on Lord Blough’s kitchen, which
16448: he had seen in the north.
16449: 
16450: “Pray don’t ask us to see two kitchens at once. It makes the heat
16451: double. I must really go out of it,” she cried at last, marching
16452: resolutely into the open air, and leaving the others in the rear.
16453: Grandcourt was already out, and as she joined him, he said,
16454: 
16455: “I wondered how long you meant to stay in that damned place”—one of
16456: the freedoms he had assumed as a husband being the use of his strongest
16457: epithets. Gwendolen, turning to see the rest of the party approach,
16458: said,
16459: 
16460: “It was certainly rather too warm in one’s wraps.”
16461: 
16462: They walked on the gravel across a green court, where the snow still
16463: lay in islets on the grass, and in masses on the boughs of the great
16464: cedar and the crenelated coping of the stone walls, and then into a
16465: larger court, where there was another cedar, to find the beautiful
16466: choir long ago turned into stables, in the first instance perhaps after
16467: an impromptu fashion by troopers, who had a pious satisfaction in
16468: insulting the priests of Baal and the images of Ashtoreth, the queen of
16469: heaven. The exterior—its west end, save for the stable door, walled in
16470: with brick and covered with ivy—was much defaced, maimed of finial and
16471: gargoyle, the friable limestone broken and fretted, and lending its
16472: soft gray to a powdery dark lichen; the long windows, too, were filled
16473: in with brick as far as the springing of the arches, the broad
16474: clerestory windows with wire or ventilating blinds. With the low wintry
16475: afternoon sun upon it, sending shadows from the cedar boughs, and
16476: lighting up the touches of snow remaining on every ledge, it had still
16477: a scarcely disturbed aspect of antique solemnity, which gave the scene
16478: in the interior rather a startling effect; though, ecclesiastical or
16479: reverential indignation apart, the eyes could hardly help dwelling with
16480: pleasure on its piquant picturesqueness. Each finely-arched chapel was
16481: turned into a stall, where in the dusty glazing of the windows there
16482: still gleamed patches of crimson, orange, blue, and palest violet; for
16483: the rest, the choir had been gutted, the floor leveled, paved, and
16484: drained according to the most approved fashion, and a line of loose
16485: boxes erected in the middle: a soft light fell from the upper windows
16486: on sleek brown or gray flanks and haunches; on mild equine faces
16487: looking out with active nostrils over the varnished brown boarding; on
16488: the hay hanging from racks where the saints once looked down from the
16489: altar-pieces, and on the pale golden straw scattered or in heaps; on a
16490: little white-and-liver-colored spaniel making his bed on the back of an
16491: elderly hackney, and on four ancient angels, still showing signs of
16492: devotion like mutilated martyrs—while over all, the grand pointed
16493: roof, untouched by reforming wash, showed its lines and colors
16494: mysteriously through veiling shadow and cobweb, and a hoof now and then
16495: striking against the boards seemed to fill the vault with thunder,
16496: while outside there was the answering bay of the blood-hounds.
16497: 
16498: “Oh, this is glorious!” Gwendolen burst forth, in forgetfulness of
16499: everything but the immediate impression: there had been a little
16500: intoxication for her in the grand spaces of courts and building, and
16501: the fact of her being an important person among them. “This _is_
16502: glorious! Only I wish there were a horse in every one of the boxes. I
16503: would ten times rather have these stables than those at Diplow.”
16504: 
16505: But she had no sooner said this than some consciousness arrested her,
16506: and involuntarily she turned her eyes toward Deronda, who oddly enough
16507: had taken off his felt hat and stood holding it before him as if they
16508: had entered a room or an actual church. He, like others, happened to be
16509: looking at her, and their eyes met—to her intense vexation, for it
16510: seemed to her that by looking at him she had betrayed the reference of
16511: her thoughts, and she felt herself blushing: she exaggerated the
16512: impression that even Sir Hugo as well as Deronda would have of her bad
16513: taste in referring to the possession of anything at the Abbey: as for
16514: Deronda, she had probably made him despise her. Her annoyance at what
16515: she imagined to be the obviousness of her confusion robbed her of her
16516: usual facility in carrying it off by playful speech, and turning up her
16517: face to look at the roof, she wheeled away in that attitude. If any had
16518: noticed her blush as significant, they had certainly not interpreted it
16519: by the secret windings and recesses of her feeling. A blush is no
16520: language: only a dubious flag-signal which may mean either of two
16521: contradictories. Deronda alone had a faint guess at some part of her
16522: feeling; but while he was observing her he was himself under
16523: observation.
16524: 
16525: “Do you take off your hat to horses?” said Grandcourt, with a slight
16526: sneer.
16527: 
16528: “Why not?” said Deronda, covering himself. He had really taken off the
16529: hat automatically, and if he had been an ugly man might doubtless have
16530: done so with impunity; ugliness having naturally the air of involuntary
16531: exposure, and beauty, of display.
16532: 
16533: Gwendolen’s confusion was soon merged in the survey of the horses,
16534: which Grandcourt politely abstained from appraising, languidly
16535: assenting to Sir Hugo’s alternate depreciation and eulogy of the same
16536: animal, as one that he should not have bought when he was younger, and
16537: piqued himself on his horses, but yet one that had better qualities
16538: than many more expensive brutes.
16539: 
16540: “The fact is, stables dive deeper and deeper into the pocket nowadays,
16541: and I am very glad to have got rid of that _démangeaison_,” said Sir
16542: Hugo, as they were coming out.
16543: 
16544: “What is a man to do, though?” said Grandcourt. “He must ride. I don’t
16545: see what else there is to do. And I don’t call it riding to sit astride
16546: a set of brutes with every deformity under the sun.”
16547: 
16548: This delicate diplomatic way of characterizing Sir Hugo’s stud did not
16549: require direct notice; and the baronet, feeling that the conversation
16550: had worn rather thin, said to the party generally, “Now we are going to
16551: see the cloister—the finest bit of all—in perfect preservation; the
16552: monks might have been walking there yesterday.”
16553: 
16554: But Gwendolen had lingered behind to look at the kenneled blood-hounds,
16555: perhaps because she felt a little dispirited; and Grandcourt waited for
16556: her.
16557: 
16558: “You had better take my arm,” he said, in his low tone of command; and
16559: she took it.
16560: 
16561: “It’s a great bore being dragged about in this way, and no cigar,” said
16562: Grandcourt.
16563: 
16564: “I thought you would like it.”
16565: 
16566: “Like it!—one eternal chatter. And encouraging those ugly
16567: girls—inviting one to meet such monsters. How that _fat_ Deronda can
16568: bear looking at her——”
16569: 
16570: “Why do you call him a _fat_? Do you object to him so much?”
16571: 
16572: “Object? no. What do I care about his being a _fat_? It’s of no
16573: consequence to me. I’ll invite him to Diplow again if you like.”
16574: 
16575: “I don’t think he would come. He is too clever and learned to care
16576: about _us_,” said Gwendolen, thinking it useful for her husband to be
16577: told (privately) that it was possible for him to be looked down upon.
16578: 
16579: “I never saw that make much difference in a man. Either he is a
16580: gentleman, or he is not,” said Grandcourt.
16581: 
16582: That a new husband and wife should snatch a moment’s _tête-à-tête_ was
16583: what could be understood and indulged; and the rest of the party left
16584: them in the rear till, re-entering the garden, they all paused in that
16585: cloistered court where, among the falling rose-petals thirteen years
16586: before, we saw a boy becoming acquainted with his first sorrow. This
16587: cloister was built of a harder stone than the church, and had been in
16588: greater safety from the wearing weather. It was a rare example of a
16589: northern cloister with arched and pillared openings not intended for
16590: glazing, and the delicately-wrought foliage of the capitals seemed
16591: still to carry the very touches of the chisel. Gwendolen had dropped
16592: her husband’s arm and joined the other ladies, to whom Deronda was
16593: noticing the delicate sense which had combined freedom with accuracy in
16594: the imitation of natural forms.
16595: 
16596: “I wonder whether one oftener learns to love real objects through their
16597: representations, or the representations through the real objects,” he
16598: said, after pointing out a lovely capital made by the curled leaves of
16599: greens, showing their reticulated under-side with the firm gradual
16600: swell of its central rib. “When I was a little fellow these capitals
16601: taught me to observe and delight in the structure of leaves.”
16602: 
16603: “I suppose you can see every line of them with your eyes shut,” said
16604: Juliet Fenn.
16605: 
16606: “Yes. I was always repeating them, because for a good many years this
16607: court stood for me as my only image of a convent, and whenever I read
16608: of monks and monasteries, this was my scenery for them.”
16609: 
16610: “You must love this place very much,” said Miss Fenn, innocently, not
16611: thinking of inheritance. “So many homes are like twenty others. But
16612: this is unique, and you seem to know every cranny of it. I dare say you
16613: could never love another home so well.”
16614: 
16615: “Oh, I carry it with me,” said Deronda, quietly, being used to all
16616: possible thoughts of this kind. “To most men their early home is no
16617: more than a memory of their early years, and I’m not sure but they have
16618: the best of it. The image is never marred. There’s no disappointment in
16619: memory, and one’s exaggerations are always on the good side.”
16620: 
16621: Gwendolen felt sure that he spoke in that way out of delicacy to her
16622: and Grandcourt—because he knew they must hear him; and that he
16623: probably thought of her as a selfish creature who only cared about
16624: possessing things in her own person. But whatever he might say, it must
16625: have been a secret hardship to him that any circumstances of his birth
16626: had shut him out from the inheritance of his father’s position; and if
16627: he supposed that she exulted in her husband’s taking it, what could he
16628: feel for her but scornful pity? Indeed it seemed clear to her that he
16629: was avoiding her, and preferred talking to others—which nevertheless
16630: was not kind in him.
16631: 
16632: With these thoughts in her mind she was prevented by a mixture of pride
16633: and timidity from addressing him again, and when they were looking at
16634: the rows of quaint portraits in the gallery above the cloisters, she
16635: kept up her air of interest and made her vivacious remarks without any
16636: direct appeal to Deronda. But at the end she was very weary of her
16637: assumed spirits, and as Grandcourt turned into the billiard-room, she went
16638: to the pretty boudoir which had been assigned to her, and shut herself
16639: up to look melancholy at her ease. No chemical process shows a more
16640: wonderful activity than the transforming influence of the thoughts we
16641: imagine to be going on in another. Changes in theory, religion,
16642: admirations, may begin with a suspicion of dissent or disapproval, even
16643: when the grounds of disapproval are but matter of searching conjecture.
16644: 
16645: Poor Gwendolen was conscious of an uneasy, transforming process—all
16646: the old nature shaken to its depths, its hopes spoiled, its pleasures
16647: perturbed, but still showing wholeness and strength in the will to
16648: reassert itself. After every new shock of humiliation she tried to
16649: adjust herself and seize her old supports—proud concealment, trust in
16650: new excitements that would make life go by without much thinking; trust
16651: in some deed of reparation to nullify her self-blame and shield her
16652: from a vague, ever-visiting dread of some horrible calamity; trust in
16653: the hardening effect of use and wont that would make her indifferent to
16654: her miseries.
16655: 
16656: Yes—miseries. This beautiful, healthy young creature, with her
16657: two-and-twenty years and her gratified ambition, no longer felt
16658: inclined to kiss her fortunate image in the glass. She looked at it
16659: with wonder that she could be so miserable. One belief which had
16660: accompanied her through her unmarried life as a self-cajoling
16661: superstition, encouraged by the subordination of every one about
16662: her—the belief in her own power of dominating—was utterly gone.
16663: Already, in seven short weeks, which seemed half her life, her husband
16664: had gained a mastery which she could no more resist than she could have
16665: resisted the benumbing effect from the touch of a torpedo. Gwendolen’s
16666: will had seemed imperious in its small girlish sway; but it was the
16667: will of a creature with a large discourse of imaginative fears: a
16668: shadow would have been enough to relax its hold. And she had found a
16669: will like that of a crab or a boa-constrictor, which goes on pinching
16670: or crushing without alarm at thunder. Not that Grandcourt was without
16671: calculation of the intangible effects which were the chief means of
16672: mastery; indeed, he had a surprising acuteness in detecting that
16673: situation of feeling in Gwendolen which made her proud and rebellious
16674: spirit dumb and helpless before him.
16675: 
16676: She had burned Lydia Glasher’s letter with an instantaneous terror lest
16677: other eyes should see it, and had tenaciously concealed from Grandcourt
16678: that there was any other cause of her violent hysterics than the
16679: excitement and fatigue of the day: she had been urged into an implied
16680: falsehood. “Don’t ask me—it was my feeling about everything—it was
16681: the sudden change from home.” The words of that letter kept repeating
16682: themselves, and hung on her consciousness with the weight of a
16683: prophetic doom. “I am the grave in which your chance of happiness is
16684: buried as well as mine. You had your warning. You have chosen to injure
16685: me and my children. He had meant to marry me. He would have married me
16686: at last, if you had not broken your word. You will have your
16687: punishment. I desire it with all my soul. Will you give him this letter
16688: to set him against me and ruin us more—me and my children? Shall you
16689: like to stand before your husband with these diamonds on you, and these
16690: words of mine in his thoughts and yours? Will he think you have any
16691: right to complain when he has made you miserable? You took him with
16692: your eyes open. The willing wrong you have done me will be your curse.”
16693: 
16694: The words had nestled their venomous life within her, and stirred
16695: continually the vision of the scene at the Whispering Stones. That
16696: scene was now like an accusing apparition: she dreaded that Grandcourt
16697: should know of it—so far out of her sight now was that possibility she
16698: had once satisfied herself with, of speaking to him about Mrs. Glasher
16699: and her children, and making them rich amends. Any endurance seemed
16700: easier than the mortal humiliation of confessing that she knew all
16701: before she married him, and in marrying him had broken her word. For
16702: the reasons by which she had justified herself when the marriage
16703: tempted her, and all her easy arrangement of her future power over her
16704: husband to make him do better than he might be inclined to do, were now
16705: as futile as the burned-out lights which set off a child’s pageant. Her
16706: sense of being blameworthy was exaggerated by a dread both definite and
16707: vague. The definite dread was lest the veil of secrecy should fall
16708: between her and Grandcourt, and give him the right to taunt her. With
16709: the reading of that letter had begun her husband’s empire of fear.
16710: 
16711: And her husband all the while knew it. He had not, indeed, any distinct
16712: knowledge of her broken promise, and would not have rated highly the
16713: effect of that breach on her conscience; but he was aware not only of
16714: what Lush had told him about the meeting at the Whispering Stones, but
16715: also of Gwendolen’s concealment as to the cause of her sudden illness.
16716: He felt sure that Lydia had enclosed something with the diamonds, and
16717: that this something, whatever it was, had at once created in Gwendolen
16718: a new repulsion for him and a reason for not daring to manifest it. He
16719: did not greatly mind, or feel as many men might have felt, that his
16720: hopes in marriage were blighted: he had wanted to marry Gwendolen, and
16721: he was not a man to repent. Why should a gentleman whose other
16722: relations in life are carried on without the luxury of sympathetic
16723: feeling, be supposed to require that kind of condiment in domestic
16724: life? What he chiefly felt was that a change had come over the
16725: conditions of his mastery, which, far from shaking it, might establish
16726: it the more thoroughly. And it was established. He judged that he had
16727: not married a simpleton unable to perceive the impossibility of escape,
16728: or to see alternative evils: he had married a girl who had spirit and
16729: pride enough not to make a fool of herself by forfeiting all the
16730: advantages of a position which had attracted her; and if she wanted
16731: pregnant hints to help her in making up her mind properly he would take
16732: care not to withhold them.
16733: 
16734: Gwendolen, indeed, with all that gnawing trouble in her consciousness,
16735: had hardly for a moment dropped the sense that it was her part to bear
16736: herself with dignity, and appear what is called happy. In disclosure of
16737: disappointment or sorrow she saw nothing but a humiliation which would
16738: have been vinegar to her wounds. Whatever her husband might have come
16739: at last to be to her, she meant to wear the yoke so as not to be
16740: pitied. For she did think of the coming years with presentiment: she
16741: was frightened at Grandcourt. The poor thing had passed from her
16742: girlish sauciness of superiority over this inert specimen of personal
16743: distinction into an amazed perception of her former ignorance about the
16744: possible mental attitude of a man toward the woman he sought in
16745: marriage—of her present ignorance as to what their life with each
16746: other might turn into. For novelty gives immeasurableness to fear, and
16747: fills the early time of all sad changes with phantoms of the future.
16748: Her little coquetries, voluntary or involuntary, had told on Grandcourt
16749: during courtship, and formed a medium of communication between them,
16750: showing him in the light of a creature such as she could understand and
16751: manage: but marriage had nullified all such interchange, and Grandcourt
16752: had become a blank uncertainty to her in everything but this, that he
16753: would do just what he willed, and that she had neither devices at her
16754: command to determine his will, nor any rational means of escaping it.
16755: 
16756: What had occurred between them and her wearing the diamonds was
16757: typical. One evening, shortly before they came to the Abbey, they were
16758: going to dine at Brackenshaw Castle. Gwendolen had said to herself that
16759: she would never wear those diamonds: they had horrible words clinging
16760: and crawling about them, as from some bad dream, whose images lingered
16761: on the perturbed sense. She came down dressed in her white, with only a
16762: streak of gold and a pendant of emeralds, which Grandcourt had given
16763: her, round her neck, and the little emerald stars in her ears.
16764: 
16765: Grandcourt stood with his back to the fire and looked at her as she
16766: entered.
16767: 
16768: “Am I altogether as you like?” she said, speaking rather gaily. She was
16769: not without enjoyment in this occasion of going to Brackenshaw Castle
16770: with her new dignities upon her, as men whose affairs are sadly
16771: involved will enjoy dining out among persons likely to be under a
16772: pleasant mistake about them.
16773: 
16774: “No,” said Grandcourt.
16775: 
16776: Gwendolen felt suddenly uncomfortable, wondering what was to come. She
16777: was not unprepared for some struggle about the diamonds; but suppose he
16778: were going to say, in low, contemptuous tones, “You are not in any way
16779: what I like.” It was very bad for her to be secretly hating him; but it
16780: would be much worse when he gave the first sign of hating her.
16781: 
16782: “Oh, mercy!” she exclaimed, the pause lasting till she could bear it no
16783: longer. “How am I to alter myself?”
16784: 
16785: “Put on the diamonds,” said Grandcourt, looking straight at her with
16786: his narrow glance.
16787: 
16788: Gwendolen paused in her turn, afraid of showing any emotion, and
16789: feeling that nevertheless there was some change in her eyes as they met
16790: his. But she was obliged to answer, and said as indifferently as she
16791: could, “Oh, please not. I don’t think diamonds suit me.”
16792: 
16793: “What you think has nothing to do with it,” said Grandcourt, his _sotto
16794: voce_ imperiousness seeming to have an evening quietude and finish,
16795: like his toilet. “I wish you to wear the diamonds.”
16796: 
16797: “Pray excuse me; I like these emeralds,” said Gwendolen, frightened in
16798: spite of her preparation. That white hand of his which was touching his
16799: whisker was capable, she fancied, of clinging round her neck and
16800: threatening to throttle her; for her fear of him, mingling with the
16801: vague foreboding of some retributive calamity which hung about her
16802: life, had reached a superstitious point.
16803: 
16804: “Oblige me by telling me your reason for not wearing the diamonds when
16805: I desire it,” said Grandcourt. His eyes were still fixed upon her, and
16806: she felt her own eyes narrowing under them as if to shut out an
16807: entering pain.
16808: 
16809: Of what use was the rebellion within her? She could say nothing that
16810: would not hurt her worse than submission. Turning slowly and covering
16811: herself again, she went to her dressing-room. As she reached out the
16812: diamonds, it occurred to her that her unwillingness to wear them might
16813: have already raised a suspicion in Grandcourt that she had some
16814: knowledge about them which he had not given her. She fancied that his
16815: eyes showed a delight in torturing her. How could she be defiant? She
16816: had nothing to say that would touch him—nothing but what would give
16817: him a more painful grasp on her consciousness.
16818: 
16819: “He delights in making the dogs and horses quail: that is half his
16820: pleasure in calling them his,” she said to herself, as she opened the
16821: jewel-case with a shivering sensation.
16822: 
16823: “It will come to be so with me; and I shall quail. What else is there
16824: for me? I will not say to the world, ‘Pity me.’”
16825: 
16826: She was about to ring for her maid when she heard the door open behind
16827: her. It was Grandcourt who came in.
16828: 
16829: “You want some one to fasten them,” he said, coming toward her.
16830: 
16831: She did not answer, but simply stood still, leaving him to take out the
16832: ornaments and fasten them as he would. Doubtless he had been used to
16833: fasten them on some one else. With a bitter sort of sarcasm against
16834: herself, Gwendolen thought, “What a privilege this is, to have robbed
16835: another woman of!”
16836: 
16837: “What makes you so cold?” said Grandcourt, when he had fastened the
16838: last ear-ring. “Pray put plenty of furs on. I hate to see a woman come
16839: into a room looking frozen. If you are to appear as a bride at all,
16840: appear decently.”
16841: 
16842: This marital speech was not exactly persuasive, but it touched the
16843: quick of Gwendolen’s pride and forced her to rally. The words of the
16844: bad dream crawled about the diamonds still, but only for her: to others
16845: they were brilliants that suited her perfectly, and Grandcourt inwardly
16846: observed that she answered to the rein.
16847: 
16848: “Oh, yes, mamma, quite happy,” Gwendolen had said on her return to
16849: Diplow. “Not at all disappointed in Ryelands. It is a much finer place
16850: than this—larger in every way. But don’t you want some more money?”
16851: 
16852: “Did you not know that Mr. Grandcourt left me a letter on your
16853: wedding-day? I am to have eight hundred a year. He wishes me to keep
16854: Offendene for the present, while you are at Diplow. But if there were
16855: some pretty cottage near the park at Ryelands we might live there
16856: without much expense, and I should have you most of the year, perhaps.”
16857: 
16858: “We must leave that to Mr. Grandcourt, mamma.”
16859: 
16860: “Oh, certainly. It is exceedingly handsome of him to say that he will
16861: pay the rent for Offendene till June. And we can go on very
16862: well—without any man-servant except Crane, just for out-of-doors. Our
16863: good Merry will stay with us and help me to manage everything. It is
16864: natural that Mr. Grandcourt should wish me to live in a good style of
16865: house in your neighborhood, and I cannot decline. So he said nothing
16866: about it to you?”
16867: 
16868: “No; he wished me to hear it from you, I suppose.”
16869: 
16870: Gwendolen in fact had been very anxious to have some definite knowledge
16871: of what would be done for her mother, but at no moment since her
16872: marriage had she been able to overcome the difficulty of mentioning the
16873: subject to Grandcourt. Now, however, she had a sense of obligation
16874: which would not let her rest without saying to him, “It is very good of
16875: you to provide for mamma. You took a great deal on yourself in marrying
16876: a girl who had nothing but relations belonging to her.”
16877: 
16878: Grandcourt was smoking, and only said carelessly, “Of course I was not
16879: going to let her live like a gamekeeper’s mother.”
16880: 
16881: “At least he is not mean about money,” thought Gwendolen, “and mamma is
16882: the better off for my marriage.”
16883: 
16884: She often pursued the comparison between what might have been, if she
16885: had not married Grandcourt, and what actually was, trying to persuade
16886: herself that life generally was barren of satisfaction, and that if she
16887: had chosen differently she might now have been looking back with a
16888: regret as bitter as the feeling she was trying to argue away. Her
16889: mother’s dullness, which used to irritate her, she was at present
16890: inclined to explain as the ordinary result of woman’s experience. True,
16891: she still saw that she would “manage differently from mamma;” but her
16892: management now only meant that she would carry her troubles with
16893: spirit, and let none suspect them. By and by she promised herself that
16894: she should get used to her heart-sores, and find excitements that would
16895: carry her through life, as a hard gallop carried her through some of
16896: the morning hours. There was gambling: she had heard stories at
16897: Leubronn of fashionable women who gambled in all sorts of ways. It
16898: seemed very flat to her at this distance, but perhaps if she began to
16899: gamble again, the passion might awake. Then there was the pleasure of
16900: producing an effect by her appearance in society: what did celebrated
16901: beauties do in town when their husbands could afford display? All men
16902: were fascinated by them: they had a perfect equipage and toilet, walked
16903: into public places, and bowed, and made the usual answers, and walked
16904: out again, perhaps they bought china, and practiced accomplishments. If
16905: she could only feel a keen appetite for those pleasures—could only
16906: believe in pleasure as she used to do! Accomplishments had ceased to
16907: have the exciting quality of promising any pre-eminence to her; and as
16908: for fascinated gentlemen—adorers who might hover round her with
16909: languishment, and diversify married life with the romantic stir of
16910: mystery, passion, and danger, which her French reading had given her
16911: some girlish notion of—they presented themselves to her imagination
16912: with the fatal circumstance that, instead of fascinating her in return,
16913: they were clad in her own weariness and disgust. The admiring male,
16914: rashly adjusting the expression of his features and the turn of his
16915: conversation to her supposed tastes, had always been an absurd object
16916: to her, and at present seemed rather detestable. Many courses are
16917: actually pursued—follies and sins both convenient and
16918: inconvenient—without pleasure or hope of pleasure; but to solace
16919: ourselves with imagining any course beforehand, there must be some
16920: foretaste of pleasure in the shape of appetite; and Gwendolen’s
16921: appetite had sickened. Let her wander over the possibilities of her
16922: life as she would, an uncertain shadow dogged her. Her confidence in
16923: herself and her destiny had turned into remorse and dread; she trusted
16924: neither herself nor her future.
16925: 
16926: This hidden helplessness gave fresh force to the hold Deronda had from
16927: the first taken on her mind, as one who had an unknown standard by
16928: which he judged her. Had he some way of looking at things which might
16929: be a new footing for her—an inward safeguard against possible events
16930: which she dreaded as stored-up retribution? It is one of the secrets in
16931: that change of mental poise which has been fitly named conversion, that
16932: to many among us neither heaven nor earth has any revelation till some
16933: personality touches theirs with a peculiar influence, subduing them
16934: into receptiveness. It had been Gwendolen’s habit to think of the
16935: persons around her as stale books, too familiar to be interesting.
16936: Deronda had lit up her attention with a sense of novelty: not by words
16937: only, but by imagined facts, his influence had entered into the current
16938: of that self-suspicion and self-blame which awakens a new consciousness.
16939: 
16940: “I wish he could know everything about me without my telling him,” was
16941: one of her thoughts, as she sat leaning over the end of a couch,
16942: supporting her head with her hand, and looking at herself in a
16943: mirror—not in admiration, but in a sad kind of companionship. “I wish
16944: he knew that I am not so contemptible as he thinks me; that I am in
16945: deep trouble, and want to be something better if I could.” Without the
16946: aid of sacred ceremony or costume, her feelings had turned this man,
16947: only a few years older than herself, into a priest; a sort of trust
16948: less rare than the fidelity that guards it. Young reverence for one who
16949: is also young is the most coercive of all: there is the same level of
16950: temptation, and the higher motive is believed in as a fuller force—not
16951: suspected to be a mere residue from weary experience.
16952: 
16953: But the coercion is often stronger on the one who takes the reverence.
16954: Those who trust us educate us. And perhaps in that ideal consecration
16955: of Gwendolen’s, some education was being prepared for Deronda.
16956:

16960: CHAPTER XXXVI.
16961: 
16962:   “Rien ne pèse tant qu’un secret
16963:   Le porter loin est difficile aux dames:
16964:   Et je sçais mesme sur ce fait
16965:   Bon nombre d’hommes qui sont femmes.”
16966:                                —LA FONTAINE.
16967: 
16968: 
16969: Meanwhile Deronda had been fastened and led off by Mr. Vandernoodt, who
16970: wished for a brisker walk, a cigar, and a little gossip. Since we
16971: cannot tell a man his own secrets, the restraint of being in his
16972: company often breeds a desire to pair off in conversation with some
16973: more ignorant person, and Mr. Vandernoodt presently said,
16974: 
16975: “What a washed-out piece of cambric Grandcourt is! But if he is a
16976: favorite of yours, I withdraw the remark.”
16977: 
16978: “Not the least in the world,” said Deronda.
16979: 
16980: “I thought not. One wonders how he came to have a great passion again;
16981: and he must have had—to marry in this way. Though Lush, his old chum,
16982: hints that he married this girl out of obstinacy. By George! it was a
16983: very accountable obstinacy. A man might make up his mind to marry her
16984: without the stimulus of contradiction. But he must have made himself a
16985: pretty large drain of money, eh?”
16986: 
16987: “I know nothing of his affairs.”
16988: 
16989: “What! not of the other establishment he keeps up?”
16990: 
16991: “Diplow? Of course. He took that of Sir Hugo. But merely for the year.”
16992: 
16993: “No, no; not Diplow: Gadsmere. Sir Hugo knows, I’ll answer for it.”
16994: 
16995: Deronda said nothing. He really began to feel some curiosity, but he
16996: foresaw that he should hear what Mr. Vandernoodt had to tell, without
16997: the condescension of asking.
16998: 
16999: “Lush would not altogether own to it, of course. He’s a confident and
17000: go-between of Grandcourt’s. But I have it on the best authority. The
17001: fact is, there’s another lady with four children at Gadsmere. She has
17002: had the upper hand of him these ten years and more, and by what I can
17003: understand has it still—left her husband for him, and used to travel
17004: with him everywhere. Her husband’s dead now; I found a fellow who was
17005: in the same regiment with him, and knew this Mrs. Glasher before she
17006: took wing. A fiery dark-eyed woman—a noted beauty at that time—he
17007: thought she was dead. They say she has Grandcourt under her thumb
17008: still, and it’s a wonder he didn’t marry her, for there’s a very fine
17009: boy, and I understand Grandcourt can do absolutely as he pleases with
17010: the estates. Lush told me as much as that.”
17011: 
17012: “What right had he to marry this girl?” said Deronda, with disgust.
17013: 
17014: Mr. Vandernoodt, adjusting the end of his cigar, shrugged his shoulders
17015: and put out his lips.
17016: 
17017: “_She_ can know nothing of it,” said Deronda, emphatically. But that
17018: positive statement was immediately followed by an inward query—“Could
17019: she have known anything of it?”
17020: 
17021: “It’s rather a piquant picture,” said Mr. Vandernoodt—“Grandcourt
17022: between two fiery women. For depend upon it this light-haired one has
17023: plenty of devil in her. I formed that opinion of her at Leubronn. It’s
17024: a sort of Medea and Creüsa business. Fancy the two meeting! Grandcourt
17025: is a new kind of Jason: I wonder what sort of a part he’ll make of it.
17026: It’s a dog’s part at best. I think I hear Ristori now, saying, ‘Jasone!
17027: Jasone!’ These fine women generally get hold of a stick.”
17028: 
17029: “Grandcourt can bite, I fancy,” said Deronda. “He is no stick.”
17030: 
17031: “No, no; I meant Jason. I can’t quite make out Grandcourt. But he’s a
17032: keen fellow enough—uncommonly well built too. And if he comes into all
17033: this property, the estates will bear dividing. This girl, whose friends
17034: had come to beggary, I understand, may think herself lucky to get him.
17035: I don’t want to be hard on a man because he gets involved in an affair
17036: of that sort. But he might make himself more agreeable. I was telling
17037: him a capital story last night, and he got up and walked away in the
17038: middle. I felt inclined to kick him. Do you suppose that is inattention
17039: or insolence, now?”
17040: 
17041: “Oh, a mixture. He generally observes the forms: but he doesn’t listen
17042: much,” said Deronda. Then, after a moment’s pause, he went on, “I
17043: should think there must be some exaggeration or inaccuracy in what you
17044: have heard about this lady at Gadsmere.”
17045: 
17046: “Not a bit, depend upon it; it has all lain snug of late years. People
17047: have forgotten all about it. But there the nest is, and the birds are
17048: in it. And I know Grandcourt goes there. I have good evidence that he
17049: goes there. However, that’s nobody’s business but his own. The affair
17050: has sunk below the surface.”
17051: 
17052: “I wonder you could have learned so much about it,” said Deronda,
17053: rather drily.
17054: 
17055: “Oh, there are plenty of people who knew all about it; but such stories
17056: get packed away like old letters. They interest me. I like to know the
17057: manners of my time—contemporary gossip, not antediluvian. These
17058: Dryasdust fellows get a reputation by raking up some small scandal
17059: about Semiramis or Nitocris, and then we have a thousand and one poems
17060: written upon it by all the warblers big and little. But I don’t care a
17061: straw about the _faux pas_ of the mummies. You do, though. You are one
17062: of the historical men—more interested in a lady when she’s got a rag
17063: face and skeleton toes peeping out. Does that flatter your imagination?”
17064: 
17065: “Well, if she had any woes in her love, one has the satisfaction of
17066: knowing that she’s well out of them.”
17067: 
17068: “Ah, you are thinking of the Medea, I see.”
17069: 
17070: Deronda then chose to point to some giant oaks worth looking at in
17071: their bareness. He also felt an interest in this piece of contemporary
17072: gossip, but he was satisfied that Mr. Vandernoodt had no more to tell
17073: about it.
17074: 
17075: Since the early days when he tried to construct the hidden story of his
17076: own birth, his mind had perhaps never been so active in weaving
17077: probabilities about any private affair as it had now begun to be about
17078: Gwendolen’s marriage. This unavowed relation of Grandcourt’s—could she
17079: have gained some knowledge of it, which caused her to shrink from the
17080: match—a shrinking finally overcome by the urgence of poverty? He could
17081: recall almost every word she had said to him, and in certain of these
17082: words he seemed to discern that she was conscious of having done some
17083: wrong—inflicted some injury. His own acute experience made him alive
17084: to the form of injury which might affect the unavowed children and
17085: their mother. Was Mrs. Grandcourt, under all her determined show of
17086: satisfaction, gnawed by a double, a treble-headed grief—self-reproach,
17087: disappointment, jealousy? He dwelt especially on all the slight signs
17088: of self-reproach: he was inclined to judge her tenderly, to excuse, to
17089: pity. He thought he had found a key now by which to interpret her more
17090: clearly: what magnifying of her misery might not a young creature get
17091: into who had wedded her fresh hopes to old secrets! He thought he saw
17092: clearly enough now why Sir Hugo had never dropped any hint of this
17093: affair to him; and immediately the image of this Mrs. Glasher became
17094: painfully associated with his own hidden birth. Gwendolen knowing of
17095: that woman and her children, marrying Grandcourt, and showing herself
17096: contented, would have been among the most repulsive of beings to him;
17097: but Gwendolen tasting the bitterness of remorse for having contributed
17098: to their injury was brought very near to his fellow-feeling. If it were
17099: so, she had got to a common plane of understanding with him on some
17100: difficulties of life which a woman is rarely able to judge of with any
17101: justice or generosity; for, according to precedent, Gwendolen’s view of
17102: her position might easily have been no other than that her husband’s
17103: marriage with her was his entrance on the path of virtue, while Mrs.
17104: Glasher represented his forsaken sin. And Deronda had naturally some
17105: resentment on behalf of the Hagars and Ishmaels.
17106: 
17107: Undeniably Deronda’s growing solicitude about Gwendolen depended
17108: chiefly on her peculiar manner toward him; and I suppose neither man
17109: nor woman would be the better for an utter insensibility to such
17110: appeals. One sign that his interest in her had changed its footing was
17111: that he dismissed any caution against her being a coquette setting
17112: snares to involve him in a vulgar flirtation, and determined that he
17113: would not again evade any opportunity of talking to her. He had shaken
17114: off Mr. Vandernoodt, and got into a solitary corner in the twilight;
17115: but half an hour was long enough to think of those possibilities in
17116: Gwendolen’s position and state of mind; and on forming the
17117: determination not to avoid her, he remembered that she was likely to be
17118: at tea with the other ladies in the drawing-room. The conjecture was
17119: true; for Gwendolen, after resolving not to go down again for the next
17120: four hours, began to feel, at the end of one, that in shutting herself
17121: up she missed all chances of seeing and hearing, and that her visit
17122: would only last two days more. She adjusted herself, put on her little
17123: air of self-possession, and going down, made herself resolutely
17124: agreeable. Only ladies were assembled, and Lady Pentreath was amusing
17125: them with a description of a drawing-room under the Regency, and the
17126: figure that was cut by ladies and gentlemen in 1819, the year she was
17127: presented—when Deronda entered.
17128: 
17129: “Shall I be acceptable?” he said. “Perhaps I had better go back and
17130: look for the others. I suppose they are in the billiard-room.”
17131: 
17132: “No, no; stay where you are,” said Lady Pentreath. “They were all
17133: getting tired of me; let us hear what _you_ have to say.”
17134: 
17135: “That is rather an embarrassing appeal,” said Deronda, drawing up a
17136: chair near Lady Mallinger’s elbow at the tea-table. “I think I had
17137: better take the opportunity of mentioning our songstress,” he added,
17138: looking at Lady Mallinger—“unless you have done so.”
17139: 
17140: “Oh, the little Jewess!” said Lady Mallinger. “No, I have not mentioned
17141: her. It never entered my head that any one here wanted singing lessons.”
17142: 
17143: “All ladies know some one else who wants singing lessons,” said
17144: Deronda. “I have happened to find an exquisite singer,”—here he turned
17145: to Lady Pentreath. “She is living with some ladies who are friends of
17146: mine—the mother and sisters of a man who was my chum at Cambridge. She
17147: was on the stage at Vienna; but she wants to leave that life, and
17148: maintain herself by teaching.”
17149: 
17150: “There are swarms of those people, aren’t there?” said the old lady.
17151: “Are her lessons to be very cheap or very expensive? Those are the two
17152: baits I know of.”
17153: 
17154: “There is another bait for those who hear her,” said Deronda. “Her
17155: singing is something quite exceptional, I think. She has had such
17156: first-rate teaching—or rather first-rate instinct with her
17157: teaching—that you might imagine her singing all came by nature.”
17158: 
17159: “Why did she leave the stage, then?” said Lady Pentreath. “I’m too old
17160: to believe in first-rate people giving up first-rate chances.”
17161: 
17162: “Her voice was too weak. It is a delicious voice for a room. You who
17163: put up with my singing of Schubert would be enchanted with hers,” said
17164: Deronda, looking at Mrs. Raymond. “And I imagine she would not object
17165: to sing at private parties or concerts. Her voice is quite equal to
17166: that.”
17167: 
17168: “I am to have her in my drawing-room when we go up to town,” said Lady
17169: Mallinger. “You shall hear her then. I have not heard her myself yet;
17170: but I trust Daniel’s recommendation. I mean my girls to have lessons of
17171: her.”
17172: 
17173: “Is it a charitable affair?” said Lady Pentreath. “I can’t bear
17174: charitable music.”
17175: 
17176: Lady Mallinger, who was rather helpless in conversation, and felt
17177: herself under an engagement not to tell anything of Mirah’s story, had
17178: an embarrassed smile on her face, and glanced at Deronda.
17179: 
17180: “It is a charity to those who want to have a good model of feminine
17181: singing,” said Deronda. “I think everybody who has ears would benefit
17182: by a little improvement on the ordinary style. If you heard Miss
17183: Lapidoth”—here he looked at Gwendolen—“perhaps you would revoke your
17184: resolution to give up singing.”
17185: 
17186: “I should rather think my resolution would be confirmed,” said
17187: Gwendolen. “I don’t feel able to follow your advice of enjoying my own
17188: middlingness.”
17189: 
17190: “For my part,” said Deronda, “people who do anything finely always
17191: inspirit me to try. I don’t mean that they make me believe I can do it
17192: as well. But they make the thing, whatever it may be, seem worthy to be
17193: done. I can bear to think my own music not good for much, but the world
17194: would be more dismal if I thought music itself not good for much.
17195: Excellence encourages one about life generally; it shows the spiritual
17196: wealth of the world.”
17197: 
17198: “But then, if we can’t imitate it, it only makes our own life seem the
17199: tamer,” said Gwendolen, in a mood to resent encouragement founded on
17200: her own insignificance.
17201: 
17202: “That depends on the point of view, I think,” said Deronda. “We should
17203: have a poor life of it if we were reduced for all our pleasure to our
17204: own performances. A little private imitation of what is good is a sort
17205: of private devotion to it, and most of us ought to practice art only in
17206: the light of private study—preparation to understand and enjoy what
17207: the few can do for us. I think Miss Lapidoth is one of the few.”
17208: 
17209: “She must be a very happy person, don’t you think?” said Gwendolen,
17210: with a touch of sarcasm, and a turn of her neck toward Mrs. Raymond.
17211: 
17212: “I don’t know,” answered the independent lady; “I must hear more of her
17213: before I say that.”
17214: 
17215: “It may have been a bitter disappointment to her that her voice failed
17216: her for the stage,” said Juliet Fenn, sympathetically.
17217: 
17218: “I suppose she’s past her best, though,” said the deep voice of Lady
17219: Pentreath.
17220: 
17221: “On the contrary, she has not reached it,” said Deronda. “She is barely
17222: twenty.”
17223: 
17224: “And very pretty,” interposed Lady Mallinger, with an amiable wish to
17225: help Deronda. “And she has very good manners. I’m sorry she’s a bigoted
17226: Jewess; I should not like it for anything else, but it doesn’t matter
17227: in singing.”
17228: 
17229: “Well, since her voice is too weak for her to scream much, I’ll tell
17230: Lady Clementina to set her on my nine granddaughters,” said Lady
17231: Pentreath; “and I hope she’ll convince eight of them that they have not
17232: voice enough to sing anywhere but at church. My notion is, that many of
17233: our girls nowadays want lessons not to sing.”
17234: 
17235: “I have had my lessons in that,” said Gwendolen, looking at Deronda.
17236: “You see Lady Pentreath is on my side.”
17237: 
17238: While she was speaking, Sir Hugo entered with some of the other
17239: gentlemen, including Grandcourt, and standing against the group at the
17240: low tea-table said,
17241: 
17242: “What imposition is Deronda putting on you, ladies—slipping in among
17243: you by himself?”
17244: 
17245: “Wanting to pass off an obscurity on us as better than any celebrity,”
17246: said Lady Pentreath—“a pretty singing Jewess who is to astonish these
17247: young people. You and I, who heard Catalani in her prime, are not so
17248: easily astonished.”
17249: 
17250: Sir Hugo listened with his good-humored smile as he took a cup of tea
17251: from his wife, and then said, “Well, you know, a Liberal is bound to
17252: think that there have been singers since Catalani’s time.”
17253: 
17254: “Ah, you are younger than I am. I dare say you are one of the men who
17255: ran after Alcharisi. But she married off and left you all in the lurch.”
17256: 
17257: “Yes, yes; it’s rather too bad when these great singers marry
17258: themselves into silence before they have a crack in their voices. And
17259: the husband is a public robber. I remember Leroux saying, ‘A man might
17260: as well take down a fine peal of church bells and carry them off to the
17261: steppes,’ said Sir Hugo, setting down his cup and turning away, while
17262: Deronda, who had moved from his place to make room for others, and felt
17263: that he was not in request, sat down a little apart. Presently he
17264: became aware that, in the general dispersion of the group, Gwendolen
17265: had extricated herself from the attentions of Mr. Vandernoodt and had
17266: walked to the piano, where she stood apparently examining the music
17267: which lay on the desk. Will any one be surprised at Deronda’s
17268: concluding that she wished him to join her? Perhaps she wanted to make
17269: amends for the unpleasant tone of resistance with which she had met his
17270: recommendation of Mirah, for he had noticed that her first impulse
17271: often was to say what she afterward wished to retract. He went to her
17272: side and said,
17273: 
17274: “Are you relenting about the music and looking for something to play or
17275: sing?”
17276: 
17277: “I am not looking for anything, but I _am_ relenting,” said Gwendolen,
17278: speaking in a submissive tone.
17279: 
17280: “May I know the reason?”
17281: 
17282: “I should like to hear Miss Lapidoth and have lessons from her, since
17283: you admire her so much—that is, of course, when we go to town. I mean
17284: lessons in rejoicing at her excellence and my own deficiency,” said
17285: Gwendolen, turning on him a sweet, open smile.
17286: 
17287: “I shall be really glad for you to see and hear her,” said Deronda,
17288: returning the smile in kind.
17289: 
17290: “Is she as perfect in every thing else as in her music?”
17291: 
17292: “I can’t vouch for that exactly. I have not seen enough of her. But I
17293: have seen nothing in her that I could wish to be different. She has had
17294: an unhappy life. Her troubles began in early childhood, and she has
17295: grown up among very painful surroundings. But I think you will say that
17296: no advantages could have given her more grace and truer refinement.”
17297: 
17298: “I wonder what sort of trouble hers were?”
17299: 
17300: “I have not any very precise knowledge. But I know that she was on the
17301: brink of drowning herself in despair.”
17302: 
17303: “And what hindered her?” said Gwendolen, quickly, looking at Deronda.
17304: 
17305: “Some ray or other came—which made her feel that she ought to
17306: live—that it was good to live,” he answered, quietly. “She is full of
17307: piety, and seems capable of submitting to anything when it takes the
17308: form of duty.”
17309: 
17310: “Those people are not to be pitied,” said Gwendolen, impatiently. “I
17311: have no sympathy with women who are always doing right. I don’t believe
17312: in their great sufferings.” Her fingers moved quickly among the edges
17313: of the music.
17314: 
17315: “It is true,” said Deronda, “that the consciousness of having done
17316: wrong is something deeper, more bitter. I suppose we faulty creatures
17317: can never feel so much for the irreproachable as for those who are
17318: bruised in the struggle with their own faults. It is a very ancient
17319: story, that of the lost sheep—but it comes up afresh every day.”
17320: 
17321: “That is a way of speaking—it is not acted upon, it is not real,” said
17322: Gwendolen, bitterly. “You admire Miss Lapidoth because you think her
17323: blameless, perfect. And you know you would despise a woman who had done
17324: something you thought very wrong.”
17325: 
17326: “That would depend entirely upon her own view of what she had done,”
17327: said Deronda.
17328: 
17329: “You would be satisfied if she were very wretched, I suppose,” said
17330: Gwendolen, impetuously.
17331: 
17332: “No, not satisfied—full of sorrow for her. It was not a mere way of
17333: speaking. I did not mean to say that the finer nature is not more
17334: adorable; I meant that those who would be comparatively uninteresting
17335: beforehand may become worthier of sympathy when they do something that
17336: awakens in them a keen remorse. Lives are enlarged in different ways. I
17337: dare say some would never get their eyes opened if it were not for a
17338: violent shock from the consequences of their own actions. And when they
17339: are suffering in that way one must care for them more than for the
17340: comfortably self-satisfied.” Deronda forgot everything but his vision
17341: of what Gwendolen’s experience had probably been, and urged by
17342: compassion let his eyes and voice express as much interest as they
17343: would.
17344: 
17345: Gwendolen had slipped on to the music-stool, and looked up at him with
17346: pain in her long eyes, like a wounded animal asking for help.
17347: 
17348: “Are you persuading Mrs. Grandcourt to play to us, Dan?” said Sir Hugo,
17349: coming up and putting his hand on Deronda’s shoulder with a gentle,
17350: admonitory pinch.
17351: 
17352: “I cannot persuade myself,” said Gwendolen, rising.
17353: 
17354: Others had followed Sir Hugo’s lead, and there was an end of any
17355: liability to confidences for that day. But the next was New Year’s Eve;
17356: and a grand dance, to which the chief tenants were invited, was to be
17357: held in the picture-gallery above the cloister—the sort of
17358: entertainment in which numbers and general movement may create privacy.
17359: When Gwendolen was dressing, she longed, in remembrance of Leubronn, to
17360: put on the old turquoise necklace for her sole ornament; but she dared
17361: not offend her husband by appearing in that shabby way on an occasion
17362: when he would demand her utmost splendor. Determined to wear the
17363: memorial necklace somehow, she wound it thrice round her wrist and made
17364: a bracelet of it—having gone to her room to put it on just before the
17365: time of entering the ball-room.
17366: 
17367: It was always a beautiful scene, this dance on New Year’s Eve, which
17368: had been kept up by the family tradition as nearly in the old fashion
17369: as inexorable change would allow. Red carpet was laid down for the
17370: occasion: hot-house plants and evergreens were arranged in bowers at
17371: the extremities and in every recess of the gallery; and the old
17372: portraits stretching back through generations, even to the
17373: pre-portraying period, made a piquant line of spectators. Some
17374: neighboring gentry, major and minor, were invited; and it was certainly
17375: an occasion when a prospective master and mistress of Abbott’s and
17376: King’s Topping might see their future glory in an agreeable light, as a
17377: picturesque provincial supremacy with a rent-roll personified by the
17378: most prosperous-looking tenants. Sir Hugo expected Grandcourt to feel
17379: flattered by being asked to the Abbey at a time which included this
17380: festival in honor of the family estate; but he also hoped that his own
17381: hale appearance might impress his successor with the probable length of
17382: time that would elapse before the succession came, and with the wisdom
17383: of preferring a good actual sum to a minor property that must be waited
17384: for. All present, down to the least important farmer’s daughter, knew
17385: that they were to see “young Grandcourt,” Sir Hugo’s nephew, the
17386: presumptive heir and future baronet, now visiting the Abbey with his
17387: bride after an absence of many years; any coolness between uncle and
17388: nephew having, it is understood, given way to a friendly warmth. The
17389: bride opening the ball with Sir Hugo was necessarily the cynosure of
17390: all eyes; and less than a year before, if some magic mirror could have
17391: shown Gwendolen her actual position, she would have imagined herself
17392: moving in it with a glow of triumphant pleasure, conscious that she
17393: held in her hands a life full of favorable chances which her cleverness
17394: and spirit would enable her to make the best of. And now she was
17395: wondering that she could get so little joy out of the exaltation to
17396: which she had been suddenly lifted, away from the distasteful petty
17397: empire of her girlhood with its irksome lack of distinction and
17398: superfluity of sisters. She would have been glad to be even
17399: unreasonably elated, and to forget everything but the flattery of the
17400: moment; but she was like one courting sleep, in whom thoughts insist
17401: like willful tormentors.
17402: 
17403: Wondering in this way at her own dullness, and all the while longing
17404: for an excitement that would deaden importunate aches, she was passing
17405: through files of admiring beholders in the country-dance with which it
17406: was traditional to open the ball, and was being generally regarded by
17407: her own sex as an enviable woman. It was remarked that she carried
17408: herself with a wonderful air, considering that she had been nobody in
17409: particular, and without a farthing to her fortune. If she had been a
17410: duke’s daughter, or one of the royal princesses, she could not have
17411: taken the honors of the evening more as a matter of course. Poor
17412: Gwendolen! It would by-and-by become a sort of skill in which she was
17413: automatically practiced to bear this last great gambling loss with an
17414: air of perfect self-possession.
17415: 
17416: The next couple that passed were also worth looking at. Lady Pentreath
17417: had said, “I shall stand up for one dance, but I shall choose my
17418: partner. Mr. Deronda, you are the youngest man, I mean to dance with
17419: you. Nobody is old enough to make a good pair with me. I must have a
17420: contrast.” And the contrast certainly set off the old lady to the
17421: utmost. She was one of those women who are never handsome till they are
17422: old, and she had had the wisdom to embrace the beauty of age as early
17423: as possible. What might have seemed harshness in her features when she
17424: was young, had turned now into a satisfactory strength of form and
17425: expression which defied wrinkles, and was set off by a crown of white
17426: hair; her well-built figure was well covered with black drapery, her
17427: ears and neck comfortably caressed with lace, showing none of those
17428: withered spaces which one would think it a pitiable condition of
17429: poverty to expose. She glided along gracefully enough, her dark eyes
17430: still with a mischievous smile in them as she observed the company. Her
17431: partner’s young richness of tint against the flattened hues and rougher
17432: forms of her aged head had an effect something like that of a fine
17433: flower against a lichenous branch. Perhaps the tenants hardly
17434: appreciated this pair. Lady Pentreath was nothing more than a straight,
17435: active old lady: Mr. Deronda was a familiar figure regarded with
17436: friendliness; but if he had been the heir, it would have been regretted
17437: that his face was not as unmistakably English as Sir Hugo’s.
17438: 
17439: Grandcourt’s appearance when he came up with Lady Mallinger was not
17440: impeached with foreignness: still the satisfaction in it was not
17441: complete. It would have been matter of congratulation if one who had
17442: the luck to inherit two old family estates had had more hair, a fresher
17443: color, and a look of greater animation; but that fine families dwindled
17444: off into females, and estates ran together into the single heirship of
17445: a mealy-complexioned male, was a tendency in things which seemed to be
17446: accounted for by a citation of other instances. It was agreed that Mr.
17447: Grandcourt could never be taken for anything but what he was—a born
17448: gentleman; and that, in fact, he looked like an heir. Perhaps the
17449: person least complacently disposed toward him at that moment was Lady
17450: Mallinger, to whom going in procession up this country-dance with
17451: Grandcourt was a blazonment of herself as the infelicitous wife who had
17452: produced nothing but daughters, little better than no children, poor
17453: dear things, except for her own fondness and for Sir Hugo’s wonderful
17454: goodness to them. But such inward discomfort could not prevent the
17455: gentle lady from looking fair and stout to admiration, or her full blue
17456: eyes from glancing mildly at her neighbors. All the mothers and fathers
17457: held it a thousand pities that she had not had a fine boy, or even
17458: several—which might have been expected, to look at her when she was
17459: first married.
17460: 
17461: The gallery included only three sides of the quadrangle, the fourth
17462: being shut off as a lobby or corridor: one side was used for dancing,
17463: and the opposite side for the supper-table, while the intermediate part
17464: was less brilliantly lit, and fitted with comfortable seats. Later in
17465: the evening Gwendolen was in one of these seats, and Grandcourt was
17466: standing near her. They were not talking to each other: she was leaning
17467: backward in her chair, and he against the wall; and Deronda, happening
17468: to observe this, went up to ask her if she had resolved not to dance
17469: any more. Having himself been doing hard duty in this way among the
17470: guests, he thought he had earned the right to sink for a little while
17471: into the background, and he had spoken little to Gwendolen since their
17472: conversation at the piano the day before. Grandcourt’s presence would
17473: only make it the easier to show that pleasure in talking to her even
17474: about trivialities which would be a sign of friendliness; and he
17475: fancied that her face looked blank. A smile beamed over it as she saw
17476: him coming, and she raised herself from her leaning posture. Grandcourt
17477: had been grumbling at the _ennui_ of staying so long in this stupid
17478: dance, and proposing that they should vanish: she had resisted on the
17479: ground of politeness—not without being a little frightened at the
17480: probability that he was silently angry with her. She had her reason
17481: for staying, though she had begun to despair of the opportunity for the
17482: sake of which she had put the old necklace on her wrist. But now at
17483: last Deronda had come.
17484: 
17485: “Yes; I shall not dance any more. Are you not glad?” she said, with
17486: some gayety, “you might have felt obliged humbly to offer yourself as a
17487: partner, and I feel sure you have danced more than you like already.”
17488: 
17489: “I will not deny that,” said Deronda, “since you have danced as much as
17490: you like.”
17491: 
17492: “But will you take trouble for me in another way, and fetch me a glass
17493: of that fresh water?”
17494: 
17495: It was but a few steps that Deronda had to go for the water. Gwendolen
17496: was wrapped in the lightest, softest of white woolen burnouses, under
17497: which her hands were hidden. While he was gone she had drawn off her
17498: glove, which was finished with a lace ruffle, and when she put up her
17499: hand to take the glass and lifted it to her mouth, the
17500: necklace-bracelet, which in its triple winding adapted itself clumsily
17501: to her wrist, was necessarily conspicuous. Grandcourt saw it, and saw
17502: that it was attracting Deronda’s notice.
17503: 
17504: “What is that hideous thing you have got on your wrist?” said the
17505: husband.
17506: 
17507: “That?” said Gwendolen, composedly, pointing to the turquoises, while
17508: she still held the glass; “it is an old necklace I like to wear. I lost
17509: it once, and someone found it for me.”
17510: 
17511: With that she gave the glass again to Deronda, who immediately carried
17512: it away, and on returning said, in order to banish any consciousness
17513: about the necklace,
17514: 
17515: “It is worth while for you to go and look out at one of the windows on
17516: that side. You can see the finest possible moonlight on the stone
17517: pillars and carving, and shadows waving across it in the wind.”
17518: 
17519: “I should like to see it. Will you go?” said Gwendolen, looking up at
17520: her husband.
17521: 
17522: He cast his eyes down at her, and saying, “No, Deronda will take you,”
17523: slowly moved from his leaning attitude, and walked away.
17524: 
17525: Gwendolen’s face for a moment showed a fleeting vexation: she resented
17526: this show of indifference toward her. Deronda felt annoyed, chiefly for
17527: her sake; and with a quick sense, that it would relieve her most to
17528: behave as if nothing peculiar had occurred, he said, “Will you take my
17529: arm and go, while only servants are there?” He thought that he
17530: understood well her action in drawing his attention to the necklace:
17531: she wished him to infer that she had submitted her mind to rebuke—her
17532: speech and manner had from the first fluctuated toward that
17533: submission—and that she felt no lingering resentment. Her evident
17534: confidence in his interpretation of her appealed to him as a peculiar
17535: claim.
17536: 
17537: When they were walking together, Gwendolen felt as if the annoyance
17538: which had just happened had removed another film of reserve from
17539: between them, and she had more right than before to be as open as she
17540: wished. She did not speak, being filled with the sense of silent
17541: confidence, until they were in front of the window looking out on the
17542: moonlit court. A sort of bower had been made round the window, turning
17543: it into a recess. Quitting his arm, she folded her hands in her
17544: burnous, and pressed her brow against the glass. He moved slightly
17545: away, and held the lapels of his coat with his thumbs under the collar
17546: as his manner was: he had a wonderful power of standing perfectly
17547: still, and in that position reminded one sometimes of Dante’s _spiriti
17548: magni con occhi tardi e gravi_. (Doubtless some of these danced in
17549: their youth, doubted of their own vocation, and found their own times
17550: too modern.) He abstained from remarking on the scene before them,
17551: fearing that any indifferent words might jar on her: already the calm
17552: light and shadow, the ancient steadfast forms, and aloofness enough
17553: from those inward troubles which he felt sure were agitating her. And
17554: he judged aright: she would have been impatient of polite conversation.
17555: The incidents of the last minute or two had receded behind former
17556: thoughts which she had imagined herself uttering to Deronda, which now
17557: urged themselves to her lips. In a subdued voice, she said,
17558: 
17559: “Suppose I had gambled again, and lost the necklace again, what should
17560: you have thought of me?”
17561: 
17562: “Worse than I do now.”
17563: 
17564: “Then you are mistaken about me. You wanted me not to do that—not to
17565: make my gain out of another’s loss in that way—and I have done a great
17566: deal worse.”
17567: 
17568: “I can’t imagine temptations,” said Deronda. “Perhaps I am able to
17569: understand what you mean. At least I understand self-reproach.” In
17570: spite of preparation he was almost alarmed at Gwendolen’s precipitancy
17571: of confidence toward him, in contrast with her habitual resolute
17572: concealment.
17573: 
17574: “What should you do if you were like me—feeling that you were wrong
17575: and miserable, and dreading everything to come?” It seemed that she was
17576: hurrying to make the utmost use of this opportunity to speak as she
17577: would.
17578: 
17579: “That is not to be amended by doing one thing only—but many,” said
17580: Deronda, decisively.
17581: 
17582: “What?” said Gwendolen, hastily, moving her brow from the glass and
17583: looking at him.
17584: 
17585: He looked full at her in return, with what she thought was severity. He
17586: felt that it was not a moment in which he must let himself be tender,
17587: and flinch from implying a hard opinion.
17588: 
17589: “I mean there are many thoughts and habits that may help us to bear
17590: inevitable sorrow. Multitudes have to bear it.”
17591: 
17592: She turned her brow to the window again, and said impatiently, “You
17593: must tell me then what to think and what to do; else why did you not
17594: let me go on doing as I liked and not minding? If I had gone on
17595: gambling I might have won again, and I might have got not to care for
17596: anything else. You would not let me do that. Why shouldn’t I do as I
17597: like, and not mind? Other people do.” Poor Gwendolen’s speech expressed
17598: nothing very clearly except her irritation.
17599: 
17600: “I don’t believe you would ever get not to mind,” said Deronda, with
17601: deep-toned decision. “If it were true that baseness and cruelty made an
17602: escape from pain, what difference would that make to people who can’t
17603: be quite base or cruel? Idiots escape some pain; but you can’t be an
17604: idiot. Some may do wrong to another without remorse; but suppose one
17605: does feel remorse? I believe you could never lead an injurious
17606: life—all reckless lives are injurious, pestilential—without feeling
17607: remorse.” Deronda’s unconscious fervor had gathered as he went on: he
17608: was uttering thoughts which he had used for himself in moments of
17609: painful meditation.
17610: 
17611: “Then tell me what better I can do,” said Gwendolen, insistently.
17612: 
17613: “Many things. Look on other lives besides your own. See what their
17614: troubles are, and how they are borne. Try to care about something in
17615: this vast world besides the gratification of small selfish desires. Try
17616: to care for what is best in thought and action—something that is good
17617: apart from the accidents of your own lot.”
17618: 
17619: For an instant or two Gwendolen was mute. Then, again moving her brow
17620: from the glass, she said,
17621: 
17622: “You mean that I am selfish and ignorant.”
17623: 
17624: He met her fixed look in silence before he answered firmly—“You will
17625: not go on being selfish and ignorant!”
17626: 
17627: She did not turn away her glance or let her eyelids fall, but a change
17628: came over her face—that subtle change in nerve and muscle which will
17629: sometimes give a childlike expression even to the elderly: it is the
17630: subsidence of self-assertion.
17631: 
17632: “Shall I lead you back?” said Deronda, gently, turning and offering her
17633: his arm again. She took it silently, and in that way they came in sight
17634: of Grandcourt, who was walking slowly near their former place.
17635: Gwendolen went up to him and said, “I am ready to go now. Mr. Deronda
17636: will excuse us to Lady Mallinger.”
17637: 
17638: “Certainly,” said Deronda. “Lord and Lady Pentreath disappeared some
17639: time ago.”
17640: 
17641: Grandcourt gave his arm in silent compliance, nodding over his shoulder
17642: to Deronda, and Gwendolen too only half turned to bow and say,
17643: “Thanks.” The husband and wife left the gallery and paced the corridors
17644: in silence. When the door had closed on them in the boudoir, Grandcourt
17645: threw himself into a chair and said, with undertoned peremptoriness,
17646: “Sit down.” She, already in the expectation of something unpleasant,
17647: had thrown off her burnous with nervous unconsciousness, and
17648: immediately obeyed. Turning his eyes toward her, he began,
17649: 
17650: “Oblige me in future by not showing whims like a mad woman in a play.”
17651: 
17652: “What do you mean?” said Gwendolen.
17653: 
17654: “I suppose there is some understanding between you and Deronda about
17655: that thing you have on your wrist. If you have anything to say to him,
17656: say it. But don’t carry on a telegraphing which other people are
17657: supposed not to see. It’s damnably vulgar.”
17658: 
17659: “You can know all about the necklace,” said Gwendolen, her angry pride
17660: resisting the nightmare of fear.
17661: 
17662: “I don’t want to know. Keep to yourself whatever you like.” Grandcourt
17663: paused between each sentence, and in each his speech seemed to become
17664: more preternaturally distinct in its inward tones. “What I care to know
17665: I shall know without your telling me. Only you will please to behave as
17666: becomes my wife. And not make a spectacle of yourself.”
17667: 
17668: “Do you object to my talking to Mr. Deronda?”
17669: 
17670: “I don’t care two straws about Deronda, or any other conceited
17671: hanger-on. You may talk to him as much as you like. He is not going to
17672: take my place. You are my wife. And you will either fill your place
17673: properly—to the world and to me—or you will go to the devil.”
17674: 
17675: “I never intended anything but to fill my place properly,” said
17676: Gwendolen, with bitterest mortification in her soul.
17677: 
17678: “You put that thing on your wrist, and hid it from me till you wanted
17679: him to see it. Only fools go into that deaf and dumb talk, and think
17680: they’re secret. You will understand that you are not to compromise
17681: yourself. Behave with dignity. That’s all I have to say.”
17682: 
17683: With that last word Grandcourt rose, turned his back to the fire and
17684: looked down on her. She was mute. There was no reproach that she dared
17685: to fling back at him in return for these insulting admonitions, and the
17686: very reason she felt them to be insulting was that their purport went
17687: with the most absolute dictate of her pride. What she would least like
17688: to incur was the making a fool of herself and being compromised. It was
17689: futile and irrelevant to try and explain that Deronda too had only been
17690: a monitor—the strongest of all monitors. Grandcourt was contemptuous,
17691: not jealous; contemptuously certain of all the subjection he cared for.
17692: Why could she not rebel and defy him? She longed to do it. But she
17693: might as well have tried to defy the texture of her nerves and the
17694: palpitation of her heart. Her husband had a ghostly army at his back,
17695: that could close round her wherever she might turn. She sat in her
17696: splendid attire, like a white image of helplessness, and he seemed to
17697: gratify himself with looking at her. She could not even make a
17698: passionate exclamation, or throw up her arms, as she would have done in
17699: her maiden days. The sense of his scorn kept her still.
17700: 
17701: “Shall I ring?” he said, after what seemed to her a long while. She
17702: moved her head in assent, and after ringing he went to his
17703: dressing-room.
17704: 
17705: Certain words were gnawing within her. “The wrong you have done me will
17706: be your own curse.” As he closed the door, the bitter tears rose, and
17707: the gnawing words provoked an answer: “Why did you put your fangs into
17708: me and not into him?” It was uttered in a whisper, as the tears came up
17709: silently. But she immediately pressed her handkerchief against her
17710: eyes, and checked her tendency to sob.
17711: 
17712: The next day, recovered from the shuddering fit of this evening scene,
17713: she determined to use the charter which Grandcourt had scornfully given
17714: her, and to talk as much as she liked with Deronda; but no
17715: opportunities occurred, and any little devices she could imagine for
17716: creating them were rejected by her pride, which was now doubly active.
17717: Not toward Deronda himself—she was singularly free from alarm lest he
17718: should think her openness wanting in dignity: it was part of his power
17719: over her that she believed him free from all misunderstanding as to the
17720: way in which she appealed to him; or rather, that he should
17721: misunderstand her had never entered into her mind. But the last morning
17722: came, and still she had never been able to take up the dropped thread
17723: of their talk, and she was without devices. She and Grandcourt were to
17724: leave at three o’clock. It was too irritating that after a walk in the
17725: grounds had been planned in Deronda’s hearing, he did not present
17726: himself to join in it. Grandcourt was gone with Sir Hugo to King’s
17727: Topping, to see the old manor-house; others of the gentlemen were
17728: shooting; she was condemned to go and see the decoy and the water-fowl,
17729: and everything else that she least wanted to see, with the ladies, with
17730: old Lord Pentreath and his anecdotes, with Mr. Vandernoodt and his
17731: admiring manners. The irritation became too strong for her; without
17732: premeditation, she took advantage of the winding road to linger a
17733: little out of sight, and then set off back to the house, almost running
17734: when she was safe from observation. She entered by a side door, and the
17735: library was on her left hand; Deronda, she knew, was often there; why
17736: might she not turn in there as well as into any other room in the
17737: house? She had been taken there expressly to see the illuminated family
17738: tree, and other remarkable things—what more natural than that she
17739: should like to look in again? The thing most to be feared was that the
17740: room would be empty of Deronda, for the door was ajar. She pushed it
17741: gently, and looked round it. He was there, writing busily at a distant
17742: table, with his back toward the door (in fact, Sir Hugo had asked him
17743: to answer some constituents’ letters which had become pressing). An
17744: enormous log fire, with the scent of Russia from the books, made the
17745: great room as warmly odorous as a private chapel in which the censers
17746: have been swinging. It seemed too daring to go in—too rude to speak
17747: and interrupt him; yet she went in on the noiseless carpet, and stood
17748: still for two or three minutes, till Deronda, having finished a letter,
17749: pushed it aside for signature, and threw himself back to consider
17750: whether there were anything else for him to do, or whether he could
17751: walk out for the chance of meeting the party which included Gwendolen,
17752: when he heard her voice saying, “Mr. Deronda.”
17753: 
17754: It was certainly startling. He rose hastily, turned round, and pushed
17755: away his chair with a strong expression of surprise.
17756: 
17757: “Am I wrong to come in?” said Gwendolen.
17758: 
17759: “I thought you were far on your walk,” said Deronda.
17760: 
17761: “I turned back,” said Gwendolen.
17762: 
17763: “Do you intend to go out again? I could join you now, if you would
17764: allow me.”
17765: 
17766: “No; I want to say something, and I can’t stay long,” said Gwendolen,
17767: speaking quickly in a subdued tone, while she walked forward and rested
17768: her arms and muff on the back of the chair he had pushed away from him.
17769: “I want to tell you that it is really so—I can’t help feeling remorse
17770: for having injured others. That was what I meant when I said that I had
17771: done worse than gamble again and pawn the necklace again—something
17772: more injurious, as you called it. And I can’t alter it. I am punished,
17773: but I can’t alter it. You said I could do many things. Tell me again.
17774: What should you do—what should you feel if you were in my place?”
17775: 
17776: The hurried directness with which she spoke—the absence of all her
17777: little airs, as if she were only concerned to use the time in getting
17778: an answer that would guide her, made her appeal unspeakably touching.
17779: 
17780: Deronda said, “I should feel something of what you feel—deep sorrow.”
17781: 
17782: “But what would you try to do?” said Gwendolen, with urgent quickness.
17783: 
17784: “Order my life so as to make any possible amends, and keep away from
17785: doing any sort of injury again,” said Deronda, catching her sense that
17786: the time for speech was brief.
17787: 
17788: “But I can’t—I can’t; I must go on,” said Gwendolen, in a passionate
17789: loud whisper. “I have thrust out others—I have made my gain out of
17790: their loss—tried to make it—tried. And I must go on. I can’t alter
17791: it.”
17792: 
17793: It was impossible to answer this instantaneously. Her words had
17794: confirmed his conjecture, and the situation of all concerned rose in
17795: swift images before him. His feeling for those who had been thrust out
17796: sanctioned her remorse; he could not try to nullify it, yet his heart
17797: was full of pity for her. But as soon as he could he answered—taking
17798: up her last words,
17799: 
17800: “That is the bitterest of all—to wear the yoke of our own wrong-doing.
17801: But if you submitted to that as men submit to maiming or life-long
17802: incurable disease?—and made the unalterable wrong a reason for more
17803: effort toward a good, that may do something to counterbalance the evil?
17804: One who has committed irremediable errors may be scourged by that
17805: consciousness into a higher course than is common. There are many
17806: examples. Feeling what it is to have spoiled one life may well make us
17807: long to save other lives from being spoiled.”
17808: 
17809: “But you have not wronged any one, or spoiled their lives,” said
17810: Gwendolen, hastily. “It is only others who have wronged _you_.”
17811: 
17812: Deronda colored slightly, but said immediately—“I suppose our keen
17813: feeling for ourselves might end in giving us a keen feeling for others,
17814: if, when we are suffering acutely, we were to consider that others go
17815: through the same sharp experience. That is a sort of remorse before
17816: commission. Can’t you understand that?”
17817: 
17818: “I think I do—now,” said Gwendolen. “But you were right—I _am_
17819: selfish. I have never thought much of any one’s feelings, except my
17820: mother’s. I have not been fond of people. But what can I do?” she went
17821: on, more quickly. “I must get up in the morning and do what every one
17822: else does. It is all like a dance set beforehand. I seem to see all
17823: that can be—and I am tired and sick of it. And the world is all
17824: confusion to me”—she made a gesture of disgust. “You say I am
17825: ignorant. But what is the good of trying to know more, unless life were
17826: worth more?”
17827: 
17828: “This good,” said Deronda promptly, with a touch of indignant severity,
17829: which he was inclined to encourage as his own safeguard; “life _would_
17830: be worth more to you: some real knowledge would give you an interest in
17831: the world beyond the small drama of personal desires. It is the curse
17832: of your life—forgive me—of so many lives, that all passion is spent
17833: in that narrow round, for want of ideas and sympathies to make a larger
17834: home for it. Is there any single occupation of mind that you care about
17835: with passionate delight or even independent interest?”
17836: 
17837: Deronda paused, but Gwendolen, looking startled and thrilled as by an
17838: electric shock, said nothing, and he went on more insistently,
17839: 
17840: “I take what you said of music for a small example—it answers for all
17841: larger things—you will not cultivate it for the sake of a private joy
17842: in it. What sort of earth or heaven would hold any spiritual wealth in
17843: it for souls pauperized by inaction? If one firmament has no stimulus
17844: for our attention and awe, I don’t see how four would have it. We
17845: should stamp every possible world with the flatness of our own
17846: inanity—which is necessarily impious, without faith or fellowship. The
17847: refuge you are needing from personal trouble is the higher, the
17848: religious life, which holds an enthusiasm for something more than our
17849: own appetites and vanities. The few may find themselves in it simply by
17850: an elevation of feeling; but for us who have to struggle for our
17851: wisdom, the higher life must be a region in which the affections are
17852: clad with knowledge.”
17853: 
17854: The half-indignant remonstrance that vibrated in Deronda’s voice came,
17855: as often happens, from the habit of inward argument with himself rather
17856: than from severity toward Gwendolen: but it had a more beneficial
17857: effect on her than any soothings. Nothing is feebler than the indolent
17858: rebellion of complaint; and to be roused into self-judgment is
17859: comparative activity. For the moment she felt like a shaken
17860: child—shaken out of its wailing into awe, and she said humbly,
17861: 
17862: “I will try. I will think.”
17863: 
17864: They both stood silent for a minute, as if some third presence had
17865: arrested them,—for Deronda, too, was under that sense of pressure
17866: which is apt to come when our own winged words seem to be hovering
17867: around us,—till Gwendolen began again,
17868: 
17869: “You said affection was the best thing, and I have hardly any—none
17870: about me. If I could, I would have mamma; but that is impossible.
17871: Things have changed to me so—in such a short time. What I used not to
17872: like I long for now. I think I am almost getting fond of the old things
17873: now they are gone.” Her lip trembled.
17874: 
17875: “Take the present suffering as a painful letting in of light,” said
17876: Deronda, more gently. “You are conscious of more beyond the round of
17877: your own inclinations—you know more of the way in which your life
17878: presses on others, and their life on yours. I don’t think you could
17879: have escaped the painful process in some form or other.”
17880: 
17881: “But it is a very cruel form,” said Gwendolen, beating her foot on the
17882: ground with returning agitation. “I am frightened at everything. I am
17883: frightened at myself. When my blood is fired I can do daring
17884: things—take any leap; but that makes me frightened at myself.” She was
17885: looking at nothing outside her; but her eyes were directed toward the
17886: window, away from Deronda, who, with quick comprehension said,
17887: 
17888: “Turn your fear into a safeguard. Keep your dread fixed on the idea of
17889: increasing that remorse which is so bitter to you. Fixed meditation may
17890: do a great deal toward defining our longing or dread. We are not always
17891: in a state of strong emotion, and when we are calm we can use our
17892: memories and gradually change the bias of our fear, as we do our
17893: tastes. Take your fear as a safeguard. It is like quickness of hearing.
17894: It may make consequences passionately present to you. Try to take hold
17895: of your sensibility, and use it as if it were a faculty, like vision.”
17896: Deronda uttered each sentence more urgently; he felt as if he were
17897: seizing a faint chance of rescuing her from some indefinite danger.
17898: 
17899: “Yes, I know; I understand what you mean,” said Gwendolen in her loud
17900: whisper, not turning her eyes, but lifting up her small gloved hand and
17901: waving it in deprecation of the notion that it was easy to obey that
17902: advice. “But if feelings rose—there are some feelings—hatred and
17903: anger—how can I be good when they keep rising? And if there came a
17904: moment when I felt stifled and could bear it no longer——” She broke
17905: off, and with agitated lips looked at Deronda, but the expression on
17906: his face pierced her with an entirely new feeling. He was under the
17907: baffling difficulty of discerning that what he had been urging on her
17908: was thrown into the pallid distance of mere thought before the outburst
17909: of her habitual emotion. It was as if he saw her drowning while his
17910: limbs were bound. The pained compassion which was spread over his
17911: features as he watched her, affected her with a compunction unlike any
17912: she had felt before, and in a changed and imploring tone she said,
17913: 
17914: “I am grieving you. I am ungrateful. You _can_ help me. I will think of
17915: everything. I will try. Tell me—it will not be a pain to you that I
17916: have dared to speak of my trouble to you? You began it, you know, when
17917: you rebuked me.” There was a melancholy smile on her lips as she said
17918: that, but she added more entreatingly, “It will not be a pain to you?”
17919: 
17920: “Not if it does anything to save you from an evil to come,” said
17921: Deronda, with strong emphasis; “otherwise, it will be a lasting pain.”
17922: 
17923: “No—no—it shall not be. It may be—it shall be better with me because
17924: I have known you.” She turned immediately, and quitted the room.
17925: 
17926: When she was on the first landing of the staircase, Sir Hugo passed
17927: across the hall on his way to the library, and saw her. Grandcourt was
17928: not with him.
17929: 
17930: Deronda, when the baronet entered, was standing in his ordinary
17931: attitude, grasping his coat-collar, with his back to the table, and
17932: with that indefinable expression by which we judge that a man is still
17933: in the shadow of a scene which he has just gone through. He moved,
17934: however, and began to arrange the letters.
17935: 
17936: “Has Mrs. Grandcourt been in here?” said Sir Hugo.
17937: 
17938: “Yes, she has.”
17939: 
17940: “Where are the others?”
17941: 
17942: “I believe she left them somewhere in the grounds.”
17943: 
17944: After a moment’s silence, in which Sir Hugo looked at a letter without
17945: reading it, he said “I hope you are not playing with fire, Dan—you
17946: understand me?”
17947: 
17948: “I believe I do, sir,” said Deronda, after a slight hesitation, which
17949: had some repressed anger in it. “But there is nothing answering to your
17950: metaphor—no fire, and therefore no chance of scorching.”
17951: 
17952: Sir Hugo looked searchingly at him, and then said, “So much the better.
17953: For, between ourselves, I fancy there may be some hidden gunpowder in
17954: that establishment.”
17955: 
17956: 
17957: 
17958: 
17959: CHAPTER XXXVII.
17960: 
17961:   _Aspern._    Pardon, my lord—I speak for Sigismund.
17962:   _Fronsberg._ For him? Oh, ay—for him I always hold
17963:                A pardon safe in bank, sure he will draw
17964:                Sooner or later on me. What his need?
17965:                Mad project broken? fine mechanic wings
17966:                That would not fly? durance, assault on watch,
17967:                Bill for Epernay, not a crust to eat?
17968:   _Aspern._    Oh, none of these, my lord; he has escaped
17969:                From Circe’s herd, and seeks to win the love
17970:                Of your fair ward Cecilia: but would win
17971:                First your consent. You frown.
17972:   _Fronsberg._                         Distinguish words.
17973:                I said I held a pardon, not consent.
17974: 
17975: 
17976: In spite of Deronda’s reasons for wishing to be in town again—reasons
17977: in which his anxiety for Mirah was blent with curiosity to know more of
17978: the enigmatic Mordecai—he did not manage to go up before Sir Hugo, who
17979: preceded his family that he might be ready for the opening of
17980: Parliament on the sixth of February. Deronda took up his quarters in
17981: Park Lane, aware that his chambers were sufficiently tenanted by Hans
17982: Meyrick. This was what he expected; but he found other things not
17983: altogether according to his expectations.
17984: 
17985: Most of us remember Retzsch’s drawing of destiny in the shape of
17986: Mephistopheles playing at chess with man for his soul, a game in which
17987: we may imagine the clever adversary making a feint of unintended moves
17988: so as to set the beguiled mortal on carrying his defensive pieces away
17989: from the true point of attack. The fiend makes preparation his favorite
17990: object of mockery, that he may fatally persuade us against our taking
17991: out waterproofs when he is well aware the sky is going to clear,
17992: foreseeing that the imbecile will turn this delusion into a prejudice
17993: against waterproofs instead of giving a closer study to the
17994: weather-signs. It is a peculiar test of a man’s mettle when, after he
17995: has painfully adjusted himself to what seems a wise provision, he finds
17996: all his mental precaution a little beside the mark, and his excellent
17997: intentions no better than miscalculated dovetails, accurately cut from
17998: a wrong starting-point. His magnanimity has got itself ready to meet
17999: misbehavior, and finds quite a different call upon it. Something of
18000: this kind happened to Deronda.
18001: 
18002: His first impression was one of pure pleasure and amusement at finding
18003: his sitting-room transformed into an _atelier_ strewed with
18004: miscellaneous drawings and with the contents of two chests from Rome,
18005: the lower half of the windows darkened with baize, and the blonde Hans
18006: in his weird youth as the presiding genius of the littered place—his
18007: hair longer than of old, his face more whimsically creased, and his
18008: high voice as usual getting higher under the excitement of rapid talk.
18009: The friendship of the two had been kept up warmly since the memorable
18010: Cambridge time, not only by correspondence but by little episodes of
18011: companionship abroad and in England, and the original relation of
18012: confidence on one side and indulgence on the other had been developed
18013: in practice, as is wont to be the case where such spiritual borrowing
18014: and lending has been well begun.
18015: 
18016: “I knew you would like to see my casts and antiquities,” said Hans,
18017: after the first hearty greetings and inquiries, “so I didn’t scruple to
18018: unlade my chests here. But I’ve found two rooms at Chelsea not many
18019: hundred yards from my mother and sisters, and I shall soon be ready to
18020: hang out there—when they’ve scraped the walls and put in some new
18021: lights. That’s all I’m waiting for. But you see I don’t wait to begin
18022: work: you can’t conceive what a great fellow I’m going to be. The seed
18023: of immortality has sprouted within me.”
18024: 
18025: “Only a fungoid growth, I dare say—a growing disease in the lungs,”
18026: said Deronda, accustomed to treat Hans in brotherly fashion. He was
18027: walking toward some drawings propped on the ledge of his bookcases;
18028: five rapidly-sketched heads—different aspects of the same face. He
18029: stood at a convenient distance from them, without making any remark.
18030: Hans, too, was silent for a minute, took up his palette and began
18031: touching the picture on his easel.
18032: 
18033: “What do you think of them?” he said at last.
18034: 
18035: “The full face looks too massive; otherwise the likenesses are good,”
18036: said Deronda, more coldly than was usual with him.
18037: 
18038: “No, it is not too massive,” said Hans, decisively. “I have noted that.
18039: There is always a little surprise when one passes from the profile to
18040: the full face. But I shall enlarge her scale for Berenice. I am making
18041: a Berenice series—look at the sketches along there—and now I think of
18042: it, you are just the model I want for the Agrippa.” Hans, still with
18043: pencil and palette in hand, had moved to Deronda’s side while he said
18044: this, but he added hastily, as if conscious of a mistake, “No, no, I
18045: forgot; you don’t like sitting for your portrait, confound you!
18046: However, I’ve picked up a capital Titus. There are to be five in the
18047: series. The first is Berenice clasping the knees of Gessius Florus and
18048: beseeching him to spare her people; I’ve got that on the easel. Then,
18049: this, where she is standing on the Xystus with Agrippa, entreating the
18050: people not to injure themselves by resistance.”
18051: 
18052: “Agrippa’s legs will never do,” said Deronda.
18053: 
18054: “The legs are good realistically,” said Hans, his face creasing drolly;
18055: “public men are often shaky about the legs—’ Their legs, the emblem of
18056: their various thought,’ as somebody says in the _Rehearsal._”
18057: 
18058: “But these are as impossible as the legs of Raphael’s Alcibiades,” said
18059: Deronda.
18060: 
18061: “Then they are good ideally,” said Hans. “Agrippa’s legs were possibly
18062: bad; I idealize that and make them impossibly bad. Art, my Eugenius,
18063: must intensify. But never mind the legs now: the third sketch in the
18064: series is Berenice exulting in the prospects of being Empress of Rome,
18065: when the news has come that Vespasian is declared Emperor and her lover
18066: Titus his successor.”
18067: 
18068: “You must put a scroll in her mouth, else people will not understand
18069: that. You can’t tell that in a picture.”
18070: 
18071: “It will make them feel their ignorance then—an excellent æsthetic
18072: effect. The fourth is, Titus sending Berenice away from Rome after she
18073: has shared his palace for ten years—both reluctant, both sad—_invitus
18074: invitam_, as Suetonius hath it. I’ve found a model for the Roman brute.”
18075: 
18076: “Shall you make Berenice look fifty? She must have been that.”
18077: 
18078: “No, no; a few mature touches to show the lapse of time. Dark-eyed
18079: beauty wears well, hers particularly. But now, here is the fifth:
18080: Berenice seated lonely on the ruins of Jerusalem. That is pure
18081: imagination. That is what ought to have been—perhaps was. Now, see how
18082: I tell a pathetic negative. Nobody knows what became of her—that is
18083: finely indicated by the series coming to a close. There is no sixth
18084: picture.” Here Hans pretended to speak with a gasping sense of
18085: sublimity, and drew back his head with a frown, as if looking for a
18086: like impression on Deronda. “I break off in the Homeric style. The
18087: story is chipped off, so to speak, and passes with a ragged edge into
18088: nothing—_le néant_; can anything be more sublime, especially in
18089: French? The vulgar would desire to see her corpse and burial—perhaps
18090: her will read and her linen distributed. But now come and look at this
18091: on the easel. I have made some way there.”
18092: 
18093: “That beseeching attitude is really good,” said Deronda, after a
18094: moment’s contemplation. “You have been very industrious in the
18095: Christmas holidays; for I suppose you have taken up the subject since
18096: you came to London.” Neither of them had yet mentioned Mirah.
18097: 
18098: “No,” said Hans, putting touches to his picture, “I made up my mind to
18099: the subject before. I take that lucky chance for an augury that I am
18100: going to burst on the world as a great painter. I saw a splendid woman
18101: in the Trastevere—the grandest women there are half Jewesses—and she
18102: set me hunting for a fine situation of a Jewess at Rome. Like other men
18103: of vast learning, I ended by taking what lay on the surface. I’ll show
18104: you a sketch of the Trasteverina’s head when I can lay my hands on it.”
18105: 
18106: “I should think she would be a more suitable model for Berenice,” said
18107: Deronda, not knowing exactly how to express his discontent.
18108: 
18109: “Not a bit of it. The model ought to be the most beautiful Jewess in
18110: the world, and I have found her.”
18111: 
18112: “Have you made yourself sure that she would like to figure in that
18113: character? I should think no woman would be more abhorrent to her. Does
18114: she quite know what you are doing?”
18115: 
18116: “Certainly. I got her to throw herself precisely into this attitude.
18117: Little mother sat for Gessius Florus, and Mirah clasped her knees.”
18118: Here Hans went a little way off and looked at the effect of his touches.
18119: 
18120: “I dare say she knows nothing about Berenice’s history,” said Deronda,
18121: feeling more indignation than he would have been able to justify.
18122: 
18123: “Oh, yes, she does—ladies’ edition. Berenice was a fervid patriot, but
18124: was beguiled by love and ambition into attaching herself to the
18125: arch-enemy of her people. Whence the Nemesis. Mirah takes it as a
18126: tragic parable, and cries to think what the penitent Berenice suffered
18127: as she wandered back to Jerusalem and sat desolate amidst desolation.
18128: That was her own phrase. I couldn’t find it in my heart to tell her I
18129: invented that part of the story.”
18130: 
18131: “Show me your Trasteverina,” said Deronda, chiefly in order to hinder
18132: himself from saying something else.
18133: 
18134: “Shall you mind turning over that folio?” said Hans. “My studies of
18135: heads are all there. But they are in confusion. You will perhaps find
18136: her next to a crop-eared undergraduate.”
18137: 
18138: After Deronda had been turning over the drawings a minute or two, he
18139: said,
18140: 
18141: “These seem to be all Cambridge heads and bits of country. Perhaps I
18142: had better begin at the other end.”
18143: 
18144: “No; you’ll find her about the middle. I emptied one folio into
18145: another.”
18146: 
18147: “Is this one of your undergraduates?” said Deronda, holding up a
18148: drawing. “It’s an unusually agreeable face.”
18149: 
18150: “That! Oh, that’s a man named Gascoigne—Rex Gascoigne. An uncommonly
18151: good fellow; his upper lip, too, is good. I coached him before he got
18152: his scholarship. He ought to have taken honors last Easter. But he was
18153: ill, and has had to stay up another year. I must look him up. I want to
18154: know how he’s going on.”
18155: 
18156: “Here she is, I suppose,” said Deronda, holding up a sketch of the
18157: Trasteverina.
18158: 
18159: “Ah,” said Hans, looking at it rather contemptuously, “too coarse. I
18160: was unregenerate then.”
18161: 
18162: Deronda was silent while he closed the folio, leaving the Trasteverina
18163: outside. Then clasping his coat-collar, and turning toward Hans, he
18164: said, “I dare say my scruples are excessive, Meyrick, but I must ask
18165: you to oblige me by giving up this notion.”
18166: 
18167: Hans threw himself into a tragic attitude, and screamed, “What! my
18168: series—my immortal Berenice series? Think of what you are saying,
18169: man—destroying, as Milton says, not a life but an immortality. Wait
18170: before you answer, that I may deposit the implements of my art and be
18171: ready to uproot my hair.”
18172: 
18173: Here Hans laid down his pencil and palette, threw himself backward into
18174: a great chair, and hanging limply over the side, shook his long hair
18175: over his face, lifted his hooked fingers on each side his head, and
18176: looked up with comic terror at Deronda, who was obliged to smile, as he
18177: said,
18178: 
18179: “Paint as many Berenices as you like, but I wish you could feel with
18180: me—perhaps you will, on reflection—that you should choose another
18181: model.”
18182: 
18183: “Why?” said Hans, standing up, and looking serious again.
18184: 
18185: “Because she may get into such a position that her face is likely to be
18186: recognized. Mrs. Meyrick and I are anxious for her that she should be
18187: known as an admirable singer. It is right, and she wishes it, that she
18188: should make herself independent. And she has excellent chances. One
18189: good introduction is secured already, and I am going to speak to
18190: Klesmer. Her face may come to be very well known, and—well, it is
18191: useless to attempt to explain, unless you feel as I do. I believe that
18192: if Mirah saw the circumstances clearly, she would strongly object to
18193: being exhibited in this way—to allowing herself to be used as a model
18194: for a heroine of this sort.”
18195: 
18196: As Hans stood with his thumbs in the belt of his blouse, listening to
18197: this speech, his face showed a growing surprise melting into amusement,
18198: that at last would have its way in an explosive laugh: but seeing that
18199: Deronda looked gravely offended, he checked himself to say, “Excuse my
18200: laughing, Deronda. You never gave me an advantage over you before. If
18201: it had been about anything but my own pictures, I should have swallowed
18202: every word because you said it. And so you actually believe that I
18203: should get my five pictures hung on the line in a conspicuous position,
18204: and carefully studied by the public? Zounds, man! cider-cup and conceit
18205: never gave me half such a beautiful dream. My pictures are likely to
18206: remain as private as the utmost hypersensitiveness could desire.”
18207: 
18208: Hans turned to paint again as a way of filling up awkward pauses.
18209: Deronda stood perfectly still, recognizing his mistake as to publicity,
18210: but also conscious that his repugnance was not much diminished. He was
18211: the reverse of satisfied either with himself or with Hans; but the
18212: power of being quiet carries a man well through moments of
18213: embarrassment. Hans had a reverence for his friend which made him feel
18214: a sort of shyness at Deronda’s being in the wrong; but it was not in
18215: his nature to give up anything readily, though it were only a whim—or
18216: rather, especially if it were a whim, and he presently went on,
18217: painting the while,
18218: 
18219: “But even supposing I had a public rushing after my pictures as if they
18220: were a railway series including nurses, babies and bonnet-boxes, I
18221: can’t see any justice in your objection. Every painter worth
18222: remembering has painted the face he admired most, as often as he could.
18223: It is a part of his soul that goes out into his pictures. He diffuses
18224: its influence in that way. He puts what he hates into a caricature. He
18225: puts what he adores into some sacred, heroic form. If a man could paint
18226: the woman he loves a thousand times as the _Stella Maris_ to put courage
18227: into the sailors on board a thousand ships, so much the more honor to
18228: her. Isn’t that better than painting a piece of staring immodesty and
18229: calling it by a worshipful name?”
18230: 
18231: “Every objection can be answered if you take broad ground enough, Hans:
18232: no special question of conduct can be properly settled in that way,”
18233: said Deronda, with a touch of peremptoriness. “I might admit all your
18234: generalities, and yet be right in saying you ought not to publish
18235: Mirah’s face as a model for Berenice. But I give up the question of
18236: publicity. I was unreasonable there.” Deronda hesitated a moment.
18237: “Still, even as a private affair, there might be good reasons for your
18238: not indulging yourself too much in painting her from the point of view
18239: you mention. You must feel that her situation at present is a very
18240: delicate one; and until she is in more independence, she should be kept
18241: as carefully as a bit of Venetian glass, for fear of shaking her out of
18242: the safe place she is lodged in. Are you quite sure of your own
18243: discretion? Excuse me, Hans. My having found her binds me to watch over
18244: her. Do you understand me?”
18245: 
18246: “Perfectly,” said Hans, turning his face into a good-humored smile.
18247: “You have the very justifiable opinion of me that I am likely to
18248: shatter all the glass in my way, and break my own skull into the
18249: bargain. Quite fair. Since I got into the scrape of being born,
18250: everything I have liked best has been a scrape either for myself or
18251: somebody else. Everything I have taken to heartily has somehow turned
18252: into a scrape. My painting is the last scrape; and I shall be all my
18253: life getting out of it. You think now I shall get into a scrape at
18254: home. No; I am regenerate. You think I must be over head and ears in
18255: love with Mirah. Quite right; so I am. But you think I shall scream and
18256: plunge and spoil everything. There you are mistaken—excusably, but
18257: transcendently mistaken. I have undergone baptism by immersion. Awe
18258: takes care of me. Ask the little mother.”
18259: 
18260: “You don’t reckon a hopeless love among your scrapes, then,” said
18261: Deronda, whose voice seemed to get deeper as Hans’s went higher.
18262: 
18263: “I don’t mean to call mine hopeless,” said Hans, with provoking
18264: coolness, laying down his tools, thrusting his thumbs into his belt,
18265: and moving away a little, as if to contemplate his picture more
18266: deliberately.
18267: 
18268: “My dear fellow, you are only preparing misery for yourself,” said
18269: Deronda, decisively. “She would not marry a Christian, even if she
18270: loved him. Have you heard her—of course you have—heard her speak of
18271: her people and her religion?”
18272: 
18273: “That can’t last,” said Hans. “She will see no Jew who is tolerable.
18274: Every male of that race is insupportable—‘insupportably
18275: advancing’—his nose.”
18276: 
18277: “She may rejoin her family. That is what she longs for. Her mother and
18278: brother are probably strict Jews.”
18279: 
18280: “I’ll turn proselyte, if she wishes it,” said Hans, with a shrug and a
18281: laugh.
18282: 
18283: “Don’t talk nonsense, Hans. I thought you professed a serious love for
18284: her,” said Deronda, getting heated.
18285: 
18286: “So I do. You think it desperate, but I don’t.”
18287: 
18288: “I know nothing; I can’t tell what has happened. We must be prepared
18289: for surprises. But I can hardly imagine a greater surprise to me than
18290: that there should have seemed to be anything in Mirah’s sentiments for
18291: you to found a romantic hope on.” Deronda felt that he was too
18292: contemptuous.
18293: 
18294: “I don’t found my romantic hopes on a woman’s sentiments,” said Hans,
18295: perversely inclined to be the merrier when he was addressed with
18296: gravity. “I go to science and philosophy for my romance. Nature
18297: designed Mirah to fall in love with me. The amalgamation of races
18298: demands it—the mitigation of human ugliness demands it—the affinity
18299: of contrasts assures it. I am the utmost contrast to Mirah—a bleached
18300: Christian, who can’t sing two notes in tune. Who has a chance against
18301: me?”
18302: 
18303: “I see now; it was all _persiflage_. You don’t mean a word you say,
18304: Meyrick,” said Deronda, laying his hand on Meyrick’s shoulder, and
18305: speaking in a tone of cordial relief. “I was a wiseacre to answer you
18306: seriously.”
18307: 
18308: “Upon my honor I do mean it, though,” said Hans, facing round and
18309: laying his left hand on Deronda’s shoulder, so that their eyes fronted
18310: each other closely. “I am at the confessional. I meant to tell you as
18311: soon as you came. My mother says you are Mirah’s guardian, and she
18312: thinks herself responsible to you for every breath that falls on Mirah
18313: in her house. Well, I love her—I worship her—I won’t despair—I mean
18314: to deserve her.”
18315: 
18316: “My dear fellow, you can’t do it,” said Deronda, quickly.
18317: 
18318: “I should have said, I mean to try.”
18319: 
18320: “You can’t keep your resolve, Hans. You used to resolve what you would
18321: do for your mother and sisters.”
18322: 
18323: “You have a right to reproach me, old fellow,” said Hans, gently.
18324: 
18325: “Perhaps I am ungenerous,” said Deronda, not apologetically, however.
18326: “Yet it can’t be ungenerous to warn you that you are indulging mad,
18327: Quixotic expectations.”
18328: 
18329: “Who will be hurt but myself, then?” said Hans, putting out his lip. “I
18330: am not going to say anything to her unless I felt sure of the answer. I
18331: dare not ask the oracles: I prefer a cheerful caliginosity, as Sir
18332: Thomas Browne might say. I would rather run my chance there and lose,
18333: than be sure of winning anywhere else. And I don’t mean to swallow the
18334: poison of despair, though you are disposed to thrust it on me. I am
18335: giving up wine, so let me get a little drunk on hope and vanity.”
18336: 
18337: “With all my heart, if it will do you any good,” said Deronda, loosing
18338: Hans’s shoulder, with a little push. He made his tone kindly, but his
18339: words were from the lip only. As to his real feeling he was silenced.
18340: 
18341: He was conscious of that peculiar irritation which will sometimes
18342: befall the man whom others are inclined to trust as a mentor—the
18343: irritation of perceiving that he is supposed to be entirely off the
18344: same plane of desire and temptation as those who confess to him. Our
18345: guides, we pretend, must be sinless: as if those were not often the
18346: best teachers who only yesterday got corrected for their mistakes.
18347: Throughout their friendship Deronda had been used to Hans’s egotism,
18348: but he had never before felt intolerant of it: when Hans, habitually
18349: pouring out his own feelings and affairs, had never cared for any
18350: detail in return, and, if he chanced to know any, had soon forgotten
18351: it. Deronda had been inwardly as well as outwardly indulgent—nay,
18352: satisfied. But now he had noted with some indignation, all the stronger
18353: because it must not be betrayed, Hans’s evident assumption that for any
18354: danger of rivalry or jealousy in relation to Mirah, Deronda was not as
18355: much out of the question as the angel Gabriel. It is one thing to be
18356: resolute in placing one’s self out of the question, and another to
18357: endure that others should perform that exclusion for us. He had
18358: expected that Hans would give him trouble: what he had not expected was
18359: that the trouble would have a strong element of personal feeling. And
18360: he was rather ashamed that Hans’s hopes caused him uneasiness in spite
18361: of his well-warranted conviction that they would never be fulfilled.
18362: They had raised an image of Mirah changing; and however he might
18363: protest that the change would not happen, the protest kept up the
18364: unpleasant image. Altogether poor Hans seemed to be entering into
18365: Deronda’s experience in a disproportionate manner—going beyond his
18366: part of rescued prodigal, and rousing a feeling quite distinct from
18367: compassionate affection.
18368: 
18369: When Deronda went to Chelsea he was not made as comfortable as he ought
18370: to have been by Mrs. Meyrick’s evident release from anxiety about the
18371: beloved but incalculable son. Mirah seemed livelier than before, and
18372: for the first time he saw her laugh. It was when they were talking of
18373: Hans, he being naturally the mother’s first topic. Mirah wished to know
18374: if Deronda had seen Mr. Hans going through a sort of character piece
18375: without changing his dress.
18376: 
18377: “He passes from one figure to another as if he were a bit of flame
18378: where you fancied the figures without seeing them,” said Mirah, full of
18379: her subject; “he is so wonderfully quick. I used never to like comic
18380: things on the stage—they were dwelt on too long; but all in one minute
18381: Mr. Hans makes himself a blind bard, and then Rienzi addressing the
18382: Romans, and then an opera-dancer, and then a desponding young
18383: gentleman—I am sorry for them all, and yet I laugh, all in one”—here
18384: Mirah gave a little laugh that might have entered into a song.
18385: 
18386: “We hardly thought that Mirah could laugh till Hans came,” said Mrs.
18387: Meyrick, seeing that Deronda, like herself, was observing the pretty
18388: picture.
18389: 
18390: “Hans seems in great force just now,” said Deronda in a tone of
18391: congratulation. “I don’t wonder at his enlivening you.”
18392: 
18393: “He’s been just perfect ever since he came back,” said Mrs. Meyrick,
18394: keeping to herself the next clause—“if it will but last.”
18395: 
18396: “It is a great happiness,” said Mirah, “to see the son and brother come
18397: into this dear home. And I hear them all talk about what they did
18398: together when they were little. That seems like heaven, and to have a
18399: mother and brother who talk in that way. I have never had it.”
18400: 
18401: “Nor I,” said Deronda, involuntarily.
18402: 
18403: “No?” said Mirah, regretfully. “I wish you had. I wish you had had
18404: every good.” The last words were uttered with a serious ardor as if
18405: they had been part of a litany, while her eyes were fixed on Deronda,
18406: who with his elbow on the back of his chair was contemplating her by
18407: the new light of the impression she had made on Hans, and the
18408: possibility of her being attracted by that extraordinary contrast. It
18409: was no more than what had happened on each former visit of his, that
18410: Mirah appeared to enjoy speaking of what she felt very much as a little
18411: girl fresh from school pours forth spontaneously all the long-repressed
18412: chat for which she has found willing ears. For the first time in her
18413: life Mirah was among those whom she entirely trusted, and her original
18414: visionary impression that Deronda was a divinely-sent messenger hung
18415: about his image still, stirring always anew the disposition to reliance
18416: and openness. It was in this way she took what might have been the
18417: injurious flattery of admiring attention into which her helpless
18418: dependence had been suddenly transformed. Every one around her watched
18419: for her looks and words, and the effect on her was simply that of
18420: having passed from a trifling imprisonment into an exhilarating air
18421: which made speech and action a delight. To her mind it was all a gift
18422: from others’ goodness. But that word of Deronda’s implying that there
18423: had been some lack in his life which might be compared with anything
18424: she had known in hers, was an entirely new inlet of thought about him.
18425: After her first expression of sorrowful surprise she went on,
18426: 
18427: “But Mr. Hans said yesterday that you thought so much of others you
18428: hardly wanted anything for yourself. He told us a wonderful story of
18429: Buddha giving himself to the famished tigress to save her and her
18430: little ones from starving. And he said you were like Buddha. That is
18431: what we all imagine of you.”
18432: 
18433: “Pray don’t imagine that,” said Deronda, who had lately been finding
18434: such suppositions rather exasperating. “Even if it were true that I
18435: thought so much of others, it would not follow that I had no wants for
18436: myself. When Buddha let the tigress eat him he might have been very
18437: hungry himself.”
18438: 
18439: “Perhaps if he was starved he would not mind so much about being
18440: eaten,” said Mab, shyly.
18441: 
18442: “Please don’t think that, Mab; it takes away the beauty of the action,”
18443: said Mirah.
18444: 
18445: “But if it were true, Mirah?” said the rational Amy, having a
18446: half-holiday from her teaching; “you always take what is beautiful as
18447: if it were true.”
18448: 
18449: “So it is,” said Mirah, gently. “If people have thought what is the
18450: most beautiful and the best thing, it must be true. It is always there.”
18451: 
18452: “Now, Mirah, what do you mean?” said Amy.
18453: 
18454: “I understand her,” said Deronda, coming to the rescue.
18455: 
18456: “It is a truth in thought though it may never have been carried out in
18457: action. It lives as an idea. Is that it?” He turned to Mirah, who was
18458: listening with a blind look in her lovely eyes.
18459: 
18460: “It must be that, because you understand me, but I cannot quite
18461: explain,” said Mirah, rather abstractedly—still searching for some
18462: expression.
18463: 
18464: “But _was_ it beautiful for Buddha to let the tiger eat him?” said Amy,
18465: changing her ground. “It would be a bad pattern.”
18466: 
18467: “The world would get full of fat tigers,” said Mab.
18468: 
18469: Deronda laughed, but defended the myth. “It is like a passionate word,”
18470: he said; “the exaggeration is a flash of fervor. It is an extreme image
18471: of what is happening every day—the transmutation of self.”
18472: 
18473: “I think I can say what I mean, now,” said Mirah, who had not heard the
18474: intermediate talk. “When the best thing comes into our thoughts, it is
18475: like what my mother has been to me. She has been just as really with me
18476: as all the other people about me—often more really with me.”
18477: 
18478: Deronda, inwardly wincing under this illustration, which brought other
18479: possible realities about that mother vividly before him, presently
18480: turned the conversation by saying, “But we must not get too far away
18481: from practical matters. I came, for one thing, to tell of an interview
18482: I had yesterday, which I hope Mirah will find to have been useful to
18483: her. It was with Klesmer, the great pianist.”
18484: 
18485: “Ah?” said Mrs. Meyrick, with satisfaction. “You think he will help
18486: her?”
18487: 
18488: “I hope so. He is very much occupied, but has promised to fix a time
18489: for receiving and hearing Miss Lapidoth, as we must learn to call
18490: her”—here Deronda smiled at Mirah—“If she consents to go to him.”
18491: 
18492: “I shall be very grateful,” said Mirah. “He wants to hear me sing,
18493: before he can judge whether I ought to be helped.”
18494: 
18495: Deronda was struck with her plain sense about these matters of
18496: practical concern.
18497: 
18498: “It will not be at all trying to you, I hope, if Mrs. Meyrick will
18499: kindly go with you to Klesmer’s house.”
18500: 
18501: “Oh, no, not at all trying. I have been doing that all my life—I mean,
18502: told to do things that others may judge of me. And I have gone through
18503: a bad trial of that sort. I am prepared to bear it, and do some very
18504: small thing. Is Klesmer a severe man?”
18505: 
18506: “He is peculiar, but I have not had experience enough of him to know
18507: whether he would be what you would call severe.”
18508: 
18509: “I know he is kind-hearted—kind in action, if not in speech.”
18510: 
18511: “I have been used to be frowned at and not praised,” said Mirah.
18512: 
18513: “By the by, Klesmer frowns a good deal,” said Deronda, “but there is
18514: often a sort of smile in his eyes all the while. Unhappily he wears
18515: spectacles, so you must catch him in the right light to see the smile.”
18516: 
18517: “I shall not be frightened,” said Mirah. “If he were like a roaring
18518: lion, he only wants me to sing. I shall do what I can.”
18519: 
18520: “Then I feel sure you will not mind being invited to sing in Lady
18521: Mallinger’s drawing-room,” said Deronda. “She intends to ask you next
18522: month, and will invite many ladies to hear you, who are likely to want
18523: lessons from you for their daughters.”
18524: 
18525: “How fast we are mounting!” said Mrs. Meyrick, with delight. “You never
18526: thought of getting grand so quickly, Mirah.”
18527: 
18528: “I am a little frightened at being called Miss Lapidoth,” said Mirah,
18529: coloring with a new uneasiness. “Might I be called Cohen?”
18530: 
18531: “I understand you,” said Deronda, promptly. “But I assure you, you must
18532: not be called Cohen. The name is inadmissible for a singer. This is one
18533: of the trifles in which we must conform to vulgar prejudice. We could
18534: choose some other name, however—such as singers ordinarily choose—an
18535: Italian or Spanish name, which would suit your _physique_.” To Deronda
18536: just now the name Cohen was equivalent to the ugliest of yellow badges.
18537: 
18538: Mirah reflected a little, anxiously, then said, “No. If Cohen will not
18539: do, I will keep the name I have been called by. I will not hide myself.
18540: I have friends to protect me. And now—if my father were very miserable
18541: and wanted help—no,” she said, looking at Mrs. Meyrick, “I should
18542: think, then, that he was perhaps crying as I used to see him, and had
18543: nobody to pity him, and I had hidden myself from him. He had none
18544: belonging to him but me. Others that made friends with him always left
18545: him.”
18546: 
18547: “Keep to what you feel right, my dear child,” said Mrs. Meyrick. “_I_
18548: would not persuade you to the contrary.” For her own part she had no
18549: patience or pity for that father, and would have left him to his crying.
18550: 
18551: Deronda was saying to himself, “I am rather base to be angry with Hans.
18552: How can he help being in love with her? But it is too absurdly
18553: presumptuous for him even to frame the idea of appropriating her, and a
18554: sort of blasphemy to suppose that she could possibly give herself to
18555: him.”
18556: 
18557: What would it be for Daniel Deronda to entertain such thoughts? He was
18558: not one who could quite naively introduce himself where he had just
18559: excluded his friend, yet it was undeniable that what had just happened
18560: made a new stage in his feeling toward Mirah. But apart from other
18561: grounds for self-repression, reasons both definite and vague made him
18562: shut away that question as he might have shut up a half-opened writing
18563: that would have carried his imagination too far, and given too much
18564: shape to presentiments. Might there not come a disclosure which would
18565: hold the missing determination of his course? What did he really know
18566: about his origin? Strangely in these latter months when it seemed right
18567: that he should exert his will in the choice of a destination, the
18568: passion of his nature had got more and more locked by this uncertainty.
18569: The disclosure might bring its pain, indeed the likelihood seemed to
18570: him to be all on that side; but if it helped him to make his life a
18571: sequence which would take the form of duty—if it saved him from having
18572: to make an arbitrary selection where he felt no preponderance of
18573: desire? Still more, he wanted to escape standing as a critic outside
18574: the activities of men, stiffened into the ridiculous attitude of
18575: self-assigned superiority. His chief tether was his early inwrought
18576: affection for Sir Hugo, making him gratefully deferential to wishes
18577: with which he had little agreement: but gratitude had been sometimes
18578: disturbed by doubts which were near reducing it to a fear of being
18579: ungrateful. Many of us complain that half our birthright is sharp duty:
18580: Deronda was more inclined to complain that he was robbed of this half;
18581: yet he accused himself, as he would have accused another, of being
18582: weakly self-conscious and wanting in resolve. He was the reverse of
18583: that type painted for us in Faulconbridge and Edmund of Gloster, whose
18584: coarse ambition for personal success is inflamed by a defiance of
18585: accidental disadvantages. To Daniel the words Father and Mother had the
18586: altar-fire in them; and the thought of all closest relations of our
18587: nature held still something of the mystic power which had made his neck
18588: and ears burn in boyhood. The average man may regard this sensibility
18589: on the question of birth as preposterous and hardly credible; but with
18590: the utmost respect for his knowledge as the rock from which all other
18591: knowledge is hewn, it must be admitted that many well-proved facts are
18592: dark to the average man, even concerning the action of his own heart
18593: and the structure of his own retina. A century ago he and all his
18594: forefathers had not had the slightest notion of that electric discharge
18595: by means of which they had all wagged their tongues mistakenly; any
18596: more than they were awake to the secluded anguish of exceptional
18597: sensitiveness into which many a carelessly-begotten child of man is
18598: born.
18599: 
18600: Perhaps the ferment was all the stronger in Deronda’s mind because he
18601: had never had a confidant to whom he could open himself on these
18602: delicate subjects. He had always been leaned on instead of being
18603: invited to lean. Sometimes he had longed for the sort of friend to whom
18604: he might possibly unfold his experience: a young man like himself who
18605: sustained a private grief and was not too confident about his own
18606: career; speculative enough to understand every moral difficulty, yet
18607: socially susceptible, as he himself was, and having every outward sign
18608: of equality either in bodily or spiritual wrestling—for he had found
18609: it impossible to reciprocate confidences with one who looked up to him.
18610: But he had no expectation of meeting the friend he imagined. Deronda’s
18611: was not one of those quiveringly-poised natures that lend themselves to
18612: second-sight.
18613: 
18614: 
18615: 
18616: 
18617: CHAPTER XXXVIII.
18618: 
18619:     There be who hold that the deeper tragedy were a Prometheus Bound
18620:     not _after_ but _before_ he had well got the celestial fire into
18621:     the νάρθηξ whereby it might be conveyed to mortals: thrust by the
18622:     Kratos and Bia of instituted methods into a solitude of despised
18623:     ideas, fastened in throbbing helplessness by the fatal pressure of
18624:     poverty and disease—a solitude where many pass by, but none
18625:     regard.
18626: 
18627: “Second-sight” is a flag over disputed ground. But it is matter of
18628: knowledge that there are persons whose yearnings, conceptions—nay,
18629: traveled conclusions—continually take the form of images which have a
18630: foreshadowing power; the deed they would do starts up before them in
18631: complete shape, making a coercive type; the event they hunger for or
18632: dread rises into vision with a seed-like growth, feeding itself fast on
18633: unnumbered impressions. They are not always the less capable of the
18634: argumentative process, nor less sane than the commonplace calculators
18635: of the market: sometimes it may be that their natures have manifold
18636: openings, like the hundred-gated Thebes, where there may naturally be a
18637: greater and more miscellaneous inrush than through a narrow
18638: beadle-watched portal. No doubt there are abject specimens of the
18639: visionary, as there is a minim mammal which you might imprison in the
18640: finger of your glove. That small relative of the elephant has no harm
18641: in him; but what great mental or social type is free from specimens
18642: whose insignificance is both ugly and noxious? One is afraid to think
18643: of all that the genus “patriot” embraces; or of the elbowing there
18644: might be at the day of judgment for those who ranked as authors, and
18645: brought volumes either in their hands or on trucks.
18646: 
18647: This apology for inevitable kinship is meant to usher in some facts
18648: about Mordecai, whose figure had bitten itself into Deronda’s mind as a
18649: new question which he felt an interest in getting answered. But the
18650: interest was no more than a vaguely-expectant suspense: the
18651: consumptive-looking Jew, apparently a fervid student of some kind,
18652: getting his crust by a quiet handicraft, like Spinoza, fitted into none
18653: of Deronda’s anticipations.
18654: 
18655: It was otherwise with the effect of their meeting on Mordecai. For many
18656: winters, while he had been conscious of an ebbing physical life, and as
18657: widening spiritual loneliness, all his passionate desire had
18658: concentrated itself in the yearning for some young ear into which he
18659: could pour his mind as a testament, some soul kindred enough to accept
18660: the spiritual product of his own brief, painful life, as a mission to
18661: be executed. It was remarkable that the hopefulness which is often the
18662: beneficent illusion of consumptive patients, was in Mordecai wholly
18663: diverted from the prospect of bodily recovery and carried into the
18664: current of this yearning for transmission. The yearning, which had
18665: panted upward from out of over-whelming discouragements, had grown into
18666: a hope—the hope into a confident belief, which, instead of being
18667: checked by the clear conception he had of his hastening decline, took
18668: rather the intensity of expectant faith in a prophecy which has only
18669: brief space to get fulfilled in.
18670: 
18671: Some years had now gone since he had first begun to measure men with a
18672: keen glance, searching for a possibility which became more and more a
18673: distinct conception. Such distinctness as it had at first was reached
18674: chiefly by a method of contrast: he wanted to find a man who differed
18675: from himself. Tracing reasons in that self for the rebuffs he had met
18676: with and the hindrances that beset him, he imagined a man who would
18677: have all the elements necessary for sympathy with him, but in an
18678: embodiment unlike his own: he must be a Jew, intellectually cultured,
18679: morally fervid—in all this a nature ready to be plenished from
18680: Mordecai’s; but his face and frame must be beautiful and strong, he
18681: must have been used to all the refinements of social life, his voice
18682: must flow with a full and easy current, his circumstances be free from
18683: sordid need: he must glorify the possibilities of the Jew, not sit and
18684: wonder as Mordecai did, bearing the stamp of his people amid the sign
18685: of poverty and waning breath. Sensitive to physical characteristics, he
18686: had, both abroad and in England, looked at pictures as well as men, and
18687: in a vacant hour he had sometimes lingered in the National Gallery in
18688: search of paintings which might feed his hopefulness with grave and
18689: noble types of the human form, such as might well belong to men of his
18690: own race. But he returned in disappointment. The instances are
18691: scattered but thinly over the galleries of Europe, in which the fortune
18692: or selection even of the chief masters has given to art a face at once
18693: young, grand, and beautiful, where, if there is any melancholy, it is
18694: no feeble passivity, but enters into the foreshadowed capability of
18695: heroism.
18696: 
18697: Some observant persons may perhaps remember his emaciated figure, and
18698: dark eyes deep in their sockets, as he stood in front of a picture that
18699: had touched him either to new or habitual meditation: he commonly wore
18700: a cloth cap with black fur round it, which no painter would have asked
18701: him to take off. But spectators would be likely to think of him as an
18702: odd-looking Jew who probably got money out of pictures; and Mordecai,
18703: when he looked at them, was perfectly aware of the impression he made.
18704: Experience had rendered him morbidly alive to the effect of a man’s
18705: poverty and other physical disadvantages in cheapening his ideas,
18706: unless they are those of a Peter the Hermit who has a tocsin for the
18707: rabble. But he was too sane and generous to attribute his spiritual
18708: banishment solely to the excusable prejudices of others; certain
18709: incapacities of his own had made the sentence of exclusion; and hence
18710: it was that his imagination had constructed another man who would be
18711: something more ample than the second soul bestowed, according to the
18712: notion of the Cabalists, to help out the insufficient first—who would
18713: be a blooming human life, ready to incorporate all that was worthiest
18714: in an existence whose visible, palpable part was burning itself fast
18715: away. His inward need for the conception of this expanded, prolonged
18716: self was reflected as an outward necessity. The thoughts of his heart
18717: (that ancient phrase best shadows the truth) seemed to him too
18718: precious, too closely interwoven with the growth of things not to have
18719: a further destiny. And as the more beautiful, the stronger, the more
18720: executive self took shape in his mind, he loved it beforehand with an
18721: affection half identifying, half contemplative and grateful.
18722: 
18723: Mordecai’s mind wrought so constantly in images, that his coherent
18724: trains of thought often resembled the significant dreams attributed to
18725: sleepers by waking persons in their most inventive moments: nay, they
18726: often resembled genuine dreams in their way of breaking off the passage
18727: from the known to the unknown. Thus, for a long while, he habitually
18728: thought of the Being answering to his need as one distantly approaching
18729: or turning his back toward him, darkly painted against a golden sky.
18730: The reason of the golden sky lay in one of Mordecai’s habits. He was
18731: keenly alive to some poetic aspects of London; and a favorite resort of
18732: his, when strength and leisure allowed, was to some of the bridges,
18733: especially about sunrise or sunset. Even when he was bending over
18734: watch-wheels and trinkets, or seated in a small upper room looking out
18735: on dingy bricks and dingy cracked windows, his imagination
18736: spontaneously planted him on some spot where he had a far-stretching
18737: scene; his thoughts went on in wide spaces; and whenever he could, he
18738: tried to have in reality the influences of a large sky. Leaning on the
18739: parapet of Blackfriar’s Bridge, and gazing meditatively, the breadth
18740: and calm of the river, with its long vista half hazy, half luminous,
18741: the grand dim masses of tall forms of buildings which were the signs of
18742: world-commerce, the oncoming of boats and barges from the still
18743: distance into sound and color, entered into his mood and blent
18744: themselves indistinguishably with his thinking, as a fine symphony to
18745: which we can hardly be said to listen, makes a medium that bears up our
18746: spiritual wings. Thus it happened that the figure representative of
18747: Mordecai’s longing was mentally seen darkened by the excess of light in
18748: the aerial background. But in the inevitable progress of his
18749: imagination toward fuller detail, he ceased to see the figure with its
18750: back toward him. It began to advance, and a face became discernible;
18751: the words youth, beauty, refinement, Jewish birth, noble gravity,
18752: turned into hardly individual but typical form and color: gathered from
18753: his memory of faces seen among the Jews of Holland and Bohemia, and
18754: from the paintings which revived that memory. Reverently let it be said
18755: of this mature spiritual need that it was akin to the boy’s and girl’s
18756: picturing of the future beloved; but the stirrings of such young desire
18757: are feeble compared with the passionate current of an ideal life
18758: straining to embody itself, made intense by resistance to imminent
18759: dissolution. The visionary form became a companion and auditor; keeping
18760: a place not only in the waking imagination, but in those dreams of
18761: lighter slumber of which it is truest to say, “I sleep, but my heart
18762: waketh”—when the disturbing trivial story of yesterday is charged with
18763: the impassioned purpose of years.
18764: 
18765: Of late the urgency of irremediable time, measured by the gradual
18766: choking of life, had turned Mordecai’s trust into an agitated watch for
18767: the fulfillment that must be at hand. Was the bell on the verge of
18768: tolling, the sentence about to be executed? The deliverer’s footstep
18769: must be near—the deliverer who was to rescue Mordecai’s spiritual
18770: travail from oblivion, and give it an abiding-place in the best
18771: heritage of his people. An insane exaggeration of his own value, even
18772: if his ideas had been as true and precious as those of Columbus or
18773: Newton, many would have counted this yearning, taking it as the
18774: sublimer part for a man to say, “If not I, then another,” and to hold
18775: cheap the meaning of his own life. But the fuller nature desires to be
18776: an agent, to create, and not merely to look on: strong love hungers to
18777: bless, and not merely to behold blessing. And while there is warmth
18778: enough in the sun to feed an energetic life, there will still be men to
18779: feel, “I am lord of this moment’s change, and will charge it with my
18780: soul.”
18781: 
18782: But with that mingling of inconsequence which belongs to us all, and
18783: not unhappily, since it saves us from many effects of mistake,
18784: Mordecai’s confidence in the friend to come did not suffice to make him
18785: passive, and he tried expedients, pathetically humble, such as happened
18786: to be within his reach, for communicating something of himself. It was
18787: now two years since he had taken up his abode under Ezra Cohen’s roof,
18788: where he was regarded with much good-will as a compound of workman,
18789: dominie, vessel of charity, inspired idiot, man of piety, and (if he
18790: were inquired into) dangerous heretic. During that time little Jacob
18791: had advanced into knickerbockers, and into that quickness of
18792: apprehension which has been already made manifest in relation to
18793: hardware and exchange. He had also advanced in attachment to Mordecai,
18794: regarding him as an inferior, but liking him none the worse, and taking
18795: his helpful cleverness as he might have taken the services of an
18796: enslaved Djinn. As for Mordecai, he had given Jacob his first lessons,
18797: and his habitual tenderness easily turned into the teacher’s
18798: fatherhood. Though he was fully conscious of the spiritual distance
18799: between the parents and himself, and would never have attempted any
18800: communication to them from his peculiar world, the boy moved him with
18801: that idealizing affection which merges the qualities of the individual
18802: child in the glory of childhood and the possibilities of a long future.
18803: And this feeling had drawn him on, at first without premeditation, and
18804: afterward with conscious purpose, to a sort of outpouring in the ear of
18805: the boy which might have seemed wild enough to any excellent man of
18806: business who overheard it. But none overheard when Jacob went up to
18807: Mordecai’s room one day, for example, in which there was little work to
18808: be done, or at an hour when the work was ended, and after a brief
18809: lesson in English reading or in numeration, was induced to remain
18810: standing at his teacher’s knees, or chose to jump astride them, often
18811: to the patient fatigue of the wasted limbs. The inducement was perhaps
18812: the mending of a toy, or some little mechanical device in which
18813: Mordecai’s well-practiced finger-tips had an exceptional skill; and
18814: with the boy thus tethered, he would begin to repeat a Hebrew poem of
18815: his own, into which years before he had poured his first youthful
18816: ardors for that conception of a blended past and future which was the
18817: mistress of his soul, telling Jacob to say the words after him.
18818: 
18819: “The boy will get them engraved within him,” thought Mordecai; “it is a
18820: way of printing.”
18821: 
18822: None readier than Jacob at this fascinating game of imitating
18823: unintelligible words; and if no opposing diversion occurred he would
18824: sometimes carry on his share in it as long as the teacher’s breath
18825: would last out. For Mordecai threw into each repetition the fervor
18826: befitting a sacred occasion. In such instances, Jacob would show no
18827: other distraction than reaching out and surveying the contents of his
18828: pockets; or drawing down the skin of his cheeks to make his eyes look
18829: awful, and rolling his head to complete the effect; or alternately
18830: handling his own nose and Mordecai’s as if to test the relation of
18831: their masses. Under all this the fervid reciter would not pause,
18832: satisfied if the young organs of speech would submit themselves. But
18833: most commonly a sudden impulse sent Jacob leaping away into some antic
18834: or active amusement, when, instead of following the recitation he would
18835: return upon the foregoing words most ready to his tongue, and mouth or
18836: gabble, with a see-saw suited to the action of his limbs, a verse on
18837: which Mordecai had spent some of his too scanty heart’s blood. Yet he
18838: waited with such patience as a prophet needs, and began his strange
18839: printing again undiscouraged on the morrow, saying inwardly,
18840: 
18841: “My words may rule him some day. Their meaning may flash out on him. It
18842: is so with a nation—after many days.”
18843: 
18844: Meanwhile Jacob’s sense of power was increased and his time enlivened
18845: by a store of magical articulation with which he made the baby crow, or
18846: drove the large cat into a dark corner, or promised himself to frighten
18847: any incidental Christian of his own years. One week he had
18848: unfortunately seen a street mountebank, and this carried off his
18849: muscular imitativeness in sad divergence from New Hebrew poetry, after
18850: the model of Jehuda ha-Levi. Mordecai had arrived at a fresh passage in
18851: his poem; for as soon as Jacob had got well used to one portion, he was
18852: led on to another, and a fresh combination of sounds generally answered
18853: better in keeping him fast for a few minutes. The consumptive voice,
18854: generally a strong high baritone, with its variously mingling
18855: hoarseness, like a haze amidst illuminations, and its occasional
18856: incipient gasp had more than the usual excitement, while it gave forth
18857: Hebrew verses with a meaning something like this:
18858: 
18859:   “Away from me the garment of forgetfulness.
18860:   Withering the heart;
18861:   The oil and wine from presses of the Goyim,
18862:   Poisoned with scorn.
18863:   Solitude is on the sides of Mount Nebo,
18864:   In its heart a tomb:
18865:   There the buried ark and golden cherubim
18866:   Make hidden light:
18867:   There the solemn gaze unchanged,
18868:   The wings are spread unbroken:
18869:   Shut beneath in silent awful speech
18870:   The Law lies graven.
18871:   Solitude and darkness are my covering,
18872:   And my heart a tomb;
18873:   Smite and shatter it, O Gabriel!
18874:   Shatter it as the clay of the founder
18875:   Around the golden image.”
18876: 
18877: In the absorbing enthusiasm with which Mordecai had intoned rather than
18878: spoken this last invocation, he was unconscious that Jacob had ceased
18879: to follow him and had started away from his knees; but pausing he saw,
18880: as by a sudden flash, that the lad had thrown himself on his hands with
18881: his feet in the air, mountebank fashion, and was picking up with his
18882: lips a bright farthing which was a favorite among his pocket treasures.
18883: This might have been reckoned among the tricks Mordecai was used to,
18884: but at this moment it jarred him horribly, as if it had been a Satanic
18885: grin upon his prayer.
18886: 
18887: “Child! child!” he called out with a strange cry that startled Jacob to
18888: his feet, and then he sank backward with a shudder, closing his eyes.
18889: 
18890: “What?” said Jacob, quickly. Then, not getting an immediate answer, he
18891: pressed Mordecai’s knees with a shaking movement, in order to rouse
18892: him. Mordecai opened his eyes with a fierce expression in them, leaned
18893: forward, grasped the little shoulders, and said in a quick, hoarse
18894: whisper,
18895: 
18896: “A curse is on your generation, child. They will open the mountain and
18897: drag forth the golden wings and coin them into money, and the solemn
18898: faces they will break up into earrings for wanton women! And they
18899: shall get themselves a new name, but the angel of ignominy, with the
18900: fiery brand, shall know them, and their heart shall be the tomb of dead
18901: desires that turn their life to rottenness.”
18902: 
18903: The aspect and action of Mordecai were so new and mysterious to
18904: Jacob—they carried such a burden of obscure threat—it was as if the
18905: patient, indulgent companion had turned into something unknown and
18906: terrific: the sunken dark eyes and hoarse accents close to him, the
18907: thin grappling fingers, shook Jacob’s little frame into awe, and while
18908: Mordecai was speaking he stood trembling with a sense that the house
18909: was tumbling in and they were not going to have dinner any more. But
18910: when the terrible speech had ended and the pinch was relaxed, the shock
18911: resolved itself into tears; Jacob lifted up his small patriarchal
18912: countenance and wept aloud. This sign of childish grief at once
18913: recalled Mordecai to his usual gentle self: he was not able to speak
18914: again at present, but with a maternal action he drew the curly head
18915: toward him and pressed it tenderly against his breast. On this Jacob,
18916: feeling the danger well-nigh over, howled at ease, beginning to imitate
18917: his own performance and improve upon it—a sort of transition from
18918: impulse into art often observable. Indeed, the next day he undertook to
18919: terrify Adelaide Rebekah in like manner, and succeeded very well.
18920: 
18921: But Mordecai suffered a check which lasted long, from the consciousness
18922: of a misapplied agitation; sane as well as excitable, he judged
18923: severely his moments of aberration into futile eagerness, and felt
18924: discredited with himself. All the more his mind was strained toward the
18925: discernment of that friend to come, with whom he would have a calm
18926: certainty of fellowship and understanding.
18927: 
18928: It was just then that, in his usual midday guardianship of the old
18929: book-shop, he was struck by the appearance of Deronda, and it is
18930: perhaps comprehensible now why Mordecai’s glance took on a sudden eager
18931: interest as he looked at the new-comer: he saw a face and frame which
18932: seemed to him to realize the long-conceived type. But the disclaimer of
18933: Jewish birth was for the moment a backward thrust of double severity,
18934: the particular disappointment tending to shake his confidence in the
18935: more indefinite expectation. Nevertheless, when he found Deronda seated
18936: at the Cohens’ table, the disclaimer was for the moment nullified: the
18937: first impression returned with added force, seeming to be guaranteed by
18938: this second meeting under circumstance more peculiar than the former;
18939: and in asking Deronda if he knew Hebrew, Mordecai was so possessed by
18940: the new inrush of belief, that he had forgotten the absence of any
18941: other condition to the fulfillment of his hopes. But the answering “No”
18942: struck them all down again, and the frustration was more painful than
18943: before. After turning his back on the visitor that Sabbath evening,
18944: Mordecai went through days of a deep discouragement, like that of men
18945: on a doomed ship, who having strained their eyes after a sail, and
18946: beheld it with rejoicing, behold it never advance, and say, “Our sick
18947: eyes make it.” But the long-contemplated figure had come as an
18948: emotional sequence of Mordecai’s firmest theoretic convictions; it had
18949: been wrought from the imagery of his most passionate life; and it
18950: inevitably reappeared—reappeared in a more specific self-asserting
18951: form than ever. Deronda had that sort of resemblance to the
18952: preconceived type which a finely individual bust or portrait has to the
18953: more generalized copy left in our minds after a long interval: we renew
18954: our memory with delight, but we hardly know with how much correction.
18955: And now, his face met Mordecai’s inward gaze as it had always belonged
18956: to the awaited friend, raying out, moreover, some of that influence
18957: which belongs to breathing flesh; till by-and-by it seemed that
18958: discouragement had turned into a new obstinacy of resistance, and the
18959: ever-recurrent vision had the force of an outward call to disregard
18960: counter-evidence, and keep expectation awake. It was Deronda now who
18961: was seen in the often painful night-watches, when we are all liable to
18962: be held with the clutch of a single thought—whose figure, never with
18963: its back turned, was seen in moments of soothed reverie or soothed
18964: dozing, painted on that golden sky which was the doubly blessed symbol
18965: of advancing day and of approaching rest.
18966: 
18967: Mordecai knew that the nameless stranger was to come and redeem his
18968: ring; and, in spite of contrary chances, the wish to see him again was
18969: growing into a belief that he should see him. In the January weeks, he
18970: felt an increasing agitation of that subdued hidden quality which
18971: hinders nervous people from any steady occupation on the eve of an
18972: anticipated change. He could not go on with his printing of Hebrew on
18973: little Jacob’s mind; or with his attendance at a weekly club, which was
18974: another effort of the same forlorn hope: something else was coming. The
18975: one thing he longed for was to get as far as the river, which he could
18976: do but seldom and with difficulty. He yearned with a poet’s yearning
18977: for the wide sky, the far-reaching vista of bridges, the tender and
18978: fluctuating lights on the water which seems to breathe with a life that
18979: can shiver and mourn, be comforted and rejoice.

18984: CHAPTER XXXIX.
18985: 
18986: 
18987:   “Vor den Wissenden sich stellen,
18988:   Sicher ist’s in allen Fällen!
18989:   Wenn du lange dich gequälet,
18990:   Weiß er gleich, wo dir es fehlet.
18991:   Auch auf Beifall darfst du hoffen;
18992:   Denn er weiß, wo du’s getroffen.”
18993: 
18994:            —GOETHE: _West-östlicher Divan_.
18995: 
18996: 
18997: Momentous things happened to Deronda the very evening of that visit to
18998: the small house at Chelsea, when there was the discussion about Mirah’s
18999: public name. But for the family group there, what appeared to be the
19000: chief sequence connected with it occurred two days afterward. About
19001: four o’clock wheels paused before the door, and there came one of those
19002: knocks with an accompanying ring which serve to magnify the sense of
19003: social existence in a region where the most enlivening signals are
19004: usually those of the muffin-man. All the girls were at home, and the
19005: two rooms were thrown together to make space for Kate’s drawing, as
19006: well as a great length of embroidery which had taken the place of the
19007: satin cushions—a sort of _pièce de résistance_ in the courses of
19008: needlework, taken up by any clever fingers that happened to be at
19009: liberty. It stretched across the front room picturesquely enough, Mrs.
19010: Meyrick bending over it on one corner, Mab in the middle, and Amy at
19011: the other end. Mirah, whose performances in point of sewing were on the
19012: make-shift level of the tailor-bird’s, her education in that branch
19013: having been much neglected, was acting as reader to the party, seated
19014: on a camp-stool; in which position she also served Kate as model for a
19015: title-page vignette, symbolizing a fair public absorbed in the
19016: successive volumes of the family tea-table. She was giving forth with
19017: charming distinctness the delightful Essay of Elia, “The Praise of
19018: Chimney-Sweeps,” and all were smiling over the “innocent blackness,”
19019: when the imposing knock and ring called their thoughts to loftier
19020: spheres, and they looked up in wonderment.
19021: 
19022: “Dear me!” said Mrs. Meyrick; “can it be Lady Mallinger? Is there a
19023: grand carriage, Amy?”
19024: 
19025: “No—only a hansom cab. It must be a gentleman.”
19026: 
19027: “The Prime Minister, I should think,” said Kate dryly. “Hans says the
19028: greatest man in London may get into a hansom cab.”
19029: 
19030: “Oh, oh, oh!” cried Mab. “Suppose it should be Lord Russell!”
19031: 
19032: The five bright faces were all looking amused when the old maid-servant
19033: bringing in a card distractedly left the parlor-door open, and there
19034: was seen bowing toward Mrs. Meyrick a figure quite unlike that of the
19035: respected Premier—tall and physically impressive even in his kid and
19036: kerseymere, with massive face, flamboyant hair, and gold spectacles: in
19037: fact, as Mrs. Meyrick saw from the card, _Julius Klesmer_.
19038: 
19039: Even embarrassment could hardly have made the “little mother” awkward,
19040: but quick in her perceptions she was at once aware of the situation,
19041: and felt well satisfied that the great personage had come to Mirah
19042: instead of requiring her to come to him; taking it as a sign of active
19043: interest. But when he entered, the rooms shrank into closets, the
19044: cottage piano, Mab thought, seemed a ridiculous toy, and the entire
19045: family existence as petty and private as an establishment of mice in
19046: the Tuileries. Klesmer’s personality, especially his way of glancing
19047: round him, immediately suggested vast areas and a multitudinous
19048: audience, and probably they made the usual scenery of his
19049: consciousness, for we all of us carry on our thinking in some habitual
19050: locus where there is a presence of other souls, and those who take in a
19051: larger sweep than their neighbors are apt to seem mightily vain and
19052: affected. Klesmer was vain, but not more so than many contemporaries of
19053: heavy aspect, whose vanity leaps out and startles one like a spear out
19054: of a walking-stick; as to his carriage and gestures, these were as
19055: natural to him as the length of his fingers; and the rankest
19056: affectation he could have shown would have been to look diffident and
19057: demure. While his grandiose air was making Mab feel herself a
19058: ridiculous toy to match the cottage piano, he was taking in the details
19059: around him with a keen and thoroughly kind sensibility. He remembered a
19060: home no longer than this on the outskirts of Bohemia; and in the
19061: figurative Bohemia too he had had large acquaintance with the variety
19062: and romance which belong to small incomes. He addressed Mrs. Meyrick
19063: with the utmost deference.
19064: 
19065: “I hope I have not taken too great a freedom. Being in the
19066: neighborhood, I ventured to save time by calling. Our friend, Mr.
19067: Deronda, mentioned to me an understanding that I was to have the honor
19068: of becoming acquainted with a young lady here—Miss Lapidoth.”
19069: 
19070: Klesmer had really discerned Mirah in the first moment of entering,
19071: but, with subtle politeness, he looked round bowingly at the three
19072: sisters as if he were uncertain which was the young lady in question.
19073: 
19074: “Those are my daughters: this is Miss Lapidoth,” said Mrs. Meyrick,
19075: waving her hand toward Mirah.
19076: 
19077: “Ah,” said Klesmer, in a tone of gratified expectation, turning a
19078: radiant smile and deep bow to Mirah, who, instead of being in the least
19079: taken by surprise, had a calm pleasure in her face. She liked the look
19080: of Klesmer, feeling sure that he would scold her, like a great musician
19081: and a kind man.
19082: 
19083: “You will not object to beginning our acquaintance by singing to me,”
19084: he added, aware that they would all be relieved by getting rid of
19085: preliminaries.
19086: 
19087: “I shall be very glad. It is good of you to be willing to listen to
19088: me,” said Mirah, moving to the piano. “Shall I accompany myself?”
19089: 
19090: “By all means,” said Klesmer, seating himself, at Mrs. Meyrick’s
19091: invitation, where he could have a good view of the singer. The acute
19092: little mother would not have acknowledged the weakness, but she really
19093: said to herself, “He will like her singing better if he sees her.”
19094: 
19095: All the feminine hearts except Mirah’s were beating fast with anxiety,
19096: thinking Klesmer terrific as he sat with his listening frown on, and
19097: only daring to look at him furtively. If he did say anything severe it
19098: would be so hard for them all. They could only comfort themselves with
19099: thinking that Prince Camaralzaman, who had heard the finest things,
19100: preferred Mirah’s singing to any other: also she appeared to be doing
19101: her very best, as if she were more instead of less at ease than usual.
19102: 
19103: The song she had chosen was a fine setting of some words selected from
19104: Leopardi’s grand Ode to Italy:,
19105: 
19106:   “_O patria mia, vedo le mura c gli archi
19107:   E le colonne e i simula-cri e l’erme
19108:   Torridegli avi nostri_”,
19109: 
19110: This was recitative: then followed,
19111: 
19112:   “_Ma la gloria—non vedo_”,
19113: 
19114: a mournful melody, a rhythmic plaint. After this came a climax of
19115: devout triumph—passing from the subdued adoration of a happy Andante
19116: in the words,
19117: 
19118:   “_Beatissimi voi.
19119:   Che offriste il petto alle nemiche lance
19120:   Per amor di costei che al sol vi diede_”,
19121: 
19122: to the joyous outburst of an exultant Allegro in,
19123: 
19124:         “_Oh viva, oh viva:
19125:   Beatissimi voi
19126:   Mentre nel monde si favelli o scriva._”
19127: 
19128: When she had ended, Klesmer said after a moment,
19129: 
19130: “That is old Leo’s music.”
19131: 
19132: “Yes, he was my last master—at Vienna: so fierce and so good,” said
19133: Mirah, with a melancholy smile. “He prophesied that my voice would not
19134: do for the stage. And he was right.”
19135: 
19136: “_Con_tinue, if you please,” said Klesmer, putting out his lips and
19137: shaking his long fingers, while he went on with a smothered
19138: articulation quite unintelligible to the audience.
19139: 
19140: The three girls detested him unanimously for not saying one word of
19141: praise. Mrs. Meyrick was a little alarmed.
19142: 
19143: Mirah, simply bent on doing what Klesmer desired, and imagining that he
19144: would now like to hear her sing some German, went through Prince
19145: Radzivill’s music to Gretchen’s songs in the _Faust_, one after the
19146: other without any interrogatory pause. When she had finished he rose
19147: and walked to the extremity of the small space at command, then walked
19148: back to the piano, where Mirah had risen from her seat and stood
19149: looking toward him with her little hands crossed before her, meekly
19150: awaiting judgment; then with a sudden unknitting of his brow and with
19151: beaming eyes, he stretched out his hand and said abruptly, “Let us
19152: shake hands: you are a musician.”
19153: 
19154: Mab felt herself beginning to cry, and all the three girls held Klesmer
19155: adorable. Mrs. Meyrick took a long breath.
19156: 
19157: But straightway the frown came again, the long hand, back uppermost,
19158: was stretched out in quite a different sense to touch with finger-tip
19159: the back of Mirah’s, and with protruded lip he said,
19160: 
19161: “Not for great tasks. No high roofs. We are no skylarks. We must be
19162: modest.” Klesmer paused here. And Mab ceased to think him adorable: “as
19163: if Mirah had shown the least sign of conceit!”
19164: 
19165: Mirah was silent, knowing that there was a specific opinion to be
19166: waited for, and Klesmer presently went on—“I would not advise—I would
19167: not further your singing in any larger space than a private
19168: drawing-room. But you will do there. And here in London that is one of
19169: the best careers open. Lessons will follow. Will you come and sing at a
19170: private concert at my house on Wednesday?”
19171: 
19172: “Oh, I shall be grateful,” said Mirah, putting her hands together
19173: devoutly. “I would rather get my bread in that way than by anything
19174: more public. I will try to improve. What should I work at most?”
19175: 
19176: Klesmer made a preliminary answer in noises which sounded like words
19177: bitten in two and swallowed before they were half out, shaking his
19178: fingers the while, before he said, quite distinctly, “I shall introduce
19179: you to Astorga: he is the foster-father of good singing and will give
19180: you advice.” Then addressing Mrs. Meyrick, he added, “Mrs. Klesmer will
19181: call before Wednesday, with your permission.”
19182: 
19183: “We shall feel that to be a great kindness,” said Mrs. Meyrick.
19184: 
19185: “You will sing to her,” said Klesmer, turning again to Mirah. “She is a
19186: thorough musician, and has a soul with more ears to it than you will
19187: often get in a musician. Your singing will satisfy her:
19188: 
19189:   ‘Vor den Wissenden sich stellen;’
19190: 
19191: you know the rest?”
19192: 
19193:   “‘Sicher ist’s in allen Fällen.’”
19194: 
19195: said Mirah, promptly. And Klesmer saying “Schön!” put out his hand
19196: again as a good-by.
19197: 
19198: He had certainly chosen the most delicate way of praising Mirah, and
19199: the Meyrick girls had now given him all their esteem. But imagine Mab’s
19200: feeling when suddenly fixing his eyes on her, he said decisively, “That
19201: young lady is musical, I see!” She was a mere blush and sense of
19202: scorching.
19203: 
19204: “Yes,” said Mirah, on her behalf. “And she has a touch.”
19205: 
19206: “Oh, please, Mirah—a scramble, not a touch,” said Mab, in anguish,
19207: with a horrible fear of what the next thing might be: this dreadful
19208: divining personage—evidently Satan in gray trousers—might order her
19209: to sit down to the piano, and her heart was like molten wax in the
19210: midst of her. But this was cheap payment for her amazed joy when
19211: Klesmer said benignantly, turning to Mrs. Meyrick, “Will she like to
19212: accompany Miss Lapidoth and hear the music on Wednesday?”
19213: 
19214: “There could hardly be a greater pleasure for her,” said Mrs. Meyrick.
19215: “She will be most glad and grateful.”
19216: 
19217: Thereupon Klesmer bowed round to the three sisters more grandly than
19218: they had ever been bowed to before. Altogether it was an amusing
19219: picture—the little room with so much of its diagonal taken up in
19220: Klesmer’s magnificent bend to the small feminine figures like images a
19221: little less than life-size, the grave Holbein faces on the walls, as
19222: many as were not otherwise occupied, looking hard at this stranger who
19223: by his face seemed a dignified contemporary of their own, but whose
19224: garments seemed a deplorable mockery of the human form.
19225: 
19226: Mrs. Meyrick could not help going out of the room with Klesmer and
19227: closing the door behind her. He understood her, and said with a
19228: frowning nod,
19229: 
19230: “She will do: if she doesn’t attempt too much and her voice holds out,
19231: she can make an income. I know that is the great point: Deronda told
19232: me. You are taking care of her. She looks like a good girl.”
19233: 
19234: “She is an angel,” said the warm-hearted woman.
19235: 
19236: “No,” said Klesmer, with a playful nod; “she is a pretty Jewess: the
19237: angels must not get the credit of her. But I think she has found a
19238: guardian angel,” he ended, bowing himself out in this amiable way.
19239: 
19240: The four young creatures had looked at each other mutely till the door
19241: banged and Mrs. Meyrick re-entered. Then there was an explosion. Mab
19242: clapped her hands and danced everywhere inconveniently; Mrs. Meyrick
19243: kissed Mirah and blessed her; Amy said emphatically, “We can never get
19244: her a new dress before Wednesday!” and Kate exclaimed, “Thank heaven my
19245: table is not knocked over!”
19246: 
19247: Mirah had reseated herself on the music-stool without speaking, and the
19248: tears were rolling down her cheeks as she looked at her friends.
19249: 
19250: “Now, now, Mab!” said Mrs. Meyrick; “come and sit down reasonably and
19251: let us talk?”
19252: 
19253: “Yes, let us talk,” said Mab, cordially, coming back to her low seat
19254: and caressing her knees. “I am beginning to feel large again. Hans said
19255: he was coming this afternoon. I wish he had been here—only there would
19256: have been no room for him. Mirah, what are you looking sad for?”
19257: 
19258: “I am too happy,” said Mirah. “I feel so full of gratitude to you all;
19259: and he was so very kind.”
19260: 
19261: “Yes, at last,” said Mab, sharply. “But he might have said something
19262: encouraging sooner. I thought him dreadfully ugly when he sat frowning,
19263: and only said, ‘_Con_tinue.’ I hated him all the long way from the top
19264: of his hair to the toe of his polished boot.”
19265: 
19266: “Nonsense, Mab; he has a splendid profile,” said Kate.
19267: 
19268: “_Now_, but not _then_. I cannot bear people to keep their minds
19269: bottled up for the sake of letting them off with a pop. They seem to
19270: grudge making you happy unless they can make you miserable beforehand.
19271: However, I forgive him everything,” said Mab, with a magnanimous air,
19272: “but he has invited me. I wonder why he fixed on me as the musical one?
19273: Was it because I have a bulging forehead, ma, and peep from under it
19274: like a newt from under a stone?”
19275: 
19276: “It was your way of listening to the singing, child,” said Mrs.
19277: Meyrick. “He has magic spectacles and sees everything through them,
19278: depend upon it. But what was that German quotation you were so ready
19279: with, Mirah—you learned puss?”
19280: 
19281: “Oh, that was not learning,” said Mirah, her tearful face breaking into
19282: an amused smile. “I said it so many times for a lesson. It means that
19283: it is safer to do anything—singing or anything else—before those who
19284: know and understand all about it.”
19285: 
19286: “That was why you were not one bit frightened, I suppose,” said Amy.
19287: “But now, what we have to talk about is a dress for you on Wednesday.”
19288: 
19289: “I don’t want anything better than this black merino,” said Mirah,
19290: rising to show the effect. “Some white gloves and some new _bottines_.”
19291: She put out her little foot, clad in the famous felt slipper.
19292: 
19293: “There comes Hans,” said Mrs. Meyrick. “Stand still, and let us hear
19294: what he says about the dress. Artists are the best people to consult
19295: about such things.”
19296: 
19297: “You don’t consult me, ma,” said Kate, lifting up her eyebrow with a
19298: playful complainingness. “I notice mothers are like the people I deal
19299: with—the girls’ doings are always priced low.”
19300: 
19301: “My dear child, the boys are such a trouble—we could never put up with
19302: them, if we didn’t make believe they were worth more,” said Mrs.
19303: Meyrick, just as her boy entered. “Hans, we want your opinion about
19304: Mirah’s dress. A great event has happened. Klesmer has been here, and
19305: she is going to sing at his house on Wednesday among grand people. She
19306: thinks this dress will do.”
19307: 
19308: “Let me see,” said Hans. Mirah in her childlike way turned toward him
19309: to be looked at; and he, going to a little further distance, knelt with
19310: one knee on a hassock to survey her.
19311: 
19312: “This would be thought a very good stage-dress for me,” she said,
19313: pleadingly, “in a part where I was to come on as a poor Jewess and sing
19314: to fashionable Christians.”
19315: 
19316: “It would be effective,” said Hans, with a considering air; “it would
19317: stand out well among the fashionable _chiffons_.”
19318: 
19319: “But you ought not to claim all the poverty on your side, Mirah,” said
19320: Amy. “There are plenty of poor Christians and dreadfully rich Jews and
19321: fashionable Jewesses.”
19322: 
19323: “I didn’t mean any harm,” said Mirah. “Only I have been used to
19324: thinking about my dress for parts in plays. And I almost always had a
19325: part with a plain dress.”
19326: 
19327: “That makes me think it questionable,” said Hans, who had suddenly
19328: become as fastidious and conventional on this occasion as he had
19329: thought Deronda was, apropos of the Berenice-pictures. “It looks a
19330: little too theatrical. We must not make you a _rôle_ of the poor
19331: Jewess—or of being a Jewess at all.” Hans had a secret desire to
19332: neutralize the Jewess in private life, which he was in danger of not
19333: keeping secret.
19334: 
19335: “But it is what I am really. I am not pretending anything. I shall
19336: never be anything else,” said Mirah. “I always feel myself a Jewess.”
19337: 
19338: “But we can’t feel that about you,” said Hans, with a devout look.
19339: “What does it signify whether a perfect woman is a Jewess or not?”
19340: 
19341: “That is your kind way of praising me; I never was praised so before,”
19342: said Mirah, with a smile, which was rather maddening to Hans and made
19343: him feel still more of a cosmopolitan.
19344: 
19345: “People don’t think of me as a British Christian,” he said, his face
19346: creasing merrily. “They think of me as an imperfectly handsome young
19347: man and an unpromising painter.”
19348: 
19349: “But you are wandering from the dress,” said Amy. “If that will not do,
19350: how are we to get another before Wednesday? and to-morrow Sunday?”
19351: 
19352: “Indeed this will do,” said Mirah, entreatingly. “It is all real, you
19353: know,” here she looked at Hans—“even if it seemed theatrical. Poor
19354: Berenice sitting on the ruins—any one might say that was theatrical,
19355: but I know that this is just what she would do.”
19356: 
19357: “I am a scoundrel,” said Hans, overcome by this misplaced trust. “That
19358: is my invention. Nobody knows that she did that. Shall you forgive me
19359: for not saying so before?”
19360: 
19361: “Oh, yes,” said Mirah, after a momentary pause of surprise. “You knew
19362: it was what she would be sure to do—a Jewess who had not been
19363: faithful—who had done what she did and was penitent. She could have no
19364: joy but to afflict herself; and where else would she go? I think it is
19365: very beautiful that you should enter so into what a Jewess would feel.”
19366: 
19367: “The Jewesses of that time sat on ruins,” said Hans, starting up with a
19368: sense of being checkmated. “That makes them convenient for pictures.”
19369: 
19370: “But the dress—the dress,” said Amy; “is it settled?”
19371: 
19372: “Yes; is it not?” said Mirah, looking doubtfully at Mrs. Meyrick, who
19373: in her turn looked up at her son, and said, “What do you think, Hans?”
19374: 
19375: “That dress will not do,” said Hans, decisively. “She is not going to
19376: sit on ruins. You must jump into a cab with her, little mother, and go
19377: to Regent Street. It’s plenty of time to get anything you like—a black
19378: silk dress such as ladies wear. She must not be taken for an object of
19379: charity. She has talents to make people indebted to her.”
19380: 
19381: “I think it is what Mr. Deronda would like—for her to have a handsome
19382: dress,” said Mrs. Meyrick, deliberating.
19383: 
19384: “Of course it is,” said Hans, with some sharpness. “You may take my
19385: word for what a gentleman would feel.”
19386: 
19387: “I wish to do what Mr. Deronda would like me to do,” said Mirah,
19388: gravely, seeing that Mrs. Meyrick looked toward her; and Hans, turning
19389: on his heel, went to Kate’s table and took up one of her drawings as if
19390: his interest needed a new direction.
19391: 
19392: “Shouldn’t you like to make a study of Klesmer’s head, Hans?” said
19393: Kate. “I suppose you have often seen him?”
19394: 
19395: “Seen him!” exclaimed Hans, immediately throwing back his head and
19396: mane, seating himself at the piano and looking round him as if he were
19397: surveying an amphitheatre, while he held his fingers down
19398: perpendicularly toward the keys. But then in another instant he wheeled
19399: round on the stool, looked at Mirah and said, half timidly—“Perhaps
19400: you don’t like this mimicry; you must always stop my nonsense when you
19401: don’t like it.”
19402: 
19403: Mirah had been smiling at the swiftly-made image, and she smiled still,
19404: but with a touch of something else than amusement, as she said—“Thank
19405: you. But you have never done anything I did not like. I hardly think he
19406: could, belonging to you,” she added, looking at Mrs. Meyrick.
19407: 
19408: In this way Hans got food for his hope. How could the rose help it when
19409: several bees in succession took its sweet odor as a sign of personal
19410: attachment?

19415: CHAPTER XL.
19416: 
19417:   “Within the soul a faculty abides,
19418:   That with interpositions, which would hide
19419:   And darken, so can deal, that they become
19420:   Contingencies of pomp; and serve to exalt
19421:   Her native brightness, as the ample moon,
19422:   In the deep stillness of a summer even,
19423:   Rising behind a thick and lofty grove,
19424:   Burns, like an unconsuming fire of light,
19425:   In the green trees; and, kindling on all sides
19426:   Their leafy umbrage, turns the dusky veil
19427:   Into a substance glorious as her own,
19428:   Yea, with her own incorporated, by power
19429:   Capacious and serene.”

19431: 
19432: 
19433: Deronda came out of the narrow house at Chelsea in a frame of mind that
19434: made him long for some good bodily exercise to carry off what he was
19435: himself inclined to call the fumes of his temper. He was going toward
19436: the city, and the sight of the Chelsea Stairs with the waiting boats at
19437: once determined him to avoid the irritating inaction of being driven in
19438: a cab, by calling a wherry and taking an oar.
19439: 
19440: His errand was to go to Ram’s book-shop, where he had yesterday arrived
19441: too late for Mordecai’s midday watch, and had been told that he
19442: invariably came there again between five and six. Some further
19443: acquaintance with this remarkable inmate of the Cohens was particularly
19444: desired by Deronda as a preliminary to redeeming his ring: he wished
19445: that their conversation should not again end speedily with that drop of
19446: Mordecai’s interest which was like the removal of a drawbridge, and
19447: threatened to shut out any easy communication in future. As he got
19448: warmed with the use of the oar, fixing his mind on the errand before
19449: him and the ends he wanted to achieve on Mirah’s account, he
19450: experienced, as was wont with him, a quick change of mental light,
19451: shifting his point of view to that of the person whom he had been
19452: thinking of hitherto chiefly as serviceable to his own purposes, and
19453: was inclined to taunt himself with being not much better than an
19454: enlisting sergeant, who never troubles himself with the drama that
19455: brings him the needful recruits.
19456: 
19457: “I suppose if I got from this man the information I am most anxious
19458: about,” thought Deronda, “I should be contented enough if he felt no
19459: disposition to tell me more of himself, or why he seemed to have some
19460: expectation from me which was disappointed. The sort of curiosity he
19461: stirs would die out; and yet it might be that he had neared and parted
19462: as one can imagine two ships doing, each freighted with an exile who
19463: would have recognized the other if the two could have looked out face
19464: to face. Not that there is any likelihood of a peculiar tie between me
19465: and this poor fellow, whose voyage, I fancy, must soon be over. But I
19466: wonder whether there is much of that momentous mutual missing between
19467: people who interchange blank looks, or even long for one another’s
19468: absence in a crowded place. However, one makes one’s self chances of
19469: missing by going on the recruiting sergeant’s plan.”
19470: 
19471: When the wherry was approaching Blackfriars Bridge, where Deronda meant
19472: to land, it was half-past four, and the gray day was dying gloriously,
19473: its western clouds all broken into narrowing purple strata before a
19474: wide-spreading saffron clearness, which in the sky had a monumental
19475: calm, but on the river, with its changing objects, was reflected as a
19476: luminous movement, the alternate flash of ripples or currents, the
19477: sudden glow of the brown sail, the passage of laden barges from
19478: blackness into color, making an active response to that brooding glory.
19479: 
19480: Feeling well heated by this time, Deronda gave up the oar and drew over
19481: him again his Inverness cape. As he lifted up his head while fastening
19482: the topmost button his eyes caught a well-remembered face looking
19483: toward him over the parapet of the bridge—brought out by the western
19484: light into startling distinctness and brilliancy—an illuminated type
19485: of bodily emaciation and spiritual eagerness. It was the face of
19486: Mordecai, who also, in his watch toward the west, had caught sight of
19487: the advancing boat, and had kept it fast within his gaze, at first
19488: simply because it was advancing, then with a recovery of impressions
19489: that made him quiver as with a presentiment, till at last the nearing
19490: figure lifted up its face toward him—the face of his visions—and then
19491: immediately, with white uplifted hand, beckoned again and again.
19492: 
19493: For Deronda, anxious that Mordecai should recognize and await him, had
19494: lost no time before signaling, and the answer came straightway.
19495: Mordecai lifted his cap and waved it—feeling in that moment that his
19496: inward prophecy was fulfilled. Obstacles, incongruities, all melted
19497: into the sense of completion with which his soul was flooded by this
19498: outward satisfaction of his longing. His exultation was not widely
19499: different from that of the experimenter, bending over the first
19500: stirrings of change that correspond to what in the fervor of
19501: concentrated prevision his thought has foreshadowed. The prefigured
19502: friend had come from the golden background, and had signaled to him:
19503: this actually was: the rest was to be.
19504: 
19505: In three minutes Deronda had landed, had paid his boatman, and was
19506: joining Mordecai, whose instinct it was to stand perfectly still and
19507: wait for him.
19508: 
19509: “I was very glad to see you standing here,” said Deronda, “for I was
19510: intending to go on to the book-shop and look for you again. I was there
19511: yesterday—perhaps they mentioned it to you?”
19512: 
19513: “Yes,” said Mordecai; “that was the reason I came to the bridge.”
19514: 
19515: This answer, made with simple gravity, was startlingly mysterious to
19516: Deronda. Were the peculiarities of this man really associated with any
19517: sort of mental alienation, according to Cohen’s hint?
19518: 
19519: “You knew nothing of my being at Chelsea?” he said, after a moment.
19520: 
19521: “No; but I expected you to come down the river. I have been waiting for
19522: you these five years.” Mordecai’s deep-sunk eyes were fixed on those of
19523: the friend who had at last arrived with a look of affectionate
19524: dependence, at once pathetic and solemn. Deronda’s sensitiveness was
19525: not the less responsive because he could not but believe that this
19526: strangely-disclosed relation was founded on an illusion.
19527: 
19528: “It will be a satisfaction to me if I can be of any real use to you,”
19529: he answered, very earnestly. “Shall we get into a cab and drive
19530: to—wherever you wish to go? You have probably had walking enough with
19531: your short breath.”
19532: 
19533: “Let us go to the book-shop. It will soon be time for me to be there.
19534: But now look up the river,” said Mordecai, turning again toward it and
19535: speaking in undertones of what may be called an excited calm—so
19536: absorbed by a sense of fulfillment that he was conscious of no barrier
19537: to a complete understanding between him and Deronda. “See the sky, how
19538: it is slowly fading. I have always loved this bridge: I stood on it
19539: when I was a little boy. It is a meeting-place for the spiritual
19540: messengers. It is true—what the Masters said—that each order of
19541: things has its angel: that means the full message of each from what is
19542: afar. Here I have listened to the messages of earth and sky; when I was
19543: stronger I used to stay and watch for the stars in the deep heavens.
19544: But this time just about sunset was always what I loved best. It has
19545: sunk into me and dwelt with me—fading, slowly fading: it was my own
19546: decline: it paused—it waited, till at last it brought me my new
19547: life—my new self—who will live when this breath is all breathed out.”
19548: 
19549: Deronda did not speak. He felt himself strangely wrought upon. The
19550: first-prompted suspicion that Mordecai might be liable to
19551: hallucinations of thought—might have become a monomaniac on some
19552: subject which had given too severe a strain to his diseased
19553: organism—gave way to a more submissive expectancy. His nature was too
19554: large, too ready to conceive regions beyond his own experience, to rest
19555: at once in the easy explanation, “madness,” whenever a consciousness
19556: showed some fullness and conviction where his own was blank. It
19557: accorded with his habitual disposition that he should meet rather than
19558: resist any claim on him in the shape of another’s need; and this claim
19559: brought with it a sense of solemnity which seemed a radiation from
19560: Mordecai, as utterly nullifying his outward poverty and lifting him
19561: into authority as if he had been that preternatural guide seen in the
19562: universal legend, who suddenly drops his mean disguise and stands a
19563: manifest Power. That impression was the more sanctioned by a sort of
19564: resolved quietude which the persuasion of fulfillment had produced in
19565: Mordecai’s manner. After they had stood a moment in silence he said,
19566: “Let us go now,” and when they were riding he added, “We will get down
19567: at the end of the street and walk to the shop. You can look at the
19568: books, and Mr. Ram will be going away directly and leave us alone.”
19569: 
19570: It seemed that this enthusiast was just as cautious, just as much alive
19571: to judgments in other minds as if he had been that antipode of all
19572: enthusiasm called “a man of the world.”
19573: 
19574: While they were rattling along in the cab, Mirah was still present with
19575: Deronda in the midst of this strange experience, but he foresaw that
19576: the course of conversation would be determined by Mordecai, not by
19577: himself: he was no longer confident what questions he should be able to
19578: ask; and with a reaction on his own mood, he inwardly said, “I suppose
19579: I am in a state of complete superstition, just as if I were awaiting
19580: the destiny that could interpret the oracle. But some strong relation
19581: there must be between me and this man, since he feels it strongly.
19582: Great heaven! what relation has proved itself more potent in the world
19583: than faith even when mistaken—than expectation even when perpetually
19584: disappointed? Is my side of the relation to be disappointing or
19585: fulfilling?—well, if it is ever possible for me to fulfill I will not
19586: disappoint.”
19587: 
19588: In ten minutes the two men, with as intense a consciousness as if they
19589: had been two undeclared lovers, felt themselves alone in the small
19590: gas-lit book-shop and turned face to face, each baring his head from an
19591: instinctive feeling that they wished to see each other fully. Mordecai
19592: came forward to lean his back against the little counter, while Deronda
19593: stood against the opposite wall hardly more than four feet off. I wish
19594: I could perpetuate those two faces, as Titian’s “Tribute Money” has
19595: perpetuated two types presenting another sort of contrast. Imagine—we
19596: all of us can—the pathetic stamp of consumption with its brilliancy of
19597: glance to which the sharply-defined structure of features reminding one
19598: of a forsaken temple, give already a far-off look as of one getting
19599: unwillingly out of reach; and imagine it on a Jewish face naturally
19600: accentuated for the expression of an eager mind—the face of a man
19601: little above thirty, but with that age upon it which belongs to time
19602: lengthened by suffering, the hair and beard, still black, throwing out
19603: the yellow pallor of the skin, the difficult breathing giving more
19604: decided marking to the mobile nostril, the wasted yellow hands
19605: conspicuous on the folded arms: then give to the yearning consumptive
19606: glance something of the slowly dying mother’s look, when her one loved
19607: son visits her bedside, and the flickering power of gladness leaps out
19608: as she says, “My boy!”—for the sense of spiritual perpetuation in
19609: another resembles that maternal transference of self.
19610: 
19611: Seeing such a portrait you would see Mordecai. And opposite to him was
19612: a face not more distinctively oriental than many a type seen among what
19613: we call the Latin races; rich in youthful health, and with a forcible
19614: masculine gravity in its repose, that gave the value of judgment to the
19615: reverence with which he met the gaze of this mysterious son of poverty
19616: who claimed him as a long-expected friend. The more exquisite quality
19617: of Deronda’s nature—that keenly perceptive sympathetic emotiveness
19618: which ran along with his speculative tendency—was never more
19619: thoroughly tested. He felt nothing that could be called belief in the
19620: validity of Mordecai’s impressions concerning him or in the probability
19621: of any greatly effective issue: what he felt was a profound sensibility
19622: to a cry from the depths of another and accompanying that, the summons
19623: to be receptive instead of superciliously prejudging. Receptiveness is
19624: a rare and massive power, like fortitude; and this state of mind now
19625: gave Deronda’s face its utmost expression of calm benignant force—an
19626: expression which nourished Mordecai’s confidence and made an open way
19627: before him. He began to speak.
19628: 
19629: “You cannot know what has guided me to you and brought us together at
19630: this moment. You are wondering.”
19631: 
19632: “I am not impatient,” said Deronda. “I am ready to listen to whatever
19633: you may wish to disclose.”
19634: 
19635: “You see some of the reasons why I needed you,” said Mordecai, speaking
19636: quietly, as if he wished to reserve his strength. “You see that I am
19637: dying. You see that I am as one shut up behind bars by the wayside, who
19638: if he spoke to any would be met only by head-shaking and pity. The day
19639: is closing—the light is fading—soon we should not have been able to
19640: discern each other. But you have come in time.”
19641: 
19642: “I rejoice that I am come in time,” said Deronda, feelingly. He would
19643: not say, “I hope you are not mistaken in me,”—the very word
19644: “mistaken,” he thought, would be a cruelty at that moment.
19645: 
19646: “But the hidden reasons why I need you began afar off,” said Mordecai;
19647: “began in my early years when I was studying in another land. Then
19648: ideas, beloved ideas, came to me, because I was a Jew. They were a
19649: trust to fulfill, because I was a Jew. They were an inspiration,
19650: because I was a Jew, and felt the heart of my race beating within me.
19651: They were my life; I was not fully born till then. I counted this
19652: heart, and this breath, and this right hand”—Mordecai had pathetically
19653: pressed his hand upon his breast, and then stretched its wasted fingers
19654: out before him—“I counted my sleep and my waking, and the work I fed
19655: my body with, and the sights that fed my eyes—I counted them but as
19656: fuel to the divine flame. But I had done as one who wanders and
19657: engraves his thought in rocky solitudes, and before I could change my
19658: course came care and labor and disease, and blocked the way before me,
19659: and bound me with the iron that eats itself into the soul. Then I said,
19660: ‘How shall I save the life within me from being stifled with this
19661: stifled breath?’”
19662: 
19663: Mordecai paused to rest that poor breath which had been taxed by the
19664: rising excitement of his speech. And also he wished to check that
19665: excitement. Deronda dared not speak: the very silence in the narrow
19666: space seemed alive with mingled awe and compassion before this
19667: struggling fervor. And presently Mordecai went on:
19668: 
19669: “But you may misunderstand me. I speak not as an ignorant dreamer—as
19670: one bred up in the inland valleys, thinking ancient thoughts anew, and
19671: not knowing them ancient, never having stood by the great waters where
19672: the world’s knowledge passes to and fro. English is my mother-tongue,
19673: England is the native land of this body, which is but as a breaking pot
19674: of earth around the fruit-bearing tree, whose seed might make the
19675: desert rejoice. But my true life was nourished in Holland at the feet
19676: of my mother’s brother, a Rabbi skilled in special learning: and when
19677: he died I went to Hamburg to study, and afterwards to Göttingen, that I
19678: might take a larger outlook on my people, and on the Gentile world, and
19679: drank knowledge at all sources. I was a youth; I felt free; I saw our
19680: chief seats in Germany; I was not then in utter poverty. And I had
19681: possessed myself of a handicraft. For I said, I care not if my lot be
19682: as that of Joshua ben Chananja: after the last destruction he earned
19683: his bread by making needles, but in his youth he had been a singer on
19684: the steps of the Temple, and had a memory of what was before the glory
19685: departed. I said, let my body dwell in poverty, and my hands be as the
19686: hands of the toiler: but let my soul be as a temple of remembrance
19687: where the treasures of knowledge enter and the inner sanctuary is hope.
19688: I knew what I chose. They said, ‘He feeds himself on visions,’ and I
19689: denied not; for visions are the creators and feeders of the world. I
19690: see, I measure the world as it is, which the vision will create anew.
19691: You are not listening to one who raves aloof from the lives of his
19692: fellows.”
19693: 
19694: Mordecai paused, and Deronda, feeling that the pause was expectant,
19695: said, “Do me the justice to believe that I was not inclined to call
19696: your words raving. I listen that I may know, without prejudgment. I
19697: have had experience which gives me a keen interest in the story of a
19698: spiritual destiny embraced willingly, and embraced in youth.”
19699: 
19700: “A spiritual destiny embraced willingly—in youth?” Mordecai repeated
19701: in a corrective tone. “It was the soul fully born within me, and it
19702: came in my boyhood. It brought its own world—a mediaeval world, where
19703: there are men who made the ancient language live again in new psalms of
19704: exile. They had absorbed the philosophy of the Gentile into the faith
19705: of the Jew, and they still yearned toward a center for our race. One of
19706: their souls was born again within me, and awakened amid the memories of
19707: their world. It traveled into Spain and Provence; it debated with
19708: Aben-Ezra; it took ship with Jehuda ha-Levi; it heard the roar of the
19709: Crusaders and the shrieks of tortured Israel. And when its dumb tongue
19710: was loosed, it spoke the speech they had made alive with the new blood
19711: of their ardor, their sorrow, and their martyred trust: it sang with
19712: the cadence of their strain.”
19713: 
19714: Mordecai paused again, and then said in a loud, hoarse whisper,
19715: 
19716: “While it is imprisoned in me, it will never learn another.”
19717: 
19718: “Have you written entirely in Hebrew, then?” said Deronda, remembering
19719: with some anxiety the former question as to his own knowledge of that
19720: tongue.
19721: 
19722: “Yes—yes,” said Mordecai, in a tone of deep sadness: “in my youth I
19723: wandered toward that solitude, not feeling that it was a solitude. I
19724: had the ranks of the great dead around me; the martyrs gathered and
19725: listened. But soon I found that the living were deaf to me. At first I
19726: saw my life spread as a long future: I said part of my Jewish heritage
19727: is an unbreaking patience; part is skill to seek divers methods and
19728: find a rooting-place where the planters despair. But there came new
19729: messengers from the Eternal. I had to bow under the yoke that presses
19730: on the great multitude born of woman: family troubles called me—I had
19731: to work, to care, not for myself alone. I was left solitary again; but
19732: already the angel of death had turned to me and beckoned, and I felt
19733: his skirts continually on my path. I loosed not my effort. I besought
19734: hearing and help. I spoke; I went to men of our people—to the rich in
19735: influence or knowledge, to the rich in other wealth. But I found none
19736: to listen with understanding. I was rebuked for error; I was offered a
19737: small sum in charity. No wonder. I looked poor; I carried a bundle of
19738: Hebrew manuscript with me; I said, our chief teachers are misleading
19739: the hope of our race. Scholar and merchant were both too busy to
19740: listen. Scorn stood as interpreter between me and them. One said, ‘The
19741: book of Mormon would never have answered in Hebrew; and if you mean to
19742: address our learned men, it is not likely you can teach them anything.’
19743: He touched a truth there.”
19744: 
19745: The last words had a perceptible irony in their hoarsened tone.
19746: 
19747: “But though you had accustomed yourself to write in Hebrew, few,
19748: surely, can use English better,” said Deronda, wanting to hint
19749: consolation in a new effort for which he could smooth the way.
19750: 
19751: Mordecai shook his head slowly, and answered,
19752: 
19753: “Too late—too late. I can write no more. My writing would be like this
19754: gasping breath. But the breath may wake the fount of pity—the writing
19755: not. If I could write now and used English, I should be as one who
19756: beats a board to summon those who have been used to no signal but a
19757: bell. My soul has an ear to hear the faults of its own speech. New
19758: writing of mine would be like this body”—Mordecai spread his
19759: arms—“within it there might be the Ruach-ha-kodesh—the breath of
19760: divine thought—but, men would smile at it and say, ‘A poor Jew!’ and
19761: the chief smilers would be of my own people.”
19762: 
19763: Mordecai let his hands fall, and his head sink in melancholy: for the
19764: moment he had lost hold of his hope. Despondency, conjured up by his
19765: own words, had floated in and hovered above him with eclipsing wings.
19766: He had sunk into momentary darkness,
19767: 
19768: “I feel with you—I feel strongly with you,” said Deronda, in a clear
19769: deep voice which was itself a cordial, apart from the words of
19770: sympathy. “But forgive me if I speak hastily—for what you have
19771: actually written there need be no utter burial. The means of
19772: publication are within reach. If you will rely on me, I can assure you
19773: of all that is necessary to that end.”
19774: 
19775: “That is not enough,” said Mordecai, quickly, looking up again with the
19776: flash of recovered memory and confidence. “That is not all my trust in
19777: you. You must be not only a hand to me, but a soul—believing my
19778: belief—being moved by my reasons—hoping my hope—seeing the vision I
19779: point to—beholding a glory where I behold it!”—Mordecai had taken a
19780: step nearer as he spoke, and now laid his hand on Deronda’s arm with a
19781: tight grasp; his face little more than a foot off had something like a
19782: pale flame in it—an intensity of reliance that acted as a peremptory
19783: claim, while he went on—“You will be my life: it will be planted
19784: afresh; it will grow. You shall take the inheritance; it has been
19785: gathering for ages. The generations are crowding on my narrow life as a
19786: bridge: what has been and what is to be are meeting there; and the
19787: bridge is breaking. But I have found you. You have come in time. You
19788: will take the inheritance which the base son refuses because of the
19789: tombs which the plow and harrow may not pass over or the gold-seeker
19790: disturb: you will take the sacred inheritance of the Jew.”
19791: 
19792: Deronda had become as pallid as Mordecai. Quick as an alarm of flood or
19793: fire, there spread within him not only a compassionate dread of
19794: discouraging this fellowman who urged a prayer as one in the last
19795: agony, but also the opposing dread of fatally feeding an illusion, and
19796: being hurried on to a self-committal which might turn into a falsity.
19797: The peculiar appeal to his tenderness overcame the repulsion that most
19798: of us experience under a grasp and speech which assumed to dominate.
19799: The difficulty to him was to inflict the accents of hesitation and
19800: doubt on this ardent suffering creature, who was crowding too much of
19801: his brief being into a moment of perhaps extravagant trust. With
19802: exquisite instinct, Deronda, before he opened his lips, placed his palm
19803: gently on Mordecai’s straining hand—an act just then equal to many
19804: speeches. And after that he said, without haste, as if conscious that
19805: he might be wrong,
19806: 
19807: “Do you forget what I told you when we first saw each other? Do you
19808: remember that I said I was not of your race?”
19809: 
19810: “It can’t be true,” Mordecai whispered immediately, with no sign of
19811: shock. The sympathetic hand still upon him had fortified the feeling
19812: which was stronger than those words of denial. There was a perceptible
19813: pause, Deronda feeling it impossible to answer, conscious indeed that
19814: the assertion “It can’t be true”—had the pressure of argument for him.
19815: Mordecai, too entirely possessed by the supreme importance of the
19816: relation between himself and Deronda to have any other care in his
19817: speech, followed up that assertion by a second, which came to his lips
19818: as a mere sequence of his long-cherished conviction—“You are not sure
19819: of your own origin.”
19820: 
19821: “How do you know that?” said Daniel, with an habitual shrinking which
19822: made him remove his hands from Mordecai’s, who also relaxed his hold,
19823: and fell back into his former leaning position.
19824: 
19825: “I know it—I know it; what is my life else?” said Mordecai, with a low
19826: cry of impatience. “Tell me everything: tell me why you deny.”
19827: 
19828: He could have no conception what that demand was to the hearer—how
19829: probingly it touched the hidden sensibility, the vividly conscious
19830: reticence of years; how the uncertainty he was insisting on as part of
19831: his own hope had always for Daniel been a threatening possibility of
19832: painful revelation about his mother. But the moment had influences
19833: which were not only new but solemn to Deronda; any evasion here might
19834: turn out to be a hateful refusal of some task that belonged to him,
19835: some act of due fellowship; in any case it would be a cruel rebuff to a
19836: being who was appealing to him as a forlorn hope under the shadow of a
19837: coming doom. After a few moments, he said, with a great effort over
19838: himself—determined to tell all the truth briefly,
19839: 
19840: “I have never known my mother. I have no knowledge about her. I have
19841: never called any man father. But I am convinced that my father is an
19842: Englishman.”
19843: 
19844: Deronda’s deep tones had a tremor in them as he uttered this
19845: confession; and all the while there was an under-current of amazement in
19846: him at the strange circumstances under which he uttered it. It seemed
19847: as if Mordecai were hardly overrating his own power to determine the
19848: action of the friend whom he had mysteriously chosen.
19849: 
19850: “It will be seen—it will be declared,” said Mordecai, triumphantly.
19851: “The world grows, and its frame is knit together by the growing soul;
19852: dim, dim at first, then clearer and more clear, the consciousness
19853: discerns remote stirrings. As thoughts move within us darkly, and shake
19854: us before they are fully discerned—so events—so beings: they are knit
19855: with us in the growth of the world. You have risen within me like a
19856: thought not fully spelled; my soul is shaken before the words are all
19857: there. The rest will come—it will come.”
19858: 
19859: “We must not lose sight of the fact that the outward event has not
19860: always been a fulfillment of the firmest faith,” said Deronda, in a
19861: tone that was made hesitating by the painfully conflicting desires, not
19862: to give any severe blow to Mordecai, and not to give his confidence a
19863: sanction which might have the severest of blows in reserve.
19864: 
19865: Mordecai’s face, which had been illuminated to the utmost in that last
19866: declaration of his confidence, changed under Deronda’s words, not only
19867: into any show of collapsed trust: the force did not disappear from the
19868: expression, but passed from the triumphant into the firmly resistant.
19869: 
19870: “You would remind me that I may be under an illusion—that the history
19871: of our people’s trust has been full of illusion. I face it all.” Here
19872: Mordecai paused a moment. Then bending his head a little forward, he
19873: said, in his hoarse whisper, “_So it might be with my trust, if you
19874: would make it an illusion. But you will not._”
19875: 
19876: The very sharpness with which these words penetrated Deronda made him
19877: feel the more that here was a crisis in which he must be firm.
19878: 
19879: “What my birth was does not lie in my will,” he answered. “My sense of
19880: claims on me cannot be independent of my knowledge there. And I cannot
19881: promise you that I will try to hasten a disclosure. Feelings which have
19882: struck root through half my life may still hinder me from doing what I
19883: have never been able to do. Everything must be waited for. I must know
19884: more of the truth about my own life, and I must know more of what it
19885: would become if it were made a part of yours.”
19886: 
19887: Mordecai had folded his arms again while Deronda was speaking, and now
19888: answered with equal firmness, though with difficult breathing,
19889: 
19890: “You _shall_ know. What are we met for, but that you should know. Your
19891: doubts lie as light as dust on my belief. I know the philosophies of
19892: this time and of other times; if I chose I could answer a summons
19893: before their tribunals. I could silence the beliefs which are the
19894: mother-tongue of my soul and speak with the rote-learned language of a
19895: system, that gives you the spelling of all things, sure of its alphabet
19896: covering them all. I could silence them: may not a man silence his awe
19897: or his love, and take to finding reasons, which others demand? But if
19898: his love lies deeper than any reasons to be found? Man finds his
19899: pathways: at first they were foot tracks, as those of the beast in the
19900: wilderness: now they are swift and invisible: his thought dives through
19901: the ocean, and his wishes thread the air: has he found all the pathways
19902: yet? What reaches him, stays with him, rules him: he must accept it,
19903: not knowing its pathway. Say, my expectation of you has grown but as
19904: false hopes grow. That doubt is in your mind? Well, my expectation was
19905: there, and you are come. Men have died of thirst. But I was thirsty,
19906: and the water is on my lips! What are doubts to me? In the hour when
19907: you come to me and say, ‘I reject your soul: I know that I am not a
19908: Jew: we have no lot in common’—I shall not doubt. I shall be
19909: certain—certain that I have been deluded. That hour will never come!”
19910: 
19911: Deronda felt a new chord sounding in his speech: it was rather
19912: imperious than appealing—had more of conscious power than of the
19913: yearning need which had acted as a beseeching grasp on him before. And
19914: usually, though he was the reverse of pugnacious, such a change of
19915: attitude toward him would have weakened his inclination to admit a
19916: claim. But here there was something that balanced his resistance and
19917: kept it aloof. This strong man whose gaze was sustainedly calm and his
19918: finger-nails pink with health, who was exercised in all questioning,
19919: and accused of excessive mental independence, still felt a subduing
19920: influence over him in the tenacious certitude of the fragile creature
19921: before him, whose pallid yellow nostril was tense with effort as his
19922: breath labored under the burthen of eager speech. The influence seemed
19923: to strengthen the bond of sympathetic obligation. In Deronda at this
19924: moment the desire to escape what might turn into a trying embarrassment
19925: was no more likely to determine action than the solicitations of
19926: indolence are likely to determine it in one with whom industry is a
19927: daily law. He answered simply,
19928: 
19929: “It is my wish to meet and satisfy your wishes wherever that is
19930: possible to me. It is certain to me at least that I desire not to
19931: undervalue your toil and your suffering. Let me know your thoughts. But
19932: where can we meet?”
19933: 
19934: “I have thought of that,” said Mordecai. “It is not hard for you to
19935: come into this neighborhood later in the evening? You did so once.”
19936: 
19937: “I can manage it very well occasionally,” said Deronda. “You live under
19938: the same roof with the Cohens, I think?”
19939: 
19940: Before Mordecai could answer, Mr. Ram re-entered to take his place
19941: behind the counter. He was an elderly son of Abraham, whose childhood
19942: had fallen on the evil times at the beginning of this century, and who
19943: remained amid this smart and instructed generation as a preserved
19944: specimen, soaked through and through with the effect of the poverty and
19945: contempt which were the common heritage of most English Jews seventy
19946: years ago. He had none of the oily cheerfulness observable in Mr.
19947: Cohen’s aspect: his very features—broad and chubby—showed that
19948: tendency to look mongrel without due cause, which, in a miscellaneous
19949: London neighborhood, may perhaps be compared with the marvels of
19950: imitation in insects, and may have been nature’s imperfect effort on
19951: behalf of the pure Caucasian to shield him from the shame and spitting
19952: to which purer features would have been exposed in the times of zeal.
19953: Mr. Ram dealt ably in books, in the same way that he would have dealt
19954: in tins of meat and other commodities—without knowledge or
19955: responsibility as to the proportion of rottenness or nourishment they
19956: might contain. But he believed in Mordecai’s learning as something
19957: marvellous, and was not sorry that his conversation should be sought by
19958: a bookish gentleman, whose visits had twice ended in a purchase. He
19959: greeted Deronda with a crabbed good-will, and, putting on large silver
19960: spectacles, appeared at once to abstract himself in the daily accounts.
19961: 
19962: But Deronda and Mordecai were soon in the street together, and without
19963: any explicit agreement as to their direction, were walking toward Ezra
19964: Cohen’s.
19965: 
19966: “We can’t meet there: my room is too narrow,” said Mordecai, taking up
19967: the thread of talk where they had dropped it. “But there is a tavern
19968: not far from here where I sometimes go to a club. It is the _Hand and
19969: Banner_, in the street at the next turning, five doors down. We can
19970: have the parlor there any evening.”
19971: 
19972: “We can try that for once,” said Deronda. “But you will perhaps let me
19973: provide you with some lodging, which would give you more freedom and
19974: comfort than where you are.”
19975: 
19976: “No; I need nothing. My outer life is as nought. I will take nothing
19977: less precious from you than your soul’s brotherhood. I will think of
19978: nothing else yet. But I am glad you are rich. You did not need money on
19979: that diamond ring. You had some other motive for bringing it.”
19980: 
19981: Deronda was a little startled by this clear-sightedness; but before he
19982: could reply Mordecai added—“it is all one. Had you been in need of the
19983: money, the great end would have been that we should meet again. But you
19984: are rich?” he ended, in a tone of interrogation.
19985: 
19986: “Not rich, except in the sense that every one is rich who has more than
19987: he needs for himself.”
19988: 
19989: “I desired that your life should be free,” said Mordecai,
19990: dreamily—“mine has been a bondage.”
19991: 
19992: It was clear that he had no interest in the fact of Deronda’s
19993: appearance at the Cohens’ beyond its relation to his own ideal purpose.
19994: Despairing of leading easily up to the question he wished to ask,
19995: Deronda determined to put it abruptly, and said,
19996: 
19997: “Can you tell me why Mrs. Cohen, the mother, must not be spoken to
19998: about her daughter?”
19999: 
20000: There was no immediate answer, and he thought that he should have to
20001: repeat the question. The fact was that Mordecai had heard the words,
20002: but had to drag his mind to a new subject away from his passionate
20003: preoccupation. After a few moments, he replied with a careful effort
20004: such as he would have used if he had been asked the road to Holborn:
20005: 
20006: “I know the reason. But I will not speak even of trivial family affairs
20007: which I have heard in the privacy of the family. I dwell in their tent
20008: as in a sanctuary. Their history, so far as they injure none other, is
20009: their own possession.”
20010: 
20011: Deronda felt the blood mounting to his cheeks as a sort of rebuke he
20012: was little used to, and he also found himself painfully baffled where
20013: he had reckoned with some confidence on getting decisive knowledge. He
20014: became the more conscious of emotional strain from the excitements of
20015: the day; and although he had the money in his pocket to redeem his
20016: ring, he recoiled from the further task of a visit to the Cohens’,
20017: which must be made not only under the former uncertainty, but under a
20018: new disappointment as to the possibility of its removal.
20019: 
20020: “I will part from you now,” he said, just before they could reach
20021: Cohen’s door; and Mordecai paused, looking up at him with an anxious
20022: fatigued face under the gaslight.
20023: 
20024: “When will you come back?” he said, with slow emphasis.
20025: 
20026: “May I leave that unfixed? May I ask for you at the Cohens’ any evening
20027: after your hour at the book-shop? There is no objection, I suppose, to
20028: their knowing that you and I meet in private?”
20029: 
20030: “None,” said Mordecai. “But the days I wait now are longer than the
20031: years of my strength. Life shrinks: what was but a tithe is now the
20032: half. My hope abides in you.”
20033: 
20034: “I will be faithful,” said Deronda—he could not have left those words
20035: unuttered. “I will come the first evening I can after seven: on
20036: Saturday or Monday, if possible. Trust me.”
20037: 
20038: He put out his ungloved hand. Mordecai, clasping it eagerly, seemed to
20039: feel a new instreaming of confidence, and he said with some recovered
20040: energy—“This is come to pass, and the rest will come.”
20041: 
20042: That was their good-by.

20047: BOOK VI.—REVELATIONS
20048: 
20049: 
20050: CHAPTER XLI.
20051: 
20052:     “This, too is probable, according to that saying of Agathon: ‘It is a
20053:     part of probability that many improbable things will happen.’”
20054:     —ARISTOTLE: _Poetics_.
20055: 
20056: 
20057: Imagine the conflict in a mind like Deronda’s given not only to feel
20058: strongly but to question actively, on the evening after the interview
20059: with Mordecai. To a young man of much duller susceptibilities the
20060: adventure might have seemed enough out of the common way to divide his
20061: thoughts; but it had stirred Deronda so deeply, that with the usual
20062: reaction of his intellect he began to examine the grounds of his
20063: emotion, and consider how far he must resist its guidance. The
20064: consciousness that he was half dominated by Mordecai’s energetic
20065: certitude, and still more by his fervent trust, roused his alarm. It
20066: was his characteristic bias to shrink from the moral stupidity of
20067: valuing lightly what had come close to him, and of missing blindly in
20068: his own life of to-day the crisis which he recognized as momentous and
20069: sacred in the historic life of men. If he had read of this incident as
20070: having happened centuries ago in Rome, Greece, Asia Minor, Palestine,
20071: Cairo, to some man young as himself, dissatisfied with his neutral
20072: life, and wanting some closer fellowship, some more special duty to
20073: give him ardor for the possible consequences of his work, it would have
20074: appeared to him quite natural that the incident should have created a
20075: deep impression on that far-off man, whose clothing and action would
20076: have been seen in his imagination as part of an age chiefly known to us
20077: through its more serious effects. Why should he be ashamed of his own
20078: agitated feeling merely because he dressed for dinner, wore a white
20079: tie, and lived among people who might laugh at his owning any
20080: conscience in the matter, as the solemn folly of taking himself too
20081: seriously?—that bugbear of circles in which the lack of grave emotion
20082: passes for wit. From such cowardice before modish ignorance and
20083: obtuseness, Deronda shrank. But he also shrank from having his course
20084: determined by mere contagion, without consent of reason; or from
20085: allowing a reverential pity for spiritual struggle to hurry him along a
20086: dimly-seen path.
20087: 
20088: What, after all, had really happened? He knew quite accurately the
20089: answer Sir Hugo would have given: “A consumptive Jew, possessed by a
20090: fanaticism which obstacles and hastening death intensified, had fixed
20091: on Deronda as the antitype of some visionary image, the offspring of
20092: wedded hope and despair: despair of his own life, irrepressible hope in
20093: the propagation of his fanatical beliefs. The instance was perhaps odd,
20094: exceptional in its form, but substantially it was not rare. Fanaticism
20095: was not so common as bankruptcy, but taken in all its aspects it was
20096: abundant enough. While Mordecai was waiting on the bridge for the
20097: fulfillment of his visions, another man was convinced that he had the
20098: mathematical key of the universe which would supersede Newton, and
20099: regarded all known physicists as conspiring to stifle his discovery and
20100: keep the universe locked; another, that he had the metaphysical key,
20101: with just that hair’s-breadth of difference from the old wards which
20102: would make it fit exactly. Scattered here and there in every direction
20103: you might find a terrible person, with more or less power of speech,
20104: and with an eye either glittering or preternaturally dull, on the
20105: look-out for the man who must hear him; and in most cases he had
20106: volumes which it was difficult to get printed, or if printed to get
20107: read. This Mordecai happened to have a more pathetic aspect, a more
20108: passionate, penetrative speech than was usual with such monomaniacs; he
20109: was more poetical than a social reformer with colored views of the new
20110: moral world in parallelograms, or than an enthusiast in sewage; still
20111: he came under the same class. It would be only right and kind to
20112: indulge him a little, to comfort him with such help as was practicable;
20113: but what likelihood was there that his notions had the sort of value he
20114: ascribed to them? In such cases a man of the world knows what to think
20115: beforehand. And as to Mordecai’s conviction that he had found a new
20116: executive self, it might be preparing for him the worst of
20117: disappointments—that which presents itself as final.”
20118: 
20119: Deronda’s ear caught all these negative whisperings; nay, he repeated
20120: them distinctly to himself. It was not the first but it was the most
20121: pressing occasion on which he had had to face this question of the
20122: family likeness among the heirs of enthusiasm, whether prophets or
20123: dreamers of dreams, whether the
20124: 
20125:   “Great benefactors of mankind, deliverers,”
20126: 
20127: or the devotees of phantasmal discovery—from the first believer in his
20128: own unmanifested inspiration, down to the last inventor of an ideal
20129: machine that will achieve perpetual motion. The kinship of human
20130: passion, the sameness of mortal scenery, inevitably fill fact with
20131: burlesque and parody. Error and folly have had their hecatombs of
20132: martyrs. Reduce the grandest type of man hitherto known to an abstract
20133: statement of his qualities and efforts, and he appears in dangerous
20134: company: say that, like Copernicus and Galileo, he was immovably
20135: convinced in the face of hissing incredulity; but so is the contriver
20136: of perpetual motion. We cannot fairly try the spirits by this sort of
20137: test. If we want to avoid giving the dose of hemlock or the sentence of
20138: banishment in the wrong case, nothing will do but a capacity to
20139: understand the subject-matter on which the immovable man is convinced,
20140: and fellowship with human travail, both near and afar, to hinder us
20141: from scanning any deep experience lightly. Shall we say, “Let the ages
20142: try the spirits, and see what they are worth?” Why, we are the
20143: beginning of the ages, which can only be just by virtue of just
20144: judgments in separate human breasts—separate yet combined. Even
20145: steam-engines could not have got made without that condition, but must
20146: have stayed in the mind of James Watt.
20147: 
20148: This track of thinking was familiar enough to Deronda to have saved him
20149: from any contemptuous prejudgment of Mordecai, even if their
20150: communication had been free from that peculiar claim on himself
20151: strangely ushered in by some long-growing preparation in the Jew’s
20152: agitated mind. This claim, indeed, considered in what is called a
20153: rational way, might seem justifiably dismissed as illusory and even
20154: preposterous; but it was precisely what turned Mordecai’s hold on him
20155: from an appeal to his ready sympathy into a clutch on his struggling
20156: conscience. Our consciences are not all of the same pattern, an inner
20157: deliverance of fixed laws: they are the voice of sensibilities as
20158: various as our memories (which also have their kinship and likeness).
20159: And Deronda’s conscience included sensibilities beyond the common,
20160: enlarged by his early habit of thinking himself imaginatively into the
20161: experience of others.
20162: 
20163: What was the claim this eager soul made upon him?—“You must believe my
20164: beliefs—be moved by my reasons—hope my hopes—see the vision I point
20165: to—behold a glory where I behold it!” To take such a demand in the
20166: light of an obligation in any direct sense would have been
20167: preposterous—to have seemed to admit it would have been dishonesty;
20168: and Deronda, looking on the agitation of those moments, felt thankful
20169: that in the midst of his compassion he had preserved himself from the
20170: bondage of false concessions. The claim hung, too, on a supposition
20171: which might be—nay, probably was—in discordance with the full fact:
20172: the supposition that he, Deronda, was of Jewish blood. Was there ever a
20173: more hypothetic appeal?
20174: 
20175: But since the age of thirteen Deronda had associated the deepest
20176: experience of his affections with what was a pure supposition, namely,
20177: that Sir Hugo was his father: that was a hypothesis which had been the
20178: source of passionate struggle within him; by its light he had been
20179: accustomed to subdue feelings and to cherish them. He had been well
20180: used to find a motive in a conception which might be disproved; and he
20181: had been also used to think of some revelation that might influence his
20182: view of the particular duties belonging to him. To be in a state of
20183: suspense, which was also one of emotive activity and scruple, was a
20184: familiar attitude of his conscience.
20185: 
20186: And now, suppose that wish-begotten belief in his Jewish birth, and
20187: that extravagant demand of discipleship, to be the foreshadowing of an
20188: actual discovery and a genuine spiritual result: suppose that
20189: Mordecai’s ideas made a real conquest over Deronda’s conviction? Nay,
20190: it was conceivable that as Mordecai needed and believed that, he had
20191: found an active replenishment of himself, so Deronda might receive from
20192: Mordecai’s mind the complete ideal shape of that personal duty and
20193: citizenship which lay in his own thought like sculptured fragments
20194: certifying some beauty yearned after but not traceable by divination.
20195: 
20196: As that possibility presented itself in his meditations, he was aware
20197: that it would be called dreamy, and began to defend it. If the
20198: influence he imagined himself submitting to had been that of some
20199: honored professor, some authority in a seat of learning, some
20200: philosopher who had been accepted as a voice of the age, would a
20201: thorough receptiveness toward direction have been ridiculed? Only by
20202: those who hold it a sign of weakness to be obliged for an idea, and
20203: prefer to hint that they have implicitly held in a more correct form
20204: whatever others have stated with a sadly short-coming explicitness.
20205: After all, what was there but vulgarity in taking the fact that
20206: Mordecai was a poor Jewish workman, and that he was to be met perhaps
20207: on a sanded floor in the parlor of the _Hand and Banner_ as a reason
20208: for determining beforehand that there was not some spiritual force
20209: within him that might have a determining effect on a white-handed
20210: gentleman? There is a legend told of the Emperor Domitian, that having
20211: heard of a Jewish family, of the house of David, whence the ruler of
20212: the world was to spring, he sent for its members in alarm, but quickly
20213: released them on observing that they had the hands of
20214: work-people—being of just the opposite opinion with that Rabbi who
20215: stood waiting at the gate of Rome in confidence that the Messiah would
20216: be found among the destitute who entered there. Both Emperor and Rabbi
20217: were wrong in their trust of outward signs: poverty and poor clothes
20218: are no sign of inspiration, said Deronda to his inward objector, but
20219: they have gone with it in some remarkable cases. And to regard
20220: discipleship as out of the question because of them, would be mere
20221: dullness of imagination.
20222: 
20223: A more plausible reason for putting discipleship out of the question
20224: was the strain of visionary excitement in Mordecai, which turned his
20225: wishes into overmastering impressions, and made him read outward facts
20226: as fulfillment. Was such a temper of mind likely to accompany that wise
20227: estimate of consequences which is the only safeguard from fatal error,
20228: even to ennobling motive? But it remained to be seen whether that rare
20229: conjunction existed or not in Mordecai: perhaps his might be one of the
20230: natures where a wise estimate of consequences is fused in the fires of
20231: that passionate belief which determines the consequences it believes
20232: in. The inspirations of the world have come in that way too: even
20233: strictly-measuring science could hardly have got on without that
20234: forecasting ardor which feels the agitations of discovery beforehand,
20235: and has a faith in its preconception that surmounts many failures of
20236: experiment. And in relation to human motives and actions, passionate
20237: belief has a fuller efficacy. Here enthusiasm may have the validity of
20238: proof, and happening in one soul, give the type of what will one day be
20239: general.
20240: 
20241: At least, Deronda argued, Mordecai’s visionary excitability was hardly
20242: a reason for concluding beforehand that he was not worth listening to
20243: except for pity’s sake. Suppose he had introduced himself as one of the
20244: strictest reasoners. Do they form a body of men hitherto free from
20245: false conclusions and illusory speculations? The driest argument has
20246: its hallucinations, too hastily concluding that its net will now at
20247: last be large enough to hold the universe. Men may dream in
20248: demonstrations, and cut out an illusory world in the shape of axioms,
20249: definitions, and propositions, with a final exclusion of fact signed
20250: Q.E.D. No formulas for thinking will save us mortals from mistake in
20251: our imperfect apprehension of the matter to be thought about. And since
20252: the unemotional intellect may carry us into a mathematical dreamland
20253: where nothing is but what is not, perhaps an emotional intellect may
20254: have absorbed into its passionate vision of possibilities some truth of
20255: what will be—the more comprehensive massive life feeding theory with
20256: new material, as the sensibility of the artist seizes combinations
20257: which science explains and justifies. At any rate, presumptions to the
20258: contrary are not to be trusted. We must be patient with the inevitable
20259: makeshift of our human thinking, whether in its sum total or in the
20260: separate minds that have made the sum. Columbus had some impressions
20261: about himself which we call superstitions, and used some arguments
20262: which we disapprove; but he had also some sound physical conceptions,
20263: and he had the passionate patience of genius to make them tell on
20264: mankind. The world has made up its mind rather contemptuously about
20265: those who were deaf to Columbus.
20266: 
20267: “My contempt for them binds me to see that I don’t adopt their mistake
20268: on a small scale,” said Deronda, “and make myself deaf with the
20269: assumption that there cannot be any momentous relation between this Jew
20270: and me, simply because he has clad it in illusory notions. What I can
20271: be to him, or he to me, may not at all depend on his persuasion about
20272: the way we came together. To me the way seems made up of plainly
20273: discernible links. If I had not found Mirah, it is probable that I
20274: should not have begun to be specially interested in the Jews, and
20275: certainly I should not have gone on that loitering search after an Ezra
20276: Cohen which made me pause at Ram’s book-shop and ask the price of
20277: _Maimon_. Mordecai, on his side, had his visions of a disciple, and he
20278: saw me by their light; I corresponded well enough with the image his
20279: longing had created. He took me for one of his race. Suppose that his
20280: impression—the elderly Jew at Frankfort seemed to have something like
20281: it—suppose in spite of all presumptions to the contrary, that his
20282: impression should somehow be proved true, and that I should come
20283: actually to share any of the ideas he is devoted to? This is the only
20284: question which really concerns the effect of our meeting on my life.
20285: 
20286: “But if the issue should be quite different?—well, there will be
20287: something painful to go through. I shall almost inevitably have to be
20288: an active cause of that poor fellow’s crushing disappointment. Perhaps
20289: this issue is the one I had need prepare myself for. I fear that no
20290: tenderness of mine can make his suffering lighter. Would the
20291: alternative—that I should not disappoint him—be less painful to me?”
20292: 
20293: Here Deronda wavered. Feelings had lately been at work within him which
20294: had very much modified the reluctance he would formerly have had to
20295: think of himself as probably a Jew. And, if you like, he was romantic.
20296: That young energy and spirit of adventure which have helped to create
20297: the world-wide legions of youthful heroes going to seek the hidden
20298: tokens of their birth and its inheritance of tasks, gave him a certain
20299: quivering interest in the bare possibility that he was entering on a
20300: like track —all the more because the track was one of thought as well
20301: as action.
20302: 
20303: “The bare possibility.” He could not admit it to be more. The belief
20304: that his father was an Englishman only grew firmer under the weak
20305: assaults of unwarranted doubt. And that a moment should ever come in
20306: which that belief was declared a delusion, was something of which
20307: Deronda would not say, “I should be glad.” His life-long affection for
20308: Sir Hugo, stronger than all his resentment, made him shrink from
20309: admitting that wish.
20310: 
20311: Which way soever the truth might lie, he repeated to himself what he
20312: had said to Mordecai—that he could not without farther reasons
20313: undertake to hasten its discovery. Nay, he was tempted now to regard
20314: his uncertainty as a condition to be cherished for the present. If
20315: further intercourse revealed nothing but illusions as what he was
20316: expected to share in, the want of any valid evidence that he was a Jew
20317: might save Mordecai the worst shock in the refusal of fraternity. It
20318: might even be justifiable to use the uncertainty on this point in
20319: keeping up a suspense which would induce Mordecai to accept those
20320: offices of friendship that Deronda longed to urge on him.
20321: 
20322: These were the meditations that busied Deronda in the interval of four
20323: days before he could fulfill his promise to call for Mordecai at Ezra
20324: Cohen’s, Sir Hugo’s demands on him often lasting to an hour so late as
20325: to put the evening expedition to Holborn out of the question.
20326: 
20327: 
20328: 
20329: 
20330: CHAPTER XLII.
20331: 
20332:     “Wenn es eine Stufenleiter von Leiden giebt, so hat Israel die höchste
20333:     Staffel erstiegen; wen die Dauer der Schmerzen und die Geduld, mit
20334:     welcher sie ertragen werden, adeln, so nehmen es die Juden mit den
20335:     Hochgeborenen aller Länder auf; wenn eine Literatur reich genannt
20336:     wird, die wenige klassische Trauerspiele besitzt, welcher Platz
20337:     gebührt dann einer Tragodie die anderthalb Jahrtausende wahrt,
20338:     gedichtet und dargestellt von den Helden selber?”—ZUNZ: _Die
20339:     Synagogale Poesie des Mittelalters._
20340: 
20341: 
20342: “If there are ranks in suffering, Israel takes precedence of all the
20343: nations—if the duration of sorrows and the patience with which they
20344: are borne ennoble, the Jews are among the aristocracy of every land—if
20345: a literature is called rich in the possession of a few classic
20346: tragedies, what shall we say to a National Tragedy lasting for fifteen
20347: hundred years, in which the poets and the actors were also the heroes?”
20348: 
20349: Deronda had lately been reading that passage of Zunz, and it occurred
20350: to him by way of contrast when he was going to the Cohens, who
20351: certainly bore no obvious stamp of distinction in sorrow or in any
20352: other form of aristocracy. Ezra Cohen was not clad in the sublime
20353: pathos of the martyr, and his taste for money-getting seemed to be
20354: favored with that success which has been the most exasperating
20355: difference in the greed of Jews during all the ages of their
20356: dispersion. This Jeshurun of a pawnbroker was not a symbol of the great
20357: Jewish tragedy; and yet was there not something typical in the fact
20358: that a life like Mordecai’s—a frail incorporation of the national
20359: consciousness, breathing with difficult breath—was nested in the
20360: self-gratulating ignorant prosperity of the Cohens?
20361: 
20362: Glistening was the gladness in their faces when Deronda reappeared
20363: among them. Cohen himself took occasion to intimate that although the
20364: diamond ring, let alone a little longer, would have bred more money, he
20365: did not mind _that_—not a sixpence—when compared with the pleasure of
20366: the women and children in seeing a young gentleman whose first visit
20367: had been so agreeable that they had “done nothing but talk of it ever
20368: since.” Young Mrs. Cohen was very sorry that baby was asleep, and then
20369: very glad that Adelaide was not yet gone to bed, entreating Deronda not
20370: to stay in the shop, but to go forthwith into the parlor to see “mother
20371: and the children.” He willingly accepted the invitation, having
20372: provided himself with portable presents; a set of paper figures for
20373: Adelaide, and an ivory cup and ball for Jacob.
20374: 
20375: The grandmother had a pack of cards before her and was making “plates”
20376: with the children. A plate had just been thrown down and kept itself
20377: whole.
20378: 
20379: “Stop!” said Jacob, running to Deronda as he entered. “Don’t tread on
20380: my plate. Stop and see me throw it up again.”
20381: 
20382: Deronda complied, exchanging a smile of understanding with the
20383: grandmother, and the plate bore several tossings before it came to
20384: pieces; then the visitor was allowed to come forward and seat himself.
20385: He observed that the door from which Mordecai had issued on the former
20386: visit was now closed, but he wished to show his interest in the Cohens
20387: before disclosing a yet stronger interest in their singular inmate.
20388: 
20389: It was not until he had Adelaide on his knee, and was setting up the
20390: paper figures in their dance on the table, while Jacob was already
20391: practicing with the cup and ball, that Deronda said,
20392: 
20393: “Is Mordecai in just now?”
20394: 
20395: “Where is he, Addy?” said Cohen, who had seized an interval of business
20396: to come and look on.
20397: 
20398: “In the workroom there,” said his wife, nodding toward the closed door.
20399: 
20400: “The fact is, sir,” said Cohen, “we don’t know what’s come to him this
20401: last day or two. He’s always what I may call a little touched, you
20402: know”—here Cohen pointed to his own forehead—“not quite so rational
20403: in all things, like you and me; but he’s mostly wonderful regular and
20404: industrious so far as a poor creature can be, and takes as much delight
20405: in the boy as anybody could. But this last day or two he’s been moving
20406: about like a sleep-walker, or else sitting as still as a wax figure.”
20407: 
20408: “It’s the disease, poor dear creature,” said the grandmother, tenderly.
20409: “I doubt whether he can stand long against it.”
20410: 
20411: “No; I think its only something he’s got in his head,” said Mrs. Cohen
20412: the younger. “He’s been turning over writing continually, and when I
20413: speak to him it takes him ever so long to hear and answer.”
20414: 
20415: “You may think us a little weak ourselves,” said Cohen, apologetically.
20416: “But my wife and mother wouldn’t part with him if he was a still worse
20417: incumbrance. It isn’t that we don’t know the long and short of matters,
20418: but it’s our principle. There’s fools do business at a loss and don’t
20419: know it. I’m not one of ’em.”
20420: 
20421: “Oh, Mordecai carries a blessing inside him,” said the grandmother.
20422: 
20423: “He’s got something the matter inside him,” said Jacob, coming up to
20424: correct this erratum of his grandmother’s. “He said he couldn’t talk to
20425: me, and he wouldn’t have a bit o’ bun.”
20426: 
20427: “So far from wondering at your feeling for him,” said Deronda, “I
20428: already feel something of the same sort myself. I have lately talked to
20429: him at Ram’s book-shop—in fact, I promised to call for him here, that
20430: we might go out together.”
20431: 
20432: “That’s it, then!” said Cohen, slapping his knee. “He’s been expecting
20433: you, and it’s taken hold of him. I suppose he talks about his learning
20434: to you. It’s uncommonly kind of _you_, sir; for I don’t suppose there’s
20435: much to be got out of it, else it wouldn’t have left him where he is.
20436: But there’s the shop.” Cohen hurried out, and Jacob, who had been
20437: listening inconveniently near to Deronda’s elbow, said to him with
20438: obliging familiarity, “I’ll call Mordecai for you, if you like.”
20439: 
20440: “No, Jacob,” said his mother; “open the door for the gentleman, and let
20441: him go in himself Hush! Don’t make a noise.”
20442: 
20443: Skillful Jacob seemed to enter into the play, and turned the handle of
20444: the door as noiselessly as possible, while Deronda went behind him and
20445: stood on the threshold. The small room was lit only by a dying fire and
20446: one candle with a shade over it. On the board fixed under the window,
20447: various objects of jewelry were scattered: some books were heaped in
20448: the corner beyond them. Mordecai was seated on a high chair at the
20449: board with his back to the door, his hands resting on each other and on
20450: the board, a watch propped on a stand before him. He was in a state of
20451: expectation as sickening as that of a prisoner listening for the
20452: delayed deliverance—when he heard Deronda’s voice saying, “I am come
20453: for you. Are you ready?”
20454: 
20455: Immediately he turned without speaking, seized his furred cap which lay
20456: near, and moved to join Deronda. It was but a moment before they were
20457: both in the sitting-room, and Jacob, noticing the change in his
20458: friend’s air and expression, seized him by the arm and said, “See my
20459: cup and ball!” sending the ball up close to Mordecai’s face, as
20460: something likely to cheer a convalescent. It was a sign of the relieved
20461: tension in Mordecai’s mind that he could smile and say, “Fine, fine!”
20462: 
20463: “You have forgotten your greatcoat and comforter,” said young Mrs.
20464: Cohen, and he went back into the workroom and got them.
20465: 
20466: “He’s come to life again, do you see?” said Cohen, who had
20467: re-entered—speaking in an undertone. “I told you so: I’m mostly
20468: right.” Then in his usual voice, “Well, sir, we mustn’t detain you now,
20469: I suppose; but I hope this isn’t the last time we shall see you.”
20470: 
20471: “Shall you come again?” said Jacob, advancing. “See, I can catch the
20472: ball; I’ll bet I catch it without stopping, if you come again.”
20473: 
20474: “He has clever hands,” said Deronda, looking at the grandmother. “Which
20475: side of the family does he get them from?”
20476: 
20477: But the grandmother only nodded towards her son, who said promptly, “My
20478: side. My wife’s family are not in that line. But bless your soul! ours
20479: is a sort of cleverness as good as gutta percha; you can twist it which
20480: way you like. There’s nothing some old gentlemen won’t do if you set
20481: ’em to it.” Here Cohen winked down at Jacob’s back, but it was doubtful
20482: whether this judicious allusiveness answered its purpose, for its
20483: subject gave a nasal whinnying laugh and stamped about singing, “Old
20484: gentlemen, old gentlemen,” in chiming cadence.
20485: 
20486: Deronda thought, “I shall never know anything decisive about these
20487: people until I ask Cohen pointblank whether he lost a sister named
20488: Mirah when she was six years old.” The decisive moment did not yet seem
20489: easy for him to face. Still his first sense of repulsion at the
20490: commonness of these people was beginning to be tempered with kindlier
20491: feeling. However unrefined their airs and speech might be, he was
20492: forced to admit some moral refinement in their treatment of the
20493: consumptive workman, whose mental distinction impressed them chiefly as
20494: a harmless, silent raving.
20495: 
20496: “The Cohens seem to have an affection for you,” said Deronda, as soon
20497: as he and Mordecai were off the doorstep.
20498: 
20499: “And I for them,” was the immediate answer. “They have the heart of the
20500: Israelite within them, though they are as the horse and the mule,
20501: without understanding beyond the narrow path they tread.”
20502: 
20503: “I have caused you some uneasiness, I fear,” said Deronda, “by my
20504: slowness in fulfilling my promise. I wished to come yesterday, but I
20505: found it impossible.”
20506: 
20507: “Yes—yes, I trusted you. But it is true I have been uneasy, for the
20508: spirit of my youth has been stirred within me, and this body is not
20509: strong enough to bear the beating of its wings. I am as a man bound and
20510: imprisoned through long years: behold him brought to speech of his
20511: fellow and his limbs set free: he weeps, he totters, the joy within him
20512: threatens to break and overthrow the tabernacle of flesh.”
20513: 
20514: “You must not speak too much in this evening air,” said Deronda,
20515: feeling Mordecai’s words of reliance like so many cords binding him
20516: painfully. “Cover your mouth with the woolen scarf. We are going to the
20517: _Hand and Banner_, I suppose, and shall be in private there?”
20518: 
20519: “No, that is my trouble that you did not come yesterday. For this is
20520: the evening of the club I spoke of, and we might not have any minutes
20521: alone until late, when all the rest are gone. Perhaps we had better
20522: seek another place. But I am used to that only. In new places the outer
20523: world presses on me and narrows the inward vision. And the people there
20524: are familiar with my face.”
20525: 
20526: “I don’t mind the club if I am allowed to go in,” said Deronda. “It is
20527: enough that you like this place best. If we have not enough time I will
20528: come again. What sort of club is it?”
20529: 
20530: “It is called ‘The Philosophers.’ They are few—like the cedars of
20531: Lebanon—poor men given to thought. But none so poor as I am: and
20532: sometimes visitors of higher worldly rank have been brought. We are
20533: allowed to introduce a friend, who is interested in our topics. Each
20534: orders beer or some other kind of drink, in payment for the room. Most
20535: of them smoke. I have gone when I could, for there are other men of my
20536: race who come, and sometimes I have broken silence. I have pleased
20537: myself with a faint likeness between these poor philosophers and the
20538: Masters who handed down the thought of our race—the great
20539: Transmitters, who labored with their hands for scant bread, but
20540: preserved and enlarged for us the heritage of memory, and saved the
20541: soul of Israel alive as a seed among the tombs. The heart pleases
20542: itself with faint resemblances.”
20543: 
20544: “I shall be very glad to go and sit among them, if that will suit you.
20545: It is a sort of meeting I should like to join in,” said Deronda, not
20546: without relief in the prospect of an interval before he went through
20547: the strain of his next private conversation with Mordecai.
20548: 
20549: In three minutes they had opened the glazed door with the red curtain,
20550: and were in the little parlor, hardly much more than fifteen feet
20551: square, where the gaslight shone through a slight haze of smoke on what
20552: to Deronda was a new and striking scene. Half-a-dozen men of various
20553: ages, from between twenty and thirty to fifty, all shabbily dressed,
20554: most of them with clay pipes in their mouths, were listening with a
20555: look of concentrated intelligence to a man in a pepper-and-salt dress,
20556: with blonde hair, short nose, broad forehead and general breadth, who,
20557: holding his pipe slightly uplifted in the left hand, and beating his
20558: knee with the right, was just finishing a quotation from Shelley (the
20559: comparison of the avalanche in his “Prometheus Unbound”)
20560: 
20561:   “As thought by thought is piled, till some great truth
20562:   Is loosened, and the nations echo round.”
20563: 
20564: The entrance of the new-comers broke the fixity of attention, and
20565: called for re-arrangement of seats in the too narrow semicircle round
20566: the fire-place and the table holding the glasses, spare pipes and
20567: tobacco. This was the soberest of clubs; but sobriety is no reason why
20568: smoking and “taking something” should be less imperiously needed as a
20569: means of getting a decent status in company and debate. Mordecai was
20570: received with welcoming voices which had a slight cadence of compassion
20571: in them, but naturally all glances passed immediately to his companion.
20572: 
20573: “I have brought a friend who is interested in our subjects,” said
20574: Mordecai. “He has traveled and studied much.”
20575: 
20576: “Is the gentlemen anonymous? Is he a Great Unknown?” said the
20577: broad-chested quoter of Shelley, with a humorous air.
20578: 
20579: “My name is Daniel Deronda. I am unknown, but not in any sense great.”
20580: The smile breaking over the stranger’s grave face as he said this was
20581: so agreeable that there was a general indistinct murmur, equivalent to
20582: a “Hear, hear,” and the broad man said,
20583: 
20584: “You recommend the name, sir, and are welcome. Here, Mordecai, come to
20585: this corner against me,” he added, evidently wishing to give the
20586: coziest place to the one who most needed it.
20587: 
20588: Deronda was well satisfied to get a seat on the opposite side, where
20589: his general survey of the party easily included Mordecai, who remained
20590: an eminently striking object in this group of sharply-characterized
20591: figures, more than one of whom, even to Daniel’s little exercised
20592: discrimination, seemed probably of Jewish descent.
20593: 
20594: In fact pure English blood (if leech or lancet can furnish us with the
20595: precise product) did not declare itself predominantly in the party at
20596: present assembled. Miller, the broad man, an exceptional second-hand
20597: bookseller who knew the insides of books, had at least grand-parents
20598: who called themselves German, and possibly far-away ancestors who
20599: denied themselves to be Jews; Buchan, the saddler, was Scotch; Pash,
20600: the watchmaker, was a small, dark, vivacious, triple-baked Jew; Gideon,
20601: the optical instrument maker, was a Jew of the red-haired,
20602: generous-featured type easily passing for Englishmen of unusually
20603: cordial manners: and Croop, the dark-eyed shoemaker, was probably more
20604: Celtic than he knew. Only three would have been discernable everywhere
20605: as Englishmen: the wood-inlayer Goodwin, well-built, open-faced,
20606: pleasant-voiced; the florid laboratory assistant Marrables; and Lily,
20607: the pale, neat-faced copying-clerk, whose light-brown hair was set up
20608: in a small parallelogram above his well-filled forehead, and whose
20609: shirt, taken with an otherwise seedy costume, had a freshness that
20610: might be called insular, and perhaps even something narrower.
20611: 
20612: Certainly a company select of the select among poor men, being drawn
20613: together by a taste not prevalent even among the privileged heirs of
20614: learning and its institutions; and not likely to amuse any gentleman in
20615: search of crime or low comedy as the ground of interest in people whose
20616: weekly income is only divisible into shillings. Deronda, even if he had
20617: not been more than usually inclined to gravity under the influence of
20618: what was pending between him and Mordecai, would not have set himself
20619: to find food for laughter in the various shades of departure from the
20620: tone of polished society sure to be observable in the air and talk of
20621: these men who had probably snatched knowledge as most of us snatch
20622: indulgences, making the utmost of scant opportunity. He looked around
20623: him with the quiet air of respect habitual to him among equals, ordered
20624: whisky and water, and offered the contents of his cigar-case, which,
20625: characteristically enough, he always carried and hardly ever used for
20626: his own behoof, having reasons for not smoking himself, but liking to
20627: indulge others. Perhaps it was his weakness to be afraid of seeming
20628: straight-laced, and turning himself into a sort of diagram instead of a
20629: growth which can exercise the guiding attraction of fellowship. That he
20630: made a decidedly winning impression on the company was proved by their
20631: showing themselves no less at ease than before, and desirous of quickly
20632: resuming their interrupted talk.
20633: 
20634: “This is what I call one of our touch-and-go nights, sir,” said Miller,
20635: who was implicitly accepted as a sort of moderator—on addressing
20636: Deronda by way of explanation, and nodding toward each person whose
20637: name he mentioned. “Sometimes we stick pretty close to the point. But
20638: to-night our friend Pash, there, brought up the law of progress; and we
20639: got on statistics; then Lily, there, saying we knew well enough before
20640: counting that in the same state of society the same sort of things
20641: would happen, and it was no more wonder that quantities should remain
20642: the same, than that qualities should remain the same, for in relation
20643: to society numbers are qualities—the number of drunkards is a quality
20644: in society—the numbers are an index to the qualities, and give us no
20645: instruction, only setting us to consider the causes of difference
20646: between different social states—Lily saying this, we went off on the
20647: causes of social change, and when you came in I was going upon the
20648: power of ideas, which I hold to be the main transforming cause.”
20649: 
20650: “I don’t hold with you there, Miller,” said Goodwin, the inlayer, more
20651: concerned to carry on the subject than to wait for a word from the new
20652: guest. “For either you mean so many sorts of things by ideas that I get
20653: no knowledge by what you say, any more than if you said light was a
20654: cause; or else you mean a particular sort of ideas, and then I go
20655: against your meaning as too narrow. For, look at it in one way, all
20656: actions men put a bit of thought into are ideas—say, sowing seed, or
20657: making a canoe, or baking clay; and such ideas as these work themselves
20658: into life and go on growing with it, but they can’t go apart from the
20659: material that set them to work and makes a medium for them. It’s the
20660: nature of wood and stone yielding to the knife that raises the idea of
20661: shaping them, and with plenty of wood and stone the shaping will go on.
20662: I look at it, that such ideas as are mixed straight away with all the
20663: other elements of life are powerful along with ’em. The slower the
20664: mixing, the less power they have. And as to the causes of social
20665: change, I look at it in this way—ideas are a sort of parliament, but
20666: there’s a commonwealth outside and a good deal of the commonwealth is
20667: working at change without knowing what the parliament is doing.”
20668: 
20669: “But if you take ready mixing as your test of power,” said Pash, “some
20670: of the least practical ideas beat everything. They spread without being
20671: understood, and enter into the language without being thought of.”
20672: 
20673: “They may act by changing the distribution of gases,” said Marrables;
20674: “instruments are getting so fine now, men may come to register the
20675: spread of a theory by observed changes in the atmosphere and
20676: corresponding changes in the nerves.”
20677: 
20678: “Yes,” said Pash, his dark face lighting up rather impishly, “there is
20679: the idea of nationalities; I dare say the wild asses are snuffing it,
20680: and getting more gregarious.”
20681: 
20682: “You don’t share that idea?” said Deronda, finding a piquant
20683: incongruity between Pash’s sarcasm and the strong stamp of race on his
20684: features.
20685: 
20686: “Say, rather, he does not share that spirit,” said Mordecai, who had
20687: turned a melancholy glance on Pash. “Unless nationality is a feeling,
20688: what force can it have as an idea?”
20689: 
20690: “Granted, Mordecai,” said Pash, quite good-humoredly. “And as the
20691: feeling of nationality is dying, I take the idea to be no better than a
20692: ghost, already walking to announce the death.”
20693: 
20694: “A sentiment may seem to be dying and yet revive into strong life,”
20695: said Deronda. “Nations have revived. We may live to see a great
20696: outburst of force in the Arabs, who are being inspired with a new zeal.”
20697: 
20698: “Amen, amen,” said Mordecai, looking at Deronda with a delight which
20699: was the beginning of recovered energy: his attitude was more upright,
20700: his face was less worn.
20701: 
20702: “That may hold with backward nations,” said Pash, “but with us in
20703: Europe the sentiment of nationality is destined to die out. It will
20704: last a little longer in the quarters where oppression lasts, but
20705: nowhere else. The whole current of progress is setting against it.”
20706: 
20707: “Ay,” said Buchan, in a rapid thin Scotch tone which was like the
20708: letting in of a little cool air on the conversation, “ye’ve done well
20709: to bring us round to the point. Ye’re all agreed that societies
20710: change—not always and everywhere—but on the whole and in the long
20711: run. Now, with all deference, I would beg t’ observe that we have got
20712: to examine the nature of changes before we have a warrant to call them
20713: progress, which word is supposed to include a bettering, though I
20714: apprehend it to be ill-chosen for that purpose, since mere motion
20715: onward may carry us to a bog or a precipice. And the questions I would
20716: put are three: Is all change in the direction of progress? if not, how
20717: shall we discern which change is progress and which not? and thirdly,
20718: how far and in what way can we act upon the course of change so as to
20719: promote it where it is beneficial, and divert it where it is injurious?”
20720: 
20721: But Buchan’s attempt to impose his method on the talk was a failure.
20722: Lily immediately said,
20723: 
20724: “Change and progress are merged in the idea of development. The laws of
20725: development are being discovered, and changes taking place according to
20726: them are necessarily progressive; that is to say, it we have any notion
20727: of progress or improvement opposed to them, the notion is a mistake.”
20728: 
20729: “I really can’t see how you arrive at that sort of certitude about
20730: changes by calling them development,” said Deronda. “There will still
20731: remain the degrees of inevitableness in relation to our own will and
20732: acts, and the degrees of wisdom in hastening or retarding; there will
20733: still remain the danger of mistaking a tendency which should be
20734: resisted for an inevitable law that we must adjust ourselves to,—which
20735: seems to me as bad a superstition or false god as any that has been set
20736: up without the ceremonies of philosophizing.”
20737: 
20738: “That is a truth,” said Mordecai. “Woe to the men who see no place for
20739: resistance in this generation! I believe in a growth, a passage, and a
20740: new unfolding of life whereof the seed is more perfect, more charged
20741: with the elements that are pregnant with diviner form. The life of a
20742: people grows, it is knit together and yet expanded, in joy and sorrow,
20743: in thought and action; it absorbs the thought of other nations into its
20744: own forms, and gives back the thought as new wealth to the world; it is
20745: a power and an organ in the great body of the nations. But there may
20746: come a check, an arrest; memories may be stifled, and love may be faint
20747: for the lack of them; or memories may shrink into withered relics—the
20748: soul of a people, whereby they know themselves to be one, may seem to
20749: be dying for want of common action. But who shall say, ‘The fountain of
20750: their life is dried up, they shall forever cease to be a nation?’ Who
20751: shall say it? Not he who feels the life of his people stirring within
20752: his own. Shall he say, ‘That way events are wending, I will not
20753: resist?’ His very soul is resistance, and is as a seed of fire that may
20754: enkindle the souls of multitudes, and make a new pathway for events.”
20755: 
20756: “I don’t deny patriotism,” said Gideon, “but we all know you have a
20757: particular meaning, Mordecai. You know Mordecai’s way of thinking, I
20758: suppose.” Here Gideon had turned to Deronda, who sat next to him, but
20759: without waiting for an answer he went on. “I’m a rational Jew myself. I
20760: stand by my people as a sort of family relations, and I am for keeping
20761: up our worship in a rational way. I don’t approve of our people getting
20762: baptised, because I don’t believe in a Jew’s conversion to the Gentile
20763: part of Christianity. And now we have political equality, there’s no
20764: excuse for a pretense of that sort. But I am for getting rid of all of
20765: our superstitions and exclusiveness. There’s no reason now why we
20766: shouldn’t melt gradually into the populations we live among. That’s the
20767: order of the day in point of progress. I would as soon my children
20768: married Christians as Jews. And I’m for the old maxim, ‘A man’s country
20769: is where he’s well off.’”
20770: 
20771: “That country’s not so easy to find, Gideon,” said the rapid Pash, with
20772: a shrug and grimace. “You get ten shillings a-week more than I do, and
20773: have only half the number of children. If somebody will introduce a
20774: brisk trade in watches among the ‘Jerusalem wares,’ I’ll go—eh,
20775: Mordecai, what do you say?”
20776: 
20777: Deronda, all ear for these hints of Mordecai’s opinion, was inwardly
20778: wondering at his persistence in coming to this club. For an
20779: enthusiastic spirit to meet continually the fixed indifference of men
20780: familiar with the object of his enthusiasm is the acceptance of a slow
20781: martyrdom, beside which the fate of a missionary tomahawked without any
20782: considerate rejection of his doctrines seems hardly worthy of
20783: compassion. But Mordecai gave no sign of shrinking: this was a moment
20784: of spiritual fullness, and he cared more for the utterance of his faith
20785: than for its immediate reception. With a fervor which had no temper in
20786: it, but seemed rather the rush of feeling in the opportunity of speech,
20787: he answered Pash:,
20788: 
20789: “What I say is, let every man keep far away from the brotherhood and
20790: inheritance he despises. Thousands on thousands of our race have mixed
20791: with the Gentiles as Celt with Saxon, and they may inherit the blessing
20792: that belongs to the Gentile. You cannot follow them. You are one of the
20793: multitudes over this globe who must walk among the nations and be known
20794: as Jews, and with words on their lips which mean, ‘I wish I had not
20795: been born a Jew, I disown any bond with the long travail of my race, I
20796: will outdo the Gentile in mocking at our separateness,’ they all the
20797: while feel breathing on them the breath of contempt because they are
20798: Jews, and they will breathe it back poisonously. Can a fresh-made
20799: garment of citizenship weave itself straightway into the flesh and
20800: change the slow deposit of eighteen centuries? What is the citizenship
20801: of him who walks among a people he has no hardy kindred and fellowship
20802: with, and has lost the sense of brotherhood with his own race? It is a
20803: charter of selfish ambition and rivalry in low greed. He is an alien of
20804: spirit, whatever he may be in form; he sucks the blood of mankind, he
20805: is not a man, sharing in no loves, sharing in no subjection of the
20806: soul, he mocks it all. Is it not truth I speak, Pash?”
20807: 
20808: “Not exactly, Mordecai,” said Pash, “if you mean that I think the worse
20809: of myself for being a Jew. What I thank our fathers for is that there
20810: are fewer blockheads among us than among other races. But perhaps you
20811: are right in thinking the Christians don’t like me so well for it.”
20812: 
20813: “Catholics and Protestants have not liked each other much better,” said
20814: the genial Gideon. “We must wait patiently for prejudices to die out.
20815: Many of our people are on a footing with the best, and there’s been a
20816: good filtering of our blood into high families. I am for making our
20817: expectations rational.”
20818: 
20819: “And so am I!” said Mordecai, quickly, leaning forward with the
20820: eagerness of one who pleads in some decisive crisis, his long, thin
20821: hands clasped together on his lap. “I, too, claim to be a rational Jew.
20822: But what is it to be rational—what is it to feel the light of the
20823: divine reason growing stronger within and without? It is to see more
20824: and more of the hidden bonds that bind and consecrate change as a
20825: dependent growth—yea, consecrate it with kinship: the past becomes my
20826: parent and the future stretches toward me the appealing arms of
20827: children. Is it rational to drain away the sap of special kindred that
20828: makes the families of men rich in interchanged wealth, and various as
20829: the forests are various with the glory of the cedar and the palm? When
20830: it is rational to say, ‘I know not my father or my mother, let my
20831: children be aliens to me, that no prayer of mine may touch them,’ then
20832: it will be rational for the Jew to say, ‘I will seek to know no
20833: difference between me and the Gentile, I will not cherish the prophetic
20834: consciousness of our nationality—let the Hebrew cease to be, and let
20835: all his memorials be antiquarian trifles, dead as the wall-paintings of
20836: a conjectured race. Yet let his child learn by rote the speech of the
20837: Greek, where he abjures his fellow-citizens by the bravery of those who
20838: fought foremost at Marathon—let him learn to say that was noble in the
20839: Greek, that is the spirit of an immortal nation! But the Jew has no
20840: memories that bind him to action; let him laugh that his nation is
20841: degraded from a nation; let him hold the monuments of his law which
20842: carried within its frame the breath of social justice, of charity, and
20843: of household sanctities—let him hold the energy of the prophets, the
20844: patient care of the Masters, the fortitude of martyred generations, as
20845: mere stuff for a professorship. The business of the Jew in all things
20846: is to be even as the rich Gentile.’”
20847: 
20848: Mordecai threw himself back in his chair, and there was a moment’s
20849: silence. Not one member of the club shared his point of view or his
20850: emotion; but his whole personality and speech had on them the effect of
20851: a dramatic representation which had some pathos in it, though no
20852: practical consequences; and usually he was at once indulged and
20853: contradicted. Deronda’s mind went back upon what must have been the
20854: tragic pressure of outward conditions hindering this man, whose force
20855: he felt to be telling on himself, from making any world for his thought
20856: in the minds of others—like a poet among people of a strange speech,
20857: who may have a poetry of their own, but have no ear for his cadence, no
20858: answering thrill to his discovery of the latent virtues in his mother
20859: tongue.
20860: 
20861: The cool Buchan was the first to speak, and hint the loss of time. “I
20862: submit,” said he, “that ye’re traveling away from the questions I put
20863: concerning progress.”
20864: 
20865: “Say they’re levanting, Buchan,” said Miller, who liked his joke, and
20866: would not have objected to be called Voltairian. “Never mind. Let us
20867: have a Jewish night; we’ve not had one for a long while. Let us take
20868: the discussion on Jewish ground. I suppose we’ve no prejudice here;
20869: we’re all philosophers; and we like our friends Mordecai, Pash, and
20870: Gideon, as well as if they were no more kin to Abraham than the rest of
20871: us. We’re all related through Adam, until further showing to the
20872: contrary, and if you look into history we’ve all got some discreditable
20873: forefathers. So I mean no offence when I say I don’t think any great
20874: things of the part the Jewish people have played in the world. What
20875: then? I think they were iniquitously dealt by in past times. And I
20876: suppose we don’t want any men to be maltreated, white, black, brown, or
20877: yellow—I know I’ve just given my half-crown to the contrary. And that
20878: reminds me, I’ve a curious old German book—I can’t read it myself, but
20879: a friend of mine was reading out of it to me the other day—about the
20880: prejudices against the Jews, and the stories used to be told against
20881: ’em, and what do you think one was? Why, that they’re punished with a
20882: bad odor in their bodies; and _that_, says the author, date 1715 (I’ve
20883: just been pricing and marking the book this very morning)—that is
20884: true, for the ancients spoke of it. But then, he says, the other things
20885: are fables, such as that the odor goes away all at once when they’re
20886: baptized, and that every one of the ten tribes, mind you, all the ten
20887: being concerned in the crucifixion, has got a particular punishment
20888: over and above the smell:—Asher, I remember, has the right arm a
20889: handbreadth shorter than the left, and Naphthali has pig’s ears and a
20890: smell of live pork. What do you think of that? There’s been a good deal
20891: of fun made of rabbinical fables, but in point of fables my opinion is,
20892: that all over the world it’s six of one and half-a-dozen of the other.
20893: However, as I said before, I hold with the philosophers of the last
20894: century that the Jews have played no great part as a people, though
20895: Pash will have it they’re clever enough to beat all the rest of the
20896: world. But if so, I ask, why haven’t they done it?”
20897: 
20898: “For the same reason that the cleverest men in the country don’t get
20899: themselves or their ideas into Parliament,” said the ready Pash;
20900: “because the blockheads are too many for ’em.”
20901: 
20902: “That is a vain question,” said Mordecai, “whether our people would
20903: beat the rest of the world. Each nation has its own work, and is a
20904: member of the world, enriched by the work of each. But it is true, as
20905: Jehuda-ha-Levi first said, that Israel is the heart of mankind, if we
20906: mean by heart the core of affection which binds a race and its families
20907: in dutiful love, and the reverence for the human body which lifts the
20908: needs of our animal life into religion, and the tenderness which is
20909: merciful to the poor and weak and to the dumb creature that wears the
20910: yoke for us.”
20911: 
20912: “They’re not behind any nation in arrogance,” said Lily; “and if they
20913: have got in the rear, it has not been because they were over-modest.”
20914: 
20915: “Oh, every nation brags in its turn,” said Miller.
20916: 
20917: “Yes,” said Pash, “and some of them in the Hebrew text.”
20918: 
20919: “Well, whatever the Jews contributed at one time, they are a
20920: stand-still people,” said Lily. “They are the type of obstinate
20921: adherence to the superannuated. They may show good abilities when they
20922: take up liberal ideas, but as a race they have no development in them.”
20923: 
20924: “That is false!” said Mordecai, leaning forward again with his former
20925: eagerness. “Let their history be known and examined; let the seed be
20926: sifted, let its beginning be traced to the weed of the wilderness—the
20927: more glorious will be the energy that transformed it. Where else is
20928: there a nation of whom it may be as truly said that their religion and
20929: law and moral life mingled as the stream of blood in the heart and made
20930: one growth—where else a people who kept and enlarged their spiritual
20931: store at the very time when they are hated with a hatred as fierce as
20932: the forest fires that chase the wild beast from his covert? There is a
20933: fable of the Roman, that swimming to save his life he held the roll of
20934: his writings between his teeth and saved them from the waters. But how
20935: much more than that is true of our race? They struggled to keep their
20936: place among the nations like heroes—yea, when the hand was hacked off,
20937: they clung with their teeth; but when the plow and the harrow had
20938: passed over the last visible signs of their national covenant, and the
20939: fruitfulness of their land was stifled with the blood of the sowers and
20940: planters, they said, ‘The spirit is alive, let us make it a lasting
20941: habitation—lasting because movable—so that it may be carried from
20942: generation to generation, and our sons unborn may be rich in the things
20943: that have been, and possess a hope built on an unchangeable
20944: foundation.’ They said it and they wrought it, though often breathing
20945: with scant life, as in a coffin, or as lying wounded amid a heap of
20946: slain. Hooted and scared like the unknown dog, the Hebrew made himself
20947: envied for his wealth and wisdom, and was bled of them to fill the bath
20948: of Gentile luxury; he absorbed knowledge, he diffused it; his dispersed
20949: race was a new Phoenicia working the mines of Greece and carrying their
20950: products to the world. The native spirit of our tradition was not to
20951: stand still, but to use records as a seed and draw out the compressed
20952: virtues of law and prophecy; and while the Gentile, who had said, ‘What
20953: is yours is ours, and no longer yours,’ was reading the letter of our
20954: law as a dark inscription, or was turning its parchments into
20955: shoe-soles for an army rabid with lust and cruelty, our Masters were
20956: still enlarging and illuminating with fresh-fed interpretation. But the
20957: dispersion was wide, the yoke of oppression was a spiked torture as
20958: well as a load; the exile was forced afar among brutish people, where
20959: the consciousness of his race was no clearer to him than the light of
20960: the sun to our fathers in the Roman persecution, who had their
20961: hiding-place in a cave, and knew not that it was day save by the dimmer
20962: burning of their candles. What wonder that multitudes of our people are
20963: ignorant, narrow, superstitious? What wonder?”
20964: 
20965: Here Mordecai, whose seat was next the fire-place, rose and leaned his
20966: arm on the little shelf; his excitement had risen, though his voice,
20967: which had begun with unusual strength, was getting hoarser.
20968: 
20969: “What wonder? The night is unto them, that they have no vision; in
20970: their darkness they are unable to divine; the sun is gone down over the
20971: prophets, and the day is dark above them; their observances are as
20972: nameless relics. But which among the chief of the Gentile nations has
20973: not an ignorant multitude? They scorn our people’s ignorant observance;
20974: but the most accursed ignorance is that which has no observance—sunk
20975: to the cunning greed of the fox, to which all law is no more than a
20976: trap or the cry of the worrying hound. There is a degradation deep down
20977: below the memory that has withered into superstition. In the multitudes
20978: of the ignorant on three continents who observe our rites and make the
20979: confession of the divine Unity, the soul of Judaism is not dead. Revive
20980: the organic centre: let the unity of Israel which has made the growth
20981: and form of its religion be an outward reality. Looking toward a land
20982: and a polity, our dispersed people in all the ends of the earth may
20983: share the dignity of a national life which has a voice among the
20984: peoples of the East and the West—which will plant the wisdom and skill
20985: of our race so that it may be, as of old, a medium of transmission and
20986: understanding. Let that come to pass, and the living warmth will spread
20987: to the weak extremities of Israel, and superstition will vanish, not in
20988: the lawlessness of the renegade, but in the illumination of great facts
20989: which widen feeling, and make all knowledge alive as the young
20990: offspring of beloved memories.”
20991: 
20992: Mordecai’s voice had sunk, but with the hectic brilliancy of his gaze
20993: it was not the less impressive. His extraordinary excitement was
20994: certainly due to Deronda’s presence: it was to Deronda that he was
20995: speaking, and the moment had a testamentary solemnity for him which
20996: rallied all his powers. Yet the presence of those other familiar men
20997: promoted expression, for they embodied the indifference which gave a
20998: resistant energy to his speech. Not that he looked at Deronda: he
20999: seemed to see nothing immediately around him, and if any one had
21000: grasped him he would probably not have known it. Again the former words
21001: came back to Deronda’s mind,—“You must hope my hopes—see the vision I
21002: point to—behold a glory where I behold it.” They came now with
21003: gathered pathos. Before him stood, as a living, suffering reality, what
21004: hitherto he had only seen as an effort of imagination, which, in its
21005: comparative faintness, yet carried a suspicion, of being exaggerated: a
21006: man steeped in poverty and obscurity, weakened by disease, consciously
21007: within the shadow of advancing death, but living an intense life in an
21008: invisible past and future, careless of his personal lot, except for its
21009: possible making some obstruction to a conceived good which he would
21010: never share except as a brief inward vision—a day afar off, whose sun
21011: would never warm him, but into which he threw his soul’s desire, with a
21012: passion often wanting to the personal motives of healthy youth. It was
21013: something more than a grandiose transfiguration of the parental love
21014: that toils, renounces, endures, resists the suicidal promptings of
21015: despair—all because of the little ones, whose future becomes present
21016: to the yearning gaze of anxiety.
21017: 
21018: All eyes were fixed on Mordecai as he sat down again, and none with
21019: unkindness; but it happened that the one who felt the most kindly was
21020: the most prompted to speak in opposition. This was the genial and
21021: rational Gideon, who also was not without a sense that he was
21022: addressing the guest of the evening. He said,
21023: 
21024: “You have your own way of looking at things, Mordecai, and as you say,
21025: your own way seems to you rational. I know you don’t hold with the
21026: restoration of Judea by miracle, and so on; but you are as well aware
21027: as I am that the subject has been mixed with a heap of nonsense both by
21028: Jews and Christians. And as to the connection of our race with
21029: Palestine, it has been perverted by superstition till it’s as
21030: demoralizing as the old poor-law. The raff and scum go there to be
21031: maintained like able-bodied paupers, and to be taken special care of by
21032: the angel Gabriel when they die. It’s no use fighting against facts. We
21033: must look where they point; that’s what I call rationality. The most
21034: learned and liberal men among us who are attached to our religion are
21035: for clearing our liturgy of all such notions as a literal fulfillment
21036: of the prophecies about restoration, and so on. Prune it of a few
21037: useless rites and literal interpretations of that sort, and our
21038: religion is the simplest of all religions, and makes no barrier, but a
21039: union, between us and the rest of the world.”
21040: 
21041: “As plain as a pike-staff,” said Pash, with an ironical laugh. “You
21042: pluck it up by the roots, strip off the leaves and bark, shave off the
21043: knots, and smooth it at top and bottom; put it where you will, it will
21044: do no harm, it will never sprout. You may make a handle of it, or you
21045: may throw it on the bonfire of scoured rubbish. I don’t see why our
21046: rubbish is to be held sacred any more than the rubbish of Brahmanism or
21047: Buddhism.”
21048: 
21049: “No,” said Mordecai, “no, Pash, because you have lost the heart of the
21050: Jew. Community was felt before it was called good. I praise no
21051: superstition, I praise the living fountains of enlarging belief. What
21052: is growth, completion, development? You began with that question, I
21053: apply it to the history of our people. I say that the effect of our
21054: separateness will not be completed and have its highest transformation
21055: unless our race takes on again the character of a nationality. That is
21056: the fulfillment of the religious trust that moulded them into a people,
21057: whose life has made half the inspiration of the world. What is it to me
21058: that the ten tribes are lost untraceably, or that multitudes of the
21059: children of Judah have mixed themselves with the Gentile populations as
21060: a river with rivers? Behold our people still! Their skirts spread afar;
21061: they are torn and soiled and trodden on; but there is a jeweled
21062: breastplate. Let the wealthy men, the monarchs of commerce, the learned
21063: in all knowledge, the skilful in all arts, the speakers, the political
21064: counselors, who carry in their veins the Hebrew blood which has
21065: maintained its vigor in all climates, and the pliancy of the Hebrew
21066: genius for which difficulty means new device—let them say, ‘we will
21067: lift up a standard, we will unite in a labor hard but glorious like
21068: that of Moses and Ezra, a labor which shall be a worthy fruit of the
21069: long anguish whereby our fathers maintained their separateness,
21070: refusing the ease of falsehood.’ They have wealth enough to redeem the
21071: soil from debauched and paupered conquerors; they have the skill of the
21072: statesman to devise, the tongue of the orator to persuade. And is there
21073: no prophet or poet among us to make the ears of Christian Europe tingle
21074: with shame at the hideous obloquy of Christian strife which the Turk
21075: gazes at as at the fighting of beasts to which he has lent an arena?
21076: There is store of wisdom among us to found a new Jewish polity, grand,
21077: simple, just, like the old—a republic where there is equality of
21078: protection, an equality which shone like a star on the forehead of our
21079: ancient community, and gave it more than the brightness of Western
21080: freedom amid the despotisms of the East. Then our race shall have an
21081: organic centre, a heart and brain to watch and guide and execute; the
21082: outraged Jew shall have a defense in the court of nations, as the
21083: outraged Englishmen of America. And the world will gain as Israel
21084: gains. For there will be a community in the van of the East which
21085: carries the culture and the sympathies of every great nation in its
21086: bosom: there will be a land set for a halting-place of enmities, a
21087: neutral ground for the East as Belgium is for the West. Difficulties? I
21088: know there are difficulties. But let the spirit of sublime achievement
21089: move in the great among our people, and the work will begin.”
21090: 
21091: “Ay, we may safely admit that, Mordecai,” said Pash. “When there are
21092: great men on ’Change, and high-flying professors converted to your
21093: doctrine, difficulties will vanish like smoke.”
21094: 
21095: Deronda, inclined by nature to take the side of those on whom the
21096: arrows of scorn were falling, could not help replying to Pash’s
21097: outfling, and said,
21098: 
21099: “If we look back to the history of efforts which have made great
21100: changes, it is astonishing how many of them seemed hopeless to those
21101: who looked on in the beginning.
21102: 
21103: “Take what we have all heard and seen something of—the effort after
21104: the unity of Italy, which we are sure soon to see accomplished to the
21105: very last boundary. Look into Mazzini’s account of his first yearning,
21106: when he was a boy, after a restored greatness and a new freedom to
21107: Italy, and of his first efforts as a young man to rouse the same
21108: feelings in other young men, and get them to work toward a united
21109: nationality. Almost everything seemed against him; his countrymen were
21110: ignorant or indifferent, governments hostile, Europe incredulous. Of
21111: course the scorners often seemed wise. Yet you see the prophecy lay
21112: with him. As long as there is a remnant of national consciousness, I
21113: suppose nobody will deny that there may be a new stirring of memories
21114: and hopes which may inspire arduous action.”
21115: 
21116: “Amen,” said Mordecai, to whom Deronda’s words were a cordial. “What is
21117: needed is the leaven—what is needed is the seed of fire. The heritage
21118: of Israel is beating in the pulses of millions; it lives in their veins
21119: as a power without understanding, like the morning exultation of herds;
21120: it is the inborn half of memory, moving as in a dream among writings on
21121: the walls, which it sees dimly but cannot divide into speech. Let the
21122: torch of visible community be lit! Let the reason of Israel disclose
21123: itself in a great outward deed, and let there be another great
21124: migration, another choosing of Israel to be a nationality whose members
21125: may still stretch to the ends of the earth, even as the sons of England
21126: and Germany, whom enterprise carries afar, but who still have a
21127: national hearth and a tribunal of national opinion. Will any say ‘It
21128: cannot be’? Baruch Spinoza had not a faithful Jewish heart, though he
21129: had sucked the life of his intellect at the breasts of Jewish
21130: tradition. He laid bare his father’s nakedness and said, ‘They who
21131: scorn him have the higher wisdom.’ Yet Baruch Spinoza confessed, he saw
21132: not why Israel should not again be a chosen nation. Who says that the
21133: history and literature of our race are dead? Are they not as living as
21134: the history and literature of Greece and Rome, which have inspired
21135: revolutions, enkindled the thought of Europe, and made the unrighteous
21136: powers tremble? These were an inheritance dug from the tomb. Ours is an
21137: inheritance that has never ceased to quiver in millions of human
21138: frames.”
21139: 
21140: Mordecai had stretched his arms upward, and his long thin hands
21141: quivered in the air for a moment after he had ceased to speak. Gideon
21142: was certainly a little moved, for though there was no long pause before
21143: he made a remark in objection, his tone was more mild and deprecatory
21144: than before; Pash, meanwhile, pressing his lips together, rubbing his
21145: black head with both his hands and wrinkling his brow horizontally,
21146: with the expression of one who differs from every speaker, but does not
21147: think it worth while to say so. There is a sort of human paste that
21148: when it comes near the fire of enthusiasm is only baked into harder
21149: shape.
21150: 
21151: “It may seem well enough on one side to make so much of our memories
21152: and inheritance as you do, Mordecai,” said Gideon; “but there’s another
21153: side. It isn’t all gratitude and harmless glory. Our people have
21154: inherited a good deal of hatred. There’s a pretty lot of curses still
21155: flying about, and stiff settled rancor inherited from the times of
21156: persecution. How will you justify keeping one sort of memory and
21157: throwing away the other? There are ugly debts standing on both sides.”
21158: 
21159: “I justify the choice as all other choice is justified,” said Mordecai.
21160: “I cherish nothing for the Jewish nation, I seek nothing for them, but
21161: the good which promises good to all the nations. The spirit of our
21162: religious life, which is one with our national life, is not hatred of
21163: aught but wrong. The Master has said, an offence against man is worse
21164: than an offence against God. But what wonder if there is hatred in the
21165: breasts of Jews, who are children of the ignorant and oppressed—what
21166: wonder, since there is hatred in the breasts of Christians? Our
21167: national life was a growing light. Let the central fire be kindled
21168: again, and the light will reach afar. The degraded and scorned of our
21169: race will learn to think of their sacred land, not as a place for
21170: saintly beggary to await death in loathsome idleness, but as a republic
21171: where the Jewish spirit manifests itself in a new order founded on the
21172: old, purified and enriched by the experience our greatest sons have
21173: gathered from the life of the ages. How long is it?—only two centuries
21174: since a vessel carried over the ocean the beginning of the great North
21175: American nation. The people grew like meeting waters—they were various
21176: in habit and sect—there came a time, a century ago, when they needed a
21177: polity, and there were heroes of peace among them. What had they to
21178: form a polity with but memories of Europe, corrected by the vision of a
21179: better? Let our wise and wealthy show themselves heroes. They have the
21180: memories of the East and West, and they have the full vision of a
21181: better. A new Persia with a purified religion magnified itself in art
21182: and wisdom. So will a new Judea, poised between East and West—a
21183: covenant of reconciliation. Will any say, the prophetic vision of your
21184: race has been hopelessly mixed with folly and bigotry: the angel of
21185: progress has no message for Judaism—it is a half-buried city for the
21186: paid workers to lay open—the waters are rushing by it as a forsaken
21187: field? I say that the strongest principle of growth lies in human
21188: choice. The sons of Judah have to choose that God may again choose
21189: them. The Messianic time is the time when Israel shall will the
21190: planting of the national ensign. The Nile overflowed and rushed onward:
21191: the Egyptian could not choose the overflow, but he chose to work and
21192: make channels for the fructifying waters, and Egypt became the land of
21193: corn. Shall man, whose soul is set in the royalty of discernment and
21194: resolve, deny his rank and say, I am an onlooker, ask no choice or
21195: purpose of me? That is the blasphemy of this time. The divine principle
21196: of our race is action, choice, resolved memory. Let us contradict the
21197: blasphemy, and help to will our own better future and the better future
21198: of the world—not renounce our higher gift and say, ‘Let us be as if we
21199: were not among the populations;’ but choose our full heritage, claim
21200: the brotherhood of our nation, and carry into it a new brotherhood with
21201: the nations of the Gentiles. The vision is there; it will be fulfilled.”
21202: 
21203: With the last sentence, which was no more than a loud whisper, Mordecai
21204: let his chin sink on his breast and his eyelids fall. No one spoke. It
21205: was not the first time that he had insisted on the same ideas, but he
21206: was seen to-night in a new phase. The quiet tenacity of his ordinary
21207: self differed as much from his present exaltation of mood as a man in
21208: private talk, giving reasons for a revolution of which no sign is
21209: discernable, differs from one who feels himself an agent in a
21210: revolution begun. The dawn of fulfillment brought to his hope by
21211: Deronda’s presence had wrought Mordecai’s conception into a state of
21212: impassioned conviction, and he had found strength in his excitement to
21213: pour forth the unlocked floods of emotive argument, with a sense of
21214: haste as at a crisis which must be seized. But now there had come with
21215: the quiescence of fatigue a sort of thankful wonder that he had
21216: spoken—a contemplation of his life as a journey which had come at last
21217: to this bourne. After a great excitement, the ebbing strength of
21218: impulse is apt to leave us in this aloofness from our active self. And
21219: in the moments after Mordecai had sunk his head, his mind was wandering
21220: along the paths of his youth, and all the hopes which had ended in
21221: bringing him hither.
21222: 
21223: Every one felt that the talk was ended, and the tone of phlegmatic
21224: discussion made unseasonable by Mordecai’s high-pitched solemnity. It
21225: was as if they had come together to hear the blowing of the _shophar_,
21226: and had nothing to do now but to disperse. The movement was unusually
21227: general, and in less than ten minutes the room was empty of all except
21228: Mordecai and Deronda. “Good-nights” had been given to Mordecai, but it
21229: was evident he had not heard them, for he remained rapt and motionless.
21230: Deronda would not disturb this needful rest, but waited for a
21231: spontaneous movement.
21232: 
21233: 
21234: 
21235: 
21236: CHAPTER XLIII.
21237: 
21238:   “My spirit is too weak; mortality
21239:   Weighs heavily on me like unwilling sleep,
21240:   And each imagined pinnacle and steep
21241:   Of godlike hardship tells me I must die
21242:   Like a sick eagle looking at the sky.”
21243:                                     —KEATS.
21244: 
21245: 
21246: After a few minutes the unwonted stillness had penetrated Mordecai’s
21247: consciousness, and he looked up at Deronda, not in the least with
21248: bewilderment and surprise, but with a gaze full of reposing
21249: satisfaction. Deronda rose and placed his chair nearer, where there
21250: could be no imagined need for raising the voice. Mordecai felt the
21251: action as a patient feels the gentleness that eases his pillow. He
21252: began to speak in a low tone, as if he were only thinking articulately,
21253: not trying to reach an audience.
21254: 
21255: “In the doctrine of the Cabbala, souls are born again and again in new
21256: bodies till they are perfected and purified, and a soul liberated from
21257: a worn-out body may join the fellow-soul that needs it, that they may
21258: be perfected together, and their earthly work accomplished. Then they
21259: will depart from the mortal region, and leave place for new souls to be
21260: born out of the store in the eternal bosom. It is the lingering
21261: imperfection of the souls already born into the mortal region that
21262: hinders the birth of new souls and the preparation of the Messianic
21263: time:—thus the mind has given shape to what is hidden, as the shadow
21264: of what is known, and has spoken truth, though it were only in parable.
21265: When my long-wandering soul is liberated from this weary body, it will
21266: join yours, and its work will be perfected.”
21267: 
21268: Mordecai’s pause seemed an appeal which Deronda’s feeling would not let
21269: him leave unanswered. He tried to make it truthful; but for Mordecai’s
21270: ear it was inevitably filled with unspoken meaning. He only said,
21271: 
21272: “Everything I can in conscience do to make your life effective I will
21273: do.”
21274: 
21275: “I know it,” said Mordecai, in a tone of quiet certainty which
21276: dispenses with further assurance. “I heard it. You see it all—you are
21277: by my side on the mount of vision, and behold the paths of fulfillment
21278: which others deny.”
21279: 
21280: He was silent a moment or two, and then went on meditatively,
21281: 
21282: “You will take up my life where it was broken. I feel myself back in
21283: that day when my life was broken. The bright morning sun was on the
21284: quay—it was at Trieste—the garments of men from all nations shone
21285: like jewels—the boats were pushing off—the Greek vessel that would
21286: land us at Beyrout was to start in an hour. I was going with a merchant
21287: as his clerk and companion. I said, I shall behold the lands and people
21288: of the East, and I shall speak with a fuller vision. I breathed then as
21289: you do, without labor; I had the light step and the endurance of youth,
21290: I could fast, I could sleep on the hard ground. I had wedded poverty,
21291: and I loved my bride—for poverty to me was freedom. My heart exulted
21292: as if it had been the heart of Moses ben Maimon, strong with the
21293: strength of three score years, and knowing the work that was to fill
21294: them. It was the first time I had been south; the soul within me felt
21295: its former sun; and standing on the quay, where the ground I stood on
21296: seemed to send forth light, and the shadows had an azure glory as of
21297: spirits become visible, I felt myself in the flood of a glorious life,
21298: wherein my own small year-counted existence seemed to melt, so that I
21299: knew it not; and a great sob arose within me as at the rush of waters
21300: that were too strong a bliss. So I stood there awaiting my companion;
21301: and I saw him not till he said: ‘Ezra, I have been to the post and
21302: there is your letter.’”
21303: 
21304: “Ezra!” exclaimed Deronda, unable to contain himself.
21305: 
21306: “Ezra,” repeated Mordecai, affirmatively, engrossed in memory. “I was
21307: expecting a letter; for I wrote continually to my mother. And that
21308: sound of my name was like the touch of a wand that recalled me to the
21309: body wherefrom I had been released as it were to mingle with the ocean
21310: of human existence, free from the pressure of individual bondage. I
21311: opened the letter; and the name came again as a cry that would have
21312: disturbed me in the bosom of heaven, and made me yearn to reach where
21313: that sorrow was—‘Ezra, my son!’”
21314: 
21315: Mordecai paused again, his imagination arrested by the grasp of that
21316: long-passed moment. Deronda’s mind was almost breathlessly suspended on
21317: what was coming. A strange possibility had suddenly presented itself.
21318: Mordecai’s eyes were cast down in abstracted contemplation, and in a
21319: few moments he went on,
21320: 
21321: “She was a mother of whom it might have come—yea, might have come to
21322: be said, ‘Her children arise up and call her blessed.’ In her I
21323: understood the meaning of that Master who, perceiving the footsteps of
21324: his mother, rose up and said, ‘The Majesty of the Eternal cometh near!’
21325: And that letter was her cry from the depths of anguish and
21326: desolation—the cry of a mother robbed of her little ones. I was her
21327: eldest. Death had taken four babes one after the other. Then came,
21328: late, my little sister, who was, more than all the rest, the desire of
21329: my mother’s eyes; and the letter was a piercing cry to me—‘Ezra, my
21330: son, I am robbed of her. He has taken her away and left disgrace
21331: behind. They will never come again.’”—Here Mordecai lifted his eyes
21332: suddenly, laid his hand on Deronda’s arm, and said, “Mine was the lot
21333: of Israel. For the sin of the father my soul must go into exile. For
21334: the sin of the father the work was broken, and the day of fulfilment
21335: delayed. She who bore me was desolate, disgraced, destitute. I turned
21336: back. On the instant I turned—her spirit and the spirit of her
21337: fathers, who had worthy Jewish hearts, moved within me, and drew me.
21338: God, in whom dwells the universe, was within me as the strength of
21339: obedience. I turned and traveled with hardship—to save the scant money
21340: which she would need. I left the sunshine, and traveled into freezing
21341: cold. In the last stage I spent a night in exposure to cold and snow.
21342: And that was the beginning of this slow death.”
21343: 
21344: Mordecai let his eyes wander again and removed his hand. Deronda
21345: resolutely repressed the questions which urged themselves within him.
21346: While Mordecai was in this state of emotion, no other confidence must
21347: be sought than what came spontaneously: nay, he himself felt a kindred
21348: emotion which made him dread his own speech as too momentous.
21349: 
21350: “But I worked. We were destitute—every thing had been seized. And she
21351: was ill: the clutch of anguish was too strong for her, and wrought with
21352: some lurking disease. At times she could not stand for the beating of
21353: her heart, and the images in her brain became as chambers of terror,
21354: where she beheld my sister reared in evil. In the dead of night I heard
21355: her crying for her child. Then I rose, and we stretched forth our arms
21356: together and prayed. We poured forth our souls in desire that Mirah
21357: might be delivered from evil.”
21358: 
21359: “Mirah?” Deronda repeated, wishing to assure, himself that his ears had
21360: not been deceived by a forecasting imagination. “Did you say Mirah?”
21361: 
21362: “That was my little sister’s name. After we had prayed for her, my
21363: mother would rest awhile. It lasted hardly four years, and in the
21364: minute before she died, we were praying the same prayer—I aloud, she
21365: silently. Her soul went out upon its wings.”
21366: 
21367: “Have you never since heard of your sister?” said Deronda, as quietly
21368: as he could.
21369: 
21370: “Never. Never have I heard whether she was delivered according to our
21371: prayer. I know not, I know not. Who shall say where the pathways lie?
21372: The poisonous will of the wicked is strong. It poisoned my life—it is
21373: slowly stifling this breath. Death delivered my mother, and I felt it a
21374: blessedness that I was alone in the winters of suffering. But what are
21375: the winters now?—they are far off”—here Mordecai again rested his
21376: hand on Deronda’s arm, and looked at him with that joy of the hectic
21377: patient which pierces us to sadness—“there is nothing to wail in the
21378: withering of my body. The work will be the better done. Once I said the
21379: work of this beginning was mine, I am born to do it. Well, I shall do
21380: it. I shall live in you. I shall live in you.”
21381: 
21382: His grasp had become convulsive in its force, and Deronda, agitated as
21383: he had never been before—the certainty that this was Mirah’s brother
21384: suffusing his own strange relation to Mordecai with a new solemnity and
21385: tenderness—felt his strong young heart beating faster and his lips
21386: paling. He shrank from speech. He feared, in Mordecai’s present state
21387: of exaltation (already an alarming strain on his feeble frame), to
21388: utter a word of revelation about Mirah. He feared to make an answer
21389: below that high pitch of expectation which resembled a flash from a
21390: dying fire, making watchers fear to see it die the faster. His dominant
21391: impulse was to do as he had once done before: he laid his firm, gentle
21392: hand on the hand that grasped him. Mordecai’s, as if it had a soul of
21393: its own—for he was not distinctly willing to do what he did—relaxed
21394: its grasp, and turned upward under Deronda’s. As the two palms met and
21395: pressed each other Mordecai recovered some sense of his surroundings,
21396: and said,
21397: 
21398: “Let us go now. I cannot talk any longer.”
21399: 
21400: And in fact they parted at Cohen’s door without having spoken to each
21401: other again—merely with another pressure of the hands.
21402: 
21403: Deronda felt a weight on him which was half joy, half anxiety. The joy
21404: of finding in Mirah’s brother a nature even more than worthy of that
21405: relation to her, had the weight of solemnity and sadness; the reunion
21406: of brother and sister was in reality the first stage of a supreme
21407: parting—like that farewell kiss which resembles greeting, that last
21408: glance of love which becomes the sharpest pang of sorrow. Then there
21409: was the weight of anxiety about the revelation of the fact on both
21410: sides, and the arrangements it would be desirable to make beforehand. I
21411: suppose we should all have felt as Deronda did, without sinking into
21412: snobbishness or the notion that the primal duties of life demand a
21413: morning and an evening suit, that it was an admissible desire to free
21414: Mirah’s first meeting with her brother from all jarring outward
21415: conditions. His own sense of deliverance from the dreaded relationship
21416: of the other Cohens, notwithstanding their good nature, made him
21417: resolve if possible to keep them in the background for Mirah, until her
21418: acquaintance with them would be an unmarred rendering of gratitude for
21419: any kindness they had shown to her brother. On all accounts he wished
21420: to give Mordecai surroundings not only more suited to his frail bodily
21421: condition, but less of a hindrance to easy intercourse, even apart from
21422: the decisive prospect of Mirah’s taking up her abode with her brother,
21423: and tending him through the precious remnant of his life. In the heroic
21424: drama, great recognitions are not encumbered with these details; and
21425: certainly Deronda had as reverential an interest in Mordecai and Mirah
21426: as he could have had in the offspring of Agamemnon; but he was caring
21427: for destinies still moving in the dim streets of our earthly life, not
21428: yet lifted among the constellations, and his task presented itself to
21429: him as difficult and delicate, especially in persuading Mordecai to
21430: change his abode and habits. Concerning Mirah’s feeling and resolve he
21431: had no doubt: there would be a complete union of sentiment toward the
21432: departed mother, and Mirah would understand her brother’s greatness.
21433: Yes, greatness: that was the word which Deronda now deliberately chose
21434: to signify the impression that Mordecai had made on him. He said to
21435: himself, perhaps rather defiantly toward the more negative spirit
21436: within him, that this man, however erratic some of his interpretations
21437: might be—this consumptive Jewish workman in threadbare clothing,
21438: lodged by charity, delivering himself to hearers who took his thoughts
21439: without attaching more consequences to them than the Flemings to the
21440: ethereal chimes ringing above their market-places—had the chief
21441: elements of greatness; a mind consciously, energetically moving with
21442: the larger march of human destinies, but not the less full of
21443: conscience and tender heart for the footsteps that tread near and need
21444: a leaning-place; capable of conceiving and choosing a life’s task with
21445: far-off issues, yet capable of the unapplauded heroism which turns off
21446: the road of achievement at the call of the nearer duty whose effect
21447: lies within the beatings of the hearts that are close to us, as the
21448: hunger of the unfledged bird to the breast of its parent.
21449: 
21450: Deronda to-night was stirred with the feeling that the brief remnant
21451: of this fervid life had become his charge. He had been peculiarly
21452: wrought on by what he had seen at the club of the friendly indifference
21453: which Mordecai must have gone on encountering. His own experience of
21454: the small room that ardor can make for itself in ordinary minds had had
21455: the effect of increasing his reserve; and while tolerance was the
21456: easiest attitude to him, there was another bent in him also capable of
21457: becoming a weakness—the dislike to appear exceptional or to risk an
21458: ineffective insistence on his own opinion. But such caution appeared
21459: contemptible to him just now, when he, for the first time, saw in a
21460: complete picture and felt as a reality the lives that burn themselves
21461: out in solitary enthusiasm: martyrs of obscure circumstance, exiled in
21462: the rarity of their own minds, whose deliverances in other ears are no
21463: more than a long passionate soliloquy—unless perhaps at last, when
21464: they are nearing the invisible shores, signs of recognition and
21465: fulfilment may penetrate the cloud of loneliness; or perhaps it may be
21466: with them as with the dying Copernicus made to touch the first printed
21467: copy of his book when the sense of touch was gone, seeing it only as a
21468: dim object through the deepening dusk.
21469: 
21470: Deronda had been brought near to one of those spiritual exiles, and it
21471: was in his nature to feel the relation as a strong chain, nay, to feel
21472: his imagination moving without repugnance in the direction of
21473: Mordecai’s desires. With all his latent objection to schemes only
21474: definite in their generality and nebulous in detail—in the poise of
21475: his sentiments he felt at one with this man who had made a visionary
21476: selection of him: the lines of what may be called their emotional
21477: theory touched. He had not the Jewish consciousness, but he had a
21478: yearning, grown the stronger for the denial which had been his
21479: grievance, after the obligation of avowed filial and social ties. His
21480: feeling was ready for difficult obedience. In this way it came that he
21481: set about his new task ungrudgingly; and again he thought of Mrs.
21482: Meyrick as his chief helper. To her first he must make known the
21483: discovery of Mirah’s brother, and with her he must consult on all
21484: preliminaries of bringing the mutually lost together. Happily the best
21485: quarter for a consumptive patient did not lie too far off the small
21486: house at Chelsea, and the first office Deronda had to perform for this
21487: Hebrew prophet who claimed him as a spiritual inheritor, was to get him
21488: a healthy lodging. Such is the irony of earthly mixtures, that the
21489: heroes have not always had carpets and teacups of their own; and, seen
21490: through the open window by the mackerel-vender, may have been invited
21491: with some hopefulness to pay three hundred per cent, in the form of
21492: fourpence. However, Deronda’s mind was busy with a prospective
21493: arrangement for giving a furnished lodging some faint likeness to a
21494: refined home by dismantling his own chambers of his best old books in
21495: vellum, his easiest chair, and the bas-reliefs of Milton and Dante.
21496: 
21497: But was not Mirah to be there? What furniture can give such finish to a
21498: room as a tender woman’s face?—and is there any harmony of tints that
21499: has such stirrings of delight as the sweet modulation of her voice?
21500: Here is one good, at least, thought Deronda, that comes to Mordecai
21501: from his having fixed his imagination on me. He has recovered a perfect
21502: sister, whose affection is waiting for him.
21503: 
21504: 
21505: 
21506: 
21507: CHAPTER XLIV.
21508: 
21509:   Fairy folk a-listening
21510:   Hear the seed sprout in the spring.
21511:   And for music to their dance
21512:   Hear the hedgerows wake from trance,
21513:   Sap that trembles into buds
21514:   Sending little rhythmic floods
21515:   Of fairy sound in fairy ears.
21516:   Thus all beauty that appears
21517:   Has birth as sound to finer sense
21518:   And lighter-clad intelligence.
21519: 
21520: 
21521: And Gwendolen? She was thinking of Deronda much more than he was
21522: thinking of her—often wondering what were his ideas “about things,”
21523: and how his life was occupied. But a lap-dog would be necessarily at a
21524: loss in framing to itself the motives and adventures of doghood at
21525: large; and it was as far from Gwendolen’s conception that Deronda’s
21526: life could be determined by the historical destiny of the Jews, as that
21527: he could rise into the air on a brazen horse, and so vanish from her
21528: horizon in the form of a twinkling star.
21529: 
21530: With all the sense of inferiority that had been forced upon her, it was
21531: inevitable that she should imagine a larger place for herself in his
21532: thoughts than she actually possessed. They must be rather old and wise
21533: persons who are not apt to see their own anxiety or elation about
21534: themselves reflected in other minds; and Gwendolen, with her youth and
21535: inward solitude, may be excused for dwelling on signs of special
21536: interest in her shown by the one person who had impressed her with the
21537: feeling of submission, and for mistaking the color and proportion of
21538: those signs in the mind of Deronda.
21539: 
21540: Meanwhile, what would he tell her that she ought to do? “He said, I
21541: must get more interest in others, and more knowledge, and that I must
21542: care about the best things—but how am I to begin?” She wondered what
21543: books he would tell her to take up to her own room, and recalled the
21544: famous writers that she had either not looked into or had found the
21545: most unreadable, with a half-smiling wish that she could mischievously
21546: ask Deronda if they were not the books called “medicine for the mind.”
21547: Then she repented of her sauciness, and when she was safe from
21548: observation carried up a miscellaneous selection—Descartes, Bacon,
21549: Locke, Butler, Burke, Guizot—knowing, as a clever young lady of
21550: education, that these authors were ornaments of mankind, feeling sure
21551: that Deronda had read them, and hoping that by dipping into them all in
21552: succession, with her rapid understanding she might get a point of view
21553: nearer to his level.
21554: 
21555: But it was astonishing how little time she found for these vast mental
21556: excursions. Constantly she had to be on the scene as Mrs. Grandcourt,
21557: and to feel herself watched in that part by the exacting eyes of a
21558: husband who had found a motive to exercise his tenacity—that of making
21559: his marriage answer all the ends he chose, and with the more
21560: completeness the more he discerned any opposing will in her. And she
21561: herself, whatever rebellion might be going on within her, could not
21562: have made up her mind to failure in her representation. No feeling had
21563: yet reconciled her for a moment to any act, word, or look that would be
21564: a confession to the world: and what she most dreaded in herself was any
21565: violent impulse that would make an involuntary confession: it was the
21566: will to be silent in every other direction that had thrown the more
21567: impetuosity into her confidences toward Deronda, to whom her thought
21568: continually turned as a help against herself. Her riding, her hunting,
21569: her visiting and receiving of visits, were all performed in a spirit of
21570: achievement which served instead of zest and young gladness, so that
21571: all around Diplow, in those weeks of the new year, Mrs. Grandcourt was
21572: regarded as wearing her honors with triumph.
21573: 
21574: “She disguises it under an air of taking everything as a matter of
21575: course,” said Mrs. Arrowpoint. “A stranger might suppose that she had
21576: condescended rather than risen. I always noticed that doubleness in
21577: her.”
21578: 
21579: To her mother most of all Gwendolen was bent on acting complete
21580: satisfaction, and poor Mrs. Davilow was so far deceived that she took
21581: the unexpected distance at which she was kept, in spite of what she
21582: felt to be Grandcourt’s handsome behavior in providing for her, as a
21583: comparative indifference in her daughter, now that marriage had created
21584: new interests. To be fetched to lunch and then to dinner along with the
21585: Gascoignes, to be driven back soon after breakfast the next morning,
21586: and to have brief calls from Gwendolen in which her husband waited for
21587: her outside either on horseback or sitting in the carriage, was all the
21588: intercourse allowed to her mother.
21589: 
21590: The truth was, that the second time Gwendolen proposed to invite her
21591: mother with Mr. and Mrs. Gascoigne, Grandcourt had at first been
21592: silent, and then drawled, “We can’t be having _those people_ always.
21593: Gascoigne talks too much. Country clergy are always bores—with their
21594: confounded fuss about everything.”
21595: 
21596: That speech was full of foreboding for Gwendolen. To have her mother
21597: classed under “those people” was enough to confirm the previous dread
21598: of bringing her too near. Still, she could not give the true
21599: reasons—she could not say to her mother, “Mr. Grandcourt wants to
21600: recognize you as little as possible; and besides it is better you
21601: should not see much of my married life, else you might find out that I
21602: am miserable.” So she waived as lightly as she could every allusion to
21603: the subject; and when Mrs. Davilow again hinted the possibility of her
21604: having a house close to Ryelands, Gwendolen said, “It would not be so
21605: nice for you as being near the rectory here, mamma. We shall perhaps be
21606: very little at Ryelands. You would miss my aunt and uncle.”
21607: 
21608: And all the while this contemptuous veto of her husband’s on any
21609: intimacy with her family, making her proudly shrink from giving them
21610: the aspect of troublesome pensioners, was rousing more inward
21611: inclination toward them. She had never felt so kindly toward her uncle,
21612: so much disposed to look back on his cheerful, complacent activity and
21613: spirit of kind management, even when mistaken, as more of a comfort
21614: than the neutral loftiness which was every day chilling her. And here
21615: perhaps she was unconsciously finding some of that mental enlargement
21616: which it was hard to get from her occasional dashes into difficult
21617: authors, who instead of blending themselves with her daily agitations
21618: required her to dismiss them.
21619: 
21620: It was a delightful surprise one day when Mr. and Mrs. Gascoigne were
21621: at Offendene to see Gwendolen ride up without her husband—with the
21622: groom only. All, including the four girls and Miss Merry, seated in the
21623: dining-room at lunch, could see the welcome approach; and even the
21624: elder ones were not without something of Isabel’s romantic sense that
21625: the beautiful sister on the splendid chestnut, which held its head as
21626: if proud to bear her, was a sort of Harriet Byron or Miss Wardour
21627: reappearing out of her “happiness ever after.”
21628: 
21629: Her uncle went to the door to give her his hand, and she sprang from
21630: her horse with an air of alacrity which might well encourage that
21631: notion of guaranteed happiness; for Gwendolen was particularly bent
21632: to-day on setting her mother’s heart at rest, and her unusual sense of
21633: freedom in being able to make this visit alone enabled her to bear up
21634: under the pressure of painful facts which were urging themselves anew.
21635: The seven family kisses were not so tiresome as they used to be.
21636: 
21637: “Mr. Grandcourt is gone out, so I determined to fill up the time by
21638: coming to you, mamma,” said Gwendolen, as she laid down her hat and
21639: seated herself next to her mother; and then looking at her with a
21640: playfully monitory air, “That is a punishment to you for not wearing
21641: better lace on your head. You didn’t think I should come and detect
21642: you—you dreadfully careless-about-yourself mamma!” She gave a
21643: caressing touch to the dear head.
21644: 
21645: “Scold me, dear,” said Mrs. Davilow, her delicate worn face flushing
21646: with delight. “But I wish there was something you could eat after your
21647: ride—instead of these scraps. Let Jocosa make you a cup of chocolate
21648: in your old way. You used to like that.”
21649: 
21650: Miss Merry immediately rose and went out, though Gwendolen said, “Oh,
21651: no, a piece of bread, or one of those hard biscuits. I can’t think
21652: about eating. I am come to say good-bye.”
21653: 
21654: “What! going to Ryelands again?” said Mr. Gascoigne.
21655: 
21656: “No, we are going to town,” said Gwendolen, beginning to break up a
21657: piece of bread, but putting no morsel into her mouth.
21658: 
21659: “It is rather early to go to town,” said Mrs. Gascoigne, “and Mr.
21660: Grandcourt not in Parliament.”
21661: 
21662: “Oh, there is only one more day’s hunting to be had, and Henleigh has
21663: some business in town with lawyers, I think,” said Gwendolen. “I am
21664: very glad. I shall like to go to town.”
21665: 
21666: “You will see your house in Grosvenor Square,” said Mrs. Davilow. She
21667: and the girls were devouring with their eyes every movement of their
21668: goddess, soon to vanish.
21669: 
21670: “Yes,” said Gwendolen, in a tone of assent to the interest of that
21671: expectation. “And there is so much to be seen and done in town.”
21672: 
21673: “I wish, my dear Gwendolen,” said Mr. Gascoigne, in a kind of cordial
21674: advice, “that you would use your influence with Mr. Grandcourt to
21675: induce him to enter Parliament. A man of his position should make his
21676: weight felt in politics. The best judges are confident that the
21677: ministry will have to appeal to the country on this question of further
21678: Reform, and Mr. Grandcourt should be ready for the opportunity. I am
21679: not quite sure that his opinions and mine accord entirely; I have not
21680: heard him express himself very fully. But I don’t look at the matter
21681: from that point of view. I am thinking of your husband’s standing in
21682: the country. And he has now come to that stage of life when a man like
21683: him should enter into public affairs. A wife has great influence with
21684: her husband. Use yours in that direction, my dear.”
21685: 
21686: The rector felt that he was acquitting himself of a duty here, and
21687: giving something like the aspect of a public benefit to his niece’s
21688: match. To Gwendolen the whole speech had the flavor of bitter comedy.
21689: If she had been merry, she must have laughed at her uncle’s explanation
21690: to her that he had not heard Grandcourt express himself very fully on
21691: politics. And the wife’s great influence! General maxims about husbands
21692: and wives seemed now of a precarious usefulness. Gwendolen herself had
21693: once believed in her future influence as an omnipotence in
21694: managing—she did not know exactly what. But her chief concern at
21695: present was to give an answer that would be felt appropriate.
21696: 
21697: “I should be very glad, uncle. But I think Mr. Grandcourt would not
21698: like the trouble of an election—at least, unless it could be without
21699: his making speeches. I thought candidates always made speeches.”
21700: 
21701: “Not necessarily—to any great extent,” said Mr. Gascoigne. “A man of
21702: position and weight can get on without much of it. A county member need
21703: have very little trouble in that way, and both out of the House and in
21704: it is liked the better for not being a speechifier. Tell Mr. Grandcourt
21705: that I say so.”
21706: 
21707: “Here comes Jocosa with my chocolate after all,” said Gwendolen,
21708: escaping from a promise to give information that would certainly have
21709: been received in a way inconceivable to the good rector, who, pushing
21710: his chair a little aside from the table and crossing his leg, looked as
21711: well as if he felt like a worthy specimen of a clergyman and magistrate
21712: giving experienced advice. Mr. Gascoigne had come to the conclusion
21713: that Grandcourt was a proud man, but his own self-love, calmed through
21714: life by the consciousness of his general value and personal advantages,
21715: was not irritable enough to prevent him from hoping the best about his
21716: niece’s husband because her uncle was kept rather haughtily at a
21717: distance. A certain aloofness must be allowed to the representative of
21718: an old family; you would not expect him to be on intimate terms even
21719: with abstractions. But Mrs. Gascoigne was less dispassionate on her
21720: husband’s account, and felt Grandcourt’s haughtiness as something a
21721: little blameable in Gwendolen.
21722: 
21723: “Your uncle and Anna will very likely be in town about Easter,” she
21724: said, with a vague sense of expressing a slight discontent. “Dear Rex
21725: hopes to come out with honors and a fellowship, and he wants his father
21726: and Anna to meet him in London, that they may be jolly together, as he
21727: says. I shouldn’t wonder if Lord Brackenshaw invited them, he has been
21728: so very kind since he came back to the Castle.”
21729: 
21730: “I hope my uncle will bring Ann to stay in Grosvenor Square,” said
21731: Gwendolen, risking herself so far, for the sake of the present moment,
21732: but in reality wishing that she might never be obliged to bring any of
21733: her family near Grandcourt again. “I am very glad of Rex’s good
21734: fortune.”
21735: 
21736: “We must not be premature, and rejoice too much beforehand,” said the
21737: rector, to whom this topic was the happiest in the world, and
21738: altogether allowable, now that the issue of that little affair about
21739: Gwendolen had been so satisfactory. “Not but that I am in
21740: correspondence with impartial judges, who have the highest hopes about
21741: my son, as a singularly clear-headed young man. And of his excellent
21742: disposition and principle I have had the best evidence.”
21743: 
21744: “We shall have him a great lawyer some time,” said Mrs. Gascoigne.
21745: 
21746: “How very nice!” said Gwendolen, with a concealed scepticism as to
21747: niceness in general, which made the word quite applicable to lawyers.
21748: 
21749: “Talking of Lord Brackenshaw’s kindness,” said Mrs. Davilow, “you don’t
21750: know how delightful he has been, Gwendolen. He has begged me to
21751: consider myself his guest in this house till I can get another that I
21752: like—he did it in the most graceful way. But now a house has turned
21753: up. Old Mr. Jodson is dead, and we can have his house. It is just what
21754: I want; small, but with nothing hideous to make you miserable thinking
21755: about it. And it is only a mile from the Rectory. You remember the low
21756: white house nearly hidden by the trees, as we turn up the lane to the
21757: church?”
21758: 
21759: “Yes, but you have no furniture, poor mamma,” said Gwendolen, in a
21760: melancholy tone.
21761: 
21762: “Oh, I am saving money for that. You know who has made me rather rich,
21763: dear,” said Mrs. Davilow, laying her hand on Gwendolen’s. “And Jocosa
21764: really makes so little do for housekeeping—it is quite wonderful.”
21765: 
21766: “Oh, please let me go up-stairs with you and arrange my hat, mamma,”
21767: said Gwendolen, suddenly putting up her hand to her hair and perhaps
21768: creating a desired disarrangement. Her heart was swelling, and she was
21769: ready to cry. Her mother _must_ have been worse off, if it had not been
21770: for Grandcourt. “I suppose I shall never see all this again,” said
21771: Gwendolen, looking round her, as they entered the black and yellow
21772: bedroom, and then throwing herself into a chair in front of the glass
21773: with a little groan as of bodily fatigue. In the resolve not to cry she
21774: had become very pale.
21775: 
21776: “You are not well, dear?” said Mrs. Davilow.
21777: 
21778: “No; that chocolate has made me sick,” said Gwendolen, putting up her
21779: hand to be taken.
21780: 
21781: “I should be allowed to come to you if you were ill, darling,” said
21782: Mrs. Davilow, rather timidly, as she pressed the hand to her bosom.
21783: Something had made her sure to-day that her child loved her—needed her
21784: as much as ever.
21785: 
21786: “Oh, yes,” said Gwendolen, leaning her head against her mother, though
21787: speaking as lightly as she could. “But you know I never am ill. I am as
21788: strong as possible; and you must not take to fretting about me, but
21789: make yourself as happy as you can with the girls. They are better
21790: children to you than I have been, you know.” She turned up her face
21791: with a smile.
21792: 
21793: “You have always been good, my darling. I remember nothing else.”
21794: 
21795: “Why, what did I ever do that was good to you, except marry Mr.
21796: Grandcourt?” said Gwendolen, starting up with a desperate resolve to be
21797: playful, and keep no more on the perilous edge of agitation. “And I
21798: should not have done that unless it had pleased myself.” She tossed up
21799: her chin, and reached her hat.
21800: 
21801: “God forbid, child! I would not have had you marry for my sake. Your
21802: happiness by itself is half mine.”
21803: 
21804: “Very well,” said Gwendolen, arranging her hat fastidiously, “then you
21805: will please to consider that you are half happy, which is more than I
21806: am used to seeing you.” With the last words she again turned with her
21807: old playful smile to her mother. “Now I am ready; but oh, mamma, Mr.
21808: Grandcourt gives me a quantity of money, and expects me to spend it,
21809: and I can’t spend it; and you know I can’t bear charity children and
21810: all that; and here are thirty pounds. I wish the girls would spend it
21811: for me on little things for themselves when you go to the new house.
21812: Tell them so.” Gwendolen put the notes into her mother’s hands and
21813: looked away hastily, moving toward the door.
21814: 
21815: “God bless you, dear,” said Mrs. Davilow. “It will please them so that
21816: you should have thought of them in particular.”
21817: 
21818: “Oh, they are troublesome things; but they don’t trouble me now,” said
21819: Gwendolen, turning and nodding playfully. She hardly understood her own
21820: feeling in this act toward her sisters, but at any rate she did not
21821: wish it to be taken as anything serious. She was glad to have got out
21822: of the bedroom without showing more signs of emotion, and she went
21823: through the rest of her visit and all the good-byes with a quiet
21824: propriety that made her say to herself sarcastically as she rode away,
21825: “I think I am making a very good Mrs. Grandcourt.”
21826: 
21827: She believed that her husband had gone to Gadsmere that day—had
21828: inferred this, as she had long ago inferred who were the inmates of
21829: what he had described as “a dog-hutch of a place in a black country;”
21830: and the strange conflict of feeling within her had had the
21831: characteristic effect of sending her to Offendene with a tightened
21832: resolve—a form of excitement which was native to her.
21833: 
21834: She wondered at her own contradictions. Why should she feel it bitter
21835: to her that Grandcourt showed concern for the beings on whose account
21836: she herself was undergoing remorse? Had she not before her marriage
21837: inwardly determined to speak and act on their behalf?—and since he had
21838: lately implied that he wanted to be in town because he was making
21839: arrangements about his will, she ought to have been glad of any sign
21840: that he kept a conscience awake toward those at Gadsmere; and yet, now
21841: that she was a wife, the sense that Grandcourt was gone to Gadsmere was
21842: like red heat near a burn. She had brought on herself this indignity in
21843: her own eyes—this humiliation of being doomed to a terrified silence
21844: lest her husband should discover with what sort of consciousness she
21845: had married him; and as she had said to Deronda, she “must go on.”
21846: After the intense moments of secret hatred toward this husband who from
21847: the very first had cowed her, there always came back the spiritual
21848: pressure which made submission inevitable. There was no effort at
21849: freedoms that would not bring fresh and worse humiliation. Gwendolen
21850: could dare nothing except an impulsive action—least of all could she
21851: dare premeditatedly a vague future in which the only certain condition
21852: was indignity. In spite of remorse, it still seemed the worst result of
21853: her marriage that she should in any way make a spectacle of herself;
21854: and her humiliation was lightened by her thinking that only Mrs.
21855: Glasher was aware of the fact which caused it. For Gwendolen had never
21856: referred the interview at the Whispering Stones to Lush’s agency; her
21857: disposition to vague terror investing with shadowy omnipresence any
21858: threat of fatal power over her, and so hindering her from imagining
21859: plans and channels by which news had been conveyed to the woman who had
21860: the poisoning skill of a sorceress. To Gwendolen’s mind the secret lay
21861: with Mrs. Glasher, and there were words in the horrible letter which
21862: implied that Mrs. Glasher would dread disclosure to the husband, as
21863: much as the usurping Mrs. Grandcourt.
21864: 
21865: Something else, too, she thought of as more of a secret from her
21866: husband than it really was—namely that suppressed struggle of
21867: desperate rebellion which she herself dreaded. Grandcourt could not
21868: indeed fully imagine how things affected Gwendolen: he had no
21869: imagination of anything in her but what affected the gratification of
21870: his own will; but on this point he had the sensibility which seems like
21871: divination. What we see exclusively we are apt to see with some mistake
21872: of proportions; and Grandcourt was not likely to be infallible in his
21873: judgments concerning this wife who was governed by many shadowy powers,
21874: to him nonexistent. He magnified her inward resistance, but that did
21875: not lessen his satisfaction in the mastery of it.
21876: 
21877: 
21878: 
21879: 
21880: CHAPTER XLV.
21881: 
21882:   Behold my lady’s carriage stop the way.
21883:   With powdered lacquey and with charming bay;
21884:   She sweeps the matting, treads the crimson stair.
21885:   Her arduous function solely “to be there.”
21886:   Like Sirius rising o’er the silent sea.
21887:   She hides her heart in lustre loftily.
21888: 
21889: 
21890: So the Grandcourts were in Grosvenor Square in time to receive a card
21891: for the musical party at Lady Mallinger’s, there being reasons of
21892: business which made Sir Hugo know beforehand that his ill-beloved
21893: nephew was coming up. It was only the third evening after their
21894: arrival, and Gwendolen made rather an absent-minded acquaintance with
21895: her new ceilings and furniture, preoccupied with the certainty that she
21896: was going to speak to Deronda again, and also to see the Miss Lapidoth
21897: who had gone through so much, and was “capable of submitting to
21898: anything in the form of duty.” For Gwendolen had remembered nearly
21899: every word that Deronda had said about Mirah, and especially that
21900: phrase, which she repeated to herself bitterly, having an ill-defined
21901: consciousness that her own submission was something very different. She
21902: would have been obliged to allow, if any one had said it to her, that
21903: what she submitted to could not take the shape of duty, but was
21904: submission to a yoke drawn on her by an action she was ashamed of, and
21905: worn with a strength of selfish motives that left no weight for duty to
21906: carry.
21907: 
21908: The drawing-rooms in Park Lane, all white, gold, and pale crimson, were
21909: agreeably furnished, and not crowded with guests, before Mr. and Mrs.
21910: Grandcourt entered; and more than half an hour of instrumental music
21911: was being followed by an interval of movement and chat. Klesmer was
21912: there with his wife, and in his generous interest for Mirah he proposed
21913: to accompany her singing of Leo’s “_O patria mia_,” which he had before
21914: recommended her to choose, as more distinctive of her than better known
21915: music. He was already at the piano, and Mirah was standing there
21916: conspicuously, when Gwendolen, magnificent in her pale green velvet and
21917: poisoned diamonds, was ushered to a seat of honor well in view of them.
21918: With her long sight and self-command she had the rare power of quickly
21919: distinguishing persons and objects on entering a full room, and while
21920: turning her glance toward Mirah she did not neglect to exchange a bow
21921: with Klesmer as she passed. The smile seemed to each a lightning-flash
21922: back on that morning when it had been her ambition to stand as the
21923: “little Jewess” was standing, and survey a grand audience from the
21924: higher rank of her talent—instead of which she was one of the ordinary
21925: crowd in silk and gems, whose utmost performance it must be to admire
21926: or find fault. “He thinks I am in the right road now,” said the lurking
21927: resentment within her.
21928: 
21929: Gwendolen had not caught sight of Deronda in her passage, and while she
21930: was seated acquitting herself in chat with Sir Hugo, she glanced round
21931: her with careful ease, bowing a recognition here and there, and fearful
21932: lest an anxious-looking exploration in search of Deronda might be
21933: observed by her husband, and afterward rebuked as something “damnably
21934: vulgar.” But all traveling, even that of a slow gradual glance round a
21935: room, brings a liability to undesired encounters, and amongst the eyes
21936: that met Gwendolen’s, forcing her into a slight bow, were those of the
21937: “amateur too fond of Meyerbeer,” Mr. Lush, whom Sir Hugo continued to
21938: find useful as a half-caste among gentlemen. He was standing near her
21939: husband, who, however, turned a shoulder toward him, and was being
21940: understood to listen to Lord Pentreath. How was it that at this moment,
21941: for the first time, there darted through Gwendolen, like a disagreeable
21942: sensation, the idea that this man knew all about her husband’s life? He
21943: had been banished from her sight, according to her will, and she had
21944: been satisfied; he had sunk entirely into the background of her
21945: thoughts, screened away from her by the agitating figures that kept up
21946: an inward drama in which Lush had no place. Here suddenly he reappeared
21947: at her husband’s elbow, and there sprang up in her, like an
21948: instantaneously fabricated memory in a dream, the sense of his being
21949: connected with the secrets that made her wretched. She was conscious of
21950: effort in turning her head away from him, trying to continue her
21951: wandering survey as if she had seen nothing of more consequence than
21952: the picture on the wall, till she discovered Deronda. But he was not
21953: looking toward her, and she withdrew her eyes from him, without having
21954: got any recognition, consoling herself with the assurance that he must
21955: have seen her come in. In fact, he was not standing far from the door
21956: with Hans Meyrick, whom he had been careful to bring into Lady
21957: Mallinger’s list. They were both a little more anxious than was
21958: comfortable lest Mirah should not be heard to advantage. Deronda even
21959: felt himself on the brink of betraying emotion, Mirah’s presence now
21960: being linked with crowding images of what had gone before and was to
21961: come after—all centering in the brother he was soon to reveal to her;
21962: and he had escaped as soon as he could from the side of Lady Pentreath,
21963: who had said in her violoncello voice,
21964: 
21965: “Well, your Jewess is pretty—there’s no denying that. But where is her
21966: Jewish impudence? She looks as demure as a nun. I suppose she learned
21967: that on the stage.”
21968: 
21969: He was beginning to feel on Mirah’s behalf something of what he had
21970: felt for himself in his seraphic boyish time, when Sir Hugo asked him
21971: if he would like to be a great singer—an indignant dislike to her
21972: being remarked on in a free and easy way, as if she were an imported
21973: commodity disdainfully paid for by the fashionable public, and he
21974: winced the more because Mordecai, he knew, would feel that the name
21975: “Jewess” was taken as a sort of stamp like the lettering of Chinese
21976: silk. In this susceptible mood he saw the Grandcourts enter, and was
21977: immediately appealed to by Hans about “that Vandyke duchess of a
21978: beauty.” Pray excuse Deronda that in this moment he felt a transient
21979: renewal of his first repulsion from Gwendolen, as if she and her beauty
21980: and her failings were to blame for the undervaluing of Mirah as a
21981: woman—a feeling something like class animosity, which affection for
21982: what is not fully recognized by others, whether in persons or in
21983: poetry, rarely allows us to escape. To Hans admiring Gwendolen with his
21984: habitual hyperbole, he answered, with a sarcasm that was not quite
21985: good-natured,
21986: 
21987: “I thought you could admire no style of woman but your Berenice.”
21988: 
21989: “That is the style I worship—not admire,” said Hans. “Other styles of
21990: women I might make myself wicked for, but for Berenice I could make
21991: myself—well, pretty good, which is something much more difficult.”
21992: 
21993: “Hush,” said Deronda, under the pretext that the singing was going to
21994: begin. He was not so delighted with the answer as might have been
21995: expected, and was relieved by Hans’s movement to a more advanced spot.
21996: 
21997: Deronda had never before heard Mirah sing “_O patria mia_.” He knew
21998: well Leopardi’s fine Ode to Italy (when Italy sat like a disconsolate
21999: mother in chains, hiding her face on her knees and weeping), and the
22000: few selected words were filled for him with the grandeur of the whole,
22001: which seemed to breathe an inspiration through the music. Mirah singing
22002: this, made Mordecai more than ever one presence with her. Certain words
22003: not included in the song nevertheless rang within Deronda as harmonies
22004: from the invisible,
22005: 
22006:         “Non ti difende
22007:   Nessun de’ tuoi! L’armi, qua l’armi: io solo
22008:   Combatterò, procomberò sol io”—[*]
22009: 
22010:     [* Do none of thy children defend thee? Arms! bring me arms!
22011:     alone I will fight, alone I will fall.]
22012: 
22013: they seemed the very voice of that heroic passion which is falsely said
22014: to devote itself in vain when it achieves the godlike end of
22015: manifesting unselfish love. And that passion was present to Deronda now
22016: as the vivid image of a man dying helplessly away from the possibility
22017: of battle.
22018: 
22019: Mirah was equal to his wishes. While the general applause was sounding,
22020: Klesmer gave a more valued testimony, audible to her only—“Good,
22021: good—the crescendo better than before.” But her chief anxiety was to
22022: know that she had satisfied Mr. Deronda: any failure on her part this
22023: evening would have pained her as an especial injury to him. Of course
22024: all her prospects were due to what he had done for her; still, this
22025: occasion of singing in the house that was his home brought a peculiar
22026: demand. She looked toward him in the distance, and he saw that she did;
22027: but he remained where he was, and watched the streams of emulous
22028: admirers closing round her, till presently they parted to make way for
22029: Gwendolen, who was taken up to be introduced by Mrs. Klesmer. Easier
22030: now about “the little Jewess,” Daniel relented toward poor Gwendolen in
22031: her splendor, and his memory went back, with some penitence for his
22032: momentary hardness, over all the signs and confessions that she too
22033: needed a rescue, and one much more difficult than that of the wanderer
22034: by the river—a rescue for which he felt himself helpless. The silent
22035: question—“But is it not cowardly to make that a reason for turning
22036: away?” was the form in which he framed his resolve to go near her on
22037: the first opportunity, and show his regard for her past confidence, in
22038: spite of Sir Hugo’s unwelcome hints.
22039: 
22040: Klesmer, having risen to Gwendolen as she approached, and being
22041: included by her in the opening conversation with Mirah, continued near
22042: them a little while, looking down with a smile, which was rather in his
22043: eyes than on his lips, at the piquant contrast of the two charming
22044: young creatures seated on the red divan. The solicitude seemed to be
22045: all on the side of the splendid one.
22046: 
22047: “You must let me say how much I am obliged to you,” said Gwendolen. “I
22048: had heard from Mr. Deronda that I should have a great treat in your
22049: singing, but I was too ignorant to imagine how great.”
22050: 
22051: “You are very good to say so,” answered Mirah, her mind chiefly
22052: occupied in contemplating Gwendolen. It was like a new kind of
22053: stage-experience to her to be close to genuine grand ladies with
22054: genuine brilliants and complexions, and they impressed her vaguely as
22055: coming out of some unknown drama, in which their parts perhaps got more
22056: tragic as they went on.
22057: 
22058: “We shall all want to learn of you—I, at least,” said Gwendolen. “I
22059: sing very badly, as Herr Klesmer will tell you,”—here she glanced
22060: upward to that higher power rather archly, and continued—“but I have
22061: been rebuked for not liking to be middling, since I can be nothing more. I
22062: think that is a different doctrine from yours?” She was still looking
22063: at Klesmer, who said quickly,
22064: 
22065: “Not if it means that it would be worth while for you to study further,
22066: and for Miss Lapidoth to have the pleasure of helping you.” With that
22067: he moved away, and Mirah taking everything with _naïve_ seriousness,
22068: said,
22069: 
22070: “If you think I could teach you, I shall be very glad. I am anxious to
22071: teach, but I have only just begun. If I do it well, it must be by
22072: remembering how my master taught me.”
22073: 
22074: Gwendolen was in reality too uncertain about herself to be prepared for
22075: this simple promptitude of Mirah’s, and in her wish to change the
22076: subject, said, with some lapse from the good taste of her first
22077: address,
22078: 
22079: “You have not been long in London, I think?—but you were perhaps
22080: introduced to Mr. Deronda abroad?”
22081: 
22082: “No,” said Mirah; “I never saw him before I came to England in the
22083: summer.”
22084: 
22085: “But he has seen you often and heard you sing a great deal, has he
22086: not?” said Gwendolen, led on partly by the wish to hear anything about
22087: Deronda, and partly by the awkwardness which besets the readiest
22088: person, in carrying on a dialogue when empty of matter. “He spoke of
22089: you to me with the highest praise. He seemed to know you quite well.”
22090: 
22091: “Oh, I was poor and needed help,” said Mirah, in a new tone of feeling,
22092: “and Mr. Deronda has given me the best friends in the world. That is
22093: the only way he came to know anything about me—because he was sorry
22094: for me. I had no friends when I came. I was in distress. I owe
22095: everything to him.”
22096: 
22097: Poor Gwendolen, who had wanted to be a struggling artist herself, could
22098: nevertheless not escape the impression that a mode of inquiry which
22099: would have been rather rude toward herself was an amiable condescension
22100: to this Jewess who was ready to give her lessons. The only effect on
22101: Mirah, as always on any mention of Deronda, was to stir reverential
22102: gratitude and anxiety that she should be understood to have the deepest
22103: obligation to him.
22104: 
22105: But both he and Hans, who were noticing the pair from a distance, would
22106: have felt rather indignant if they had known that the conversation had
22107: led up to Mirah’s representation of herself in this light of neediness.
22108: In the movement that prompted her, however, there was an exquisite
22109: delicacy, which perhaps she could not have stated explicitly—the
22110: feeling that she ought not to allow any one to assume in Deronda a
22111: relation of more equality or less generous interest toward her than
22112: actually existed. Her answer was delightful to Gwendolen: she thought
22113: of nothing but the ready compassion which in another form she had
22114: trusted in and found herself; and on the signals that Klesmer was about
22115: to play she moved away in much content, entirely without presentiment
22116: that this Jewish _protégé_ would ever make a more important difference
22117: in her life than the possible improvement of her singing—if the
22118: leisure and spirits of a Mrs. Grandcourt would allow of other lessons
22119: than such as the world was giving her at rather a high charge.
22120: 
22121: With her wonted alternation from resolute care of appearances to some
22122: rash indulgence of an impulse, she chose, under the pretext of getting
22123: farther from the instrument, not to go again to her former seat, but
22124: placed herself on a settee where she could only have one neighbor. She
22125: was nearer to Deronda than before: was it surprising that he came up in
22126: time to shake hands before the music began—then, that after he had
22127: stood a little while by the elbow of the settee at the empty end, the
22128: torrent-like confluences of bass and treble seemed, like a convulsion
22129: of nature, to cast the conduct of petty mortals into insignificance,
22130: and to warrant his sitting down?
22131: 
22132: But when at the end of Klesmer’s playing there came the outburst of
22133: talk under which Gwendolen had hoped to speak as she would to Deronda,
22134: she observed that Mr. Lush was within hearing, leaning against the wall
22135: close by them. She could not help her flush of anger, but she tried to
22136: have only an air of polite indifference in saying,
22137: 
22138: “Miss Lapidoth is everything you described her to be.”
22139: 
22140: “You have been very quick in discovering that,” said Deronda,
22141: ironically.
22142: 
22143: “I have not found out all the excellencies you spoke of—I don’t mean
22144: that,” said Gwendolen; “but I think her singing is charming, and
22145: herself, too. Her face is lovely—not in the least common; and she is
22146: such a complete little person. I should think she will be a great
22147: success.”
22148: 
22149: This speech was grating on Deronda, and he would not answer it, but
22150: looked gravely before him. She knew that he was displeased with her,
22151: and she was getting so impatient under the neighborhood of Mr. Lush,
22152: which prevented her from saying any word she wanted to say, that she
22153: meditated some desperate step to get rid of it, and remained silent,
22154: too. That constraint seemed to last a long while, neither Gwendolen nor
22155: Deronda looking at the other, till Lush slowly relieved the wall of his
22156: weight, and joined some one at a distance.
22157: 
22158: Gwendolen immediately said, “You despise me for talking artificially.”
22159: 
22160: “No,” said Deronda, looking at her coolly; “I think that is quite
22161: excusable sometimes. But I did not think what you were last saying was
22162: altogether artificial.”
22163: 
22164: “There was something in it that displeased you,” said Gwendolen. “What
22165: was it?”
22166: 
22167: “It is impossible to explain such things,” said Deronda. “One can never
22168: communicate niceties of feeling about words and manner.”
22169: 
22170: “You think I am shut out from understanding them,” said Gwendolen, with
22171: a slight tremor in her voice, which she was trying to conquer. “Have I
22172: shown myself so very dense to everything you have said?” There was an
22173: indescribable look of suppressed tears in her eyes, which were turned
22174: on him.
22175: 
22176: “Not at all,” said Deronda, with some softening of voice. “But
22177: experience differs for different people. We don’t all wince at the same
22178: things. I have had plenty of proof that you are not dense.” He smiled
22179: at her.
22180: 
22181: “But one may feel things and are not able to do anything better for all
22182: that,” said Gwendolen, not smiling in return—the distance to which
22183: Deronda’s words seemed to throw her chilling her too much. “I begin to
22184: think we can only get better by having people about us who raise good
22185: feelings. You must not be surprised at anything in me. I think it is
22186: too late for me to alter. I don’t know how to set about being wise, as
22187: you told me to be.”
22188: 
22189: “I seldom find I do any good by my preaching. I might as well have kept
22190: from meddling,” said Deronda, thinking rather sadly that his
22191: interference about that unfortunate necklace might end in nothing but
22192: an added pain to him in seeing her after all hardened to another sort
22193: of gambling than roulette.
22194: 
22195: “Don’t say that,” said Gwendolen, hurriedly, feeling that this might be
22196: her only chance of getting the words uttered, and dreading the increase
22197: of her own agitation. “If you despair of me, I shall despair. Your
22198: saying that I should not go on being selfish and ignorant has been some
22199: strength to me. If you say you wish you had not meddled—that means you
22200: despair of me and forsake me. And then you will decide for me that I
22201: shall not be good. It is you who will decide; because you might have
22202: made me different by keeping as near to me as you could, and believing
22203: in me.”
22204: 
22205: She had not been looking at him as she spoke, but at the handle of the
22206: fan which she held closed. With the last words she rose and left him,
22207: returning to her former place, which had been left vacant; while every
22208: one was settling into quietude in expectation of Mirah’s voice, which
22209: presently, with that wonderful, searching quality of subdued song in
22210: which the melody seems simply an effect of the emotion, gave forth,
22211: _Per pietà non dirmi addio_.
22212: 
22213: In Deronda’s ear the strain was for the moment a continuance of
22214: Gwendolen’s pleading—a painful urging of something vague and
22215: difficult, irreconcilable with pressing conditions, and yet cruel to
22216: resist. However strange the mixture in her of a resolute pride and a
22217: precocious air of knowing the world, with a precipitate, guileless
22218: indiscretion, he was quite sure now that the mixture existed. Sir
22219: Hugo’s hints had made him alive to dangers that his own disposition
22220: might have neglected; but that Gwendolen’s reliance on him was
22221: unvisited by any dream of his being a man who could misinterpret her
22222: was as manifest as morning, and made an appeal which wrestled with his
22223: sense of present dangers, and with his foreboding of a growing
22224: incompatible claim on him in her mind. There was a foreshadowing of
22225: some painful collision: on the one side the grasp of Mordecai’s dying
22226: hand on him, with all the ideals and prospects it aroused; on the other
22227: the fair creature in silk and gems, with her hidden wound and her
22228: self-dread, making a trustful effort to lean and find herself
22229: sustained. It was as if he had a vision of himself besought with
22230: outstretched arms and cries, while he was caught by the waves and
22231: compelled to mount the vessel bound for a far-off coast. That was the
22232: strain of excited feeling in him that went along with the notes of
22233: Mirah’s song; but when it ceased he moved from his seat with the
22234: reflection that he had been falling into an exaggeration of his own
22235: importance, and a ridiculous readiness to accept Gwendolen’s view of
22236: himself, as if he could really have any decisive power over her.
22237: 
22238: “What an enviable fellow you are,” said Hans to him, “sitting on a sofa
22239: with that young duchess, and having an interesting quarrel with her!”
22240: 
22241: “Quarrel with her?” repeated Deronda, rather uncomfortably.
22242: 
22243: “Oh, about theology, of course; nothing personal. But she told you what
22244: you ought to think, and then left you with a grand air which was
22245: admirable. Is she an Antinomian—if so, tell her I am an Antinomian
22246: painter, and introduce me. I should like to paint her and her husband.
22247: He has the sort of handsome _physique_ that the Duke ought to have in
22248: _Lucrezia Borgia_—if it could go with a fine baritone, which it can’t.”
22249: 
22250: Deronda devoutly hoped that Hans’s account of the impression his
22251: dialogue with Gwendolen had made on a distant beholder was no more than
22252: a bit of fantastic representation, such as was common with him.
22253: 
22254: And Gwendolen was not without her after-thoughts that her husband’s
22255: eyes might have been on her, extracting something to reprove—some
22256: offence against her dignity as his wife; her consciousness telling her
22257: that she had not kept up the perfect air of equability in public which
22258: was her own ideal. But Grandcourt made no observation on her behavior.
22259: All he said as they were driving home was,
22260: 
22261: “Lush will dine with us among the other people to-morrow. You will
22262: treat him civilly.”
22263: 
22264: Gwendolen’s heart began to beat violently. The words that she wanted to
22265: utter, as one wants to return a blow, were. “You are breaking your
22266: promise to me—the first promise you made me.” But she dared not utter
22267: them. She was as frightened at a quarrel as if she had foreseen that it
22268: would end with throttling fingers on her neck. After a pause, she said
22269: in the tone rather of defeat than resentment,
22270: 
22271: “I thought you did not intend him to frequent the house again.”
22272: 
22273: “I want him just now. He is useful to me; and he must be treated
22274: civilly.”
22275: 
22276: Silence. There may come a moment when even an excellent husband who has
22277: dropped smoking under more or less of a pledge during courtship, for
22278: the first time will introduce his cigar-smoke between himself and his
22279: wife, with the tacit understanding that she will have to put up with
22280: it. Mr. Lush was, so to speak, a very large cigar.
22281: 
22282: If these are the sort of lovers’ vows at which Jove laughs, he must
22283: have a merry time of it.

22286: 
22287: 
22288: CHAPTER XLVI.
22289: 
22290:     “If any one should importune me to give a reason why I loved him, I
22291:     feel it could no otherwise be expressed than by making answer,
22292:     ‘Because it was he, because it was I.’ There is, beyond what I am able
22293:     to say, I know not what inexplicable power that brought on this
22294:     union.”—MONTAIGNE: _On Friendship_.
22295: 
22296: 
22297: The time had come to prepare Mordecai for the revelation of the
22298: restored sister and for the change of abode which was desirable before
22299: Mirah’s meeting with her brother. Mrs. Meyrick, to whom Deronda had
22300: confided everything except Mordecai’s peculiar relation to himself, had
22301: been active in helping him to find a suitable lodging in Brompton, not
22302: many minutes’ walk from her own house, so that the brother and sister
22303: would be within reach of her motherly care. Her happy mixture of
22304: Scottish fervor and Gaelic liveliness had enabled her to keep the
22305: secret close from the girls as well as from Hans, any betrayal to them
22306: being likely to reach Mirah in some way that would raise an agitating
22307: suspicion, and spoil the important opening of that work which was to
22308: secure her independence, as we rather arbitrarily call one of the more
22309: arduous and dignified forms of our dependence. And both Mrs. Meyrick
22310: and Deronda had more reasons than they could have expressed for
22311: desiring that Mirah should be able to maintain herself. Perhaps “the
22312: little mother” was rather helped in her secrecy by some dubiousness in
22313: her sentiment about the remarkable brother described to her; and
22314: certainly if she felt any joy and anticipatory admiration, it was due
22315: to her faith in Deronda’s judgment. The consumption was a sorrowful
22316: fact that appealed to her tenderness; but how was she to be very glad
22317: of an enthusiasm which, to tell the truth, she could only contemplate
22318: as Jewish pertinacity, and as rather an undesirable introduction among
22319: them all of a man whose conversation would not be more modern and
22320: encouraging than that of Scott’s Covenanters? Her mind was anything but
22321: prosaic, and had her soberer share of Mab’s delight in the romance of
22322: Mirah’s story and of her abode with them; but the romantic or unusual
22323: in real life requires some adaptation. We sit up at night to read about
22324: Sakya-Mouni, St. Francis, or Oliver Cromwell; but whether we should be
22325: glad for any one at all like them to call on us the next morning, still
22326: more, to reveal himself as a new relation, is quite another affair.
22327: Besides, Mrs. Meyrick had hoped, as her children did, that the
22328: intensity of Mirah’s feeling about Judaism would slowly subside, and be
22329: merged in the gradually deepening current of loving interchange with
22330: her new friends. In fact, her secret favorite continuation of the
22331: romance had been no discovery of Jewish relations, but something much
22332: more favorable to the hopes she discerned in Hans. And now—here was a
22333: brother who would dip Mirah’s mind over again in the deepest dye of
22334: Jewish sentiment. She could not help saying to Deronda,
22335: 
22336: “I am as glad as you are that the pawnbroker is not her brother: there
22337: are Ezras and Ezras in the world; and really it is a comfort to think
22338: that all Jews are not like those shopkeepers who _will not_ let you get
22339: out of their shops: and besides, what he said to you about his mother
22340: and sister makes me bless him. I am sure he’s good. But I never did
22341: like anything fanatical. I suppose I heard a little too much preaching
22342: in my youth and lost my palate for it.”
22343: 
22344: “I don’t think you will find that Mordecai obtrudes any preaching,”
22345: said Deronda. “He is not what I should call fanatical. I call a man
22346: fanatical when his enthusiasm is narrow and hoodwinked, so that he has
22347: no sense of proportions, and becomes unjust and unsympathetic to men
22348: who are out of his own track. Mordecai is an enthusiast; I should like
22349: to keep that word for the highest order of minds—those who care
22350: supremely for grand and general benefits to mankind. He is not a
22351: strictly orthodox Jew, and is full of allowances for others; his
22352: conformity in many things is an allowance for the condition of other
22353: Jews. The people he lives with are as fond of him as possible, and they
22354: can’t in the least understand his ideas.”
22355: 
22356: “Oh, well, I can live up to the level of the pawnbroker’s mother, and
22357: like him for what I see to be good in him; and for what I don’t see the
22358: merits of I will take your word. According to your definition, I
22359: suppose one might be fanatical in worshipping common-sense; for my poor
22360: husband used to say the world would be a poor place if there were
22361: nothing but common-sense in it. However, Mirah’s brother will have good
22362: bedding—that I have taken care of; and I shall have this extra window
22363: pasted up with paper to prevent draughts.” (The conversation was taking
22364: place in the destined lodging.) “It is a comfort to think that the
22365: people of the house are no strangers to me—no hypocritical harpies.
22366: And when the children know, we shall be able to make the rooms much
22367: prettier.”
22368: 
22369: “The next stage of the affair is to tell all to Mordecai, and get him
22370: to move—which may be a more difficult business,” said Deronda.
22371: 
22372: “And will you tell Mirah before I say anything to the children?” said
22373: Mrs. Meyrick. But Deronda hesitated, and she went on in a tone of
22374: persuasive deliberation—“No, I think not. Let me tell Hans and the
22375: girls the evening before, and they will be away the next morning?”
22376: 
22377: “Yes, that will be best. But do justice to my account of Mordecai—or
22378: Ezra, as I suppose Mirah will wish to call him: don’t assist their
22379: imagination by referring to Habakkuk Mucklewrath,” said Deronda,
22380: smiling—Mrs. Meyrick herself having used the comparison of the
22381: Covenanters.
22382: 
22383: “Trust me, trust me,” said the little mother. “I shall have to persuade
22384: them so hard to be glad, that I shall convert myself. When I am
22385: frightened I find it a good thing to have somebody to be angry with for
22386: not being brave: it warms the blood.”
22387: 
22388: Deronda might have been more argumentative or persuasive about the view
22389: to be taken of Mirah’s brother, if he had been less anxiously
22390: preoccupied with the more important task immediately before him, which
22391: he desired to acquit himself of without wounding the Cohens. Mordecai,
22392: by a memorable answer, had made it evident that he would be keenly
22393: alive to any inadvertance in relation to their feelings. In the
22394: interval, he had been meeting Mordecai at the _Hand and Banner_, but
22395: now after due reflection he wrote to him saying that he had particular
22396: reasons for wishing to see him in his own home the next evening, and
22397: would beg to sit with him in his workroom for an hour, if the Cohens
22398: would not regard it as an intrusion. He would call with the
22399: understanding that if there were any objection, Mordecai would
22400: accompany him elsewhere. Deronda hoped in this way to create a little
22401: expectation that would have a preparatory effect.
22402: 
22403: He was received with the usual friendliness, some additional costume in
22404: the women and children, and in all the elders a slight air of wondering
22405: which even in Cohen was not allowed to pass the bounds of silence—the
22406: guest’s transactions with Mordecai being a sort of mystery which he was
22407: rather proud to think lay outside the sphere of light which enclosed
22408: his own understanding. But when Deronda said, “I suppose Mordecai is at
22409: home and expecting me,” Jacob, who had profited by the family remarks,
22410: went up to his knee and said, “What do you want to talk to Mordecai
22411: about?”
22412: 
22413: “Something that is very interesting to him,” said Deronda, pinching the
22414: lad’s ear, “but that you can’t understand.”
22415: 
22416: “Can you say this?” said Jacob, immediately giving forth a string of
22417: his rote-learned Hebrew verses with a wonderful mixture of the throaty
22418: and the nasal, and nodding his small head at his hearer, with a sense
22419: of giving formidable evidence which might rather alter their mutual
22420: position.
22421: 
22422: “No, really,” said Deronda, keeping grave; “I can’t say anything like
22423: it.”
22424: 
22425: “I thought not,” said Jacob, performing a dance of triumph with his
22426: small scarlet legs, while he took various objects out of the deep
22427: pockets of his knickerbockers and returned them thither, as a slight
22428: hint of his resources; after which, running to the door of the
22429: workroom, he opened it wide, set his back against it, and said,
22430: “Mordecai, here’s the young swell”—a copying of his father’s phrase,
22431: which seemed to him well fitted to cap the recitation of Hebrew.
22432: 
22433: He was called back with hushes by mother and grandmother, and Deronda,
22434: entering and closing the door behind him, saw that a bit of carpet had
22435: been laid down, a chair placed, and the fire and lights attended to, in
22436: sign of the Cohens’ respect. As Mordecai rose to greet him, Deronda was
22437: struck with the air of solemn expectation in his face, such as would
22438: have seemed perfectly natural if his letter had declared that some
22439: revelation was to be made about the lost sister. Neither of them spoke,
22440: till Deronda, with his usual tenderness of manner, had drawn the vacant
22441: chair from the opposite side of the hearth and had seated himself near
22442: to Mordecai, who then said, in a tone of fervid certainty,
22443: 
22444: “You are coming to tell me something that my soul longs for.”
22445: 
22446: “It is true I have something very weighty to tell you—something I
22447: trust that you will rejoice in,” said Deronda, on his guard against the
22448: probability that Mordecai had been preparing himself for something
22449: quite different from the fact.
22450: 
22451: “It is all revealed—it is made clear to you,” said Mordecai, more
22452: eagerly, leaning forward with clasped hands. “You are even as my
22453: brother that sucked the breasts of my mother—the heritage is
22454: yours—there is no doubt to divide us.”
22455: 
22456: “I have learned nothing new about myself,” said Deronda. The
22457: disappointment was inevitable: it was better not to let the feeling be
22458: strained longer in a mistaken hope.
22459: 
22460: Mordecai sank back in his chair, unable for the moment to care what was
22461: really coming. The whole day his mind had been in a state of tension
22462: toward one fulfillment. The reaction was sickening and he closed his
22463: eyes.
22464: 
22465: “Except,” Deronda went on gently, after a pause,—“except that I had
22466: really some time ago come into another sort of hidden connection with
22467: you, besides what you have spoken of as existing in your own feeling.”
22468: 
22469: The eyes were not opened, but there was a fluttering in the lids.
22470: 
22471: “I had made the acquaintance of one in whom you are interested.”
22472: 
22473: “One who is closely related to your departed mother,” Deronda went on
22474: wishing to make the disclosure gradual; but noticing a shrinking
22475: movement in Mordecai, he added—“whom she and you held dear above all
22476: others.”
22477: 
22478: Mordecai, with a sudden start, laid a spasmodic grasp on Deronda’s
22479: wrist; there was a great terror in him. And Deronda divined it. A
22480: tremor was perceptible in his clear tones as he said,
22481: 
22482: “What was prayed for has come to pass: Mirah has been delivered from
22483: evil.”
22484: 
22485: Mordecai’s grasp relaxed a little, but he was panting with a tearless
22486: sob.
22487: 
22488: Deronda went on: “Your sister is worthy of the mother you honored.”
22489: 
22490: He waited there, and Mordecai, throwing himself backward in his chair,
22491: again closed his eyes, uttering himself almost inaudibly for some
22492: minutes in Hebrew, and then subsiding into a happy-looking silence.
22493: Deronda, watching the expression in his uplifted face, could have
22494: imagined that he was speaking with some beloved object: there was a new
22495: suffused sweetness, something like that on the faces of the beautiful
22496: dead. For the first time Deronda thought he discerned a family
22497: resemblance to Mirah.
22498: 
22499: Presently when Mordecai was ready to listen, the rest was told. But in
22500: accounting for Mirah’s flight he made the statement about the father’s
22501: conduct as vague as he could, and threw the emphasis on her yearning to
22502: come to England as the place where she might find her mother. Also he
22503: kept back the fact of Mirah’s intention to drown herself, and his own
22504: part in rescuing her; merely describing the home she had found with
22505: friends of his, whose interest in her and efforts for her he had
22506: shared. What he dwelt on finally was Mirah’s feeling about her mother
22507: and brother; and in relation to this he tried to give every detail.
22508: 
22509: “It was in search of them,” said Deronda, smiling, “that I turned into
22510: this house: the name Ezra Cohen was just then the most interesting name
22511: in the world to me. I confess I had fear for a long while. Perhaps you
22512: will forgive me now for having asked you that question about the elder
22513: Mrs. Cohen’s daughter. I cared very much what I should find Mirah’s
22514: friends to be. But I had found a brother worthy of her when I knew that
22515: her Ezra was disguised under the name of Mordecai.”
22516: 
22517: “Mordecai is really my name—Ezra Mordecai Cohen.”
22518: 
22519: “Is there any kinship between this family and yours?” said Deronda.
22520: 
22521: “Only the kinship of Israel. My soul clings to these people, who have
22522: sheltered me and given me succor out of the affection that abides in
22523: Jewish hearts, as sweet odor in things long crushed and hidden from the
22524: outer air. It is good for me to bear with their ignorance and be bound
22525: to them in gratitude, that I may keep in mind the spiritual poverty of
22526: the Jewish million, and not put impatient knowledge in the stead of
22527: loving wisdom.”
22528: 
22529: “But you don’t feel bound to continue with them now there is a closer
22530: tie to draw you?” said Deronda, not without fear that he might find an
22531: obstacle to overcome. “It seems to me right now—is it not?—that you
22532: should live with your sister; and I have prepared a home to take you to
22533: in the neighborhood of her friends, that she may join you there. Pray
22534: grant me this wish. It will enable me to be with you often in the hours
22535: when Mirah is obliged to leave you. That is my selfish reason. But the
22536: chief reason is, that Mirah will desire to watch over you, and that you
22537: ought to give her the guardianship of a brother’s presence. You shall
22538: have books about you. I shall want to learn of you, and to take you out
22539: to see the river and trees. And you will have the rest and comfort that
22540: you will be more and more in need of—nay, that I need for you. This is
22541: the claim I make on you, now that we have found each other.”
22542: 
22543: Deronda spoke in a tone of earnest, affectionate pleading, such as he
22544: might have used to a venerated elder brother. Mordecai’s eyes were
22545: fixed on him with a listening contemplation, and he was silent for a
22546: little while after Deronda had ceased to speak. Then he said, with an
22547: almost reproachful emphasis,
22548: 
22549: “And you would have me hold it doubtful whether you were born a Jew!
22550: Have we not from the first touched each other with invisible
22551: fibres—have we not quivered together like the leaves from a common
22552: stem with stirring from a common root? I know what I am outwardly, I am
22553: one among the crowd of poor—I am stricken, I am dying. But our souls
22554: know each other. They gazed in silence as those who have long been
22555: parted and meet again, but when they found voice they were assured, and
22556: all their speech is understanding. The life of Israel is in your veins.”
22557: 
22558: Deronda sat perfectly still, but felt his face tingling. It was
22559: impossible either to deny or assent. He waited, hoping that Mordecai
22560: would presently give him a more direct answer. And after a pause of
22561: meditation he did say, firmly,
22562: 
22563: “What you wish of me I will do. And our mother—may the blessing of the
22564: Eternal be with her in our souls!—would have wished it too. I will
22565: accept what your loving kindness has prepared, and Mirah’s home shall
22566: be mine.” He paused a moment, and then added in a more melancholy tone,
22567: “But I shall grieve to part from these parents and the little ones. You
22568: must tell them, for my heart would fail me.”
22569: 
22570: “I felt that you would want me to tell them. Shall we go now at once?”
22571: said Deronda, much relieved by this unwavering compliance.
22572: 
22573: “Yes; let us not defer it. It must be done,” said Mordecai, rising with
22574: the air of a man who has to perform a painful duty. Then came, as an
22575: afterthought, “But do not dwell on my sister more than is needful.”
22576: 
22577: When they entered the parlor he said to the alert Jacob, “Ask your
22578: father to come, and tell Sarah to mind the shop. My friend has
22579: something to say,” he continued, turning to the elder Mrs. Cohen. It
22580: seemed part of Mordecai’s eccentricity that he should call this
22581: gentleman his friend; and the two women tried to show their better
22582: manners by warm politeness in begging Deronda to seat himself in the
22583: best place.
22584: 
22585: When Cohen entered with a pen behind his ear, he rubbed his hands and
22586: said with loud satisfaction, “Well, sir! I’m glad you’re doing us the
22587: honor to join our family party again. We are pretty comfortable, I
22588: think.”
22589: 
22590: He looked round with shiny gladness. And when all were seated on the
22591: hearth the scene was worth peeping in upon: on one side Baby under her
22592: scarlet quilt in the corner being rocked by the young mother, and
22593: Adelaide Rebekah seated on the grandmother’s knee; on the other, Jacob
22594: between his father’s legs; while the two markedly different figures of
22595: Deronda and Mordecai were in the middle—Mordecai a little backward in
22596: the shade, anxious to conceal his agitated susceptibility to what was
22597: going on around him. The chief light came from the fire, which brought
22598: out the rich color on a depth of shadow, and seemed to turn into speech
22599: the dark gems of eyes that looked at each other kindly.
22600: 
22601: “I have just been telling Mordecai of an event that makes a great
22602: change in his life,” Deronda began, “but I hope you will agree with me
22603: that it is a joyful one. Since he thinks of you as his best friends, he
22604: wishes me to tell you for him at once.”
22605: 
22606: “Relations with money, sir?” burst in Cohen, feeling a power of
22607: divination which it was a pity to nullify by waiting for the fact.
22608: 
22609: “No; not exactly,” said Deronda, smiling. “But a very precious relation
22610: wishes to be reunited to him—a very good and lovely young sister, who
22611: will care for his comfort in every way.”
22612: 
22613: “Married, sir?”
22614: 
22615: “No, not married.”
22616: 
22617: “But with a maintenance?”
22618: 
22619: “With talents which will secure her a maintenance. A home is already
22620: provided for Mordecai.”
22621: 
22622: There was silence for a moment or two before the grandmother said in a
22623: wailing tone,
22624: 
22625: “Well, well! and so you’re going away from us, Mordecai.”
22626: 
22627: “And where there’s no children as there is here,” said the mother,
22628: catching the wail.
22629: 
22630: “No Jacob, and no Adelaide, and no Eugenie!” wailed the grandmother
22631: again.
22632: 
22633: “Ay, ay, Jacob’s learning ’ill all wear out of him. He must go to
22634: school. It’ll be hard times for Jacob,” said Cohen, in a tone of
22635: decision.
22636: 
22637: In the wide-open ears of Jacob his father’s words sounded like a doom,
22638: giving an awful finish to the dirge-like effect of the whole
22639: announcement. His face had been gathering a wondering incredulous
22640: sorrow at the notion of Mordecai’s going away: he was unable to imagine
22641: the change as anything lasting; but at the mention of “hard times for
22642: Jacob” there was no further suspense of feeling, and he broke forth in
22643: loud lamentation. Adelaide Rebekah always cried when her brother cried,
22644: and now began to howl with astonishing suddenness, whereupon baby
22645: awaking contributed angry screams, and required to be taken out of the
22646: cradle. A great deal of hushing was necessary, and Mordecai feeling the
22647: cries pierce him, put out his arms to Jacob, who in the midst of his
22648: tears and sobs was turning his head right and left for general
22649: observation. His father, who had been saying, “Never mind, old man;
22650: you shall go to the riders,” now released him, and he went to Mordecai,
22651: who clasped him, and laid his cheek on the little black head without
22652: speaking. But Cohen, sensible that the master of the family must make
22653: some apology for all this weakness, and that the occasion called for a
22654: speech, addressed Deronda with some elevation of pitch, squaring his
22655: elbows and resting a hand on each knee:
22656: 
22657: “It’s not as we’re the people to grudge anybody’s good luck, sir, or
22658: the portion of their cup being made fuller, as I may say. I’m not an
22659: envious man, and if anybody offered to set up Mordecai in a shop of my
22660: sort two doors lower down, _I_ shouldn’t make wry faces about it. I’m
22661: not one of them that had need have a poor opinion of themselves, and be
22662: frightened at anybody else getting a chance. If I’m offal, let a wise
22663: man come and tell me, for I’ve never heard it yet. And in point of
22664: business, I’m not a class of goods to be in danger. If anybody takes to
22665: rolling me, I can pack myself up like a caterpillar, and find my feet
22666: when I’m let alone. And though, as I may say, you’re taking some of our
22667: good works from us, which is property bearing interest, I’m not saying
22668: but we can afford that, though my mother and my wife had the good will
22669: to wish and do for Mordecai to the last; and a Jew must not be like a
22670: servant who works for reward—though I see nothing against a reward if
22671: I can get it. And as to the extra outlay in schooling, I’m neither poor
22672: nor greedy—I wouldn’t hang myself for sixpence, nor half a crown
22673: neither. But the truth of it is, the women and children are fond of
22674: Mordecai. You may partly see how it is, sir, by your own sense. A
22675: Jewish man is bound to thank God, day by day, that he was not made a
22676: woman; but a woman has to thank God that He has made her according to
22677: His will. And we all know what He has made her—a child-bearing,
22678: tender-hearted thing is the woman of our people. Her children are
22679: mostly stout, as I think you’ll say Addy’s are, and she’s not mushy,
22680: but her heart is tender. So you must excuse present company, sir, for
22681: not being glad all at once. And as to this young lady—for by what you
22682: say ‘young lady’ is the proper term”—Cohen here threw some additional
22683: emphasis into his look and tone—“we shall all be glad for Mordecai’s
22684: sake by-and-by, when we cast up our accounts and see where we are.”
22685: 
22686: Before Deronda could summon any answer to this oddly mixed speech,
22687: Mordecai exclaimed,
22688: 
22689: “Friends, friends! For food and raiment and shelter I would not have
22690: sought better than you have given me. You have sweetened the morsel
22691: with love; and what I thought of as a joy that would be left to me even
22692: in the last months of my waning strength was to go on teaching the lad.
22693: But now I am as one who had clad himself beforehand in his shroud, and
22694: used himself to making the grave his bed, when the divine command
22695: sounded in his ears, ‘Arise, and go forth; the night is not yet come.’
22696: For no light matter would I have turned away from your kindness to take
22697: another’s. But it has been taught us, as you know, that _the reward of
22698: one duty is the power to fulfill another_—so said Ben Azai. You have
22699: made your duty to one of the poor among your brethren a joy to you and
22700: me; and your reward shall be that you will not rest without the joy of
22701: like deeds in the time to come. And may not Jacob come and visit me?”
22702: 
22703: Mordecai had turned with this question to Deronda, who said,
22704: 
22705: “Surely that can be managed. It is no further than Brompton.”
22706: 
22707: Jacob, who had been gradually calmed by the need to hear what was going
22708: forward, began now to see some daylight on the future, the word “visit”
22709: having the lively charm of cakes and general relaxation at his
22710: grandfather’s, the dealer in knives. He danced away from Mordecai, and
22711: took up a station of survey in the middle of the hearth with his hands
22712: in his knickerbockers.
22713: 
22714: “Well,” said the grandmother, with a sigh of resignation, “I hope
22715: there’ll be nothing in the way of your getting _kosher_ meat, Mordecai.
22716: For you’ll have to trust to those you live with.”
22717: 
22718: “That’s all right, that’s all right, you may be sure, mother,” said
22719: Cohen, as if anxious to cut off inquiry on matters in which he was
22720: uncertain of the guest’s position. “So, sir,” he added, turning with a
22721: look of amused enlightenment to Deronda, “it was better than learning
22722: you had to talk to Mordecai about! I wondered to myself at the time. I
22723: thought somehow there was a something.”
22724: 
22725: “Mordecai will perhaps explain to you how it was that I was seeking
22726: him,” said Deronda, feeling that he had better go, and rising as he
22727: spoke.
22728: 
22729: It was agreed that he should come again and the final move be made on
22730: the next day but one; but when he was going Mordecai begged to walk
22731: with him to the end of the street, and wrapped himself in coat and
22732: comforter. It was a March evening, and Deronda did not mean to let him
22733: go far, but he understood the wish to be outside the house with him in
22734: communicative silence, after the exciting speech that had been filling
22735: the last hour. No word was spoken until Deronda had proposed parting,
22736: when he said,
22737: 
22738: “Mirah would wish to thank the Cohens for their goodness. You would
22739: wish her to do so—to come and see them, would you not?”
22740: 
22741: Mordecai did not answer immediately, but at length said,
22742: 
22743: “I cannot tell. I fear not. There is a family sorrow, and the sight of
22744: my sister might be to them as the fresh bleeding of wounds. There is a
22745: daughter and sister who will never be restored as Mirah is. But who
22746: knows the pathways? We are all of us denying or fulfilling prayers—and
22747: men in their careless deeds walk amidst invisible outstretched arms and
22748: pleadings made in vain. In my ears I have the prayers of generations
22749: past and to come. My life is as nothing to me but the beginning of
22750: fulfilment. And yet I am only another prayer—which you will fulfil.”
22751: 
22752: Deronda pressed his hand, and they parted.
22753: 
22754: 
22755: 
22756: 
22757: CHAPTER XLVII.
22758: 
22759:   “And you must love him ere to you
22760:   He will seem worthy of your love.”
22761:                         —WORDSWORTH.
22762: 
22763: 
22764: One might be tempted to envy Deronda providing new clothes for
22765: Mordecai, and pleasing himself as if he were sketching a picture in
22766: imagining the effect of the fine gray flannel shirts and a
22767: dressing-gown very much like a Franciscan’s brown frock, with
22768: Mordecai’s head and neck above them. Half his pleasure was the sense of
22769: seeing Mirah’s brother through her eyes, and securing her fervid joy
22770: from any perturbing impression. And yet, after he had made all things
22771: ready, he was visited with doubt whether he were not mistaking her, and
22772: putting the lower effect for the higher: was she not just as capable as
22773: he himself had been of feeling the impressive distinction in her
22774: brother all the more for that aspect of poverty which was among the
22775: memorials of his past? But there were the Meyricks to be propitiated
22776: toward this too Judaic brother; and Deronda detected himself piqued
22777: into getting out of sight everything that might feed the ready
22778: repugnance in minds unblessed with that precious “seeing,” that bathing
22779: of all objects in a solemnity as of sun-set glow, which is begotten of
22780: a loving reverential emotion.
22781: 
22782: And his inclination would have been the more confirmed if he had heard
22783: the dialogue round Mrs. Meyrick’s fire late in the evening, after Mirah
22784: had gone to her room. Hans, settled now in his Chelsea rooms, had
22785: stayed late, and Mrs. Meyrick, poking the fire into a blaze, said,
22786: 
22787: “Now, Kate, put out your candle, and all come round the fire cosily.
22788: Hans, dear, do leave off laughing at those poems for the ninety-ninth
22789: time, and come too. I have something wonderful to tell.”
22790: 
22791: “As if I didn’t know that, ma. I have seen it in the corner of your eye
22792: ever so long, and in your pretense of errands,” said Kate, while the
22793: girls came up to put their feet on the fender, and Hans, pushing his
22794: chair near them, sat astride it, resting his fists and chin on the back.
22795: 
22796: “Well, then, if you are so wise, perhaps you know that Mirah’s brother
22797: is found!” said Mrs. Meyrick, in her clearest accents.
22798: 
22799: “Oh, confound it!” said Hans, in the same moment.
22800: 
22801: “Hans, that is wicked,” said Mab. “Suppose we had lost you?”
22802: 
22803: “I _cannot_ help being rather sorry,” said Kate. “And her
22804: mother?—where is she?”
22805: 
22806: “Her mother is dead.”
22807: 
22808: “I hope the brother is not a bad man,” said Amy.
22809: 
22810: “Nor a fellow all smiles and jewelry—a Crystal Palace Assyrian with a
22811: hat on,” said Hans, in the worst humor.
22812: 
22813: “Were there ever such unfeeling children?” said Mrs. Meyrick, a little
22814: strengthened by the need for opposition. “You don’t think the least bit
22815: of Mirah’s joy in the matter.”
22816: 
22817: “You know, ma, Mirah hardly remembers her brother,” said Kate.
22818: 
22819: “People who are lost for twelve years should never come back again,”
22820: said Hans. “They are always in the way.”
22821: 
22822: “Hans!” said Mrs. Meyrick, reproachfully. “If you had lost me for
22823: _twenty_ years, I should have thought—”
22824: 
22825: “I said twelve years,” Hans broke in. “Anywhere about twelve years is
22826: the time at which lost relations should keep out of the way.”
22827: 
22828: “Well, but it’s nice finding people—there is something to tell,” said
22829: Mab, clasping her knees. “Did Prince Camaralzaman find him?”
22830: 
22831: Then Mrs. Meyrick, in her neat, narrative way, told all she knew
22832: without interruption. “Mr. Deronda has the highest admiration for him,”
22833: she ended—“seems quite to look up to him. And he says Mirah is just
22834: the sister to understand this brother.”
22835: 
22836: “Deronda is getting perfectly preposterous about those Jews,” said Hans
22837: with disgust, rising and setting his chair away with a bang. “He wants
22838: to do everything he can to encourage Mirah in her prejudices.”
22839: 
22840: “Oh, for shame, Hans!—to speak in that way of Mr. Deronda,” said Mab.
22841: And Mrs. Meyrick’s face showed something like an under-current of
22842: expression not allowed to get to the surface.
22843: 
22844: “And now we shall never be all together,” Hans went on, walking about
22845: with his hands thrust into the pockets of his brown velveteen coat,
22846: “but we must have this prophet Elijah to tea with us, and Mirah will
22847: think of nothing but sitting on the ruins of Jerusalem. She will be
22848: spoiled as an artist—mind that—she will get as narrow as a nun.
22849: Everything will be spoiled—our home and everything. I shall take to
22850: drinking.”
22851: 
22852: “Oh, really, Hans,” said Kate, impatiently. “I do think men are the
22853: most contemptible animals in all creation. Every one of them must have
22854: everything to his mind, else he is unbearable.”
22855: 
22856: “Oh, oh, oh, it’s very dreadful!” cried Mab. “I feel as if ancient
22857: Nineveh were come again.”
22858: 
22859: “I should like to know what is the good of having gone to the
22860: university and knowing everything, if you are so childish, Hans,” said
22861: Amy. “You ought to put up with a man that Providence sends you to be
22862: kind to. _We_ shall have to put up with him.”
22863: 
22864: “I hope you will all of you like the new Lamentations of Jeremiah—‘to
22865: be continued in our next’—that’s all,” said Hans, seizing his
22866: wide-awake. “It’s no use being one thing more than another if one has
22867: to endure the company of those men with a fixed idea, staring blankly
22868: at you, and requiring all your remarks to be small foot-notes to their
22869: text. If you’re to be under a petrifying wall, you’d better be an old
22870: boot. I don’t feel myself an old boot.” Then abruptly, “Good night,
22871: little mother,” bending to kiss her brow in a hasty, desperate manner,
22872: and condescendingly, on his way to the door, “Good-night, girls.”
22873: 
22874: “Suppose Mirah knew how you are behaving,” said Kate. But her answer
22875: was a slam of the door. “I _should_ like to see Mirah when Mr. Deronda
22876: tells her,” she went on to her mother. “I know she will look so
22877: beautiful.”
22878: 
22879: But Deronda, on second thoughts, had written a letter, which Mrs.
22880: Meyrick received the next morning, begging her to make the revelation
22881: instead of waiting for him, not giving the real reason—that he shrank
22882: from going again through a narrative in which he seemed to be making
22883: himself important and giving himself a character of general
22884: beneficence—but saying that he wished to remain with Mordecai while
22885: Mrs. Meyrick would bring Mirah on what was to be understood as a visit,
22886: so that there might be a little interval before that change of abode
22887: which he expected that Mirah herself would propose.
22888: 
22889: Deronda secretly felt some wondering anxiety how far Mordecai, after
22890: years of solitary preoccupation with ideas likely to have become the
22891: more exclusive from continual diminution of bodily strength, would
22892: allow him to feel a tender interest in his sister over and above the
22893: rendering of pious duties. His feeling for the Cohens, and especially
22894: for little Jacob, showed a persistent activity of affection; but these
22895: objects had entered into his daily life for years; and Deronda felt it
22896: noticeable that Mordecai asked no new questions about Mirah,
22897: maintaining, indeed, an unusual silence on all subjects, and appearing
22898: simply to submit to the changes that were coming over his personal
22899: life. He donned the new clothes obediently, but said afterward to
22900: Deronda, with a faint smile, “I must keep my old garments by me for a
22901: remembrance.” And when they were seated, awaiting Mirah, he uttered no
22902: word, keeping his eyelids closed, but yet showing restless feeling in
22903: his face and hands. In fact, Mordecai was undergoing that peculiar
22904: nervous perturbation only known to those whose minds, long and
22905: habitually moving with strong impetus in one current, are suddenly
22906: compelled into a new or reopened channel. Susceptible people, whose
22907: strength has been long absorbed by dormant bias, dread an interview
22908: that imperiously revives the past, as they would dread a threatening
22909: illness. Joy may be there, but joy, too, is terrible.
22910: 
22911: Deronda felt the infection of excitement, and when he heard the ring at
22912: the door, he went out, not knowing exactly why, that he might see and
22913: greet Mirah beforehand. He was startled to find that she had on the hat
22914: and cloak in which he had first seen her—the memorable cloak that had
22915: once been wetted for a winding-sheet. She had come down-stairs equipped
22916: in this way; and when Mrs. Meyrick said, in a tone of question, “You
22917: like to go in that dress, dear?” she answered, “My brother is poor, and
22918: I want to look as much like him as I can, else he may feel distant from
22919: me”—imagining that she should meet him in the workman’s dress. Deronda
22920: could not make any remark, but felt secretly rather ashamed of his own
22921: fastidious arrangements. They shook hands silently, for Mirah looked
22922: pale and awed.
22923: 
22924: When Deronda opened the door for her, Mordecai had risen, and had his
22925: eyes turned toward it with an eager gaze. Mirah took only two or three
22926: steps, and then stood still. They looked at each other, motionless. It
22927: was less their own presence that they felt than another’s; they were
22928: meeting first in memories, compared with which touch was no union.
22929: Mirah was the first to break the silence, standing where she was.
22930: 
22931: “Ezra,” she said, in exactly the same tone as when she was telling of
22932: her mother’s call to him.
22933: 
22934: Mordecai with a sudden movement advanced and laid his hand on her
22935: shoulders. He was the head taller, and looked down at her tenderly
22936: while he said, “That was our mother’s voice. You remember her calling
22937: me?”
22938: 
22939: “Yes, and how you answered her—‘Mother!’—and I knew you loved her.”
22940: Mirah threw her arms round her brother’s neck, clasped her little hands
22941: behind it, and drew down his face, kissing it with childlike
22942: lavishness. Her hat fell backward on the ground and disclosed all her
22943: curls.
22944: 
22945: “Ah, the dear head, the dear head!” said Mordecai, in a low loving
22946: tone, laying his thin hand gently on the curls.
22947: 
22948: “You are very ill, Ezra,” said Mirah, sadly looking at him with more
22949: observation.
22950: 
22951: “Yes, dear child, I shall not be long with you in the body,” was the
22952: quiet answer.
22953: 
22954: “Oh, I will love you and we will talk to each other,” said Mirah, with
22955: a sweet outpouring of her words, as spontaneous as bird-notes. “I will
22956: tell you everything, and you will teach me:—you will teach me to be a
22957: good Jewess—what she would have liked me to be. I shall always be with
22958: you when I am not working. For I work now. I shall get money to keep
22959: us. Oh, I have had such good friends.”
22960: 
22961: Mirah until now had quite forgotten that any one was by, but here she
22962: turned with the prettiest attitude, keeping one hand on her brother’s
22963: arm while she looked at Mrs. Meyrick and Deronda. The little mother’s
22964: happy emotion in witnessing this meeting of brother and sister had
22965: already won her to Mordecai, who seemed to her really to have more
22966: dignity and refinement than she had felt obliged to believe in from
22967: Deronda’s account.
22968: 
22969: “See this dear lady!” said Mirah. “I was a stranger, a poor wanderer,
22970: and she believed in me, and has treated me as a daughter. Please give
22971: my brother your hand,” she added, beseechingly, taking Mrs. Meyrick’s
22972: hand and putting it in Mordecai’s, then pressing them both with her own
22973: and lifting them to her lips.
22974: 
22975: “The Eternal Goodness has been with you,” said Mordecai. “You have
22976: helped to fulfill our mother’s prayer.”
22977: 
22978: “I think we will go now, shall we?—and return later,” said Deronda,
22979: laying a gentle pressure on Mrs. Meyrick’s arm, and she immediately
22980: complied. He was afraid of any reference to the facts about himself
22981: which he had kept back from Mordecai, and he felt no uneasiness now in
22982: the thought of the brother and sister being alone together.
22983: 
22984: 
22985: 
22986: 
22987: CHAPTER XLVIII.
22988: 
22989:     ’Tis hard and ill-paid task to order all things beforehand by the rule
22990:     of our own security, as is well hinted by Machiavelli concerning
22991:     Cæsar Borgia, who, saith he, had thought of all that might occur on
22992:     his father’s death, and had provided against every evil chance save
22993:     only one: it had never come into his mind that when his father died,
22994:     his own death would quickly follow.
22995: 
22996: 
22997: Grandcourt’s importance as a subject of this realm was of the grandly
22998: passive kind which consists in the inheritance of land. Political and
22999: social movements touched him only through the wire of his rental, and
23000: his most careful biographer need not have read up on
23001: Schleswig-Holstein, the policy of Bismarck, trade-unions, household
23002: suffrage, or even the last commercial panic. He glanced over the best
23003: newspaper columns on these topics, and his views on them can hardly be
23004: said to have wanted breadth, since he embraced all Germans, all
23005: commercial men, and all voters liable to use the wrong kind of soap,
23006: under the general epithet of “brutes;” but he took no action on these
23007: much-agitated questions beyond looking from under his eyelids at any
23008: man who mentioned them, and retaining a silence which served to shake
23009: the opinions of timid thinkers.
23010: 
23011: But Grandcourt, within his own sphere of interest, showed some of the
23012: qualities which have entered into triumphal diplomacy of the wildest
23013: continental sort.
23014: 
23015: No movement of Gwendolen in relation to Deronda escaped him. He would
23016: have denied that he was jealous; because jealousy would have implied
23017: some doubt of his own power to hinder what he had determined against.
23018: That his wife should have more inclination to another man’s society
23019: than to his own would not pain him: what he required was that she
23020: should be as fully aware as she would have been of a locked hand-cuff,
23021: that her inclination was helpless to decide anything in contradiction
23022: with his resolve. However much of vacillating whim there might have
23023: been in his entrance on matrimony, there was no vacillating in his
23024: interpretation of the bond. He had not repented of his marriage; it had
23025: really brought more of aim into his life, new objects to exert his will
23026: upon; and he had not repented of his choice. His taste was fastidious,
23027: and Gwendolen satisfied it: he would not have liked a wife who had not
23028: received some elevation of rank from him; nor one who did not command
23029: admiration by her mien and beauty; nor one whose nails were not of the
23030: right shape; nor one the lobe of whose ear was at all too large and
23031: red; nor one who, even if her nails and ears were right, was at the
23032: same time a ninny, unable to make spirited answers. These requirements
23033: may not seem too exacting to refined contemporaries whose own ability
23034: to fall in love has been held in suspense for lack of indispensable
23035: details; but fewer perhaps may follow him in his contentment that his
23036: wife should be in a temper which would dispose her to fly out if she
23037: dared, and that she should have been urged into marrying him by other
23038: feelings than passionate attachment. Still, for those who prefer
23039: command to love, one does not see why the habit of mind should change
23040: precisely at the point of matrimony.
23041: 
23042: Grandcourt did not feel that he had chosen the wrong wife; and having
23043: taken on himself the part of husband, he was not going in any way to be
23044: fooled, or allow himself to be seen in a light that could be regarded
23045: as pitiable. This was his state of mind—not jealousy; still, his
23046: behavior in some respects was as like jealousy as yellow is to yellow,
23047: which color we know may be the effect of very different causes.
23048: 
23049: He had come up to town earlier than usual because he wished to be on
23050: the spot for legal consultation as to the arrangements of his will, the
23051: transference of mortgages, and that transaction with his uncle about
23052: the succession to Diplow, which the bait of ready money, adroitly
23053: dangled without importunity, had finally won him to agree upon. But
23054: another acceptable accompaniment of his being in town was the
23055: presentation of himself with the beautiful bride whom he had chosen to
23056: marry in spite of what other people might have expected of him. It is
23057: true that Grandcourt went about with the sense that he did not care a
23058: languid curse for any one’s admiration: but this state of not-caring,
23059: just as much as desire, required its related object—namely, a world of
23060: admiring or envying spectators: for if you are fond of looking stonily
23061: at smiling persons—the persons must be and they must smile—a
23062: rudimentary truth which is surely forgotten by those who complain of
23063: mankind as generally contemptible, since any other aspect of the race
23064: must disappoint the voracity of their contempt. Grandcourt, in town for
23065: the first time with his wife, had his non-caring abstinence from curses
23066: enlarged and diversified by splendid receptions, by conspicuous rides
23067: and drives, by presentations of himself with her on all distinguished
23068: occasions. He wished her to be sought after; he liked that “fellows”
23069: should be eager to talk with her and escort her within his observation;
23070: there was even a kind of lofty coquetry on her part that he would not
23071: have objected to. But what he did not like were her ways in relation to
23072: Deronda.
23073: 
23074: After the musical party at Lady Mallinger’s, when Grandcourt had
23075: observed the dialogue on the settee as keenly as Hans had done, it was
23076: characteristic of him that he named Deronda for invitation along with
23077: the Mallingers, tenaciously avoiding the possible suggestion to
23078: anybody concerned that Deronda’s presence or absence could be of the
23079: least importance to him; and he made no direct observation to Gwendolen
23080: on her behavior that evening, lest the expression of his disgust should
23081: be a little too strong to satisfy his own pride. But a few days
23082: afterward he remarked, without being careful of the _à propos_,
23083: 
23084: “Nothing makes a woman more of a gawky than looking out after people
23085: and showing tempers in public. A woman ought to have good manners. Else
23086: it’s intolerable to appear with her.”
23087: 
23088: Gwendolen made the expected application, and was not without alarm at
23089: the notion of being a gawky. For she, too, with her melancholy distaste
23090: for things, preferred that her distaste should include admirers. But
23091: the sense of overhanging rebuke only intensified the strain of
23092: expectation toward any meeting with Deronda. The novelty and excitement
23093: of her town life was like the hurry and constant change of foreign
23094: travel; whatever might be the inward despondency, there was a programme
23095: to be fulfilled, not without gratification to many-sided self. But, as
23096: always happens with a deep interest, the comparatively rare occasions
23097: on which she could exchange any words with Deronda had a diffusive
23098: effect in her consciousness, magnifying their communication with each
23099: other, and therefore enlarging the place she imagined it to have in his
23100: mind. How could Deronda help this? He certainly did not avoid her;
23101: rather he wished to convince her by every delicate indirect means that
23102: her confidence in him had not been indiscreet since it had not lowered
23103: his respect. Moreover he liked being near her—how could it be
23104: otherwise? She was something more than a problem: she was a lovely
23105: woman, for the turn of whose mind and fate he had a care which, however
23106: futile it might be, kept soliciting him as a responsibility, perhaps
23107: all the more that, when he dared to think of his own future, he saw it
23108: lying far away from this splendid sad-hearted creature, who, because he
23109: had once been impelled to arrest her attention momentarily, as he might
23110: have seized her arm with warning to hinder her from stepping where
23111: there was danger, had turned to him with a beseeching persistent need.
23112: 
23113: One instance in which Grandcourt stimulated a feeling in Gwendolen that
23114: he would have liked to suppress without seeming to care about it, had
23115: relation to Mirah. Gwendolen’s inclination lingered over the project of
23116: the singing lessons as a sort of obedience to Deronda’s advice, but day
23117: followed day with that want of perceived leisure which belongs to lives
23118: where there is no work to mark off intervals; and the continual
23119: liability to Grandcourt’s presence and surveillance seemed to flatten
23120: every effort to the level of the boredom which his manner expressed;
23121: his negative mind was as diffusive as fog, clinging to all objects, and
23122: spoiling all contact.
23123: 
23124: But one morning when they were breakfasting, Gwendolen, in a recurrent
23125: fit of determination to exercise the old spirit, said, dallying
23126: prettily over her prawns without eating them,
23127: 
23128: “I think of making myself accomplished while we are in town, and having
23129: singing lessons.”
23130: 
23131: “Why?” said Grandcourt, languidly.
23132: 
23133: “Why?” echoed Gwendolen, playing at sauciness; “because I can’t eat
23134: _pâté de foie gras_ to make me sleepy, and I can’t smoke, and I can’t
23135: go to the club to make me like to come away again—I want a variety of
23136: _ennui_. What would be the most convenient time, when you are busy with
23137: your lawyers and people, for me to have lessons from that little
23138: Jewess, whose singing is getting all the rage.”
23139: 
23140: “Whenever you like,” said Grandcourt, pushing away his plate, and
23141: leaning back in his chair while he looked at her with his most
23142: lizard-like expression and, played with the ears of the tiny spaniel on
23143: his lap (Gwendolen had taken a dislike to the dogs because they fawned
23144: on him).
23145: 
23146: Then he said, languidly, “I don’t see why a lady should sing. Amateurs
23147: make fools of themselves. A lady can’t risk herself in that way in
23148: company. And one doesn’t want to hear squalling in private.”
23149: 
23150: “I like frankness: that seems to me a husband’s great charm,” said
23151: Gwendolen, with her little upward movement of her chin, as she turned
23152: her eyes away from his, and lifting a prawn before her, looked at the
23153: boiled ingenuousness of its eyes as preferable to the lizard’s. “But;”
23154: she added, having devoured her mortification, “I suppose you don’t
23155: object to Miss Lapidoth’s singing at our party on the fourth? I thought
23156: of engaging her. Lady Brackenshaw had her, you know: and the Raymonds,
23157: who are very particular about their music. And Mr. Deronda, who is a
23158: musician himself and a first-rate judge, says there is no singing in
23159: such good taste as hers for a drawing-room. I think his opinion is an
23160: authority.”
23161: 
23162: She meant to sling a small stone at her husband in that way.
23163: 
23164: “It’s very indecent of Deronda to go about praising that girl,” said
23165: Grandcourt in a tone of indifference.
23166: 
23167: “Indecent!” exclaimed Gwendolen, reddening and looking at him again,
23168: overcome by startled wonder, and unable to reflect on the probable
23169: falsity of the phrase—“to go about praising.”
23170: 
23171: “Yes; and especially when she is patronized by Lady Mallinger. He ought
23172: to hold his tongue about her. Men can see what is his relation to her.”
23173: 
23174: “Men who judge of others by themselves,” said Gwendolen, turning white
23175: after her redness, and immediately smitten with a dread of her own
23176: words.
23177: 
23178: “Of course. And a woman should take their judgment—else she is likely
23179: to run her head into the wrong place,” said Grandcourt, conscious of
23180: using pinchers on that white creature. “I suppose you take Deronda for
23181: a saint.”
23182: 
23183: “Oh dear no!” said Gwendolen, summoning desperately her almost
23184: miraculous power of self-control, and speaking in a high hard tone.
23185: “Only a little less of a monster.”
23186: 
23187: She rose, pushed her chair away without hurry, and walked out of the
23188: room with something like the care of a man who is afraid of showing
23189: that he has taken more wine than usual. She turned the keys inside her
23190: dressing-room doors, and sat down for some time looking pale and quiet
23191: as when she was leaving the breakfast-room. Even in the moments after
23192: reading the poisonous letter she had hardly had more cruel sensations
23193: than now; for emotion was at the acute point, where it is not
23194: distinguishable from sensation. Deronda unlike what she had believed
23195: him to be, was an image which affected her as a hideous apparition
23196: would have done, quite apart from the way in which it was produced. It
23197: had taken hold of her as pain before she could consider whether it were
23198: fiction or truth; and further to hinder her power of resistance came
23199: the sudden perception, how very slight were the grounds of her faith in
23200: Deronda—how little she knew of his life—how childish she had been in
23201: her confidence. His rebukes and his severity to her began to seem
23202: odious, along with all the poetry and lofty doctrine in the world,
23203: whatever it might be; and the grave beauty of his face seemed the most
23204: unpleasant mask that the common habits of men could put on.
23205: 
23206: All this went on in her with the rapidity of a sick dream; and her
23207: start into resistance was very much like a waking. Suddenly from out
23208: the gray sombre morning there came a stream of sunshine, wrapping her
23209: in warmth and light where she sat in stony stillness. She moved gently
23210: and looked round her—there was a world outside this bad dream, and the
23211: dream proved nothing; she rose, stretching her arms upward and clasping
23212: her hands with her habitual attitude when she was seeking relief from
23213: oppressive feeling, and walked about the room in this flood of sunbeams.
23214: 
23215: “It is not true! What does it matter whether _he_ believes it or not?”
23216: This is what she repeated to herself—but this was not her faith come
23217: back again; it was only the desperate cry of faith, finding suffocation
23218: intolerable. And how could she go on through the day in this state?
23219: With one of her impetuous alternations, her imagination flew to wild
23220: actions by which she would convince herself of what she wished: she
23221: would go to Lady Mallinger and question her about Mirah; she would
23222: write to Deronda and upbraid him with making the world all false and
23223: wicked and hopeless to her—to him she dared pour out all the bitter
23224: indignation of her heart. No; she would go to Mirah. This last form
23225: taken by her need was more definitely practicable, and quickly became
23226: imperious. No matter what came of it. She had the pretext of asking
23227: Mirah to sing at her party on the fourth. What was she going to say
23228: beside? How satisfy? She did not foresee—she could not wait to
23229: foresee. If that idea which was maddening her had been a living thing,
23230: she would have wanted to throttle it without waiting to foresee what
23231: would come of the act. She rang her bell and asked if Mr. Grandcourt
23232: were gone out: finding that he was, she ordered the carriage, and began
23233: to dress for the drive; then she went down, and walked about the large
23234: drawing-room like an imprisoned dumb creature, not recognizing herself
23235: in the glass panels, not noting any object around her in the painted
23236: gilded prison. Her husband would probably find out where she had been,
23237: and punish her in some way or other—no matter—she could neither
23238: desire nor fear anything just now but the assurance that she had not
23239: been deluding herself in her trust.
23240: 
23241: She was provided with Mirah’s address. Soon she was on the way with all
23242: the fine equipage necessary to carry about her poor uneasy heart,
23243: depending in its palpitations on some answer or other to questioning
23244: which she did not know how she should put. She was as heedless of what
23245: happened before she found that Miss Lapidoth was at home, as one is of
23246: lobbies and passages on the way to a court of justice—heedless of
23247: everything till she was in a room where there were folding-doors, and
23248: she heard Deronda’s voice behind it. Doubtless the identification was
23249: helped by forecast, but she was as certain of it as if she had seen
23250: him. She was frightened at her own agitation, and began to unbutton her
23251: gloves that she might button them again, and bite her lips over the
23252: pretended difficulty, while the door opened, and Mirah presented
23253: herself with perfect quietude and a sweet smile of recognition. There
23254: was relief in the sight of her face, and Gwendolen was able to smile in
23255: return, while she put out her hand in silence; and as she seated
23256: herself, all the while hearing the voice, she felt some reflux of
23257: energy in the confused sense that the truth could not be anything that
23258: she dreaded. Mirah drew her chair very near, as if she felt that the
23259: sound of the conversation should be subdued, and looked at her visitor
23260: with placid expectation, while Gwendolen began in a low tone, with
23261: something that seemed like bashfulness,
23262: 
23263: “Perhaps you wonder to see me—perhaps I ought to have written—but I
23264: wished to make a particular request.”
23265: 
23266: “I am glad to see you instead of having a letter,” said Mirah,
23267: wondering at the changed expression and manner of the “Vandyke
23268: duchess,” as Hans had taught her to call Gwendolen. The rich color and
23269: the calmness of her own face were in strong contrast with the pale
23270: agitated beauty under the plumed hat.
23271: 
23272: “I thought,” Gwendolen went on—“at least I hoped, you would not object
23273: to sing at our house on the 4th—in the evening—at a party like Lady
23274: Brackenshaw’s. I should be so much obliged.”
23275: 
23276: “I shall be very happy to sing for you. At ten?” said Mirah, while
23277: Gwendolen seemed to get more instead of less embarrassed.
23278: 
23279: “At ten, please,” she answered; then paused, and felt that she had
23280: nothing more to say. She could not go. It was impossible to rise and
23281: say good-bye. Deronda’s voice was in her ears. She must say it—she
23282: could contrive no other sentence,
23283: 
23284: “Mr. Deronda is in the next room.”
23285: 
23286: “Yes,” said Mirah, in her former tone. “He is reading Hebrew with my
23287: brother.”
23288: 
23289: “You have a brother?” said Gwendolen, who had heard this from Lady
23290: Mallinger, but had not minded it then.
23291: 
23292: “Yes, a dear brother who is ill—consumptive, and Mr. Deronda is the
23293: best of friends to him, as he has been to me,” said Mirah, with the
23294: impulse that will not let us pass the mention of a precious person
23295: indifferently.
23296: 
23297: “Tell me,” said Gwendolen, putting her hand on Mirah’s, and speaking
23298: hardly above a whisper—“tell me—tell me the truth. You are sure he is
23299: quite good. You know no evil of him. Any evil that people say of him is
23300: false.”
23301: 
23302: Could the proud-spirited woman have behaved more like a child? But the
23303: strange words penetrated Mirah with nothing but a sense of solemnity
23304: and indignation. With a sudden light in her eyes and a tremor in her
23305: voice, she said,
23306: 
23307: “Who are the people that say evil of him? I would not believe any evil
23308: of him, if an angel came to tell it me. He found me when I was so
23309: miserable—I was going to drown myself; I looked so poor and forsaken;
23310: you would have thought I was a beggar by the wayside. And he treated me
23311: as if I had been a king’s daughter. He took me to the best of women. He
23312: found my brother for me. And he honors my brother—though he too was
23313: poor—oh, almost as poor as he could be. And my brother honors him.
23314: That is no light thing to say”—here Mirah’s tone changed to one of
23315: profound emphasis, and she shook her head backward: “for my brother is
23316: very learned and great-minded. And Mr. Deronda says there are few men
23317: equal to him.” Some Jewish defiance had flamed into her indignant
23318: gratitude and her anger could not help including Gwendolen since she
23319: seemed to have doubted Deronda’s goodness.
23320: 
23321: But Gwendolen was like one parched with thirst, drinking the fresh
23322: water that spreads through the frame as a sufficient bliss. She did not
23323: notice that Mirah was angry with her; she was not distinctly conscious
23324: of anything but of the penetrating sense that Deronda and his life were
23325: no more like her husband’s conception than the morning in the horizon
23326: was like the morning mixed with street gas. Even Mirah’s words sank
23327: into the indefiniteness of her relief. She could hardly have repeated
23328: them, or said how her whole state of feeling was changed. She pressed
23329: Mirah’s hand, and said, “Thank you, thank you,” in a hurried whisper,
23330: then rose, and added, with only a hazy consciousness, “I must go, I
23331: shall see you—on the fourth—I am so much obliged”—bowing herself out
23332: automatically, while Mirah, opening the door for her, wondered at what
23333: seemed a sudden retreat into chill loftiness.
23334: 
23335: Gwendolen, indeed, had no feeling to spare in any effusiveness toward
23336: the creature who had brought her relief. The passionate need of
23337: contradiction to Grandcourt’s estimate of Deronda, a need which had
23338: blunted her sensibility to everything else, was no sooner satisfied
23339: than she wanted to be gone. She began to be aware that she was out of
23340: place, and to dread Deronda’s seeing her. And once in the carriage
23341: again, she had the vision of what awaited her at home. When she drew up
23342: before the door in Grosvenor Square, her husband was arriving with a
23343: cigar between his fingers. He threw it away and handed her out,
23344: accompanying her up-stairs. She turned into the drawing-room, lest he
23345: should follow her farther and give her no place to retreat to; then she
23346: sat down with a weary air, taking off her gloves, rubbing her hand over
23347: her forehead, and making his presence as much of a cipher as possible.
23348: But he sat, too, and not far from her—just in front, where to avoid
23349: looking at him must have the emphasis of effort.
23350: 
23351: “May I ask where you have been at this extraordinary hour?” said
23352: Grandcourt.
23353: 
23354: “Oh, yes; I have been to Miss Lapidoth’s, to ask her to come and sing
23355: for us,” said Gwendolen, laying her gloves on the little table beside
23356: her, and looking down at them.
23357: 
23358: “And to ask her about her relations with Deronda?” said Grandcourt,
23359: with the coldest possible sneer in his low voice which in poor
23360: Gwendolen’s ear was diabolical.
23361: 
23362: For the first time since their marriage she flashed out upon him
23363: without inward check. Turning her eyes full on his she said, in a
23364: biting tone,
23365: 
23366: “Yes; and what you said is false—a low, wicked falsehood.”
23367: 
23368: “She told you so—did she?” returned Grandcourt, with a more thoroughly
23369: distilled sneer.
23370: 
23371: Gwendolen was mute. The daring anger within her was turned into the
23372: rage of dumbness. What reasons for her belief could she give? All the
23373: reasons that seemed so strong and living within her—she saw them
23374: suffocated and shrivelled up under her husband’s breath. There was no
23375: proof to give, but her own impression, which would seem to him her own
23376: folly. She turned her head quickly away from him and looked angrily
23377: toward the end of the room: she would have risen, but he was in her way.
23378: 
23379: Grandcourt saw his advantage. “It’s of no consequence so far as her
23380: singing goes,” he said, in his superficial drawl. “You can have her to
23381: sing, if you like.” Then, after a pause, he added in his lowest
23382: imperious tone, “But you will please to observe that you are not to go
23383: near that house again. As my wife, you must take my word about what is
23384: proper for you. When you undertook to be Mrs. Grandcourt, you undertook
23385: not to make a fool of yourself. You have been making a fool of yourself
23386: this morning; and if you were to go on as you have begun, you might
23387: soon get yourself talked of at the clubs in a way you would not like.
23388: What do _you_ know about the world? You have married _me_, and must be
23389: guided by my opinion.”
23390: 
23391: Every slow sentence of that speech had a terrific mastery in it for
23392: Gwendolen’s nature. If the low tones had come from a physician telling
23393: her that her symptoms were those of a fatal disease, and
23394: prognosticating its course, she could not have been more helpless
23395: against the argument that lay in it. But she was permitted to move now,
23396: and her husband never again made any reference to what had occurred
23397: this morning. He knew the force of his own words. If this white-handed
23398: man with the perpendicular profile had been sent to govern a difficult
23399: colony, he might have won reputation among his contemporaries. He had
23400: certainly ability, would have understood that it was safer to
23401: exterminate than to cajole superseded proprietors, and would not have
23402: flinched from making things safe in that way.
23403: 
23404: Gwendolen did not, for all this, part with her recovered
23405: faith;—rather, she kept it with a more anxious tenacity, as a
23406: Protestant of old kept his bible hidden or a Catholic his crucifix,
23407: according to the side favored by the civil arm; and it was
23408: characteristic of her that apart from the impression gained concerning
23409: Deronda in that visit, her imagination was little occupied with Mirah
23410: or the eulogised brother. The one result established for her was, that
23411: Deronda had acted simply as a generous benefactor, and the phrase
23412: “reading Hebrew” had fleeted unimpressively across her sense of
23413: hearing, as a stray stork might have made its peculiar flight across
23414: her landscape without rousing any surprised reflection on its natural
23415: history.
23416: 
23417: But the issue of that visit, as it regarded her husband, took a
23418: strongly active part in the process which made an habitual conflict
23419: within her, and was the cause of some external change perhaps not
23420: observed by any one except Deronda. As the weeks went on bringing
23421: occasional transient interviews with her, he thought that he perceived
23422: in her an intensifying of her superficial hardness and resolute
23423: display, which made her abrupt betrayals of agitation the more marked
23424: and disturbing to him.
23425: 
23426: In fact, she was undergoing a sort of discipline for the refractory
23427: which, as little as possible like conversion, bends half the self with
23428: a terrible strain, and exasperates the unwillingness of the other half.
23429: Grandcourt had an active divination rather than discernment of
23430: refractoriness in her, and what had happened about Mirah quickened his
23431: suspicion that there was an increase of it dependent on the occasions
23432: when she happened to see Deronda: there was some “confounded nonsense”
23433: between them: he did not imagine it exactly as flirtation, and his
23434: imagination in other branches was rather restricted; but it was
23435: nonsense that evidently kept up a kind of simmering in her mind—an
23436: inward action which might become disagreeable outward. Husbands in the
23437: old time are known to have suffered from a threatening devoutness in
23438: their wives, presenting itself first indistinctly as oddity, and ending
23439: in that mild form of lunatic asylum, a nunnery: Grandcourt had a vague
23440: perception of threatening moods in Gwendolen which the unity between
23441: them in his views of marriage required him peremptorily to check. Among
23442: the means he chose, one was peculiar, and was less ably calculated than
23443: the speeches we have just heard.
23444: 
23445: He determined that she should know the main purport of the will he was
23446: making, but he could not communicate this himself, because it involved
23447: the fact of his relation to Mrs. Glasher and her children; and that
23448: there should be any overt recognition of this between Gwendolen and
23449: himself was supremely repugnant to him. Like all proud, closely-wrapped
23450: natures, he shrank from explicitness and detail, even on trivialities,
23451: if they were personal: a valet must maintain a strict reserve with him
23452: on the subject of shoes and stockings. And clashing was intolerable to
23453: him; his habitual want was to put collision out of the question by the
23454: quiet massive pressure of his rule. But he wished Gwendolen to know
23455: that before he made her an offer it was no secret to him that she was
23456: aware of his relations with Lydia, her previous knowledge being the
23457: apology for bringing the subject before her now. Some men in his place
23458: might have thought of writing what he wanted her to know, in the form
23459: of a letter. But Grandcourt hated writing: even writing a note was a
23460: bore to him, and he had long been accustomed to have all his writing
23461: done by Lush. We know that there are persons who will forego their own
23462: obvious interest rather than do anything so disagreeable as to write
23463: letters; and it is not probable that these imperfect utilitarians would
23464: rush into manuscript and syntax on a difficult subject in order to save
23465: another’s feelings. To Grandcourt it did not even occur that he should,
23466: would, or could write to Gwendolen the information in question; and the
23467: only medium of communication he could use was Lush, who, to his mind,
23468: was as much of an implement as pen and paper. But here too Grandcourt
23469: had his reserves, and would not have uttered a word likely to encourage
23470: Lush in an impudent sympathy with any supposed grievance in a marriage
23471: which had been discommended by him. Who that has a confidant escapes
23472: believing too little in his penetration, and too much in his
23473: discretion? Grandcourt had always allowed Lush to know his external
23474: affairs indiscriminately—irregularities, debts, want of ready money;
23475: he had only used discrimination about what he would allow his confidant
23476: to say to him; and he had been so accustomed to this human tool, that
23477: the having him at call in London was a recovery of lost ease. It
23478: followed that Lush knew all the provisions of the will more exactly
23479: than they were known to the testator himself.
23480: 
23481: Grandcourt did not doubt that Gwendolen, since she was a woman who
23482: could put two and two together, knew or suspected Lush to be the
23483: contriver of her interview with Lydia, and that this was the reason why
23484: her first request was for his banishment. But the bent of a woman’s
23485: inferences on mixed subjects which excites mixed passions is not
23486: determined by her capacity for simple addition; and here Grandcourt
23487: lacked the only organ of thinking that could have saved him from
23488: mistake—namely, some experience of the mixed passions concerned. He
23489: had correctly divined one-half of Gwendolen’s dread—all that related
23490: to her personal pride, and her perception that his will must conquer
23491: hers; but the remorseful half, even if he had known of her broken
23492: promise, was as much out of his imagination as the other side of the
23493: moon. What he believed her to feel about Lydia was solely a tongue-tied
23494: jealousy, and what he believed Lydia to have written with the jewels
23495: was the fact that she had once been used to wearing them, with other
23496: amenities such as he imputed to the intercourse with jealous women. He
23497: had the triumphant certainty that he could aggravate the jealousy and
23498: yet smite it with a more absolute dumbness. His object was to engage
23499: all his wife’s egoism on the same side as his own, and in his
23500: employment of Lush he did not intend an insult to her: she ought to
23501: understand that he was the only possible envoy. Grandcourt’s view of
23502: things was considerably fenced in by his general sense, that what
23503: suited him others must put up with. There is no escaping the fact that
23504: want of sympathy condemns us to corresponding stupidity. Mephistopheles
23505: thrown upon real life, and obliged to manage his own plots, would
23506: inevitably make blunders.
23507: 
23508: One morning he went to Gwendolen in the boudoir beyond the back
23509: drawing-room, hat and gloves in hand, and said with his best-tempered,
23510: most persuasive drawl, standing before her and looking down on her as
23511: she sat with a book on her lap,
23512: 
23513: “A—Gwendolen, there’s some business about property to be explained. I
23514: have told Lush to come and explain it to you. He knows all about these
23515: things. I am going out. He can come up now. He’s the only person who
23516: can explain. I suppose you’ll not mind.”
23517: 
23518: “You know that I do mind,” said Gwendolen, angrily, starting up. “I
23519: shall not see him.” She showed the intention to dart away to the door.
23520: Grandcourt was before her, with his back toward it. He was prepared for
23521: her anger, and showed none in return, saying, with the same sort of
23522: remonstrant tone that he might have used about an objection to dining
23523: out,
23524: 
23525: “It’s no use making a fuss. There are plenty of brutes in the world
23526: that one has to talk to. People with any _savoir vivre_ don’t make a
23527: fuss about such things. Some business must be done. You can’t expect
23528: agreeable people to do it. If I employ Lush, the proper thing for you
23529: is to take it as a matter of course. Not to make a fuss about it. Not
23530: to toss your head and bite your lips about people of that sort.”
23531: 
23532: The drawling and the pauses with which this speech was uttered gave
23533: time for crowding reflections in Gwendolen, quelling her resistance.
23534: What was there to be told her about property? This word had certain
23535: dominant associations for her, first with her mother, then with Mrs.
23536: Glasher and her children. What would be the use if she refused to see
23537: Lush? Could she ask Grandcourt to tell her himself? That might be
23538: intolerable, even if he consented, which it was certain he would not,
23539: if he had made up his mind to the contrary. The humiliation of standing
23540: an obvious prisoner, with her husband barring the door, was not to be
23541: borne any longer, and she turned away to lean against a cabinet, while
23542: Grandcourt again moved toward her.
23543: 
23544: “I have arranged for Lush to come up now, while I am out,” he said,
23545: after a long organ stop, during which Gwendolen made no sign. “Shall I
23546: tell him he may come?”
23547: 
23548: Yet another pause before she could say “Yes”—her face turned obliquely
23549: and her eyes cast down.
23550: 
23551: “I shall come back in time to ride, if you like to get ready,” said
23552: Grandcourt. No answer. “She is in a desperate rage,” thought he. But
23553: the rage was silent, and therefore not disagreeable to him. It followed
23554: that he turned her chin and kissed her, while she still kept her
23555: eyelids down, and she did not move them until he was on the other side
23556: of the door.
23557: 
23558: What was she to do? Search where she would in her consciousness, she
23559: found no plea to justify a plaint. Any romantic illusions she had had
23560: in marrying this man had turned on her power of using him as she liked.
23561: He was using her as he liked.
23562: 
23563: She sat awaiting the announcement of Lush as a sort of searing
23564: operation that she had to go through. The facts that galled her
23565: gathered a burning power when she thought of their lying in his mind.
23566: It was all a part of that new gambling, in which the losing was not
23567: simply a _minus_, but a terrible _plus_ that had never entered into her
23568: reckoning.
23569: 
23570: Lush was neither quite pleased nor quite displeased with his task.
23571: Grandcourt had said to him by way of conclusion, “Don’t make yourself
23572: more disagreeable than nature obliges you.”
23573: 
23574: “That depends,” thought Lush. But he said, “I will write a brief
23575: abstract for Mrs. Grandcourt to read.” He did not suggest that he
23576: should make the whole communication in writing, which was a proof that
23577: the interview did not wholly displease him.
23578: 
23579: Some provision was being made for himself in the will, and he had no
23580: reason to be in a bad humor, even if a bad humor had been common with
23581: him. He was perfectly convinced that he had penetrated all the secrets
23582: of the situation; but he had no diabolical delight in it. He had only
23583: the small movements of gratified self-loving resentment in discerning
23584: that this marriage had fulfilled his own foresight in not being as
23585: satisfactory as the supercilious young lady had expected it to be, and
23586: as Grandcourt wished to feign that it was. He had no persistent spite
23587: much stronger than what gives the seasoning of ordinary scandal to
23588: those who repeat it and exaggerate it by their conjectures. With no
23589: active compassion or good-will, he had just as little active
23590: malevolence, being chiefly occupied in liking his particular pleasures,
23591: and not disliking anything but what hindered those
23592: pleasures—everything else ranking with the last murder and the last
23593: _opéra bouffe_, under the head of things to talk about. Nevertheless,
23594: he was not indifferent to the prospect of being treated uncivilly by a
23595: beautiful woman, or to the counterbalancing fact that his present
23596: commission put into his hands an official power of humiliating her. He
23597: did not mean to use it needlessly; but there are some persons so gifted
23598: in relation to us that their “How do you do?” seems charged with
23599: offense.
23600: 
23601: By the time that Mr. Lush was announced, Gwendolen had braced herself
23602: to a bitter resolve that he should not witness the slightest betrayal
23603: of her feeling, whatever he might have to tell. She invited him to sit
23604: down with stately quietude. After all, what was this man to her? He was
23605: not in the least like her husband. Her power of hating a coarse,
23606: familiar-mannered man, with clumsy hands, was now relaxed by the
23607: intensity with which she hated his contrast.
23608: 
23609: He held a small paper folded in his hand while he spoke.
23610: 
23611: “I need hardly say that I should not have presented myself if Mr.
23612: Grandcourt had not expressed a strong wish to that effect—as no doubt
23613: he has mentioned to you.”
23614: 
23615: From some voices that speech might have sounded entirely reverential,
23616: and even timidly apologetic. Lush had no intention to the contrary, but
23617: to Gwendolen’s ear his words had as much insolence in them as his
23618: prominent eyes, and the pronoun “you” was too familiar. He ought to
23619: have addressed the folding-screen, and spoke of her as Mrs. Grandcourt.
23620: She gave the smallest sign of a bow, and Lush went on, with a little
23621: awkwardness, getting entangled in what is elegantly called tautology.
23622: 
23623: “My having been in Mr. Grandcourt’s confidence for fifteen years or
23624: more—since he was a youth, in fact—of course gives me a peculiar
23625: position. He can speak to me of affairs that he could not mention to
23626: any one else; and, in fact, he could not have employed any one else in
23627: this affair. I have accepted the task out of friendship for him. Which
23628: is my apology for accepting the task—if you would have preferred some
23629: one else.”
23630: 
23631: He paused, but she made no sign, and Lush, to give himself a
23632: countenance in an apology which met no acceptance, opened the folded
23633: paper, and looked at it vaguely before he began to speak again.
23634: 
23635: “This paper contains some information about Mr. Grandcourt’s will, an
23636: abstract of a part he wished you to know—if you’ll be good enough to
23637: cast your eyes over it. But there is something I had to say by way of
23638: introduction—which I hope you’ll pardon me for, if it’s not quite
23639: agreeable.” Lush found that he was behaving better than he had
23640: expected, and had no idea how insulting he made himself with his “not
23641: quite agreeable.”
23642: 
23643: “Say what you have to say without apologizing, please,” said Gwendolen,
23644: with the air she might have bestowed on a dog-stealer come to claim a
23645: reward for finding the dog he had stolen.
23646: 
23647: “I have only to remind you of something that occurred before your
23648: engagement to Mr. Grandcourt,” said Lush, not without the rise of some
23649: willing insolence in exchange for her scorn. “You met a lady in Cardell
23650: Chase, if you remember, who spoke to you of her position with regard to
23651: Mr. Grandcourt. She had children with her—one a very fine boy.”
23652: 
23653: Gwendolen’s lips were almost as pale as her cheeks; her passion had no
23654: weapons—words were no better than chips. This man’s speech was like a
23655: sharp knife-edge drawn across her skin: but even her indignation at the
23656: employment of Lush was getting merged in a crowd of other feelings, dim
23657: and alarming as a crowd of ghosts.
23658: 
23659: “Mr. Grandcourt was aware that you were acquainted with this
23660: unfortunate affair beforehand, and he thinks it only right that his
23661: position and intentions should be made quite clear to you. It is an
23662: affair of property and prospects; and if there were any objection you
23663: had to make, if you would mention it to me—it is a subject which of
23664: course he would rather not speak about himself—if you will be good
23665: enough just to read this.” With the last words Lush rose and presented
23666: the paper to her.
23667: 
23668: When Gwendolen resolved that she would betray no feeling in the
23669: presence of this man, she had not prepared herself to hear that her
23670: husband knew the silent consciousness, the silently accepted terms on
23671: which she had married him. She dared not raise her hand to take the
23672: paper, least it should visibly tremble. For a moment Lush stood holding
23673: it toward her, and she felt his gaze on her as ignominy, before she
23674: could say even with low-toned haughtiness,
23675: 
23676: “Lay it on the table. And go into the next room, please.”
23677: 
23678: Lush obeyed, thinking as he took an easy-chair in the back
23679: drawing-room, “My lady winces considerably. She didn’t know what would
23680: be the charge for that superfine article, Henleigh Grandcourt.” But it
23681: seemed to him that a penniless girl had done better than she had any
23682: right to expect, and that she had been uncommonly knowing for her years
23683: and opportunities: her words to Lydia meant nothing, and her running
23684: away had probably been part of her adroitness. It had turned out a
23685: master-stroke.
23686: 
23687: Meanwhile Gwendolen was rallying her nerves to the reading of the
23688: paper. She must read it. Her whole being—pride, longing for rebellion,
23689: dreams of freedom, remorseful conscience, dread of fresh
23690: visitation—all made one need to know what the paper contained. But at
23691: first it was not easy to take in the meaning of the words. When she had
23692: succeeded, she found that in the case of there being no son as issue of
23693: her marriage, Grandcourt had made the small Henleigh his heir; that was
23694: all she cared to extract from the paper with any distinctness. The
23695: other statement as to what provision would be made for her in the same
23696: case, she hurried over, getting only a confused perception of thousands
23697: and Gadsmere. It was enough. She could dismiss the man in the next room
23698: with the defiant energy which had revived in her at the idea that this
23699: question of property and inheritance was meant as a finish to her
23700: humiliations and her thraldom.
23701: 
23702: She thrust the paper between the leaves of her book, which she took in
23703: her hand, and walked with her stateliest air into the next room, where
23704: Lush immediately arose, awaiting her approach. When she was four yards
23705: from him, it was hardly an instant that she paused to say in a high
23706: tone, while she swept him with her eyelashes,
23707: 
23708: “Tell Mr. Grandcourt that his arrangements are just what I
23709: desired”—passing on without haste, and leaving Lush time to mingle
23710: some admiration of her graceful back with that half-amused sense of her
23711: spirit and impertinence, which he expressed by raising his eyebrows and
23712: just thrusting his tongue between his teeth. He really did not want her
23713: to be worse punished, and he was glad to think that it was time to go
23714: and lunch at the club, where he meant to have a lobster salad.
23715: 
23716: What did Gwendolen look forward to? When her husband returned he found
23717: her equipped in her riding-dress, ready to ride out with him. She was
23718: not again going to be hysterical, or take to her bed and say she was
23719: ill. That was the implicit resolve adjusting her muscles before she
23720: could have framed it in words, as she walked out of the room, leaving
23721: Lush behind her. She was going to act in the spirit of her message, and
23722: not to give herself time to reflect. She rang the bell for her maid,
23723: and went with the usual care through her change of toilet. Doubtless
23724: her husband had meant to produce a great effect on her: by-and-by
23725: perhaps she would let him see an effect the very opposite of what he
23726: intended; but at present all that she could show was a defiant
23727: satisfaction in what had been presumed to be disagreeable. It came as
23728: an instinct rather than a thought, that to show any sign which could be
23729: interpreted as jealousy, when she had just been insultingly reminded
23730: that the conditions were what she had accepted with her eyes open,
23731: would be the worst self-humiliation. She said to herself that she had
23732: not time to-day to be clear about her future actions; all she could be
23733: clear about was that she would match her husband in ignoring any ground
23734: for excitement. She not only rode, but went out with him to dine,
23735: contributing nothing to alter their mutual manner, which was never that
23736: of rapid interchange in discourse; and curiously enough she rejected a
23737: handkerchief on which her maid had by mistake put the wrong scent—a
23738: scent that Grandcourt had once objected to. Gwendolen would not have
23739: liked to be an object of disgust to this husband whom she hated: she
23740: liked all disgust to be on her side.
23741: 
23742: But to defer thought in this way was something like trying to talk
23743: without singing in her own ears. The thought that is bound up with our
23744: passion is as penetrative as air—everything is porous to it; bows,
23745: smiles, conversation, repartee, are mere honeycombs where such thoughts
23746: rushes freely, not always with a taste of honey. And without shutting
23747: herself up in any solitude, Gwendolen seemed at the end of nine or ten
23748: hours to have gone through a labyrinth of reflection, in which already
23749: the same succession of prospects had been repeated, the same fallacious
23750: outlets rejected, the same shrinking from the necessities of every
23751: course. Already she was undergoing some hardening effect from feeling
23752: that she was under eyes which saw her past actions solely in the light
23753: of her lowest motives. She lived back in the scenes of her courtship,
23754: with the new bitter consciousness of what had been in Grandcourt’s
23755: mind—certain now, with her present experience of him, that he had a
23756: peculiar triumph in conquering her dumb repugnance, and that ever since
23757: their marriage he had had a cold exultation in knowing her fancied
23758: secret. Her imagination exaggerated every tyrannical impulse he was
23759: capable of. “I will insist on being separated from him”—was her first
23760: darting determination; then, “I will leave him whether he consents or
23761: not. If this boy becomes his heir, I have made an atonement.” But
23762: neither in darkness nor in daylight could she imagine the scenes which
23763: must carry out those determinations with the courage to feel them
23764: endurable. How could she run away to her own family—carry distress
23765: among them, and render herself an object of scandal in the society she
23766: had left behind her? What future lay before her as Mrs. Grandcourt gone
23767: back to her mother, who would be made destitute again by the rupture of
23768: the marriage for which one chief excuse had been that it had brought
23769: that mother a maintenance? She had lately been seeing her uncle and
23770: Anna in London, and though she had been saved from any difficulty about
23771: inviting them to stay in Grosvenor Square by their wish to be with Rex,
23772: who would not risk a meeting with her, the transient visit she had had
23773: from them helped now in giving stronger color to the picture of what it
23774: would be for her to take refuge in her own family. What could she say
23775: to justify her flight? Her uncle would tell her to go back. Her mother
23776: would cry. Her aunt and Anna would look at her with wondering alarm.
23777: Her husband would have power to compel her. She had absolutely nothing
23778: that she could allege against him in judicious or judicial ears. And to
23779: “insist on separation!” That was an easy combination of words; but
23780: considered as an action to be executed against Grandcourt, it would be
23781: about as practicable as to give him a pliant disposition and a dread of
23782: other people’s unwillingness. How was she to begin? What was she to say
23783: that would not be a condemnation of herself? “If I am to have misery
23784: anyhow,” was the bitter refrain of her rebellious dreams, “I had better
23785: have the misery that I can keep to myself.” Moreover, her capability of
23786: rectitude told her again and again that she had no right to complain of
23787: her contract, or to withdraw from it.
23788: 
23789: And always among the images that drove her back to submission was
23790: Deronda. The idea of herself separated from her husband, gave Deronda a
23791: changed, perturbing, painful place in her consciousness: instinctively
23792: she felt that the separation would be from him too, and in the
23793: prospective vision of herself as a solitary, dubiously-regarded woman,
23794: she felt some tingling bashfulness at the remembrance of her behavior
23795: towards him. The association of Deronda with a dubious position for
23796: herself was intolerable. And what would he say if he knew everything?
23797: Probably that she ought to bear what she had brought on herself, unless
23798: she were sure that she could make herself a better woman by taking any
23799: other course. And what sort of woman was she to be—solitary, sickened
23800: of life, looked at with a suspicious kind of pity?—even if she could
23801: dream of success in getting that dreary freedom. Mrs. Grandcourt “run
23802: away” would be a more pitiable creature than Gwendolen Harleth
23803: condemned to teach the bishop’s daughters, and to be inspected by Mrs.
23804: Mompert.
23805: 
23806: One characteristic trait in her conduct is worth mentioning. She would
23807: not look a second time at the paper Lush had given her; and before
23808: ringing for her maid she locked it up in a traveling-desk which was at
23809: hand, proudly resolved against curiosity about what was allotted to
23810: herself in connection with Gadsmere—feeling herself branded in the
23811: minds of her husband and his confidant with the meanness that would
23812: accept marriage and wealth on any conditions, however dishonorable and
23813: humiliating.
23814: 
23815: Day after day the same pattern of thinking was repeated. There came
23816: nothing to change the situation—no new elements in the sketch—only a
23817: recurrence which engraved it. The May weeks went on into June, and
23818: still Mrs. Grandcourt was outwardly in the same place, presenting
23819: herself as she was expected to do in the accustomed scenes, with the
23820: accustomed grace, beauty, and costume; from church at one end of the
23821: week, through all the scale of desirable receptions, to opera at the
23822: other. Church was not markedly distinguished in her mind from the other
23823: forms of self-presentation, for marriage had included no instruction
23824: that enabled her to connect liturgy and sermon with any larger order of
23825: the world than that of unexplained and perhaps inexplicable social
23826: fashions. While a laudable zeal was laboring to carry the light of
23827: spiritual law up the alleys where law is chiefly known as the
23828: policeman, the brilliant Mrs. Grandcourt, condescending a little to a
23829: fashionable rector and conscious of a feminine advantage over a learned
23830: dean, was, so far as pastoral care and religious fellowship were
23831: concerned, in as complete a solitude as a man in a lighthouse.
23832: 
23833: Can we wonder at the practical submission which hid her constructive
23834: rebellion? The combination is common enough, as we know from the number
23835: of persons who make us aware of it in their own case by a clamorous
23836: unwearied statement of the reasons against their submitting to a
23837: situation which, on inquiry, we discover to be the least disagreeable
23838: within their reach. Poor Gwendolen had both too much and too little
23839: mental power and dignity to make herself exceptional. No wonder that
23840: Deronda now marked some hardening in a look and manner which were
23841: schooled daily to the suppression of feeling.
23842: 
23843: For example. One morning, riding in Rotten Row with Grandcourt by her
23844: side, she saw standing against the railing at the turn, just facing
23845: them, a dark-eyed lady with a little girl and a blonde boy, whom she at
23846: once recognized as the beings in all the world the most painful for her
23847: to behold. She and Grandcourt had just slackened their pace to a walk;
23848: he being on the outer side was the nearer to the unwelcome vision, and
23849: Gwendolen had not presence of mind to do anything but glance away from
23850: the dark eyes that met hers piercingly toward Grandcourt, who wheeled
23851: past the group with an unmoved face, giving no sign of recognition.
23852: 
23853: Immediately she felt a rising rage against him mingling with her shame
23854: for herself, and the words, “You might at least have raised your hat to
23855: her,” flew impetuously to her lips—but did not pass them. If as her
23856: husband, in her company, he chose to ignore these creatures whom she
23857: herself had excluded from the place she was filling, how could she be
23858: the person to reproach him? She was dumb.
23859: 
23860: It was not chance, but her own design, that had brought Mrs. Glasher
23861: there with her boy. She had come to town under the pretext of making
23862: purchases—really wanting educational apparatus for her children, and
23863: had had interviews with Lush in which she had not refused to soothe her
23864: uneasy mind by representing the probabilities as all on the side of her
23865: ultimate triumph. Let her keep quiet, and she might live to see the
23866: marriage dissolve itself in one way or other—Lush hinted at several
23867: ways—leaving the succession assured to her boy. She had had an
23868: interview with Grandcourt, too, who had as usual told her to behave
23869: like a reasonable woman, and threatened punishment if she were
23870: troublesome; but had, also as usual, vindicated himself from any wish
23871: to be stingy, the money he was receiving from Sir Hugo on account of
23872: Diplow encouraging him to be lavish. Lydia, feeding on the
23873: probabilities in her favor, devoured her helpless wrath along with that
23874: pleasanter nourishment; but she could not let her discretion go
23875: entirely without the reward of making a Medusa-apparition before
23876: Gwendolen, vindictiveness and jealousy finding relief in an outlet of
23877: venom, though it were as futile as that of a viper already flung on the
23878: other side of the hedge. Hence, each day, after finding out from Lush
23879: the likely time for Gwendolen to be riding, she had watched at that
23880: post, daring Grandcourt so far. Why should she not take little Henleigh
23881: into the Park?
23882: 
23883: The Medusa-apparition was made effective beyond Lydia’s conception by
23884: the shock it gave Gwendolen actually to see Grandcourt ignoring this
23885: woman who had once been the nearest in the world to him, along with the
23886: children she had borne him. And all the while the dark shadow thus cast
23887: on the lot of a woman destitute of acknowledged social dignity, spread
23888: itself over her visions of a future that might be her own, and made
23889: part of her dread on her own behalf. She shrank all the more from any
23890: lonely action. What possible release could there be for her from this
23891: hated vantage ground, which yet she dared not quit, any more than if
23892: fire had been raining outside it? What release, but death? Not her own
23893: death. Gwendolen was not a woman who could easily think of her own
23894: death as a near reality, or front for herself the dark entrance on the
23895: untried and invisible. It seemed more possible that Grandcourt should
23896: die:—and yet not likely. The power of tyranny in him seemed a power of
23897: living in the presence of any wish that he should die. The thought that
23898: his death was the only possible deliverance for her was one with the
23899: thought that deliverance would never come—the double deliverance from
23900: the injury with which other beings might reproach her and from the yoke
23901: she had brought on her own neck. No! she foresaw him always living, and
23902: her own life dominated by him; the “always” of her young experience not
23903: stretching beyond the few immediate years that seemed immeasurably long
23904: with her passionate weariness. The thought of his dying would not
23905: subsist: it turned as with a dream-change into the terror that she
23906: should die with his throttling fingers on her neck avenging that
23907: thought. Fantasies moved within her like ghosts, making no break in her
23908: more acknowledged consciousness and finding no obstruction in it: dark
23909: rays doing their work invisibly in the broad light.
23910: 
23911: Only an evening or two after that encounter in the Park, there was a
23912: grand concert at Klesmer’s, who was living rather magnificently now in
23913: one of the large houses in Grosvenor Place, a patron and prince among
23914: musical professors. Gwendolen had looked forward to this occasion as
23915: one on which she was sure to meet Deronda, and she had been meditating
23916: how to put a question to him which, without containing a word that she
23917: would feel a dislike to utter, would yet be explicit enough for him to
23918: understand it. The struggle of opposite feelings would not let her
23919: abide by her instinct that the very idea of Deronda’s relation to her
23920: was a discouragement to any desperate step towards freedom. The next
23921: wave of emotion was a longing for some word of his to enforce a
23922: resolve. The fact that her opportunities of conversation with him had
23923: always to be snatched in the doubtful privacy of large parties, caused
23924: her to live through them many times beforehand, imagining how they
23925: would take place and what she would say. The irritation was
23926: proportionate when no opportunity came; and this evening at Klesmer’s
23927: she included Deronda in her anger, because he looked as calm as
23928: possible at a distance from her, while she was in danger of betraying
23929: her impatience to every one who spoke to her. She found her only safety
23930: in a chill haughtiness which made Mr. Vandernoodt remark that Mrs.
23931: Grandcourt was becoming a perfect match for her husband. When at last
23932: the chances of the evening brought Deronda near her, Sir Hugo and Mrs.
23933: Raymond were close by and could hear every word she said. No matter:
23934: her husband was not near, and her irritation passed without check into
23935: a fit of daring which restored the security of her self-possession.
23936: Deronda was there at last, and she would compel him to do what she
23937: pleased. Already and without effort rather queenly in her air as she
23938: stood in her white lace and green leaves she threw a royal
23939: permissiveness into her way of saying, “I wish you would come and see
23940: me to-morrow between five and six, Mr. Deronda.”
23941: 
23942: There could be but one answer at that moment: “Certainly,” with a tone
23943: of obedience.
23944: 
23945: Afterward it occurred to Deronda that he would write a note to excuse
23946: himself. He had always avoided making a call at Grandcourt’s. He could
23947: not persuade himself to any step that might hurt her, and whether his
23948: excuse were taken for indifference or for the affectation of
23949: indifference it would be equally wounding. He kept his promise.
23950: Gwendolen had declined to ride out on the plea of not feeling well
23951: enough having left her refusal to the last moment when the horses were
23952: soon to be at the door—not without alarm lest her husband should say
23953: that he too would stay at home. Become almost superstitious about his
23954: power of suspicious divination, she had a glancing forethought of what
23955: she would do in that case—namely, have herself denied as not well. But
23956: Grandcourt accepted her excuse without remark, and rode off.
23957: 
23958: Nevertheless when Gwendolen found herself alone, and had sent down the
23959: order that only Mr. Deronda was to be admitted, she began to be alarmed
23960: at what she had done, and to feel a growing agitation in the thought
23961: that he would soon appear, and she should soon be obliged to speak: not
23962: of trivialities, as if she had no serious motive in asking him to come:
23963: and yet what she had been for hours determining to say began to seem
23964: impossible. For the first time the impulse of appeal to him was being
23965: checked by timidity, and now that it was too late she was shaken by the
23966: possibility that he might think her invitation unbecoming. If so, she
23967: would have sunk in his esteem. But immediately she resisted this
23968: intolerable fear as an infection from her husband’s way of thinking.
23969: That _he_ would say she was making a fool of herself was rather a
23970: reason why such a judgment would be remote from Deronda’s mind. But
23971: that she could not rid herself from this sudden invasion of womanly
23972: reticence was manifest in a kind of action which had never occurred to
23973: her before. In her struggle between agitation and the effort to
23974: suppress it, she was walking up and down the length of the two
23975: drawing-rooms, where at one end a long mirror reflected her in her
23976: black dress, chosen in the early morning with a half-admitted reference
23977: to this hour. But above this black dress her head on its white pillar
23978: of a neck showed to advantage. Some consciousness of this made her turn
23979: hastily and hurry to the boudoir, where again there was a glass, but
23980: also, tossed over a chair, a large piece of black lace which she
23981: snatched and tied over her crown of hair so as completely to conceal
23982: her neck, and leave only her face looking out from the black frame. In
23983: this manifest contempt of appearance, she thought it possible to be
23984: freer from nervousness, but the black lace did not take away the
23985: uneasiness from her eyes and lips.
23986: 
23987: She was standing in the middle of the room when Deronda was announced,
23988: and as he approached her she perceived that he too for some reason was
23989: not his usual self. She could not have defined the change except by
23990: saying that he looked less happy than usual, and appeared to be under
23991: some effort in speaking to her. And yet the speaking was the slightest
23992: possible. They both said, “How do you do?” quite curtly; and Gwendolen,
23993: instead of sitting down, moved to a little distance, resting her arms
23994: slightly on the tall back of a chair, while Deronda stood where he
23995: was,—both feeling it difficult to say any more, though the
23996: preoccupation in his mind could hardly have been more remote than it
23997: was from Gwendolen’s conception. She naturally saw in his embarrassment
23998: some reflection of her own. Forced to speak, she found all her training
23999: in concealment and self-command of no use to her and began with timid
24000: awkwardness,
24001: 
24002: “You will wonder why I begged you to come. I wanted to ask you
24003: something. You said I was ignorant. That is true. And what can I do but
24004: ask you?”
24005: 
24006: And at this moment she was feeling it utterly impossible to put the
24007: questions she had intended. Something new in her nervous manner roused
24008: Deronda’s anxiety lest there might be a new crisis. He said with the
24009: sadness of affection in his voice,
24010: 
24011: “My only regret is, that I can be of so little use to you.” The words
24012: and the tone touched a new spring in her, and she went on with more
24013: sense of freedom, yet still not saying anything she had designed to
24014: say, and beginning to hurry, that she might somehow arrive at the right
24015: words.
24016: 
24017: “I wanted to tell you that I have always been thinking of your advice,
24018: but is it any use?—I can’t make myself different, because things about
24019: me raise bad feelings—and I must go on—I can alter nothing—it is no
24020: use.”
24021: 
24022: She paused an instant, with the consciousness that she was not finding
24023: the right words, but began again hurriedly, “But if I go on I shall get
24024: worse. I want not to get worse. I should like to be what you wish.
24025: There are people who are good and enjoy great things—I know there are.
24026: I am a contemptible creature. I feel as if I should get wicked with
24027: hating people. I have tried to think that I would go away from
24028: everybody. But I can’t. There are so many things to hinder me. You
24029: think, perhaps, that I don’t mind. But I do mind. I am afraid of
24030: everything. I am afraid of getting wicked. Tell me what I can do.”
24031: 
24032: She had forgotten everything but that image of her helpless misery
24033: which she was trying to make present to Deronda in broken allusive
24034: speech—wishing to convey but not express all her need. Her eyes were
24035: tearless, and had a look of smarting in their dilated brilliancy; there
24036: was a subdued sob in her voice which was more and more veiled, till it
24037: was hardly above a whisper. She was hurting herself with the jewels
24038: that glittered on her tightly-clasped fingers pressed against her heart.
24039: 
24040: The feeling Deronda endured in these moments he afterward called
24041: horrible. Words seemed to have no more rescue in them than if he had
24042: been beholding a vessel in peril of wreck—the poor ship with its
24043: many-lived anguish beaten by the inescapable storm. How could he grasp
24044: the long-growing process of this young creature’s wretchedness?—how
24045: arrest and change it with a sentence? He was afraid of his own voice.
24046: The words that rushed into his mind seemed in their feebleness nothing
24047: better than despair made audible, or than that insensibility to
24048: another’s hardship which applies precept to soothe pain. He felt
24049: himself holding a crowd of words imprisoned within his lips, as if the
24050: letting them escape would be a violation of awe before the mysteries of
24051: our human lot. The thought that urged itself foremost was—“Confess
24052: everything to your husband; have nothing concealed:”—the words carried
24053: in his mind a vision of reasons which would have needed much fuller
24054: expressions for Gwendolen to apprehend them, but before he had begun
24055: those brief sentences, the door opened and the husband entered.
24056: 
24057: Grandcourt had deliberately gone out and turned back to satisfy a
24058: suspicion. What he saw was Gwendolen’s face of anguish framed black
24059: like a nun’s, and Deronda standing three yards from her with a look of
24060: sorrow such as he might have bent on the last struggle of life in a
24061: beloved object. Without any show of surprise Grandcourt nodded to
24062: Deronda, gave a second look at Gwendolen, passed on, and seated himself
24063: easily at a little distance crossing his legs, taking out his
24064: handkerchief and trifling with it elegantly.
24065: 
24066: Gwendolen had shrunk and changed her attitude on seeing him, but she
24067: did not turn or move from her place. It was not a moment in which she
24068: could feign anything, or manifest any strong revulsion of feeling: the
24069: passionate movement of her last speech was still too strong within her.
24070: What she felt beside was a dull despairing sense that her interview
24071: with Deronda was at an end: a curtain had fallen. But he, naturally,
24072: was urged into self-possession and effort by susceptibility to what
24073: might follow for her from being seen by her husband in this betrayal of
24074: agitation; and feeling that any pretense of ease in prolonging his
24075: visit would only exaggerate Grandcourt’s possible conjectures of
24076: duplicity, he merely said,
24077: 
24078: “I will not stay longer now. Good-bye.”
24079: 
24080: He put out his hand, and she let him press her poor little chill
24081: fingers; but she said no good-bye.
24082: 
24083: When he had left the room, Gwendolen threw herself into a seat, with an
24084: expectation as dull as her despair—the expectation that she was going
24085: to be punished. But Grandcourt took no notice: he was satisfied to have
24086: let her know that she had not deceived him, and to keep a silence which
24087: was formidable with omniscience. He went out that evening, and her plea
24088: of feeling ill was accepted without even a sneer.
24089: 
24090: The next morning at breakfast he said, “I am going yachting to the
24091: Mediterranean.”
24092: 
24093: “When?” said Gwendolen, with a leap of heart which had hope in it.
24094: 
24095: “The day after to-morrow. The yacht is at Marseilles. Lush is gone to
24096: get everything ready.”
24097: 
24098: “Shall I have mamma to stay with me, then?” said Gwendolen, the new
24099: sudden possibility of peace and affection filling her mind like a burst
24100: of morning light.
24101: 
24102: “No; you will go with me.”
24103: 
24104: 
24105: 
24106: 
24107: CHAPTER XLIX.
24108: 
24109:         Ever in his soul
24110:   That larger justice which makes gratitude
24111:   Triumphed above resentment. ’Tis the mark
24112:   Of regal natures, with the wider life.
24113:   And fuller capability of joy:—
24114:   Not wits exultant in the strongest lens
24115:   To show you goodness vanished into pulp
24116:   Never worth “thank you”—they’re the devil’s friars,
24117:   Vowed to be poor as he in love and trust,
24118:   Yet must go begging of a world that keeps
24119:   Some human property.
24120: 
24121: 
24122: Deronda, in parting from Gwendolen, had abstained from saying, “I shall
24123: not see you again for a long while: I am going away,” lest Grandcourt
24124: should understand him to imply that the fact was of importance to her.
24125: 
24126: He was actually going away under circumstances so momentous to himself
24127: that when he set out to fulfill his promise of calling on her, he was
24128: already under the shadow of a solemn emotion which revived the deepest
24129: experience of his life.
24130: 
24131: Sir Hugo had sent for him to his chambers with the note—“Come
24132: immediately. Something has happened:” a preparation that caused him
24133: some relief when, on entering the baronet’s study, he was received with
24134: grave affection instead of the distress which he had apprehended.
24135: 
24136: “It is nothing to grieve you, sir?” said Deronda, in a tone rather of
24137: restored confidence than question, as he took the hand held out to him.
24138: There was an unusual meaning in Sir Hugo’s look, and a subdued emotion
24139: in his voice, as he said,
24140: 
24141: “No, Dan, no. Sit down. I have something to say.”
24142: 
24143: Deronda obeyed, not without presentiment. It was extremely rare for Sir
24144: Hugo to show so much serious feeling.
24145: 
24146: “Not to grieve me, my boy, no. At least, if there is nothing in it that
24147: will grieve you too much. But I hardly expected that this—just
24148: this—would ever happen. There have been reasons why I have never
24149: prepared you for it. There have been reasons why I have never told you
24150: anything about your parentage. But I have striven in every way not to
24151: make that an injury to you.”
24152: 
24153: Sir Hugo paused, but Deronda could not speak. He could not say, “I have
24154: never felt it an injury.” Even if that had been true, he could not have
24155: trusted his voice to say anything. Far more than any one but himself
24156: could know of was hanging on this moment when the secrecy was to be
24157: broken. Sir Hugo had never seen the grand face he delighted in so
24158: pale—the lips pressed together with such a look of pain. He went on
24159: with a more anxious tenderness, as if he had a new fear of wounding.
24160: 
24161: “I have acted in obedience to your mother’s wishes. The secrecy was her
24162: wish. But now she desires to remove it. She desires to see you. I will
24163: put this letter into your hands, which you can look at by-and-by. It
24164: will merely tell you what she wishes you to do, and where you will find
24165: her.”
24166: 
24167: Sir Hugo held out a letter written on foreign paper, which Deronda
24168: thrust into his breast-pocket, with a sense of relief that he was not
24169: called on to read anything immediately. The emotion on Daniel’s face
24170: had gained on the baronet, and was visibly shaking his composure. Sir
24171: Hugo found it difficult to say more. And Deronda’s whole soul was
24172: possessed by a question which was the hardest in the world to utter.
24173: Yet he could not bear to delay it. This was a sacramental moment. If he
24174: let it pass, he could not recover the influences under which it was
24175: possible to utter the words and meet the answer. For some moments his
24176: eyes were cast down, and it seemed to both as if thoughts were in the
24177: air between them. But at last Deronda looked at Sir Hugo, and said,
24178: with a tremulous reverence in his voice—dreading to convey indirectly
24179: the reproach that affection had for years been stifling,
24180: 
24181: “Is my father also living?”
24182: 
24183: The answer came immediately in a low emphatic tone—“No.”
24184: 
24185: In the mingled emotions which followed that answer it was impossible to
24186: distinguish joy from pain.
24187: 
24188: Some new light had fallen on the past for Sir Hugo too in this
24189: interview. After a silence in which Deronda felt like one whose creed
24190: is gone before he has religiously embraced another, the baronet said,
24191: in a tone of confession,
24192: 
24193: “Perhaps I was wrong, Dan, to undertake what I did. And perhaps I liked
24194: it a little too well—having you all to myself. But if you have had any
24195: pain which I might have helped, I ask you to forgive me.”
24196: 
24197: “The forgiveness has long been there,” said Deronda “The chief pain has
24198: always been on account of some one else—whom I never knew—whom I am
24199: now to know. It has not hindered me from feeling an affection for you
24200: which has made a large part of all the life I remember.”
24201: 
24202: It seemed one impulse that made the two men clasp each other’s hand for
24203: a moment.

24208: BOOK VII.—THE MOTHER AND THE SON
24209: 
24210: 
24211: CHAPTER L.
24212: 
24213:         “If some mortal, born too soon,
24214:   Were laid away in some great trance—the ages
24215:   Coming and going all the while—till dawned
24216:   His true time’s advent; and could then record
24217:   The words they spoke who kept watch by his bed,
24218:   Then I might tell more of the breath so light
24219:   Upon my eyelids, and the fingers warm
24220:   Among my hair. Youth is confused; yet never
24221:   So dull was I but, when that spirit passed,
24222:   I turned to him, scarce consciously, as turns
24223:   A water-snake when fairies cross his sleep.”
24224:                     —BROWNING: _Paracelsus_.
24225: 
24226: 
24227: This was the letter which Sir Hugo put into Deronda’s hands:,
24228: 
24229:     TO MY SON, DANIEL DERONDA.
24230: 
24231:     My good friend and yours, Sir Hugo Mallinger, will have told you that
24232:     I wish to see you. My health is shaken, and I desire there should be
24233:     no time lost before I deliver to you what I have long withheld. Let
24234:     nothing hinder you from being at the _Albergo dell’ Italia_ in
24235:     Genoa by the fourteenth of this month. Wait for me there. I am
24236:     uncertain when I shall be able to make the journey from Spezia, where
24237:     I shall be staying. That will depend on several things. Wait for
24238:     me—the Princess Halm-Eberstein. Bring with you the diamond ring that
24239:     Sir Hugo gave you. I shall like to see it again.—Your unknown mother,
24240: 
24241:     LEONORA HALM-EBERSTEIN.
24242: 
24243: This letter with its colorless wording gave Deronda no clue to what was
24244: in reserve for him; but he could not do otherwise than accept Sir
24245: Hugo’s reticence, which seemed to imply some pledge not to anticipate
24246: the mother’s disclosures; and the discovery that his life-long
24247: conjectures had been mistaken checked further surmise. Deronda could
24248: not hinder his imagination from taking a quick flight over what seemed
24249: possibilities, but he refused to contemplate any of them as more likely
24250: than another, lest he should be nursing it into a dominant desire or
24251: repugnance, instead of simply preparing himself with resolve to meet
24252: the fact bravely, whatever it might turn out to be.
24253: 
24254: In this state of mind he could not have communicated to any one the
24255: reason for the absence which in some quarters he was obliged to mention
24256: beforehand, least of all to Mordecai, whom it would affect as
24257: powerfully as it did himself, only in rather a different way. If he
24258: were to say, “I am going to learn the truth about my birth,” Mordecai’s
24259: hope would gather what might prove a painful, dangerous excitement. To
24260: exclude suppositions, he spoke of his journey as being undertaken by
24261: Sir Hugo’s wish, and threw as much indifference as he could into his
24262: manner of announcing it, saying he was uncertain of its duration, but
24263: it would perhaps be very short.
24264: 
24265: “I will ask to have the child Jacob to stay with me,” said Mordecai,
24266: comforting himself in this way, after the first mournful glances.
24267: 
24268: “I will drive round and ask Mrs. Cohen to let him come,” said Mirah.
24269: 
24270: “The grandmother will deny you nothing,” said Deronda. “I’m glad you
24271: were a little wrong as well as I,” he added, smiling at Mordecai. “You
24272: thought that old Mrs. Cohen would not bear to see Mirah.”
24273: 
24274: “I undervalued her heart,” said Mordecai. “She is capable of rejoicing
24275: that another’s plant blooms though her own be withered.”
24276: 
24277: “Oh, they are dear good people; I feel as if we all belonged to each
24278: other,” said Mirah, with a tinge of merriment in her smile.
24279: 
24280: “What should you have felt if that Ezra had been your brother?” said
24281: Deronda, mischievously—a little provoked that she had taken kindly at
24282: once to people who had caused him so much prospective annoyance on her
24283: account.
24284: 
24285: Mirah looked at him with a slight surprise for a moment, and then said,
24286: “He is not a bad man—I think he would never forsake any one.” But when
24287: she uttered the words she blushed deeply, and glancing timidly at
24288: Mordecai, turned away to some occupation. Her father was in her mind,
24289: and this was a subject on which she and her brother had a painful
24290: mutual consciousness. “If he should come and find us!” was a thought
24291: which to Mirah sometimes made the street daylight as shadowy as a
24292: haunted forest where each turn screened for her an imaginary apparition.
24293: 
24294: Deronda felt what was her involuntary allusion, and understood the
24295: blush. How could he be slow to understand feelings which now seemed
24296: nearer than ever to his own? for the words of his mother’s letter
24297: implied that his filial relation was not to be freed from painful
24298: conditions; indeed, singularly enough that letter which had brought his
24299: mother nearer as a living reality had thrown her into more remoteness
24300: for his affections. The tender yearning after a being whose life might
24301: have been the worse for not having his care and love, the image of a
24302: mother who had not had all her dues, whether of reverence or
24303: compassion, had long been secretly present with him in his observation
24304: of all the women he had come near. But it seemed now that this
24305: picturing of his mother might fit the facts no better than his former
24306: conceptions about Sir Hugo. He wondered to find that when this mother’s
24307: very handwriting had come to him with words holding her actual
24308: feeling, his affections had suddenly shrunk into a state of comparative
24309: neutrality toward her. A veiled figure with enigmatic speech had thrust
24310: away that image which, in spite of uncertainty, his clinging thought
24311: had gradually modeled and made the possessor of his tenderness and
24312: duteous longing. When he set off to Genoa, the interest really
24313: uppermost in his mind had hardly so much relation to his mother as to
24314: Mordecai and Mirah.
24315: 
24316: “God bless you, Dan!” Sir Hugo had said, when they shook hands.
24317: “Whatever else changes for you, it can’t change my being the oldest
24318: friend you have known, and the one who has all along felt the most for
24319: you. I couldn’t have loved you better if you’d been my own—only I
24320: should have been better pleased with thinking of you always as the
24321: future master of the Abbey instead of my fine nephew; and then you
24322: would have seen it necessary for you to take a political line.
24323: However—things must be as they may.” It was a defensive movement of
24324: the baronet’s to mingle purposeless remarks with the expression of
24325: serious feeling.
24326: 
24327: When Deronda arrived at the _Italia_ in Genoa, no Princess
24328: Halm-Eberstein was there; but on the second day there was a letter for
24329: him, saying that her arrival might happen within a week, or might be
24330: deferred a fortnight and more; she was under circumstances which made
24331: it impossible for her to fix her journey more precisely, and she
24332: entreated him to wait as patiently as he could.
24333: 
24334: With this indefinite prospect of suspense on matters of supreme moment
24335: to him, Deronda set about the difficult task of seeking amusement on
24336: philosophic grounds, as a means of quieting excited feeling and giving
24337: patience a lift over a weary road. His former visit to the superb city
24338: had been only cursory, and left him much to learn beyond the prescribed
24339: round of sight-seeing, by spending the cooler hours in observant
24340: wandering about the streets, the quay, and the environs; and he often
24341: took a boat that he might enjoy the magnificent view of the city and
24342: harbor from the sea. All sights, all subjects, even the expected
24343: meeting with his mother, found a central union in Mordecai and Mirah,
24344: and the ideas immediately associated with them; and among the thoughts
24345: that most filled his mind while his boat was pushing about within view
24346: of the grand harbor was that of the multitudinous Spanish Jews
24347: centuries ago driven destitute from their Spanish homes, suffered to
24348: land from the crowded ships only for a brief rest on this grand quay of
24349: Genoa, overspreading it with a pall of famine and plague—dying mothers
24350: and dying children at their breasts—fathers and sons a-gaze at each
24351: other’s haggardness, like groups from a hundred Hunger-towers turned
24352: out beneath the midday sun. Inevitably dreamy constructions of a
24353: possible ancestry for himself would weave themselves with historic
24354: memories which had begun to have a new interest for him on his
24355: discovery of Mirah, and now, under the influence of Mordecai, had
24356: become irresistibly dominant. He would have sealed his mind against
24357: such constructions if it had been possible, and he had never yet fully
24358: admitted to himself that he wished the facts to verify Mordecai’s
24359: conviction: he inwardly repeated that he had no choice in the matter,
24360: and that wishing was folly—nay, on the question of parentage, wishing
24361: seemed part of that meanness which disowns kinship: it was a disowning
24362: by anticipation. What he had to do was simply to accept the fact; and
24363: he had really no strong presumption to go upon, now that he was assured
24364: of his mistake about Sir Hugo. There had been a resolved concealment
24365: which made all inference untrustworthy, and the very name he bore might
24366: be a false one. If Mordecai was wrong—if he, the so-called Daniel
24367: Deronda, were held by ties entirely aloof from any such course as his
24368: friend’s pathetic hope had marked out?—he would not say “I wish”; but
24369: he could not help feeling on which side the sacrifice lay.
24370: 
24371: Across these two importunate thoughts, which he resisted as much as one
24372: can resist anything in that unstrung condition which belongs to
24373: suspense, there came continually an anxiety which he made no effort to
24374: banish—dwelling on it rather with a mournfulness, which often seems to
24375: us the best atonement we can make to one whose need we have been unable
24376: to meet. The anxiety was for Gwendolen. In the wonderful mixtures of
24377: our nature there is a feeling distinct from that exclusive passionate
24378: love of which some men and women (by no means all) are capable, which
24379: yet is not the same with friendship, nor with a merely benevolent
24380: regard, whether admiring or compassionate: a man, say—for it is a man
24381: who is here concerned—hardly represents to himself this shade of
24382: feeling toward a woman more nearly than in words, “I should have loved
24383: her, if——”: the “if” covering some prior growth in the inclinations,
24384: or else some circumstances which have made an inward prohibitory law as
24385: a stay against the emotions ready to quiver out of balance. The “if” in
24386: Deronda’s case carried reasons of both kinds; yet he had never
24387: throughout his relations with Gwendolen been free from the nervous
24388: consciousness that there was something to guard against not only on her
24389: account but on his own—some precipitancy in the manifestations of
24390: impulsive feeling—some ruinous inroad of what is but momentary on the
24391: permanent chosen treasure of the heart—some spoiling of her trust,
24392: which wrought upon him now as if it had been the retreating cry of a
24393: creature snatched and carried out of his reach by swift horsemen or
24394: swifter waves, while his own strength was only a stronger sense of
24395: weakness. How could his feelings for Gwendolen ever be exactly like his
24396: feelings for other women, even when there was one by whose side he
24397: desired to stand apart from them? Strangely the figure entered into the
24398: pictures of his present and future; strangely (and now it seemed sadly)
24399: their two lots had come in contact, hers narrowly personal, his charged
24400: with far-reaching sensibilities, perhaps with durable purposes, which
24401: were hardly more present to her than the reasons why men migrate are
24402: present to the birds that come as usual for the crumbs and find them no
24403: more. Not that Deronda was too ready to imagine himself of supreme
24404: importance to a woman; but her words of insistence that he must “remain
24405: near her—must not forsake her”—continually recurred to him with the
24406: clearness and importunity of imagined sounds, such as Dante has said
24407: pierce us like arrows whose points carry the sharpness of pity,
24408: 
24409:   “Lamenti saettaron me diversi
24410:   Che di pietà ferrati avean gli strali”.
24411: 
24412: Day after day passed, and the very air of Italy seemed to carry the
24413: consciousness that war had been declared against Austria, and every day
24414: was a hurrying march of crowded Time toward the world-changing battle
24415: of Sadowa. Meanwhile, in Genoa, the noons were getting hotter, the
24416: converging outer roads getting deeper with white dust, the oleanders in
24417: the tubs along the wayside gardens looking more and more like fatigued
24418: holiday-makers, and the sweet evening changing her office—scattering
24419: abroad those whom the midday had sent under shelter, and sowing all
24420: paths with happy social sounds, little tinklings of mule-bells and
24421: whirrings of thrumbed strings, light footsteps and voices, if not
24422: leisurely, then with the hurry of pleasure in them; while the
24423: encircling heights, crowned with forts, skirted with fine dwellings and
24424: gardens, seemed also to come forth and gaze in fullness of beauty after
24425: their long siesta, till all strong color melted in the stream of
24426: moonlight which made the Streets a new spectacle with shadows, both
24427: still and moving, on cathedral steps and against the façades of massive
24428: palaces; and then slowly with the descending moon all sank in deep
24429: night and silence, and nothing shone but the port lights of the great
24430: Lanterna in the blackness below, and the glimmering stars in the
24431: blackness above. Deronda, in his suspense, watched this revolving of
24432: the days as he might have watched a wonderful clock where the striking
24433: of the hours was made solemn with antique figures advancing and
24434: retreating in monitory procession, while he still kept his ear open for
24435: another kind of signal which would have its solemnity too: He was
24436: beginning to sicken of occupation, and found himself contemplating all
24437: activity with the aloofness of a prisoner awaiting ransom. In his
24438: letters to Mordecai and Hans, he had avoided writing about himself, but
24439: he was really getting into that state of mind to which all subjects
24440: become personal; and the few books he had brought to make him a refuge
24441: in study were becoming unreadable, because the point of view that life
24442: would make for him was in that agitating moment of uncertainty which is
24443: close upon decision.
24444: 
24445: Many nights were watched through by him in gazing from the open window
24446: of his room on the double, faintly pierced darkness of the sea and the
24447: heavens; often in struggling under the oppressive skepticism which
24448: represented his particular lot, with all the importance he was allowing
24449: Mordecai to give it, as of no more lasting effect than a dream—a set
24450: of changes which made passion to him, but beyond his consciousness were
24451: no more than an imperceptible difference of mass and shadow; sometimes
24452: with a reaction of emotive force which gave even to sustained
24453: disappointment, even to the fulfilled demand of sacrifice, the nature
24454: of a satisfied energy, and spread over his young future, whatever it
24455: might be, the attraction of devoted service; sometimes with a sweet
24456: irresistible hopefulness that the very best of human possibilities
24457: might befall him—the blending of a complete personal love in one
24458: current with a larger duty; and sometimes again in a mood of rebellion
24459: (what human creature escapes it?) against things in general because
24460: they are thus and not otherwise, a mood in which Gwendolen and her
24461: equivocal fate moved as busy images of what was amiss in the world
24462: along with the concealments which he had felt as a hardship in his own
24463: life, and which were acting in him now under the form of an afflicting
24464: doubtfulness about the mother who had announced herself coldly and
24465: still kept away.
24466: 
24467: But at last she was come. One morning in his third week of waiting
24468: there was a new kind of knock at the door. A servant in Chasseurs
24469: livery entered and delivered in French the verbal message that, the
24470: Princess Halm-Eberstein had arrived, that she was going to rest during
24471: the day, but would be obliged if Monsieur would dine early, so as to be
24472: at liberty at seven, when she would be able to receive him.
24473: 
24474: 
24475: 
24476: 
24477: CHAPTER LI.
24478: 
24479:     She held the spindle as she sat,
24480:     Errina with the thick-coiled mat
24481:     Of raven hair and deepest agate eyes,
24482:     Gazing with a sad surprise
24483:     At surging visions of her destiny—
24484:     To spin the byssus drearily
24485:     In insect-labor, while the throng
24486:   Of gods and men wrought deeds that poets wrought in song.
24487: 
24488: 
24489: When Deronda presented himself at the door of his mother’s apartment in
24490: the _Italia_ he felt some revival of his boyhood with its premature
24491: agitations. The two servants in the antechamber looked at him markedly,
24492: a little surprised that the doctor their lady had come to consult was
24493: this striking young gentleman whose appearance gave even the severe
24494: lines of an evening dress the credit of adornment. But Deronda could
24495: notice nothing until, the second door being opened, he found himself in
24496: the presence of a figure which at the other end of the large room stood
24497: awaiting his approach.
24498: 
24499: She was covered, except as to her face and part of her arms, with black
24500: lace hanging loosely from the summit of her whitening hair to the long
24501: train stretching from her tall figure. Her arms, naked to the elbow,
24502: except for some rich bracelets, were folded before her, and the fine
24503: poise of her head made it look handsomer than it really was. But
24504: Deronda felt no interval of observation before he was close in front of
24505: her, holding the hand she had put out and then raising it to his lips.
24506: She still kept her hand in his and looked at him examiningly; while his
24507: chief consciousness was that her eyes were piercing and her face so
24508: mobile that the next moment she might look like a different person. For
24509: even while she was examining him there was a play of the brow and
24510: nostril which made a tacit language. Deronda dared no movement, not
24511: able to conceive what sort of manifestation her feeling demanded; but
24512: he felt himself changing color like a girl, and yet wondering at his
24513: own lack of emotion; he had lived through so many ideal meetings with
24514: his mother, and they had seemed more real than this! He could not even
24515: conjecture in what language she would speak to him. He imagined it
24516: would not be English. Suddenly, she let fall his hand, and placed both
24517: hers on his shoulders, while her face gave out a flash of admiration in
24518: which every worn line disappeared and seemed to leave a restored youth.
24519: 
24520: “You are a beautiful creature!” she said, in a low melodious voice,
24521: with syllables which had what might be called a foreign but agreeable
24522: outline. “I knew you would be.” Then she kissed him on each cheek, and
24523: he returned the kisses. But it was something like a greeting between
24524: royalties.
24525: 
24526: She paused a moment while the lines were coming back into her face, and
24527: then said in a colder tone, “I am your mother. But you can have no love
24528: for me.”
24529: 
24530: “I have thought of you more than of any other being in the world,” said
24531: Deronda, his voice trembling nervously.
24532: 
24533: “I am not like what you thought I was,” said the mother decisively,
24534: withdrawing her hands from his shoulders, and folding her arms as
24535: before, looking at him as if she invited him to observe her. He had
24536: often pictured her face in his imagination as one which had a likeness
24537: to his own: he saw some of the likeness now, but amidst more striking
24538: differences. She was a remarkable looking being. What was it that gave
24539: her son a painful sense of aloofness?—Her worn beauty had a
24540: strangeness in it as if she were not quite a human mother, but a
24541: Melusina, who had ties with some world which is independent of ours.
24542: 
24543: “I used to think that you might be suffering,” said Deronda, anxious
24544: above all not to wound her. “I used to wish that I could be a comfort
24545: to you.”
24546: 
24547: “I _am_ suffering. But with a suffering that you can’t comfort,” said
24548: the Princess, in a harder voice than before, moving to a sofa where
24549: cushions had been carefully arranged for her. “Sit down.” She pointed
24550: to a seat near her; and then discerning some distress in Deronda’s
24551: face, she added, more gently, “I am not suffering at this moment. I am
24552: at ease now. I am able to talk.”
24553: 
24554: Deronda seated himself and waited for her to speak again. It seemed as
24555: if he were in the presence of a mysterious Fate rather than of the
24556: longed-for mother. He was beginning to watch her with wonder, from the
24557: spiritual distance to which she had thrown him.
24558: 
24559: “No,” she began: “I did not send for you to comfort me. I could not
24560: know beforehand—I don’t know now—what you will feel toward me. I have
24561: not the foolish notion that you can love me merely because I am your
24562: mother, when you have never seen or heard of me in all your life. But I
24563: thought I chose something better for you than being with me. I did not
24564: think I deprived you of anything worth having.”
24565: 
24566: “You cannot wish me to believe that your affection would not have been
24567: worth having,” said Deronda, finding that she paused as if she expected
24568: him to make some answer.
24569: 
24570: “I don’t mean to speak ill of myself,” said the princess, with proud
24571: impetuosity, “But I had not much affection to give you. I did not want
24572: affection. I had been stifled with it. I wanted to live out the life
24573: that was in me, and not to be hampered with other lives. You wonder
24574: what I was. I was no princess then.” She rose with a sudden movement,
24575: and stood as she had done before. Deronda immediately rose too; he felt
24576: breathless.
24577: 
24578: “No princess in this tame life that I live in now. I was a great
24579: singer, and I acted as well as I sang. All the rest were poor beside
24580: me. Men followed me from one country to another. I was living a myriad
24581: lives in one. I did not want a child.”
24582: 
24583: There was a passionate self-defence in her tone. She had cast all
24584: precedent out of her mind. Precedent had no excuse for her and she
24585: could only seek a justification in the intensest words she could find
24586: for her experience. She seemed to fling out the last words against some
24587: possible reproach in the mind of her son, who had to stand and hear
24588: them—clutching his coat-collar as if he were keeping himself above
24589: water by it, and feeling his blood in the sort of commotion that might
24590: have been excited if he had seen her going through some strange rite of
24591: a religion which gave a sacredness to crime. What else had she to tell
24592: him? She went on with the same intensity and a sort of pale
24593: illumination in her face.
24594: 
24595: “I did not want to marry. I was forced into marrying your
24596: father—forced, I mean, by my father’s wishes and commands; and
24597: besides, it was my best way of getting some freedom. I could rule my
24598: husband, but not my father. I had a right to be free. I had a right to
24599: seek my freedom from a bondage that I hated.”
24600: 
24601: She seated herself again, while there was that subtle movement in her
24602: eyes and closed lips which is like the suppressed continuation of
24603: speech. Deronda continued standing, and after a moment or two she
24604: looked up at him with a less defiant pleading as she said,
24605: 
24606: “And the bondage I hated for myself I wanted to keep you from. What
24607: better could the most loving mother have done? I relieved you from the
24608: bondage of having been born a Jew.”
24609: 
24610: “Then I _am_ a Jew?” Deronda burst out with a deep-voiced energy that
24611: made his mother shrink a little backward against her cushions. “My
24612: father was a Jew, and you are a Jewess?”
24613: 
24614: “Yes, your father was my cousin,” said the mother, watching him with a
24615: change in her look, as if she saw something that she might have to be
24616: afraid of.
24617: 
24618: “I am glad of it,” said Deronda, impetuously, in the veiled voice of
24619: passion. He could not have imagined beforehand how he would have come
24620: to say that which he had never hitherto admitted. He could not have
24621: dreamed that it would be in impulsive opposition to his mother. He was
24622: shaken by a mixed anger which no reflection could come soon enough to
24623: check, against this mother who it seemed had borne him unwillingly, had
24624: willingly made herself a stranger to him, and—perhaps—was now making
24625: herself known unwillingly. This last suspicion seemed to flash some
24626: explanation over her speech.
24627: 
24628: But the mother was equally shaken by an anger differently mixed, and
24629: her frame was less equal to any repression. The shaking with her was
24630: visibly physical, and her eyes looked the larger for her pallid
24631: excitement as she said violently,
24632: 
24633: “Why do you say you are glad? You are an English gentleman. I secured
24634: you that.”
24635: 
24636: “You did not know what you secured me. How could you choose my
24637: birthright for me?” said Deronda, throwing himself sideways into his
24638: chair again, almost unconsciously, and leaning his arm over the back,
24639: while he looked away from his mother.
24640: 
24641: He was fired with an intolerance that seemed foreign to him. But he was
24642: now trying hard to master himself and keep silence. A horror had swept
24643: in upon his anger lest he should say something too hard in this moment
24644: which made an epoch never to be recalled. There was a pause before his
24645: mother spoke again, and when she spoke her voice had become more firmly
24646: resistant in its finely varied tones:
24647: 
24648: “I chose for you what I would have chosen for myself. How could I know
24649: that you would have the spirit of my father in you? How could I know
24650: that you would love what I hated?—if you really love to be a Jew.” The
24651: last words had such bitterness in them that any one overhearing might
24652: have supposed some hatred had arisen between the mother and son.
24653: 
24654: But Deronda had recovered his fuller self. He was recalling his
24655: sensibilities to what life had been and actually was for her whose best
24656: years were gone, and who with the signs of suffering in her frame was
24657: now exerting herself to tell him of a past which was not his alone but
24658: also hers. His habitual shame at the acceptance of events as if they
24659: were his only, helped him even here. As he looked at his mother
24660: silently after her last words, his face regained some of its
24661: penetrative calm; yet it seemed to have a strangely agitating influence
24662: over her: her eyes were fixed on him with a sort of fascination, but
24663: not with any repose of maternal delight.
24664: 
24665: “Forgive me, if I speak hastily,” he said, with diffident gravity. “Why
24666: have you resolved now on disclosing to me what you took care to have me
24667: brought up in ignorance of? Why—since you seem angry that I should be
24668: glad?”
24669: 
24670: “Oh—the reasons of our actions!” said the Princess, with a ring of
24671: something like sarcastic scorn. “When you are as old as I am, it will
24672: not seem so simple a question—‘Why did you do this?’ People talk of
24673: their motives in a cut and dried way. Every woman is supposed to have
24674: the same set of motives, or else to be a monster. I am not a monster,
24675: but I have not felt exactly what other women feel—or say they feel,
24676: for fear of being thought unlike others. When you reproach me in your
24677: heart for sending you away from me, you mean that I ought to say I felt
24678: about you as other women say they feel about their children. I did
24679: _not_ feel that. I was glad to be freed from you. But I did well for
24680: you, and I gave you your father’s fortune. Do I seem now to be revoking
24681: everything?—Well, there are reasons. I feel many things that I cannot
24682: understand. A fatal illness has been growing in me for a year. I shall
24683: very likely not live another year. I will not deny anything I have
24684: done. I will not pretend to love where I have no love. But shadows are
24685: rising round me. Sickness makes them. If I have wronged the dead—I
24686: have but little time to do what I left undone.”
24687: 
24688: The varied transitions of tone with which this speech was delivered
24689: were as perfect as the most accomplished actress could have made them.
24690: The speech was in fact a piece of what may be called sincere acting;
24691: this woman’s nature was one in which all feeling—and all the more when
24692: it was tragic as well as real—immediately became matter of conscious
24693: representation: experience immediately passed into drama, and she acted
24694: her own emotions. In a minor degree this is nothing uncommon, but in
24695: the Princess the acting had a rare perfection of physiognomy, voice,
24696: and gesture. It would not be true to say that she felt less because of
24697: this double consciousness: she felt—that is, her mind went
24698: through—all the more, but with a difference; each nucleus of pain or
24699: pleasure had a deep atmosphere of the excitement or spiritual
24700: intoxication which at once exalts and deadens. But Deronda made no
24701: reflection of this kind. All his thoughts hung on the purport of what
24702: his mother was saying; her tones and her wonderful face entered into
24703: his agitation without being noted. What he longed for with an awed
24704: desire was to know as much as she would tell him of the strange mental
24705: conflict under which it seemed he had been brought into the world; what
24706: his compassionate nature made the controlling idea within him were the
24707: suffering and the confession that breathed through her later words, and
24708: these forbade any further question, when she paused and remained
24709: silent, with her brow knit, her head turned a little away from him, and
24710: her large eyes fixed as if on something incorporeal. He must wait for
24711: her to speak again. She did so with strange abruptness, turning her
24712: eyes upon him suddenly, and saying more quickly,
24713: 
24714: “Sir Hugo has written much about you. He tells me you have a wonderful
24715: mind—you comprehend everything—you are wiser than he is with all his
24716: sixty years. You say you are glad to know that you were born a Jew. I
24717: am not going to tell you that I have changed my mind about that. Your
24718: feelings are against mine. You don’t thank me for what I did. Shall you
24719: comprehend your mother, or only blame her?”
24720: 
24721: “There is not a fibre within me but makes me wish to comprehend her,”
24722: said Deronda, meeting her sharp gaze solemnly. “It is a bitter reversal
24723: of my longing to think of blaming her. What I have been most trying to
24724: do for fifteen years is to have some understanding of those who differ
24725: from myself.”
24726: 
24727: “Then you have become unlike your grandfather in that.” said the
24728: mother, “though you are a young copy of him in your face. He never
24729: comprehended me, or if he did, he only thought of fettering me into
24730: obedience. I was to be what he called ‘the Jewish woman’ under pain of
24731: his curse. I was to feel everything I did not feel, and believe
24732: everything I did not believe. I was to feel awe for the bit of
24733: parchment in the _mezuza_ over the door; to dread lest a bit of butter
24734: should touch a bit of meat; to think it beautiful that men should bind
24735: the _tephillin_ on them, and women not,—to adore the wisdom of such
24736: laws, however silly they might seem to me. I was to love the long
24737: prayers in the ugly synagogue, and the howling, and the gabbling, and
24738: the dreadful fasts, and the tiresome feasts, and my father’s endless
24739: discoursing about our people, which was a thunder without meaning in my
24740: ears. I was to care forever about what Israel had been; and I did not
24741: care at all. I cared for the wide world, and all that I could represent
24742: in it. I hated living under the shadow of my father’s strictness.
24743: Teaching, teaching for everlasting—‘this you must be,’ ‘that you must
24744: not be’—pressed on me like a frame that got tighter and tighter as I
24745: grew. I wanted to live a large life, with freedom to do what every one
24746: else did, and be carried along in a great current, not obliged to care.
24747: Ah!”—here her tone changed to one of a more bitter incisiveness—“you
24748: are glad to have been born a Jew. You say so. That is because you have
24749: not been brought up as a Jew. That separateness seems sweet to you
24750: because I saved you from it.”
24751: 
24752: “When you resolved on that, you meant that I should never know my
24753: origin?” said Deronda, impulsively. “You have at least changed in your
24754: feeling on that point.”
24755: 
24756: “Yes, that was what I meant. That is what I persevered in. And it is
24757: not true to say that I have changed. Things have changed in spite of
24758: me. I am still the same Leonora”—she pointed with her forefinger to
24759: her breast—“here within me is the same desire, the same will, the same
24760: choice, _but_”—she spread out her hands, palm upward, on each side of
24761: her, as she paused with a bitter compression of her lip, then let her
24762: voice fall into muffled, rapid utterance—“events come upon us like
24763: evil enchantments: and thoughts, feelings, apparitions in the darkness
24764: are events—are they not? I don’t consent. We only consent to what we
24765: love. I obey something tyrannic”—she spread out her hands again—“I am
24766: forced to be withered, to feel pain, to be dying slowly. Do I love
24767: that? Well, I have been forced to obey my dead father. I have been
24768: forced to tell you that you are a Jew, and deliver to you what he
24769: commanded me to deliver.”
24770: 
24771: “I beseech you to tell me what moved you—when you were young, I
24772: mean—to take the course you did,” said Deronda, trying by this
24773: reference to the past to escape from what to him was the heart-rending
24774: piteousness of this mingled suffering and defiance. “I gather that my
24775: grandfather opposed your bent to be an artist. Though my own experience
24776: has been quite different, I enter into the painfulness of your
24777: struggle. I can imagine the hardship of an enforced renunciation.”
24778: 
24779: “No,” said the Princess, shaking her head and folding her arms with an
24780: air of decision. “You are not a woman. You may try—but you can never
24781: imagine what it is to have a man’s force of genius in you, and yet to
24782: suffer the slavery of being a girl. To have a pattern cut out—‘this is
24783: the Jewish woman; this is what you must be; this is what you are wanted
24784: for; a woman’s heart must be of such a size and no larger, else it must
24785: be pressed small, like Chinese feet; her happiness is to be made as
24786: cakes are, by a fixed receipt.’ That was what my father wanted. He
24787: wished I had been a son; he cared for me as a make-shift link. His
24788: heart was set on his Judaism. He hated that Jewish women should be
24789: thought of by the Christian world as a sort of ware to make public
24790: singers and actresses of. As if we were not the more enviable for that!
24791: That is a chance of escaping from bondage.”
24792: 
24793: “Was my grandfather a learned man?” said Deronda, eager to know
24794: particulars that he feared his mother might not think of.
24795: 
24796: She answered impatiently, putting up her hand, “Oh, yes,—and a clever
24797: physician—and good: I don’t deny that he was good. A man to be admired
24798: in a play—grand, with an iron will. Like the old Foscari before he
24799: pardons. But such men turn their wives and daughters into slaves. They
24800: would rule the world if they could; but not ruling the world, they
24801: throw all the weight of their will on the necks and souls of women. But
24802: nature sometimes thwarts them. My father had no other child than his
24803: daughter, and she was like himself.”
24804: 
24805: She had folded her arms again, and looked as if she were ready to face
24806: some impending attempt at mastery.
24807: 
24808: “Your father was different. Unlike me—all lovingness and affection. I
24809: knew I could rule him; and I made him secretly promise me, before I
24810: married him, that he would put no hindrance in the way of my being an
24811: artist. My father was on his deathbed when we were married: from the
24812: first he had fixed his mind on my marrying my cousin Ephraim. And when
24813: a woman’s will is as strong as the man’s who wants to govern her, half
24814: her strength must be concealment. I meant to have my will in the end,
24815: but I could only have it by seeming to obey. I had an awe of my
24816: father—always I had had an awe of him: it was impossible to help it. I
24817: hated to feel awed—I wished I could have defied him openly; but I
24818: never could. It was what I could not imagine: I could not act it to
24819: myself that I should begin to defy my father openly and succeed. And I
24820: never would risk failure.”
24821: 
24822: This last sentence was uttered with an abrupt emphasis, and she paused
24823: after it as if the words had raised a crowd of remembrances which
24824: obstructed speech. Her son was listening to her with feelings more and
24825: more highly mixed; the first sense of being repelled by the frank
24826: coldness which had replaced all his preconceptions of a mother’s tender
24827: joy in the sight of him; the first impulses of indignation at what
24828: shocked his most cherished emotions and principles—all these busy
24829: elements of collision between them were subsiding for a time, and
24830: making more and more room for that effort at just allowance and that
24831: admiration of a forcible nature whose errors lay along high pathways,
24832: which he would have felt if, instead of being his mother, she had been
24833: a stranger who had appealed to his sympathy. Still it was impossible to
24834: be dispassionate: he trembled lest the next thing she had to say would
24835: be more repugnant to him than what had gone before: he was afraid of
24836: the strange coercion she seemed to be under to lay her mind bare: he
24837: almost wished he could say, “Tell me only what is necessary,” and then
24838: again he felt the fascination which made him watch her and listen to
24839: her eagerly. He tried to recall her to particulars by asking,
24840: 
24841: “Where was my grandfather’s home?”
24842: 
24843: “Here in Genoa, where I was married; and his family had lived here
24844: generations ago. But my father had been in various countries.”
24845: 
24846: “You must surely have lived in England?”
24847: 
24848: “My mother was English—a Jewess of Portuguese descent. My father
24849: married her in England. Certain circumstances of that marriage made all
24850: the difference in my life: through that marriage my father thwarted his
24851: own plans. My mother’s sister was a singer, and afterward she married
24852: the English partner of a merchant’s house here in Genoa, and they came
24853: and lived here eleven years. My mother died when I was eight years old,
24854: and my father allowed me to be continually with my Aunt Leonora and be
24855: taught under her eyes, as if he had not minded the danger of her
24856: encouraging my wish to be a singer, as she had been. But this was it—I
24857: saw it again and again in my father:—he did not guard against
24858: consequences, because he felt sure he could hinder them if he liked.
24859: Before my aunt left Genoa, I had had enough teaching to bring out the
24860: born singer and actress within me: my father did not know everything
24861: that was done; but he knew that I was taught music and singing—he knew
24862: my inclination. That was nothing to him: he meant that I should obey
24863: his will. And he was resolved that I should marry my cousin Ephraim,
24864: the only one left of my father’s family that he knew. I wanted not to
24865: marry. I thought of all plans to resist it, but at last I found that I
24866: could rule my cousin, and I consented. My father died three weeks after
24867: we were married, and then I had my way!” She uttered these words almost
24868: exultantly; but after a little pause her face changed, and she said in
24869: a biting tone, “It has not lasted, though. My father is getting his way
24870: now.”
24871: 
24872: She began to look more contemplatively again at her son, and presently
24873: said,
24874: 
24875: “You are like him—but milder—there is something of your own father in
24876: you; and he made it the labor of his life to devote himself to me:
24877: wound up his money-changing and banking, and lived to wait upon me—he
24878: went against his conscience for me. As I loved the life of my art, so
24879: he loved me. Let me look at your hand again: the hand with the ring on.
24880: It was your father’s ring.”
24881: 
24882: He drew his chair nearer to her and gave her his hand. We know what
24883: kind of a hand it was: her own, very much smaller, was of the same
24884: type. As he felt the smaller hand holding his, as he saw nearer to him
24885: the face that held the likeness of his own, aged not by time but by
24886: intensity, the strong bent of his nature toward a reverential
24887: tenderness asserted itself above every other impression and in his most
24888: fervent tone he said,
24889: 
24890: “Mother! take us all into your heart—the living and the dead. Forgive
24891: every thing that hurts you in the past. Take my affection.”
24892: 
24893: She looked at him admiringly rather than lovingly, then kissed him on
24894: the brow, and saying sadly, “I reject nothing, but I have nothing to
24895: give,” she released his hand and sank back on her cushions. Deronda
24896: turned pale with what seems always more of a sensation than an
24897: emotion—the pain of repulsed tenderness. She noticed the expression of
24898: pain, and said, still with melodious melancholy in her tones,
24899: 
24900: “It is better so. We must part again soon and you owe me no duties. I
24901: did not wish you to be born. I parted with you willingly. When your
24902: father died I resolved that I would have no more ties, but such as I
24903: could free myself from. I was the Alcharisi you have heard of: the name
24904: had magic wherever it was carried. Men courted me. Sir Hugo Mallinger
24905: was one who wished to marry me. He was madly in love with me. One day I
24906: asked him, ‘Is there a man capable of doing something for love of me,
24907: and expecting nothing in return?’ He said: ‘What is it you want done?’
24908: I said, ‘Take my boy and bring him up as an Englishman, and never let
24909: him know anything about his parents.’ You were little more than two
24910: years old, and were sitting on his foot. He declared that he would pay
24911: money to have such a boy. I had not meditated much on the plan
24912: beforehand, but as soon as I had spoken about it, it took possession of
24913: me as something I could not rest without doing. At first he thought I
24914: was not serious, but I convinced him, and he was never surprised at
24915: anything. He agreed that it would be for your good, and the finest
24916: thing for you. A great singer and actress is a queen, but she gives no
24917: royalty to her son. All that happened at Naples. And afterward I made
24918: Sir Hugo the trustee of your fortune. That is what I did; and I had a
24919: joy in doing it. My father had tyrannized over me—he cared more about
24920: a grandson to come than he did about me: I counted as nothing. You were
24921: to be such a Jew as he; you were to be what he wanted. But you were my
24922: son, and it was my turn to say what you should be. I said you should
24923: not know you were a Jew.”
24924: 
24925: “And for months events have been preparing me to be glad that I am a
24926: Jew,” said Deronda, his opposition roused again. The point touched the
24927: quick of his experience. “It would always have been better that I
24928: should have known the truth. I have always been rebelling against the
24929: secrecy that looked like shame. It is no shame to have Jewish
24930: parents—the shame is to disown it.”
24931: 
24932: “You say it was a shame to me, then, that I used that secrecy,” said
24933: his mother, with a flash of new anger. “There is no shame attaching to
24934: me. I have no reason to be ashamed. I rid myself of the Jewish tatters
24935: and gibberish that make people nudge each other at sight of us, as if
24936: we were tattooed under our clothes, though our faces are as whole as
24937: theirs. I delivered you from the pelting contempt that pursues Jewish
24938: separateness. I am not ashamed that I did it. It was the better for
24939: you.”
24940: 
24941: “Then why have you now undone the secrecy?—no, not undone it—the
24942: effects will never be undone. But why have you now sent for me to tell
24943: me that I am a Jew?” said Deronda, with an intensity of opposition in
24944: feeling that was almost bitter. It seemed as if her words had called
24945: out a latent obstinacy of race in him.
24946: 
24947: “Why?—ah, why?” said the Princess, rising quickly and walking to the
24948: other side of the room, where she turned round and slowly approached
24949: him, as he, too, stood up. Then she began to speak again in a more
24950: veiled voice. “I can’t explain; I can only say what is. I don’t love my
24951: father’s religion now any more than I did then. Before I married the
24952: second time I was baptized; I made myself like the people I lived
24953: among. I had a right to do it; I was not like a brute, obliged to go
24954: with my own herd. I have not repented; I will not say that I have
24955: repented. But yet”—here she had come near to her son, and paused; then
24956: again retreated a little and stood still, as if resolute not to give
24957: way utterly to an imperious influence; but, as she went on speaking,
24958: she became more and more unconscious of anything but the awe that
24959: subdued her voice. “It is illness, I don’t doubt that it has been
24960: gathering illness—my mind has gone back: more than a year ago it
24961: began. You see my gray hair, my worn look: it has all come fast.
24962: Sometimes I am in an agony of pain—I dare say I shall be to-night.
24963: Then it is as if all the life I have chosen to live, all thoughts, all
24964: will, forsook me and left me alone in spots of memory, and I can’t get
24965: away: my pain seems to keep me there. My childhood—my girlhood—the
24966: day of my marriage—the day of my father’s death—there seems to be
24967: nothing since. Then a great horror comes over me: what do I know of
24968: life or death? and what my father called ‘right’ may be a power that is
24969: laying hold of me—that is clutching me now. Well, I will satisfy him.
24970: I cannot go into the darkness without satisfying him. I have hidden
24971: what was his. I thought once I would burn it. I have not burned it. I
24972: thank God I have not burned it!”
24973: 
24974: She threw herself on her cushions again, visibly fatigued. Deronda,
24975: moved too strongly by her suffering for other impulses to act within
24976: him, drew near her, and said, entreatingly,
24977: 
24978: “Will you not spare yourself this evening? Let us leave the rest till
24979: to-morrow.”
24980: 
24981: “No,” she said decisively. “I will confess it all, now that I have come
24982: up to it. Often when I am at ease it all fades away; my whole self
24983: comes quite back; but I know it will sink away again, and the other
24984: will come—the poor, solitary, forsaken remains of self, that can
24985: resist nothing. It was my nature to resist, and say, ‘I have a right to
24986: resist.’ Well, I say so still when I have any strength in me. You have
24987: heard me say it, and I don’t withdraw it. But when my strength goes,
24988: some other right forces itself upon me like iron in an inexorable hand;
24989: and even when I am at ease, it is beginning to make ghosts upon the
24990: daylight. And now you have made it worse for me,” she said, with a
24991: sudden return of impetuosity; “but I shall have told you everything.
24992: And what reproach is there against me,” she added bitterly, “since I
24993: have made you glad to be a Jew? Joseph Kalonymos reproached me: he said
24994: you had been turned into a proud Englishman, who resented being touched
24995: by a Jew. I wish you had!” she ended, with a new marvelous alternation.
24996: It was as if her mind were breaking into several, one jarring the other
24997: into impulsive action.
24998: 
24999: “Who is Joseph Kalonymos?” said Deronda, with a darting recollection of
25000: that Jew who touched his arm in the Frankfort synagogue.
25001: 
25002: “Ah! some vengeance sent him back from the East, that he might see you
25003: and come to reproach me. He was my father’s friend. He knew of your
25004: birth: he knew of my husband’s death, and once, twenty years ago, after
25005: he had been away in the Levant, he came to see me and inquire about
25006: you. I told him that you were dead: I meant you to be dead to all the
25007: world of my childhood. If I had said that you were living, he would
25008: have interfered with my plans: he would have taken on him to represent
25009: my father, and have tried to make me recall what I had done. What could
25010: I do but say you were dead? The act was done. If I had told him of it
25011: there would have been trouble and scandal—and all to conquer me, who
25012: would not have been conquered. I was strong then, and I would have had
25013: my will, though there might have been a hard fight against me. I took
25014: the way to have it without any fight. I felt then that I was not really
25015: deceiving: it would have come to the same in the end; or if not to the
25016: same, to something worse. He believed me and begged that I would give
25017: up to him the chest that my father had charged me and my husband to
25018: deliver to our eldest son. I knew what was in the chest—things that
25019: had been dinned in my ears since I had had any understanding—things
25020: that were thrust on my mind that I might feel them like a wall around
25021: my life—my life that was growing like a tree. Once, after my husband
25022: died, I was going to burn the chest. But it was difficult to burn; and
25023: burning a chest and papers looks like a shameful act. I have committed
25024: no shameful act—except what Jews would call shameful. I had kept the
25025: chest, and I gave it to Joseph Kalonymos. He went away mournful, and
25026: said, ‘If you marry again, and if another grandson is born to him who
25027: is departed, I will deliver up the chest to him.’ I bowed in silence. I
25028: meant not to marry again—no more than I meant to be the shattered
25029: woman that I am now.”
25030: 
25031: She ceased speaking, and her head sank back while she looked vaguely
25032: before her. Her thought was traveling through the years, and when she
25033: began to speak again her voice had lost its argumentative spirit, and
25034: had fallen into a veiled tone of distress.
25035: 
25036: “But months ago this Kalonymos saw you in the synagogue at Frankfort.
25037: He saw you enter the hotel, and he went to ask your name. There was
25038: nobody else in the world to whom the name would have told anything
25039: about me.”
25040: 
25041: “Then it is not my real name?” said Deronda, with a dislike even to
25042: this trifling part of the disguise which had been thrown round him.
25043: 
25044: “Oh, as real as another,” said his mother, indifferently. “The Jews
25045: have always been changing their names. My father’s family had kept the
25046: name of Charisi: my husband was a Charisi. When I came out as a singer,
25047: we made it Alcharisi. But there had been a branch of the family my
25048: father had lost sight of who called themselves Deronda, and when I
25049: wanted a name for you, and Sir Hugo said, ‘Let it be a foreign name,’ I
25050: thought of Deronda. But Joseph Kalonymos had heard my father speak of
25051: the Deronda branch, and the name confirmed his suspicion. He began to
25052: suspect what had been done. It was as if everything had been whispered
25053: to him in the air. He found out where I was. He took a journey into
25054: Russia to see me; he found me weak and shattered. He had come back
25055: again, with his white hair, and with rage in his soul against me. He
25056: said I was going down to the grave clad in falsehood and
25057: robbery—falsehood to my father and robbery of my own child. He accused
25058: me of having kept the knowledge of your birth from you, and having
25059: brought you up as if you had been the son of an English gentleman.
25060: Well, it was true; and twenty years before I would have maintained that
25061: I had a right to do it. But I can maintain nothing now. No faith is
25062: strong within me. My father may have God on his side. This man’s words
25063: were like lion’s teeth upon me. My father’s threats eat into me with my
25064: pain. If I tell everything—if I deliver up everything—what else can
25065: be demanded of me? I cannot make myself love the people I have never
25066: loved—is it not enough that I lost the life I did love?”
25067: 
25068: She had leaned forward a little in her low-toned pleading, that seemed
25069: like a smothered cry: her arms and hands were stretched out at full
25070: length, as if strained in beseeching, Deronda’s soul was absorbed in
25071: the anguish of compassion. He could not mind now that he had been
25072: repulsed before. His pity made a flood of forgiveness within him. His
25073: single impulse was to kneel by her and take her hand gently, between
25074: his palms, while he said in that exquisite voice of soothing which
25075: expresses oneness with the sufferer,
25076: 
25077: “Mother, take comfort!”
25078: 
25079: She did not seem inclined to repulse him now, but looked down at him
25080: and let him take both her hands to fold between his. Gradually tears
25081: gathered, but she pressed her handkerchief against her eyes and then
25082: leaned her cheek against his brow, as if she wished that they should
25083: not look at each other.
25084: 
25085: “Is it not possible that I could be near you often and comfort you?”
25086: said Deronda. He was under that stress of pity that propels us on
25087: sacrifices.
25088: 
25089: “No, not possible,” she answered, lifting up her head again and
25090: withdrawing her hand as if she wished him to move away. “I have a
25091: husband and five children. None of them know of your existence.”
25092: 
25093: Deronda felt painfully silenced. He rose and stood at a little distance.
25094: 
25095: “You wonder why I married,” she went on presently, under the influence
25096: of a newly-recurring thought. “I meant never to marry again. I meant to
25097: be free and to live for my art. I had parted with you. I had no bonds.
25098: For nine years I was a queen. I enjoyed the life I had longed for. But
25099: something befell me. It was like a fit of forgetfulness. I began to
25100: sing out of tune. They told me of it. Another woman was thrusting
25101: herself in my place. I could not endure the prospect of failure and
25102: decline. It was horrible to me.” She started up again, with a shudder,
25103: and lifted screening hands like one who dreads missiles. “It drove me
25104: to marry. I made believe that I preferred being the wife of a Russian
25105: noble to being the greatest lyric actress of Europe; I made believe—I
25106: acted that part. It was because I felt my greatness sinking away from
25107: me, as I feel my life sinking now. I would not wait till men said, ‘She
25108: had better go.’”
25109: 
25110: She sank into her seat again, and looked at the evening sky as she went
25111: on: “I repented. It was a resolve taken in desperation. That singing
25112: out of tune was only like a fit of illness; it went away. I repented;
25113: but it was too late. I could not go back. All things hindered, me—all
25114: things.”
25115: 
25116: A new haggardness had come in her face, but her son refrained from
25117: again urging her to leave further speech till the morrow: there was
25118: evidently some mental relief for her in an outpouring such as she could
25119: never have allowed herself before. He stood still while she maintained
25120: silence longer than she knew, and the light was perceptibly fading. At
25121: last she turned to him and said,
25122: 
25123: “I can bear no more now.” She put out her hand, but then quickly
25124: withdrew it saying, “Stay. How do I know that I can see you again? I
25125: cannot bear to be seen when I am in pain.”
25126: 
25127: She drew forth a pocket-book, and taking out a letter said, “This is
25128: addressed to the banking-house in Mainz, where you are to go for your
25129: grandfather’s chest. It is a letter written by Joseph Kalonymos: if he
25130: is not there himself, this order of his will be obeyed.”
25131: 
25132: When Deronda had taken the letter, she said, with effort but more
25133: gently than before, “Kneel again, and let me kiss you.”
25134: 
25135: He obeyed, and holding his head between her hands, she kissed him
25136: solemnly on the brow. “You see, I had no life left to love you with,”
25137: she said, in a low murmur. “But there is more fortune for you. Sir Hugo
25138: was to keep it in reserve. I gave you all your father’s fortune. They
25139: can never accuse me of robbery there.”
25140: 
25141: “If you had needed anything I would have worked for you,” said Deronda,
25142: conscious of disappointed yearning—a shutting out forever from long
25143: early vistas of affectionate imagination.
25144: 
25145: “I need nothing that the skill of man can give me,” said his mother,
25146: still holding his head, and perusing his features. “But perhaps now I
25147: have satisfied my father’s will, your face will come instead of
25148: his—your young, loving face.”
25149: 
25150: “But you will see me again?” said Deronda, anxiously.
25151: 
25152: “Yes—perhaps. Wait, wait. Leave me now.”
25153:

25157: CHAPTER LII.
25158: 
25159:     “La même fermeté qui sert à résister à l’amour sert aussi à le rendre
25160:     violent et durable; et les personnes faibles qui sont toujours
25161:     agitées des passions n’en sont presque jamais véritablement remplies.”
25162:     —LA ROCHEFOUCAULD.
25163: 
25164: 
25165: Among Deronda’s letters the next morning was one from Hans Meyrick of
25166: four quarto pages, in the small, beautiful handwriting which ran in the
25167: Meyrick family.
25168: 
25169:     MY DEAR DERONDA,—In return for your sketch of Italian movements and
25170:     your view of the world’s affairs generally, I may say that here at
25171:     home the most judicious opinion going as to the effects of present
25172:     causes is that “time will show.” As to the present causes of past
25173:     effects, it is now seen that the late swindling telegrams account for
25174:     the last year’s cattle plague—which is a refutation of philosophy
25175:     falsely so called, and justifies the compensation to the farmers. My
25176:     own idea that a murrain will shortly break out in the commercial
25177:     class, and that the cause will subsequently disclose itself in the
25178:     ready sale of all rejected pictures, has been called an unsound use of
25179:     analogy; but there are minds that will not hesitate to rob even the
25180:     neglected painter of his solace. To my feeling there is great beauty
25181:     in the conception that some bad judge might give a high price for my
25182:     Berenice series, and that the men in the city would have already been
25183:     punished for my ill-merited luck.
25184: 
25185:     Meanwhile I am consoling myself for your absence by finding my
25186:     advantage in it—shining like Hesperus when Hyperion has departed;
25187:     sitting with our Hebrew prophet, and making a study of his head, in
25188:     the hours when he used to be occupied with you—getting credit with
25189:     him as a learned young Gentile, who would have been a Jew if he could
25190:     —and agreeing with him in the general principle, that whatever is
25191:     best is for that reason Jewish. I never held it my _forte_ to be
25192:     a severe reasoner, but I can see that if whatever is best is A, and B
25193:     happens to be best, B must be A, however little you might have
25194:     expected it beforehand. On that principle I could see the force of a
25195:     pamphlet I once read to prove that all good art was Protestant.
25196:     However, our prophet is an uncommonly interesting sitter—a better
25197:     model than Rembrandt had for his Rabbi—and I never come away from him
25198:     without a new discovery. For one thing, it is a constant wonder to me
25199:     that, with all his fiery feeling for his race and their traditions, he
25200:     is no straight-laced Jew, spitting after the word Christian, and
25201:     enjoying the prospect that the Gentile mouth will water in vain for a
25202:     slice of the roasted Leviathan, while Israel will be sending up plates
25203:     for more, _ad libitum_, (You perceive that my studies had taught
25204:     me what to expect from the orthodox Jew.) I confess that I have always
25205:     held lightly by your account of Mordecai, as apologetic, and merely
25206:     part of your disposition to make an antediluvian point of view lest
25207:     you should do injustice to the megatherium. But now I have given ear
25208:     to him in his proper person, I find him really a sort of
25209:     philosophical-allegorical-mystical believer, and yet with a sharp
25210:     dialectic point, so that any argumentative rattler of peas in a
25211:     bladder might soon be pricked in silence by him. The mixture may be
25212:     one of the Jewish prerogatives, for what I know. In fact, his mind
25213:     seems so broad that I find my own correct opinions lying in it quite
25214:     commodiously, and how they are to be brought into agreement with the
25215:     vast remainder is his affair, not mine. I leave it to him to settle
25216:     our basis, never yet having seen a basis which is not a
25217:     world-supporting elephant, more or less powerful and expensive to keep.
25218:     My means will not allow me to keep a private elephant. I go into mystery
25219:     instead, as cheaper and more lasting—a sort of gas which is likely to
25220:     be continually supplied by the decomposition of the elephants. And if
25221:     I like the look of an opinion, I treat it civilly, without suspicious
25222:     inquiries. I have quite a friendly feeling toward Mordecai’s notion
25223:     that a whole Christian is three-fourths a Jew, and that from the
25224:     Alexandrian time downward the most comprehensive minds have been
25225:     Jewish; for I think of pointing out to Mirah that, Arabic and other
25226:     incidents of life apart, there is really little difference between me
25227:     and—Maimonides. But I have lately been finding out that it is your
25228:     shallow lover who can’t help making a declaration. If Mirah’s ways
25229:     were less distracting, and it were less of a heaven to be in her
25230:     presence and watch her, I must long ago have flung myself at her feet,
25231:     and requested her to tell me, with less indirectness, whether she
25232:     wished me to blow my brains out. I have a knack of hoping, which is as
25233:     good as an estate in reversion, if one can keep from the temptation of
25234:     turning it into certainty, which may spoil all. My Hope wanders among
25235:     the orchard blossoms, feels the warm snow falling on it through the
25236:     sunshine, and is in doubt of nothing; but, catching sight of Certainty
25237:     in the distance, sees an ugly Janus-faced deity, with a dubious wink
25238:     on the hither side of him, and turns quickly away. But you, with your
25239:     supreme reasonableness, and self-nullification, and preparation for
25240:     the worst—you know nothing about Hope, that immortal, delicious
25241:     maiden forever courted forever propitious, whom fools have called
25242:     deceitful, as if it were Hope that carried the cup of disappointment,
25243:     whereas it is her deadly enemy, Certainty, whom she only escapes by
25244:     transformation. (You observe my new vein of allegory?) Seriously,
25245:     however, I must be permitted to allege that truth will prevail, that
25246:     prejudice will melt before it, that diversity, accompanied by merit,
25247:     will make itself felt as fascination, and that no virtuous aspiration
25248:     will be frustrated—all which, if I mistake not, are doctrines of the
25249:     schools, and they imply that the Jewess I prefer will prefer me. Any
25250:     blockhead can cite generalities, but the mind-master discerns the
25251:     particular cases they represent.
25252: 
25253:     I am less convinced that my society makes amends to Mordecai for your
25254:     absence, but another substitute occasionally comes in the form of
25255:     Jacob Cohen. It is worth while to catch our prophet’s expression when
25256:     he has that remarkable type of young Israel on his knee, and pours
25257:     forth some Semitic inspiration with a sublime look of melancholy
25258:     patience and devoutness. Sometimes it occurs to Jacob that Hebrew will
25259:     be more edifying to him if he stops his ears with his palms, and
25260:     imitates the venerable sounds as heard through that muffled medium.
25261:     When Mordecai gently draws down the little fists and holds them fast,
25262:     Jacob’s features all take on an extraordinary activity, very much as
25263:     if he was walking through a menagerie and trying to imitate every
25264:     animal in turn, succeeding best with the owl and the peccary. But I
25265:     dare say you have seen something of this. He treats me with the
25266:     easiest familiarity, and seems in general to look at me as a second-hand
25267:     Christian commodity, likely to come down in price; remarking on
25268:     my disadvantages with a frankness which seems to imply some thoughts
25269:     of future purchase. It is pretty, though, to see the change in him if
25270:     Mirah happens to come in. He turns child suddenly—his age usually
25271:     strikes one as being like the Israelitish garments in the desert,
25272:     perhaps near forty, yet with an air of recent production. But, with
25273:     Mirah, he reminds me of the dogs that have been brought up by women,
25274:     and remain manageable by them only. Still, the dog is fond of Mordecai
25275:     too, and brings sugar-plums to share with him, filling his own mouth
25276:     to rather an embarrassing extent, and watching how Mordecai deals with
25277:     a smaller supply. Judging from this modern Jacob at the age of six, my
25278:     astonishment is that his race has not bought us all up long ago, and
25279:     pocketed our feebler generations in the form of stock and scrip, as so
25280:     much slave property. There is one Jewess I should not mind being slave
25281:     to. But I wish I did not imagine that Mirah gets a little sadder, and
25282:     tries all the while to hide it. It is natural enough, of course, while
25283:     she has to watch the slow death of this brother, whom she has taken to
25284:     worshipping with such looks of loving devoutness that I am ready to
25285:     wish myself in his place.
25286: 
25287:     For the rest, we are a little merrier than usual. Rex Gascoigne—you
25288:     remember a head you admired among my sketches, a fellow with a good
25289:     upper lip, reading law—has got some rooms in town now not far off us,
25290:     and has had a neat sister (upper lip also good) staying with him the
25291:     last fortnight. I have introduced them both to my mother and the
25292:     girls, who have found out from Miss Gascoigne that she is cousin to
25293:     your Vandyke duchess!!! I put the notes of exclamation to mark the
25294:     surprise that the information at first produced on my feeble
25295:     understanding. On reflection I discovered that there was not the least
25296:     ground for surprise, unless I had beforehand believed that nobody
25297:     could be anybody’s cousin without my knowing it. This sort of
25298:     surprise, I take it, depends on a liveliness of the spine, with a more
25299:     or less constant nullity of brain. There was a fellow I used to meet
25300:     at Rome who was in an effervescence of surprise at contact with the
25301:     simplest information. Tell him what you would—that you were fond of
25302:     easy boots—he would always say, “No! are you?” with the same energy
25303:     of wonder: the very fellow of whom pastoral Browne wrote
25304:     prophetically,
25305: 
25306:       “A wretch so empty that if e’er there be
25307:       In nature found the least vacuity
25308:       ’Twill be in him.”
25309: 
25310:     I have accounted for it all—he had a lively spine.
25311: 
25312:     However, this cousinship with the duchess came out by chance one day
25313:     that Mirah was with them at home and they were talking about the
25314:     Mallingers. _Apropos_; I am getting so important that I have
25315:     rival invitations. Gascoigne wants me to go down with him to his
25316:     father’s rectory in August and see the country round there. But I
25317:     think self-interest well understood will take me to Topping Abbey, for
25318:     Sir Hugo has invited me, and proposes—God bless him for his rashness!
25319:     —that I should make a picture of his three daughters sitting on a
25320:     bank—as he says, in the Gainsborough style. He came to my studio the
25321:     other day and recommended me to apply myself to portrait. Of course I
25322:     know what that means.—“My good fellow, your attempts at the historic
25323:     and poetic are simply pitiable. Your brush is just that of a
25324:     successful portrait-painter—it has a little truth and a great
25325:     facility in falsehood—your idealism will never do for gods and
25326:     goddesses and heroic story, but it may fetch a high price as flattery.
25327:     Fate, my friend, has made you the hinder wheel—_rota  posterior
25328:     curras, et in axe secundo_—run behind, because you can’t help it.”
25329:     —What great effort it evidently costs our friends to give us these
25330:     candid opinions! I have even known a man to take the trouble to call,
25331:     in order to tell me that I had irretrievably exposed my want of
25332:     judgment in treating my subject, and that if I had asked him we would
25333:     have lent me his own judgment. Such was my ingratitude and my
25334:     readiness at composition, that even while he was speaking I inwardly
25335:     sketched a Last Judgment with that candid friend’s physiognomy on the
25336:     left. But all this is away from Sir Hugo, whose manner of implying
25337:     that one’s gifts are not of the highest order is so exceedingly
25338:     good-natured and comfortable that I begin to feel it an advantage not
25339:     to be among those poor fellows at the tip-top. And his kindness to me
25340:     tastes all the better because it comes out of his love for you, old
25341:     boy. His chat is uncommonly amusing. By the way, he told me that your
25342:     Vandyke duchess is gone with her husband yachting to the Mediterranean.
25343:     I bethink me that it is possible to land from a yacht, or to be taken
25344:     on to a yacht from the land. Shall you by chance have an opportunity of
25345:     continuing your theological discussion with the fair Supralapsarian—I
25346:     think you said her tenets were of that complexion? Is Duke Alphonso
25347:     also theological?—perhaps an Arian who objects to triplicity. (Stage
25348:     direction. While D. is reading, a profound scorn gathers in his face
25349:     till at the last word he flings down the letter, grasps his coat-collar
25350:     in a statuesque attitude and so remains with a look generally
25351:     tremendous, throughout the following soliloquy, “O night, O blackness,
25352:     etc., etc.”)
25353: 
25354:     Excuse the brevity of this letter. You are not used to more from me
25355:     than a bare statement of facts, without comment or digression. One
25356:     fact I have omitted—that the Klesmers on the eve of departure have
25357:     behaved magnificently, shining forth as might be expected from the
25358:     planets of genius and fortune in conjunction. Mirah is rich with their
25359:     oriental gifts.
25360: 
25361:     What luck it will be if you come back and present yourself at the
25362:     Abbey while I am there! I am going to behave with consummate
25363:     discretion and win golden opinions, But I shall run up to town now and
25364:     then, just for a peep into Gad Eden. You see how far I have got in
25365:     Hebrew lore—up with my Lord Bolingbroke, who knew no Hebrew, but
25366:     “understood that sort of learning and what is writ about it.” If Mirah
25367:     commanded, I would go to a depth below the tri-literal roots. Already
25368:     it makes no difference to me whether the points are there or not. But
25369:     while her brother’s life lasts I suspect she would not listen to a
25370:     lover, even one whose “hair is like a flock of goats on Mount
25371:     Gilead”—and I flatter myself that few heads would bear that trying
25372:     comparison better than mine. So I stay with my hope among the
25373:     orchard-blossoms.—Your devoted,
25374: 
25375:                                        HANS MEYRICK.
25376: 
25377: Some months before, this letter from Hans would have divided Deronda’s
25378: thoughts irritatingly: its romancing, about Mirah would have had an
25379: unpleasant edge, scarcely anointed with any commiseration for his
25380: friend’s probable disappointment. But things had altered since March.
25381: Mirah was no longer so critically placed with regard to the Meyricks,
25382: and Deronda’s own position had been undergoing a change which had just
25383: been crowned by the revelation of his birth. The new opening toward the
25384: future, though he would not trust in any definite visions, inevitably
25385: shed new lights, and influenced his mood toward past and present;
25386: hence, what Hans called his hope now seemed to Deronda, not a
25387: mischievous unreasonableness which roused his indignation, but an
25388: unusually persistent bird-dance of an extravagant fancy, and he would
25389: have felt quite able to pity any consequent suffering of his friend’s,
25390: if he had believed in the suffering as probable. But some of the busy
25391: thought filling that long day, which passed without his receiving any
25392: new summons from his mother, was given to the argument that Hans
25393: Meyrick’s nature was not one in which love could strike the deep roots
25394: that turn disappointment into sorrow: it was too restless, too readily
25395: excitable by novelty, too ready to turn itself into imaginative
25396: material, and wear its grief as a fantastic costume. “Already he is
25397: beginning to play at love: he is taking the whole affair as a comedy,”
25398: said Deronda to himself; “he knows very well that there is no chance
25399: for him. Just like him—never opening his eyes on any possible
25400: objection I could have to receive his outpourings about Mirah. Poor old
25401: Hans! If we were under a fiery hail together he would howl like a
25402: Greek, and if I did not howl too it would never occur to him that I was
25403: as badly off as he. And yet he is tender-hearted and affectionate in
25404: intention, and I can’t say that he is not active in imagining what goes
25405: on in other people—but then he always imagines it to fit his own
25406: inclination.”
25407: 
25408: With this touch of causticity Deronda got rid of the slight heat at
25409: present raised by Hans’s naive expansiveness. The nonsense about
25410: Gwendolen, conveying the fact that she was gone yachting with her
25411: husband, only suggested a disturbing sequel to his own strange parting
25412: with her. But there was one sentence in the letter which raised a more
25413: immediate, active anxiety. Hans’s suspicion of a hidden sadness in
25414: Mirah was not in the direction of his wishes, and hence, instead of
25415: distrusting his observation here, Deronda began to conceive a cause for
25416: the sadness. Was it some event that had occurred during his absence, or
25417: only the growing fear of some event? Was it something, perhaps
25418: alterable, in the new position which had been made for her? Or—had
25419: Mordecai, against his habitual resolve, communicated to her those
25420: peculiar cherished hopes about him, Deronda, and had her quickly
25421: sensitive nature been hurt by the discovery that her brother’s will or
25422: tenacity of visionary conviction had acted coercively on their
25423: friendship—been hurt by the fear that there was more of pitying
25424: self-suppression than of equal regard in Deronda’s relation to him? For
25425: amidst all Mirah’s quiet renunciation, the evident thirst of soul with
25426: which she received the tribute of equality implied a corresponding pain
25427: if she found that what she had taken for a purely reverential regard
25428: toward her brother had its mixture of condescension.
25429: 
25430: In this last conjecture of Deronda’s he was not wrong as to the quality
25431: in Mirah’s nature on which he was founding—the latent protest against
25432: the treatment she had all her life being subject to until she met him.
25433: For that gratitude which would not let her pass by any notice of their
25434: acquaintance without insisting on the depth of her debt to him, took
25435: half its fervor from the keen comparison with what others had thought
25436: enough to render to her. Deronda’s affinity in feeling enabled him to
25437: penetrate such secrets. But he was not near the truth in admitting the
25438: idea that Mordecai had broken his characteristic reticence. To no soul
25439: but Deronda himself had he yet breathed the history of their relation
25440: to each other, or his confidence about his friend’s origin: it was not
25441: only that these subjects were for him too sacred to be spoken of
25442: without weighty reason, but that he had discerned Deronda’s shrinking
25443: at any mention of his birth; and the severity of reserve which had
25444: hindered Mordecai from answering a question on a private affair of the
25445: Cohen family told yet more strongly here.
25446: 
25447: “Ezra, how is it?” Mirah one day said to him—“I am continually going
25448: to speak to Mr. Deronda as if he were a Jew?”
25449: 
25450: He smiled at her quietly, and said, “I suppose it is because he treats
25451: us as if he were our brother. But he loves not to have the difference
25452: of birth dwelt upon.”
25453: 
25454: “He has never lived with his parents, Mr. Hans, says,” continued Mirah,
25455: to whom this was necessarily a question of interest about every one for
25456: whom she had a regard.
25457: 
25458: “Seek not to know such things from Mr. Hans,” said Mordecai, gravely,
25459: laying his hand on her curls, as he was wont. “What Daniel Deronda
25460: wishes us to know about himself is for him to tell us.”
25461: 
25462: And Mirah felt herself rebuked, as Deronda had done. But to be rebuked
25463: in this way by Mordecai made her rather proud.
25464: 
25465: “I see no one so great as my brother,” she said to Mrs. Meyrick one day
25466: that she called at the Chelsea house on her way home, and, according to
25467: her hope, found the little mother alone. “It is difficult to think that
25468: he belongs to the same world as those people I used to live amongst. I
25469: told you once that they made life seem like a madhouse; but when I am
25470: with Ezra he makes me feel that his life is a great good, though he has
25471: suffered so much; not like me, who wanted to die because I had suffered
25472: a little, and only for a little while. His soul is so full, it is
25473: impossible for him to wish for death as I did. I get the same sort of
25474: feeling from him that I got yesterday, when I was tired, and came home
25475: through the park after the sweet rain had fallen and the sunshine lay
25476: on the grass and flowers. Everything in the sky and under the sky
25477: looked so pure and beautiful that the weariness and trouble and folly
25478: seemed only a small part of what is, and I became more patient and
25479: hopeful.”
25480: 
25481: A dove-like note of melancholy in this speech caused Mrs. Meyrick to
25482: look at Mirah with new examination. After laying down her hat and
25483: pushing her curls flat, with an air of fatigue, she placed herself on a
25484: chair opposite her friend in her habitual attitude, her feet and hands
25485: just crossed; and at a distance she might have seemed a colored statue
25486: of serenity. But Mrs. Meyrick discerned a new look of suppressed
25487: suffering in her face, which corresponded to the hint that to be
25488: patient and hopeful required some extra influence.
25489: 
25490: “Is there any fresh trouble on your mind, my dear?” said Mrs. Meyrick,
25491: giving up her needlework as a sign of concentrated attention.
25492: 
25493: Mirah hesitated before she said, “I am too ready to speak of troubles,
25494: I think. It seems unkind to put anything painful into other people’s
25495: minds, unless one were sure it would hinder something worse. And
25496: perhaps I am too hasty and fearful.”
25497: 
25498: “Oh, my dear, mothers are made to like pain and trouble for the sake of
25499: their children. Is it because the singing lessons are so few, and are
25500: likely to fall off when the season comes to an end? Success in these
25501: things can’t come all at once.” Mrs. Meyrick did not believe that she
25502: was touching the real grief; but a guess that could be corrected would
25503: make an easier channel for confidence.
25504: 
25505: “No, not that,” said Mirah, shaking her head gently. “I have been a
25506: little disappointed because so many ladies said they wanted me to give
25507: them or their daughters lessons, and then I never heard of them again,
25508: But perhaps after the holidays I shall teach in some schools. Besides,
25509: you know, I am as rich as a princess now. I have not touched the
25510: hundred pounds that Mrs. Klesmer gave me; and I should never be afraid
25511: that Ezra would be in want of anything, because there is Mr. Deronda,
25512: and he said, ‘It is the chief honor of my life that your brother will
25513: share anything with me.’ Oh, no! Ezra and I can have no fears for each
25514: other about such things as food and clothing.”
25515: 
25516: “But there is some other fear on your mind,” said Mrs. Meyrick not
25517: without divination—“a fear of something that may disturb your peace.
25518: Don’t be forecasting evil, dear child, unless it is what you can guard
25519: against. Anxiety is good for nothing if we can’t turn it into a
25520: defense. But there’s no defense against all the things that might be.
25521: Have you any more reason for being anxious now than you had a month
25522: ago?”
25523: 
25524: “Yes, I have,” said Mirah. “I have kept it from Ezra. I have not dared
25525: to tell him. Pray forgive me that I can’t do without telling you. I
25526: _have_ more reason for being anxious. It is five days ago now. I am
25527: quite sure I saw my father.”
25528: 
25529: Mrs. Meyrick shrank into a smaller space, packing her arms across her
25530: chest and leaning forward—to hinder herself from pelting that father
25531: with her worst epithets.
25532: 
25533: “The year has changed him,” Mirah went on. “He had already been much
25534: altered and worn in the time before I left him. You remember I said how
25535: he used sometimes to cry. He was always excited one way or the other. I
25536: have told Ezra everything that I told you, and he says that my father
25537: had taken to gambling, which makes people easily distressed, and then
25538: again exalted. And now—it was only a moment that I saw him—his face
25539: was more haggard, and his clothes were shabby. He was with a much
25540: worse-looking man, who carried something, and they were hurrying along
25541: after an omnibus.”
25542: 
25543: “Well, child, he did not see you, I hope?”
25544: 
25545: “No. I had just come from Mrs. Raymond’s, and I was waiting to cross
25546: near the Marble Arch. Soon he was on the omnibus and gone out of sight.
25547: It was a dreadful moment. My old life seemed to have come back again,
25548: and it was worse than it had ever been before. And I could not help
25549: feeling it a new deliverance that he was gone out of sight without
25550: knowing that I was there. And yet it hurt me that I was feeling so—it
25551: seemed hateful in me—almost like words I once had to speak in a play,
25552: that ‘I had warmed my hands in the blood of my kindred.’ For where
25553: might my father be going? What may become of him? And his having a
25554: daughter who would own him in spite of all, might have hindered the
25555: worst. Is there any pain like seeing what ought to be the best things
25556: in life turned into the worst? All those opposite feelings were meeting
25557: and pressing against each other, and took up all my strength. No one
25558: could act that. Acting is slow and poor to what we go through within. I
25559: don’t know how I called a cab. I only remember that I was in it when I
25560: began to think, ‘I cannot tell Ezra; he must not know.’”
25561: 
25562: “You are afraid of grieving him?” Mrs. Meyrick asked, when Mirah had
25563: paused a little.
25564: 
25565: “Yes—and there is something more,” said Mirah, hesitatingly, as if she
25566: were examining her feeling before she would venture to speak of it. “I
25567: want to tell you; I cannot tell any one else. I could not have told my
25568: own mother: I should have closed it up before her. I feel shame for my
25569: father, and it is perhaps strange—but the shame is greater before Ezra
25570: than before any one else in the world. He desired me to tell him all
25571: about my life, and I obeyed him. But it is always like a smart to me to
25572: know that those things about my father are in Ezra’s mind. And—can you
25573: believe it? when the thought haunts me how it would be if my father
25574: were to come and show himself before us both, what seems as if it would
25575: scorch me most is seeing my father shrinking before Ezra. That is the
25576: truth. I don’t know whether it is a right feeling. But I can’t help
25577: thinking that I would rather try to maintain my father in secret, and
25578: bear a great deal in that way, if I could hinder him from meeting my
25579: brother.”
25580: 
25581: “You must not encourage that feeling, Mirah,” said Mrs. Meyrick,
25582: hastily. “It would be very dangerous; it would be wrong. You must not
25583: have concealment of that sort.”
25584: 
25585: “But ought I now to tell Ezra that I have seen my father?” said Mirah,
25586: with deprecation in her tone.
25587: 
25588: “No,” Mrs. Meyrick answered, dubitatively. “I don’t know that it is
25589: necessary to do that. Your father may go away with the birds. It is not
25590: clear that he came after you; you may never see him again. And then
25591: your brother will have been spared a useless anxiety. But promise me
25592: that if your father sees you—gets hold of you in any way again—and
25593: you will let us all know. Promise me that solemnly, Mirah. I have a
25594: right to ask it.”
25595: 
25596: Mirah reflected a little, then leaned forward to put her hands in Mrs.
25597: Meyrick’s, and said, “Since you ask it, I do promise. I will bear this
25598: feeling of shame. I have been so long used to think that I must bear
25599: that sort of inward pain. But the shame for my father burns me more
25600: when I think of his meeting Ezra.” She was silent a moment or two, and
25601: then said, in a new tone of yearning compassion, “And we are his
25602: children—and he was once young like us—and my mother loved him. Oh! I
25603: cannot help seeing it all close, and it hurts me like a cruelty.”
25604: 
25605: Mirah shed no tears: the discipline of her whole life had been against
25606: indulgence in such manifestation, which soon falls under the control of
25607: strong motives; but it seemed that the more intense expression of
25608: sorrow had entered into her voice. Mrs. Meyrick, with all her quickness
25609: and loving insight, did not quite understand that filial feeling in
25610: Mirah which had active roots deep below her indignation for the worst
25611: offenses. She could conceive that a mother would have a clinging pity
25612: and shame for a reprobate son, but she was out of patience with what
25613: she held an exaggerated susceptibility on behalf of this father, whose
25614: reappearance inclined her to wish him under the care of a turnkey.
25615: Mirah’s promise, however, was some security against her weakness.
25616: 
25617: That incident was the only reason that Mirah herself could have stated
25618: for the hidden sadness which Hans had divined. Of one element in her
25619: changed mood she could have given no definite account: it was something
25620: as dim as the sense of approaching weather-change, and had extremely
25621: slight external promptings, such as we are often ashamed to find all we
25622: can allege in support of the busy constructions that go on within us,
25623: not only without effort, but even against it, under the influence of
25624: any blind emotional stirring. Perhaps the first leaven of uneasiness
25625: was laid by Gwendolen’s behavior on that visit which was entirely
25626: superfluous as a means of engaging Mirah to sing, and could have no
25627: other motive than the excited and strange questioning about Deronda.
25628: Mirah had instinctively kept the visit a secret, but the active
25629: remembrance of it had raised a new susceptibility in her, and made her
25630: alive as she had never been before to the relations Deronda must have
25631: with that society which she herself was getting frequent glimpses of
25632: without belonging to it. Her peculiar life and education had produced
25633: in her an extraordinary mixture of unworldliness, with knowledge of the
25634: world’s evil, and even this knowledge was a strange blending of direct
25635: observation with the effects of reading and theatrical study. Her
25636: memory was furnished with abundant passionate situation and intrigue,
25637: which she never made emotionally her own, but felt a repelled aloofness
25638: from, as she had done from the actual life around her. Some of that
25639: imaginative knowledge began now to weave itself around Mrs. Grandcourt;
25640: and though Mirah would admit no position likely to affect her reverence
25641: for Deronda, she could not avoid a new painfully vivid association of
25642: his general life with a world away from her own, where there might be
25643: some involvement of his feeling and action with a woman like Gwendolen,
25644: who was increasingly repugnant to her—increasingly, even after she had
25645: ceased to see her; for liking and disliking can grow in meditation as
25646: fast as in the more immediate kind of presence. Any disquietude
25647: consciously due to the idea that Deronda’s deepest care might be for
25648: something remote not only from herself but even from his friendship for
25649: her brother, she would have checked with rebuking questions:—What was
25650: she but one who had shared his generous kindness with many others? and
25651: his attachment to her brother, was it not begun late to be soon ended?
25652: Other ties had come before, and others would remain after this had been
25653: cut by swift-coming death. But her uneasiness had not reached that
25654: point of self-recognition in which she would have been ashamed of it as
25655: an indirect, presumptuous claim on Deronda’s feeling. That she or any
25656: one else should think of him as her possible lover was a conception
25657: which had never entered her mind; indeed it was equally out of the
25658: question with Mrs. Meyrick and the girls, who with Mirah herself
25659: regarded his intervention in her life as something exceptional, and
25660: were so impressed by his mission as her deliverer and guardian that
25661: they would have held it an offense to him at his holding any other
25662: relation toward her: a point of view which Hans also had readily
25663: adopted. It is a little hard upon some men that they appear to sink for
25664: us in becoming lovers. But precisely to this innocence of the Meyricks
25665: was owing the disturbance of Mirah’s unconsciousness. The first
25666: occasion could hardly have been more trivial, but it prepared her
25667: emotive nature for a deeper effect from what happened afterward.
25668: 
25669: It was when Anna Gascoigne, visiting the Meyricks; was led to speak of
25670: her cousinship with Gwendolen. The visit had been arranged that Anna
25671: might see Mirah; the three girls were at home with their mother, and
25672: there was naturally a flux of talk among six feminine creatures, free
25673: from the presence of a distorting male standard. Anna Gascoigne felt
25674: herself much at home with the Meyrick girls, who knew what it was to
25675: have a brother, and to be generally regarded as of minor importance in
25676: the world; and she had told Rex that she thought the University very
25677: nice, because brothers made friends there whose families were not rich
25678: and grand, and yet (like the University) were very nice. The Meyricks
25679: seemed to her almost alarmingly clever, and she consulted them much on
25680: the best mode of teaching Lotta, confiding to them that she herself was
25681: the least clever of her family. Mirah had lately come in, and there was
25682: a complete bouquet of young faces around the tea-table—Hafiz, seated a
25683: little aloft with large eyes on the alert, regarding the whole scene as
25684: an apparatus for supplying his allowance of milk.
25685: 
25686: “Think of our surprise, Mirah,” said Kate. “We were speaking of Mr.
25687: Deronda and the Mallingers, and it turns out that Miss Gascoigne knows
25688: them.”
25689: 
25690: “I only knew about them,” said Anna, a little flushed with excitement,
25691: what she had heard and now saw of the lovely Jewess being an almost
25692: startling novelty to her. “I have not even seen them. But some months
25693: ago, my cousin married Sir Hugo Mallinger’s nephew, Mr. Grandcourt, who
25694: lived in Sir Hugo’s place at Diplow, near us.”
25695: 
25696: “There!” exclaimed Mab, clasping her hands. “Something must come of
25697: that. Mrs. Grandcourt, the Vandyke duchess, is your cousin?”
25698: 
25699: “Oh, yes; I was her bridesmaid,” said Anna. “Her mamma and mine are
25700: sisters. My aunt was much richer before last year, but then she and
25701: mamma lost all their fortune. Papa is a clergyman, you know, so it
25702: makes very little difference to us, except that we keep no carriage,
25703: and have no dinner parties—and I like it better. But it was very sad
25704: for poor Aunt Davilow, for she could not live with us, because she has
25705: four daughters besides Gwendolen; but then, when she married Mr.
25706: Grandcourt, it did not signify so much, because of his being so rich.”
25707: 
25708: “Oh, this finding out relationships is delightful!” said Mab. “It is
25709: like a Chinese puzzle that one has to fit together. I feel sure
25710: something wonderful may be made of it, but I can’t tell what.”
25711: 
25712: “Dear me, Mab,” said Amy, “relationships must branch out. The only
25713: difference is, that we happen to know some of the people concerned.
25714: Such things are going on every day.”
25715: 
25716: “And pray, Amy, why do you insist on the number nine being so
25717: wonderful?” said Mab. “I am sure that is happening every day. Never
25718: mind, Miss Gascoigne; please go on. And Mr. Deronda?—have you never
25719: seen Mr. Deronda? You _must_ bring him in.”
25720: 
25721: “No, I have not seen him,” said Anna; “but he was at Diplow before my
25722: cousin was married, and I have heard my aunt speaking of him to papa.
25723: She said what you have been saying about him—only not so much: I mean,
25724: about Mr. Deronda living with Sir Hugo Mallinger, and being so nice,
25725: she thought. We talk a great deal about every one who comes near
25726: Pennicote, because it is so seldom there is any one new. But I
25727: remember, when I asked Gwendolen what she thought of Mr. Deronda, she
25728: said, ‘Don’t mention it, Anna: but I think his hair is dark.’ That was
25729: her droll way of answering: she was always so lively. It is really
25730: rather wonderful that I should come to hear so much about him, all
25731: through Mr. Hans knowing Rex, and then my having the pleasure of
25732: knowing you,” Anna ended, looking at Mrs. Meyrick with a shy grace.
25733: 
25734: “The pleasure is on our side too; but the wonder would have been, if
25735: you had come to this house without hearing of Mr. Deronda—wouldn’t it,
25736: Mirah?” said Mrs. Meyrick.
25737: 
25738: Mirah smiled acquiescently, but had nothing to say. A confused
25739: discontent took possession of her at the mingling of names and images
25740: to which she had been listening.
25741: 
25742: “My son calls Mrs. Grandcourt the Vandyke duchess,” continued Mrs.
25743: Meyrick, turning again to Anna; “he thinks her so striking and
25744: picturesque.”
25745: 
25746: “Yes,” said Anna. “Gwendolen was always so beautiful—people fell
25747: dreadfully in love with her. I thought it a pity, because it made them
25748: unhappy.”
25749: 
25750: “And how do you like Mr. Grandcourt, the happy lover?” said Mrs.
25751: Meyrick, who, in her way, was as much interested as Mab in the hints
25752: she had been hearing of vicissitude in the life of a widow with
25753: daughters.
25754: 
25755: “Papa approved of Gwendolen’s accepting him, and my aunt says he is
25756: very generous,” said Anna, beginning with a virtuous intention of
25757: repressing her own sentiments; but then, unable to resist a rare
25758: occasion for speaking them freely, she went on—“else I should have
25759: thought he was not very nice—rather proud, and not at all lively, like
25760: Gwendolen. I should have thought some one younger and more lively would
25761: have suited her better. But, perhaps, having a brother who seems to us
25762: better than any one makes us think worse of others.”
25763: 
25764: “Wait till you see Mr. Deronda,” said Mab, nodding significantly.
25765: “Nobody’s brother will do after him.”
25766: 
25767: “Our brothers _must_ do for people’s husbands,” said Kate, curtly,
25768: “because they will not get Mr. Deronda. No woman will do for him to
25769: marry.”
25770: 
25771: “No woman ought to want him to marry him,” said Mab, with indignation.
25772: “_I_ never should. Fancy finding out that he had a tailor’s bill, and
25773: used boot-hooks, like Hans. Who ever thought of his marrying?”
25774: 
25775: “I have,” said Kate. “When I drew a wedding for a frontispiece to
25776: ‘Hearts and Diamonds,’ I made a sort of likeness to him for the
25777: bridegroom, and I went about looking for a grand woman who would do for
25778: his countess, but I saw none that would not be poor creatures by the
25779: side of him.”
25780: 
25781: “You should have seen this Mrs. Grandcourt then,” said Mrs. Meyrick.
25782: “Hans says that she and Mr. Deronda set each other off when they are
25783: side by side. She is tall and fair. But you know her, Mirah—you can
25784: always say something descriptive. What do _you_ think of Mrs.
25785: Grandcourt?”
25786: 
25787: “I think she is the _Princess of Eboli_ in _Don Carlos_,” said Mirah,
25788: with a quick intensity. She was pursuing an association in her own mind
25789: not intelligible to her hearers—an association with a certain actress
25790: as well as the part she represented.
25791: 
25792: “Your comparison is a riddle for me, my dear,” said Mrs. Meyrick,
25793: smiling.
25794: 
25795: “You said that Mrs. Grandcourt was tall and fair,” continued Mirah,
25796: slightly paler. “That is quite true.”
25797: 
25798: Mrs. Meyrick’s quick eye and ear detected something unusual, but
25799: immediately explained it to herself. Fine ladies had often wounded
25800: Mirah by caprices of manner and intention.
25801: 
25802: “Mrs. Grandcourt had thought of having lessons of Mirah,” she said
25803: turning to Anna. “But many have talked of having lessons, and then have
25804: found no time. Fashionable ladies have too much work to do.”
25805: 
25806: And the chat went on without further insistence on the _Princess of
25807: Eboli_. That comparison escaped Mirah’s lips under the urgency of a
25808: pang unlike anything she had felt before. The conversation from the
25809: beginning had revived unpleasant impressions, and Mrs. Meyrick’s
25810: suggestion of Gwendolen’s figure by the side of Deronda’s had the
25811: stinging effect of a voice outside her, confirming her secret
25812: conviction that this tall and fair woman had some hold on his lot. For
25813: a long while afterward she felt as if she had had a jarring shock
25814: through her frame.
25815: 
25816: In the evening, putting her cheek against her brother’s shoulder as she
25817: was sitting by him, while he sat propped up in bed under a new
25818: difficulty of breathing, she said,
25819: 
25820: “Ezra, does it ever hurt your love for Mr. Deronda that so much of his
25821: life was all hidden away from you—that he is amongst persons and cares
25822: about persons who are all so unlike us—I mean unlike you?”
25823: 
25824: “No, assuredly no,” said Mordecai. “Rather it is a precious thought to
25825: me that he has a preparation which I lacked, and is an accomplished
25826: Egyptian.” Then, recollecting that his words had reference which his
25827: sister must not yet understand, he added, “I have the more to give him,
25828: since his treasure differs from mine. That is a blessedness in
25829: friendship.”
25830: 
25831: Mirah mused a little.
25832: 
25833: “Still,” she said, “it would be a trial to your love for him if that
25834: other part of his life were like a crowd in which he had got entangled,
25835: so that he was carried away from you—I mean in his thoughts, and not
25836: merely carried out of sight as he is now—and not merely for a little
25837: while, but continually. How should you bear that! Our religion commands
25838: us to bear. But how should you bear it?”
25839: 
25840: “Not well, my sister—not well; but it will never happen,” said
25841: Mordecai, looking at her with a tender smile. He thought that her heart
25842: needed comfort on his account.
25843: 
25844: Mirah said no more. She mused over the difference between her own state
25845: of mind and her brother’s, and felt her comparative pettiness. Why
25846: could she not be completely satisfied with what satisfied his larger
25847: judgment? She gave herself no fuller reason than a painful sense of
25848: unfitness—in what? Airy possibilities to which she could give no
25849: outline, but to which one name and one figure gave the wandering
25850: persistency of a blot in her vision. Here lay the vaguer source of the
25851: hidden sadness rendered noticeable to Hans by some diminution of that
25852: sweet ease, that ready joyousness of response in her speech and smile,
25853: which had come with the new sense of freedom and safety, and had made
25854: her presence like the freshly-opened daisies and clear bird-notes after
25855: the rain. She herself regarded her uneasiness as a sort of ingratitude
25856: and dullness of sensibility toward the great things that had been given
25857: her in her new life; and whenever she threw more energy than usual into
25858: her singing, it was the energy of indignation against the shallowness
25859: of her own content. In that mood she once said, “Shall I tell you what
25860: is the difference between you and me, Ezra? You are a spring in the
25861: drought, and I am an acorn-cup; the waters of heaven fill me, but the
25862: least little shake leaves me empty.”
25863: 
25864: “Why, what has shaken thee?” said Mordecai. He fell into this antique
25865: form of speech habitually in talking to his sister and to the Cohen
25866: children.
25867: 
25868: “Thoughts,” said Mirah; “thoughts that come like the breeze and shake
25869: me—bad people, wrong things, misery—and how they might touch our
25870: life.”
25871: 
25872: “We must take our portion, Mirah. It is there. On whose shoulder would
25873: we lay it, that we might be free?”
25874: 
25875: The one voluntary sign she made of her inward care was this distant
25876: allusion.

25881: CHAPTER LIII.
25882: 
25883:   “My desolation does begin to make
25884:   A better life.”
25885:       —SHAKESPEARE: _Antony and Cleopatra._
25886: 
25887: 
25888: Before Deronda was summoned to a second interview with his mother, a
25889: day had passed in which she had only sent him a message to say that she
25890: was not yet well enough to receive him again; but on the third morning
25891: he had a note saying, “I leave to-day. Come and see me at once.”
25892: 
25893: He was shown into the same room as before; but it was much darkened
25894: with blinds and curtains. The Princess was not there, but she presently
25895: entered, dressed in a loose wrap of some soft silk, in color a dusky
25896: orange, her head again with black lace floating about it, her arms
25897: showing themselves bare from under her wide sleeves. Her face seemed
25898: even more impressive in the sombre light, the eyes larger, the lines
25899: more vigorous. You might have imagined her a sorceress who would
25900: stretch forth her wonderful hand and arm to mix youth-potions for
25901: others, but scorned to mix them for herself, having had enough of youth.
25902: 
25903: She put her arms on her son’s shoulders at once, and kissed him on both
25904: cheeks, then seated herself among her cushions with an air of assured
25905: firmness and dignity unlike her fitfulness in their first interview,
25906: and told Deronda to sit down by her. He obeyed, saying, “You are quite
25907: relieved now, I trust?”
25908: 
25909: “Yes, I am at ease again. Is there anything more that you would like to
25910: ask me?” she said, with the matter of a queen rather than of a mother.
25911: 
25912: “Can I find the house in Genoa where you used to live with my
25913: grandfather?” said Deronda.
25914: 
25915: “No,” she answered, with a deprecating movement of her arm, “it is
25916: pulled down—not to be found. But about our family, and where my father
25917: lived at various times—you will find all that among the papers in the
25918: chest, better than I can tell you. My father, I told you, was a
25919: physician. My mother was a Morteira. I used to hear all those things
25920: without listening. You will find them all. I was born amongst them
25921: without my will. I banished them as soon as I could.”
25922: 
25923: Deronda tried to hide his pained feeling, and said, “Anything else that
25924: I should desire to know from you could only be what it is some
25925: satisfaction to your own feeling to tell me.”
25926: 
25927: “I think I have told you everything that could be demanded of me,” said
25928: the Princess, looking coldly meditative. It seemed as if she had
25929: exhausted her emotion in their former interview. The fact was, she had
25930: said to herself, “I have done it all. I have confessed all. I will not
25931: go through it again. I will save myself from agitation.” And she was
25932: acting out that scheme.
25933: 
25934: But to Deronda’s nature the moment was cruel; it made the filial
25935: yearning of his life a disappointed pilgrimage to a shrine where there
25936: were no longer the symbols of sacredness. It seemed that all the woman
25937: lacking in her was present in him, as he said, with some tremor in his
25938: voice,
25939: 
25940: “Then are we to part and I never be anything to you?”
25941: 
25942: “It is better so,” said the Princess, in a softer, mellower voice.
25943: “There could be nothing but hard duty for you, even if it were possible
25944: for you to take the place of my son. You would not love me. Don’t deny
25945: it,” she said, abruptly, putting up her hand. “I know what is the
25946: truth. You don’t like what I did. You are angry with me. You think I
25947: robbed you of something. You are on your grandfather’s side, and you
25948: will always have a condemnation of me in your heart.”
25949: 
25950: Deronda felt himself under a ban of silence. He rose from his seat by
25951: her, preferring to stand, if he had to obey that imperious prohibition
25952: of any tenderness. But his mother now looked up at him with a new
25953: admiration in her glance, saying,
25954: 
25955: “You are wrong to be angry with me. You are the better for what I did.”
25956: After pausing a little, she added, abruptly, “And now tell me what you
25957: shall do?”
25958: 
25959: “Do you mean now, immediately,” said Deronda; “or as to the course of
25960: my future life?”
25961: 
25962: “I mean in the future. What difference will it make to you that I have
25963: told you about your birth?”
25964: 
25965: “A very great difference,” said Deronda, emphatically. “I can hardly
25966: think of anything that would make a greater difference.”
25967: 
25968: “What shall you do then?” said the Princess, with more sharpness. “Make
25969: yourself just like your grandfather—be what he wished you—turn
25970: yourself into a Jew like him?”
25971: 
25972: “That is impossible. The effect of my education can never be done away
25973: with. The Christian sympathies in which my mind was reared can never
25974: die out of me,” said Deronda, with increasing tenacity of tone. “But I
25975: consider it my duty—it is the impulse of my feeling—to identify
25976: myself, as far as possible, with my hereditary people, and if I can see
25977: any work to be done for them that I can give my soul and hand to I
25978: shall choose to do it.”
25979: 
25980: His mother had her eyes fixed on him with a wondering speculation,
25981: examining his face as if she thought that by close attention she could
25982: read a difficult language there. He bore her gaze very firmly,
25983: sustained by a resolute opposition, which was the expression of his
25984: fullest self. She bent toward him a little, and said, with a decisive
25985: emphasis,
25986: 
25987: “You are in love with a Jewess.”
25988: 
25989: Deronda colored and said, “My reasons would be independent of any such
25990: fact.”
25991: 
25992: “I know better. I have seen what men are,” said the Princess,
25993: peremptorily. “Tell me the truth. She is a Jewess who will not accept
25994: any one but a Jew. There _are_ a few such,” she added, with a touch of
25995: scorn.
25996: 
25997: Deronda had that objection to answer which we all have known in
25998: speaking to those who are too certain of their own fixed
25999: interpretations to be enlightened by anything we may say. But besides
26000: this, the point immediately in question was one on which he felt a
26001: repugnance either to deny or affirm. He remained silent, and she
26002: presently said,
26003: 
26004: “You love her as your father loved me, and she draws you after her as I
26005: drew him.”
26006: 
26007: Those words touched Deronda’s filial imagination, and some tenderness
26008: in his glance was taken by his mother as an assent. She went on with
26009: rising passion: “But I was leading him the other way. And now your
26010: grandfather is getting his revenge.”
26011: 
26012: “Mother,” said Deronda, remonstrantly, “don’t let us think of it in
26013: that way. I will admit that there may come some benefit from the
26014: education you chose for me. I prefer cherishing the benefit with
26015: gratitude, to dwelling with resentment on the injury. I think it would
26016: have been right that I should have been brought up with the
26017: consciousness that I was a Jew, but it must always have been a good to
26018: me to have as wide an instruction and sympathy as possible. And now,
26019: you have restored me my inheritance—events have brought a fuller
26020: restitution than you could have made—you have been saved from robbing
26021: my people of my service and me of my duty: can you not bring your whole
26022: soul to consent to this?”
26023: 
26024: Deronda paused in his pleading: his mother looked at him listeningly,
26025: as if the cadence of his voice were taking her ear, yet she shook her
26026: head slowly. He began again, even more urgently.
26027: 
26028: “You have told me that you sought what you held the best for me: open
26029: your heart to relenting and love toward my grandfather, who sought what
26030: he held the best for you.”
26031: 
26032: “Not for me, no,” she said, shaking her head with more absolute denial,
26033: and folding her arms tightly. “I tell you, he never thought of his
26034: daughter except as an instrument. Because I had wants outside his
26035: purpose, I was to be put in a frame and tortured. If that is the right
26036: law for the world, I will not say that I love it. If my acts were
26037: wrong—if it is God who is exacting from me that I should deliver up
26038: what I withheld—who is punishing me because I deceived my father and
26039: did not warn him that I should contradict his trust—well, I have told
26040: everything. I have done what I could. And _your_ soul consents. That is
26041: enough. I have after all been the instrument my father wanted.—‘I
26042: desire a grandson who shall have a true Jewish heart. Every Jew should
26043: rear his family as if he hoped that a Deliverer might spring from it.’”
26044: 
26045: In uttering these last sentences the Princess narrowed her eyes, waved
26046: her head up and down, and spoke slowly with a new kind of chest-voice,
26047: as if she were quoting unwillingly.
26048: 
26049: “Were those my grandfather’s words?” said Deronda.
26050: 
26051: “Yes, yes; and you will find them written. I wanted to thwart him,”
26052: said the Princess, with a sudden outburst of the passion she had shown
26053: in the former interview. Then she added more slowly, “You would have me
26054: love what I have hated from the time I was so high”—here she held her
26055: left hand a yard from the floor.—“That can never be. But what does it
26056: matter? His yoke has been on me, whether I loved it or not. You are the
26057: grandson he wanted. You speak as men do—as if you felt yourself wise.
26058: What does it all mean?”
26059: 
26060: Her tone was abrupt and scornful. Deronda, in his pained feeling, and
26061: under the solemn urgency of the moment, had to keep a clutching
26062: remembrance of their relationship, lest his words should become cruel.
26063: He began in a deep entreating tone:
26064: 
26065: “Mother, don’t say that I feel myself wise. We are set in the midst of
26066: difficulties. I see no other way to get any clearness than by being
26067: truthful—not by keeping back facts which may—which should carry
26068: obligation within them—which should make the only guidance toward
26069: duty. No wonder if such facts come to reveal themselves in spite of
26070: concealments. The effects prepared by generations are likely to triumph
26071: over a contrivance which would bend them all to the satisfaction of
26072: self. Your will was strong, but my grandfather’s trust which you
26073: accepted and did not fulfill—what you call his yoke—is the expression
26074: of something stronger, with deeper, farther-spreading roots, knit into
26075: the foundations of sacredness for all men. You renounced me—you still
26076: banish me—as a son”—there was an involuntary movement of indignation
26077: in Deronda’s voice—“But that stronger Something has determined that I
26078: shall be all the more the grandson whom also you willed to annihilate.”
26079: 
26080: His mother was watching him fixedly, and again her face gathered
26081: admiration. After a moment’s silence she said, in a low, persuasive
26082: tone,
26083: 
26084: “Sit down again,” and he obeyed, placing himself beside her. She laid
26085: her hand on his shoulder and went on,
26086: 
26087: “You rebuke me. Well—I am the loser. And you are angry because I
26088: banish you. What could you do for me but weary your own patience? Your
26089: mother is a shattered woman. My sense of life is little more than a
26090: sense of what was—except when the pain is present. You reproach me
26091: that I parted with you. I had joy enough without you then. Now you are
26092: come back to me, and I cannot make you a joy. Have you the cursing
26093: spirit of the Jew in you? Are you not able to forgive me? Shall you be
26094: glad to think that I am punished because I was not a Jewish mother to
26095: you?”
26096: 
26097: “How can you ask me that?” said Deronda, remonstrantly. “Have I not
26098: besought you that I might now at least be a son to you? My grief is
26099: that you have declared me helpless to comfort you. I would give up much
26100: that is dear for the sake of soothing your anguish.”
26101: 
26102: “You shall give up nothing,” said his mother, with the hurry of
26103: agitation. “You shall be happy. You shall let me think of you as happy.
26104: I shall have done you no harm. You have no reason to curse me. You
26105: shall feel for me as they feel for the dead whom they say prayers
26106: for—you shall long that I may be freed from all suffering—from all
26107: punishment. And I shall see you instead of always seeing your
26108: grandfather. Will any harm come to me because I broke his trust in the
26109: daylight after he was gone into darkness? I cannot tell:—if you think
26110: _Kaddish_ will help me—say it, say it. You will come between me and
26111: the dead. When I am in your mind, you will look as you do now—always
26112: as if you were a tender son—always—as if I had been a tender mother.”
26113: 
26114: She seemed resolved that her agitation should not conquer her, but he
26115: felt her hand trembling on his shoulder. Deep, deep compassion hemmed
26116: in all words. With a face of beseeching he put his arm around her and
26117: pressed her head tenderly under his. They sat so for some moments. Then
26118: she lifted her head again and rose from her seat with a great sigh, as
26119: if in that breath she were dismissing a weight of thoughts. Deronda,
26120: standing in front of her, felt that the parting was near. But one of
26121: her swift alternations had come upon his mother.
26122: 
26123: “Is she beautiful?” she said, abruptly.
26124: 
26125: “Who?” said Deronda, changing color.
26126: 
26127: “The woman you love.”
26128: 
26129: It was not a moment for deliberate explanation. He was obliged to say,
26130: “Yes.”
26131: 
26132: “Not ambitious?”
26133: 
26134: “No, I think not.”
26135: 
26136: “Not one who must have a path of her own?”
26137: 
26138: “I think her nature is not given to make great claims.”
26139: 
26140: “She is not like that?” said the Princess, taking from her wallet a
26141: miniature with jewels around it, and holding it before her son. It was
26142: her own in all the fire of youth, and as Deronda looked at it with
26143: admiring sadness, she said, “Had I not a rightful claim to be something
26144: more than a mere daughter and mother? The voice and the genius matched
26145: the face. Whatever else was wrong, acknowledge that I had a right to be
26146: an artist, though my father’s will was against it. My nature gave me a
26147: charter.”
26148: 
26149: “I do acknowledge that,” said Deronda, looking from the miniature to
26150: her face, which even in its worn pallor had an expression of living
26151: force beyond anything that the pencil could show.
26152: 
26153: “Will you take the portrait?” said the Princess, more gently. “If she
26154: is a kind woman, teach her to think of me kindly.”
26155: 
26156: “I shall be grateful for the portrait,” said Deronda, “but—I ought to
26157: say, I have no assurance that she whom I love will have any love for
26158: me. I have kept silence.”
26159: 
26160: “Who and what is she?” said the mother. The question seemed a command.
26161: 
26162: “She was brought up as a singer for the stage,” said Deronda, with
26163: inward reluctance. “Her father took her away early from her mother, and
26164: her life has been unhappy. She is very young—only twenty. Her father
26165: wished to bring her up in disregard—even in dislike of her Jewish
26166: origin, but she has clung with all her affection to the memory of her
26167: mother and the fellowship of her people.”
26168: 
26169: “Ah, like you. She is attached to the Judaism she knows nothing of,”
26170: said the Princess, peremptorily. “That is poetry—fit to last through
26171: an opera night. Is she fond of her artist’s life—is her singing worth
26172: anything?”
26173: 
26174: “Her singing is exquisite. But her voice is not suited to the stage. I
26175: think that the artist’s life has been made repugnant to her.”
26176: 
26177: “Why, she is made for you then. Sir Hugo said you were bitterly against
26178: being a singer, and I can see that you would never have let yourself be
26179: merged in a wife, as your father was.”
26180: 
26181: “I repeat,” said Deronda, emphatically—“I repeat that I have no
26182: assurance of her love for me, of the possibility that we can ever be
26183: united. Other things—painful issues may lie before me. I have always
26184: felt that I should prepare myself to renounce, not cherish that
26185: prospect. But I suppose I might feel so of happiness in general.
26186: Whether it may come or not, one should try and prepare one’s self to do
26187: without it.”
26188: 
26189: “Do you feel in that way?” said his mother, laying her hands on his
26190: shoulders, and perusing his face, while she spoke in a low meditative
26191: tone, pausing between her sentences. “Poor boy!——I wonder how it
26192: would have been if I had kept you with me——whether you would have
26193: turned your heart to the old things against mine——and we should have
26194: quarreled——your grandfather would have been in you——and you would
26195: have hampered my life with your young growth from the old root.”
26196: 
26197: “I think my affection might have lasted through all our quarreling,”
26198: said Deronda, saddened more and more, “and that would not have
26199: hampered—surely it would have enriched your life.”
26200: 
26201: “Not then, not then——I did not want it then——I might have been glad
26202: of it now,” said the mother, with a bitter melancholy, “if I could have
26203: been glad of anything.”
26204: 
26205: “But you love your other children, and they love you?” said Deronda,
26206: anxiously.
26207: 
26208: “Oh, yes,” she answered, as to a question about a matter of course,
26209: while she folded her arms again. “But,”——she added in a deeper
26210: tone,——“I am not a loving woman. That is the truth. It is a talent to
26211: love—I lack it. Others have loved me—and I have acted their love. I
26212: know very well what love makes of men and women—it is subjection. It
26213: takes another for a larger self, enclosing this one,”—she pointed to
26214: her own bosom. “I was never willingly subject to any man. Men have been
26215: subject to me.”
26216: 
26217: “Perhaps the man who was subject was the happier of the two,” said
26218: Deronda—not with a smile, but with a grave, sad sense of his mother’s
26219: privation.
26220: 
26221: “Perhaps—but I _was_ happy—for a few years I was happy. If I had not
26222: been afraid of defeat and failure, I might have gone on. I
26223: miscalculated. What then? It is all over. Another life! Men talk of
26224: ‘another life,’ as if it only began on the other side of the grave. I
26225: have long entered on another life.” With the last words she raised her
26226: arms till they were bare to the elbow, her brow was contracted in one
26227: deep fold, her eyes were closed, her voice was smothered: in her dusky
26228: flame-colored garment, she looked like a dreamed visitant from some
26229: region of departed mortals.
26230: 
26231: Deronda’s feeling was wrought to a pitch of acuteness in which he was
26232: no longer quite master of himself. He gave an audible sob. His mother
26233: opened her eyes, and letting her hands again rest on his shoulders,
26234: said,
26235: 
26236: “Good-bye, my son, good-bye. We shall hear no more of each other. Kiss
26237: me.”
26238: 
26239: He clasped his arms round her neck, and they kissed each other.
26240: 
26241: Deronda did not know how he got out of the room. He felt an older man.
26242: All his boyish yearnings and anxieties about his mother had vanished.
26243: He had gone through a tragic experience which must forever solemnize
26244: his life and deepen the significance of the acts by which he bound
26245: himself to others.

26250: CHAPTER LIV.
26251: 
26252:         “The unwilling brain
26253:   Feigns often what it would not; and we trust
26254:   Imagination with such phantasies
26255:   As the tongue dares not fashion into words;
26256:   Which have no words, their horror makes them dim
26257:   To the mind’s eye.”
26258:                                           —SHELLEY.
26259: 
26260: 
26261: Madonna Pia, whose husband, feeling himself injured by her, took her to
26262: his castle amid the swampy flats of the Maremma and got rid of her
26263: there, makes a pathetic figure in Dante’s Purgatory, among the sinners
26264: who repented at the last and desire to be remembered compassionately by
26265: their fellow-countrymen. We know little about the grounds of mutual
26266: discontent between the Siennese couple, but we may infer with some
26267: confidence that the husband had never been a very delightful companion,
26268: and that on the flats of the Maremma his disagreeable manners had a
26269: background which threw them out remarkably; whence in his desire to
26270: punish his wife to the upmost, the nature of things was so far against
26271: him that in relieving himself of her he could not avoid making the
26272: relief mutual. And thus, without any hardness to the poor Tuscan lady,
26273: who had her deliverance long ago, one may feel warranted in thinking of
26274: her with a less sympathetic interest than of the better known Gwendolen
26275: who, instead of being delivered from her errors on earth and cleansed
26276: from their effect in purgatory, is at the very height of her
26277: entanglement in those fatal meshes which are woven within more closely
26278: than without, and often make the inward torture disproportionate to
26279: what is discernable as outward cause.
26280: 
26281: In taking his wife with him on a yachting expedition, Grandcourt had no
26282: intention to get rid of her; on the contrary, he wanted to feel more
26283: securely that she was his to do as he liked with, and to make her feel
26284: it also. Moreover, he was himself very fond of yachting: its dreamy
26285: do-nothing absolutism, unmolested by social demands, suited his
26286: disposition, and he did not in the least regard it as an equivalent for
26287: the dreariness of the Maremma. He had his reasons for carrying
26288: Gwendolen out of reach, but they were not reasons that can seem black
26289: in the mere statement. He suspected a growing spirit of opposition in
26290: her, and his feeling about the sentimental inclination she betrayed for
26291: Deronda was what in another man he would have called jealousy. In
26292: himself it seemed merely a resolution to put an end to such foolery as
26293: must have been going on in that prearranged visit of Deronda’s which he
26294: had divined and interrupted.
26295: 
26296: And Grandcourt might have pleaded that he was perfectly justified in
26297: taking care that his wife should fulfill the obligations she had
26298: accepted. Her marriage was a contract where all the ostensible
26299: advantages were on her side, and it was only of those advantages that
26300: her husband should use his power to hinder her from any injurious self
26301: committal or unsuitable behavior. He knew quite well that she had not
26302: married him—had not overcome her repugnance to certain facts—out of
26303: love to him personally; he had won her by the rank and luxuries he had
26304: to give her, and these she had got: he had fulfilled his side of the
26305: contract.
26306: 
26307: And Gwendolen, we know, was thoroughly aware of the situation. She
26308: could not excuse herself by saying that there had been a tacit part of
26309: the contract on her side—namely, that she meant to rule and have her
26310: own way. With all her early indulgence in the disposition to dominate,
26311: she was not one of the narrow-brained women who through life regard all
26312: their own selfish demands as rights, and every claim upon themselves as
26313: an injury. She had a root of conscience in her, and the process of
26314: purgatory had begun for her on the green earth: she knew that she had
26315: been wrong.
26316: 
26317: But now enter into the soul of this young creature as she found
26318: herself, with the blue Mediterranean dividing her from the world, on
26319: the tiny plank-island of a yacht, the domain of the husband to whom she
26320: felt that she had sold herself, and had been paid the strict
26321: price—nay, paid more than she had dared to ask in the handsome
26322: maintenance of her mother:—the husband to whom she had sold her
26323: truthfulness and sense of justice, so that he held them throttled into
26324: silence, collared and dragged behind him to witness what he would,
26325: without remonstrance.
26326: 
26327: What had she to complain of? The yacht was of the prettiest; the cabin
26328: fitted up to perfection, smelling of cedar, soft-cushioned, hung with
26329: silk, expanded with mirrors; the crew such as suited an elegant toy,
26330: one of them having even ringlets, as well as a bronze complexion and
26331: fine teeth; and Mr. Lush was not there, for he had taken his way back
26332: to England as soon as he had seen all and everything on board.
26333: Moreover, Gwendolen herself liked the sea: it did not make her ill; and
26334: to observe the rigging of the vessel and forecast the necessary
26335: adjustments was a sort of amusement that might have gratified her
26336: activity and enjoyment of imaginary rule; the weather was fine, and
26337: they were coasting southward, where even the rain-furrowed,
26338: heat-cracked clay becomes gem-like with purple shadows, and where one
26339: may float between blue and blue in an open-eyed dream that the world
26340: has done with sorrow.
26341: 
26342: But what can still that hunger of the heart which sickens the eye for
26343: beauty, and makes sweet-scented ease an oppression? What sort of Moslem
26344: paradise would quiet the terrible fury of moral repulsion and cowed
26345: resistance which, like an eating pain intensifying into torture,
26346: concentrates the mind in that poisonous misery? While Gwendolen,
26347: throned on her cushions at evening, and beholding the glory of sea and
26348: sky softening as if with boundless love around her, was hoping that
26349: Grandcourt in his march up and down was not going to pause near her,
26350: not going to look at her or speak to her, some woman, under a smoky
26351: sky, obliged to consider the price of eggs in arranging her dinner, was
26352: listening for the music of a footstep that would remove all risk from
26353: her foretaste of joy; some couple, bending cheek by cheek, over a bit
26354: of work done by the one and delighted in by the other, were reckoning
26355: the earnings that would make them rich enough for a holiday among the
26356: furze and heather.
26357: 
26358: Had Grandcourt the least conception of what was going on in the breast
26359: of his wife? He conceived that she did not love him; but was that
26360: necessary? She was under his power, and he was not accustomed to soothe
26361: himself, as some cheerfully-disposed persons are, with the conviction
26362: that he was very generally and justly beloved. But what lay quite away
26363: from his conception was, that she could have any special repulsion for
26364: him personally. How could she? He himself knew what personal repulsion
26365: was—nobody better; his mind was much furnished with a sense of what
26366: brutes his fellow-creatures were, both masculine and feminine; what
26367: odious familiarities they had, what smirks, what modes of flourishing
26368: their handkerchiefs, what costume, what lavender water, what bulging
26369: eyes, and what foolish notions of making themselves agreeable by
26370: remarks which were not wanted. In this critical view of mankind there
26371: was an affinity between him and Gwendolen before their marriage, and we
26372: know that she had been attractingly wrought upon by the refined
26373: negations he presented to her. Hence he understood her repulsion for
26374: Lush. But how was he to understand or conceive her present repulsion
26375: for Henleigh Grandcourt? Some men bring themselves to believe, and not
26376: merely maintain, the non-existence of an external world; a few others
26377: believe themselves objects of repulsion to a woman without being told
26378: so in plain language. But Grandcourt did not belong to this eccentric
26379: body of thinkers. He had all his life had reason to take a flattering
26380: view of his own attractiveness, and to place himself in fine antithesis
26381: to the men who, he saw at once, must be revolting to a woman of taste.
26382: He had no idea of moral repulsion, and could not have believed, if he
26383: had been told it, that there may be a resentment and disgust which will
26384: gradually make beauty more detestable than ugliness, through
26385: exasperation at that outward virtue in which hateful things can flaunt
26386: themselves or find a supercilious advantage.
26387: 
26388: How, then, could Grandcourt divine what was going on in Gwendolen’s
26389: breast?
26390: 
26391: For their behavior to each other scandalized no observer—not even the
26392: foreign maid, warranted against sea-sickness; nor Grandcourt’s own
26393: experienced valet: still less the picturesque crew, who regarded them
26394: as a model couple in high life. Their companionship consisted chiefly
26395: in a well-bred silence. Grandcourt had no humorous observations at
26396: which Gwendolen could refuse to smile, no chit-chat to make small
26397: occasions of dispute. He was perfectly polite in arranging an
26398: additional garment over her when needful, and in handing her any object
26399: that he perceived her to need, and she could not fall into the
26400: vulgarity of accepting or rejecting such politeness rudely.
26401: 
26402: Grandcourt put up his telescope and said, “There’s a plantation of
26403: sugar-canes at the foot of that rock; should you like to look?”
26404: 
26405: Gwendolen said, “Yes, please,” remembering that she must try and
26406: interest herself in sugar-canes as something outside her personal
26407: affairs. Then Grandcourt would walk up and down and smoke for a long
26408: while, pausing occasionally to point out a sail on the horizon, and at
26409: last would seat himself and look at Gwendolen with his narrow immovable
26410: gaze, as if she were part of the complete yacht; while she, conscious
26411: of being looked at was exerting her ingenuity not to meet his eyes. At
26412: dinner he would remark that the fruit was getting stale, and they must
26413: put in somewhere for more; or, observing that she did not drink the
26414: wine, he asked her if she would like any other kind better. A lady was
26415: obliged to respond to these things suitably; and even if she had not
26416: shrunk from quarrelling on other grounds, quarreling with Grandcourt
26417: was impossible; she might as well have made angry remarks to a
26418: dangerous serpent ornamentally coiled in her cabin without invitation.
26419: And what sort of dispute could a woman of any pride and dignity begin
26420: on a yacht?
26421: 
26422: Grandcourt had intense satisfaction in leading his wife captive after
26423: this fashion; it gave their life on a small scale a royal
26424: representation and publicity in which every thing familiar was got rid
26425: of, and every body must do what was expected of them whatever might be
26426: their private protest—the protest (kept strictly private) adding to
26427: the piquancy of despotism.
26428: 
26429: To Gwendolen, who even in the freedom of her maiden time, had had very
26430: faint glimpses of any heroism or sublimity, the medium that now thrust
26431: itself everywhere before her view was this husband and her relation to
26432: him. The beings closest to us, whether in love or hate, are often
26433: virtually our interpreters of the world, and some feather-headed
26434: gentleman or lady whom in passing we regret to take as legal tender for
26435: a human being, may be acting as a melancholy theory of life in the
26436: minds of those who live with them—like a piece of yellow and wavy
26437: glass that distorts form and makes color an affliction. Their trivial
26438: sentences, their petty standards, their low suspicions, their loveless
26439: _ennui_, may be making somebody else’s life no better than a promenade
26440: through a pantheon of ugly idols. Gwendolen had that kind of window
26441: before her, affecting the distant equally with the near. Some unhappy
26442: wives are soothed by the possibility that they may become mothers; but
26443: Gwendolen felt that to desire a child for herself would have been a
26444: consenting to the completion of the injury she had been guilty of. She
26445: was reduced to dread lest she should become a mother. It was not the
26446: image of a new sweetly-budding life that came as a vision of
26447: deliverance from the monotony of distaste: it was an image of another
26448: sort. In the irritable, fluctuating stages of despair, gleams of hope
26449: came in the form of some possible accident. To dwell on the benignity
26450: of accident was a refuge from worse temptation.
26451: 
26452: The embitterment of hatred is often as unaccountable to onlookers as
26453: the growth of devoted love, and it not only seems but is really out of
26454: direct relation with any outward causes to be alleged. Passion is of
26455: the nature of seed, and finds nourishment within, tending to a
26456: predominance which determines all currents toward itself, and makes the
26457: whole life its tributary. And the intensest form of hatred is that
26458: rooted in fear, which compels to silence and drives vehemence into a
26459: constructive vindictiveness, an imaginary annihilation of the detested
26460: object, something like the hidden rites of vengeance with which the
26461: persecuted have made a dark vent for their rage, and soothed their
26462: suffering into dumbness. Such hidden rites went on in the secrecy of
26463: Gwendolen’s mind, but not with soothing effect—rather with the effect
26464: of a struggling terror. Side by side with the dread of her husband had
26465: grown the self-dread, which urged her to flee from the pursuing images
26466: wrought by her pent-up impulse. The vision of her past wrong-doing, and
26467: what it had brought on her, came with a pale ghastly illumination over
26468: every imagined deed that was a rash effort at freedom, such as she had
26469: made in her marriage. Moreover, she had learned to see all her acts
26470: through the impression they would make on Deronda: whatever relief
26471: might come to her, she could not sever it from the judgment of her that
26472: would be created in his mind. Not one word of flattery, of indulgence,
26473: of dependence on her favor, could be fastened on by her in all their
26474: intercourse, to weaken his restraining power over her (in this way
26475: Deronda’s effort over himself was repaid); and amid the dreary
26476: uncertainties of her spoiled life the possible remedies that lay in his
26477: mind, nay, the remedy that lay in her feeling for him, made her only
26478: hope. He seemed to her a terrible-browed angel, from whom she could not
26479: think of concealing any deed so as to win an ignorant regard from him:
26480: it belonged to the nature of their relation that she should be
26481: truthful, for his power over her had begun in the raising of a
26482: self-discontent which could be satisfied only by genuine change. But in
26483: no concealment had she now any confidence: her vision of what she had
26484: to dread took more decidedly than ever the form of some fiercely
26485: impulsive deed, committed as in a dream that she would instantaneously
26486: wake from to find the effects real though the images had been false: to
26487: find death under her hands, but instead of darkness, daylight; instead
26488: of satisfied hatred, the dismay of guilt; instead of freedom, the palsy
26489: of a new terror—a white dead face from which she was forever trying to
26490: flee and forever held back. She remembered Deronda’s words: they were
26491: continually recurring in her thought,
26492: 
26493: “Turn your fear into a safeguard. Keep your dread fixed on the idea of
26494: increasing your remorse. * * * Take your fear as a safeguard. It is
26495: like quickness of hearing. It may make consequences passionately
26496: present to you.”
26497: 
26498: And so it was. In Gwendolen’s consciousness temptation and dread met
26499: and stared like two pale phantoms, each seeing itself in the
26500: other—each obstructed by its own image; and all the while her fuller
26501: self beheld the apparitions and sobbed for deliverance from them.
26502: 
26503: Inarticulate prayers, no more definite than a cry, often swept out from
26504: her into the vast silence, unbroken except by her husband’s breathing
26505: or the plash of the wave or the creaking of the masts; but if ever she
26506: thought of definite help, it took the form of Deronda’s presence and
26507: words, of the sympathy he might have for her, of the direction he might
26508: give her. It was sometimes after a white-lipped fierce-eyed temptation
26509: with murdering fingers had made its demon-visit that these best moments
26510: of inward crying and clinging for rescue would come to her, and she
26511: would lie with wide-open eyes in which the rising tears seemed a
26512: blessing, and the thought, “I will not mind if I can keep from getting
26513: wicked,” seemed an answer to the indefinite prayer.
26514: 
26515: So the days passed, taking with them light breezes beyond and about the
26516: Balearic Isles, and then to Sardinia, and then with gentle change
26517: persuading them northward again toward Corsica. But this floating,
26518: gentle-wafted existence, with its apparently peaceful influences, was
26519: becoming as bad as a nightmare to Gwendolen.
26520: 
26521: “How long are we to be yachting?” she ventured to ask one day after
26522: they had been touching at Ajaccio, and the mere fact of change in going
26523: ashore had given her a relief from some of the thoughts which seemed
26524: now to cling about the very rigging of the vessel, mix with the air in
26525: the red silk cabin below, and make the smell of the sea odious.
26526: 
26527: “What else should we do?” said Grandcourt. “I’m not tired of it. I
26528: don’t see why we shouldn’t stay out any length of time. There’s less to
26529: bore one in this way. And where would you go to? I’m sick of foreign
26530: places. And we shall have enough of Ryelands. Would you rather be at
26531: Ryelands?”
26532: 
26533: “Oh, no,” said Gwendolen, indifferently, finding all places alike
26534: indescribable as soon as she imagined herself and her husband in them.
26535: “I only wondered how long you would like this.”
26536: 
26537: “I like yachting longer than anything else,” said Grandcourt; “and I
26538: had none last year. I suppose you are beginning to tire of it. Women
26539: are so confoundedly whimsical. They expect everything to give way to
26540: them.”
26541: 
26542: “Oh, dear, no!” said Gwendolen, letting out her scorn in a flute-like
26543: tone. “I never expect you to give way.”
26544: 
26545: “Why should I?” said Grandcourt, with his inward voice, looking at her,
26546: and then choosing an orange—for they were at table.
26547: 
26548: She made up her mind to a length of yachting that she could not see
26549: beyond; but the next day, after a squall which had made her rather ill
26550: for the first time, he came down to her and said,
26551: 
26552: “There’s been the devil’s own work in the night. The skipper says we
26553: shall have to stay at Genoa for a week while things are set right.”
26554: 
26555: “Do you mind that?” said Gwendolen, who lay looking very white amidst
26556: her white drapery.
26557: 
26558: “I should think so. Who wants to be broiling at Genoa?”
26559: 
26560: “It will be a change,” said Gwendolen, made a little incautious by her
26561: languor.
26562: 
26563: “_I_ don’t want any change. Besides, the place is intolerable; and one
26564: can’t move along the roads. I shall go out in a boat, as I used to do,
26565: and manage it myself. One can get a few hours every day in that way
26566: instead of striving in a damnable hotel.”
26567: 
26568: Here was a prospect which held hope in it. Gwendolen thought of hours
26569: when she would be alone, since Grandcourt would not want to take her in
26570: the said boat, and in her exultation at this unlooked-for relief, she
26571: had wild, contradictory fancies of what she might do with her
26572: freedom—that “running away” which she had already innumerable times
26573: seen to be a worse evil than any actual endurance, now finding new
26574: arguments as an escape from her worse self. Also, visionary relief on a
26575: par with the fancy of a prisoner that the night wind may blow down the
26576: wall of his prison and save him from desperate devices, insinuated
26577: itself as a better alternative, lawful to wish for.
26578: 
26579: The fresh current of expectation revived her energies, and enabled her
26580: to take all things with an air of cheerfulness and alacrity that made a
26581: change marked enough to be noticed by her husband. She watched through
26582: the evening lights to the sinking of the moon with less of awed
26583: loneliness than was habitual to her—nay, with a vague impression that
26584: in this mighty frame of things there might be some preparation of
26585: rescue for her. Why not?—since the weather had just been on her side.
26586: This possibility of hoping, after her long fluctuation amid fears, was
26587: like a first return of hunger to the long-languishing patient.
26588: 
26589: She was waked the next morning by the casting of the anchor in the port
26590: of Genoa—waked from a strangely-mixed dream in which she felt herself
26591: escaping over the Mont Cenis, and wondering to find it warmer even in
26592: the moonlight on the snow, till suddenly she met Deronda, who told her
26593: to go back.
26594: 
26595: In an hour or so from that dream she actually met Deronda. But it was
26596: on the palatial staircase of the _Italia_, where she was feeling warm
26597: in her light woolen dress and straw hat; and her husband was by her
26598: side.
26599: 
26600: There was a start of surprise in Deronda before he could raise his hat
26601: and pass on. The moment did not seem to favor any closer greeting, and
26602: the circumstances under which they had last parted made him doubtful
26603: whether Grandcourt would be civilly inclined to him.
26604: 
26605: The doubt might certainly have been changed into a disagreeable
26606: certainty, for Grandcourt on this unaccountable appearance of Deronda
26607: at Genoa of all places, immediately tried to conceive how there could
26608: have been an arrangement between him and Gwendolen. It is true that
26609: before they were well in their rooms, he had seen how difficult it was
26610: to shape such an arrangement with any probability, being too
26611: cool-headed to find it at once easily credible that Gwendolen had not
26612: only while in London hastened to inform Deronda of the yachting
26613: project, but had posted a letter to him from Marseilles or Barcelona,
26614: advising him to travel to Genoa in time for the chance of meeting her
26615: there, or of receiving a letter from her telling of some other
26616: destination—all which must have implied a miraculous foreknowledge in
26617: her, and in Deronda a bird-like facility in flying about and perching
26618: idly. Still he was there, and though Grandcourt would not make a fool
26619: of himself by fabrications that others might call preposterous, he was
26620: not, for all that, disposed to admit fully that Deronda’s presence was,
26621: so far as Gwendolen was concerned, a mere accident. It was a disgusting
26622: fact; that was enough; and no doubt she was well pleased. A man out of
26623: temper does not wait for proofs before feeling toward all things
26624: animate and inanimate as if they were in a conspiracy against him, but
26625: at once threshes his horse or kicks his dog in consequence. Grandcourt
26626: felt toward Gwendolen and Deronda as if he knew them to be in a
26627: conspiracy against him, and here was an event in league with them. What
26628: he took for clearly certain—and so far he divined the truth—was that
26629: Gwendolen was now counting on an interview with Deronda whenever her
26630: husband’s back was turned.
26631: 
26632: As he sat taking his coffee at a convenient angle for observing her, he
26633: discerned something which he felt sure was the effect of a secret
26634: delight—some fresh ease in moving and speaking, some peculiar meaning
26635: in her eyes, whatever she looked on. Certainly her troubles had not
26636: marred her beauty. Mrs. Grandcourt was handsomer than Gwendolen
26637: Harleth: her grace and expression were informed by a greater variety of
26638: inward experience, giving new play to her features, new attitudes in
26639: movement and repose; her whole person and air had the nameless
26640: something which often makes a woman more interesting after marriage
26641: than before, less confident that all things are according to her
26642: opinion, and yet with less of deer-like shyness—more fully a human
26643: being.
26644: 
26645: This morning the benefits of the voyage seemed to be suddenly revealing
26646: themselves in a new elasticity of mien. As she rose from the table and
26647: put her two heavily-jewelled hands on each side of her neck, according
26648: to her wont, she had no art to conceal that sort of joyous expectation
26649: which makes the present more bearable than usual, just as when a man
26650: means to go out he finds it easier to be amiable to the family for a
26651: quarter of an hour beforehand. It is not impossible that a terrier
26652: whose pleasure was concerned would perceive those amiable signs and
26653: know their meaning—know why his master stood in a peculiar way, talked
26654: with alacrity, and even had a peculiar gleam in his eye, so that on the
26655: least movement toward the door, the terrier would scuttle to be in
26656: time. And, in dog fashion, Grandcourt discerned the signs of
26657: Gwendolen’s expectation, interpreting them with the narrow correctness
26658: which leaves a world of unknown feeling behind.
26659: 
26660: “A—just ring, please, and tell Gibbs to order some dinner for us at
26661: three,” said Grandcourt, as he too rose, took out a cigar, and then
26662: stretched his hand toward the hat that lay near. “I’m going to send
26663: Angus to find a little sailing-boat for us to go out in; one that I can
26664: manage, with you at the tiller. It’s uncommonly pleasant these fine
26665: evenings—the least boring of anything we can do.”
26666: 
26667: Gwendolen turned cold. There was not only the cruel disappointment;
26668: there was the immediate conviction that her husband had determined to
26669: take her because he would not leave her out of his sight; and probably
26670: this dual solitude in a boat was the more attractive to him because it
26671: would be wearisome to her. They were not on the plank-island; she felt
26672: it the more possible to begin a contest. But the gleaming content had
26673: died out of her. There was a change in her like that of a glacier after
26674: sunset.
26675: 
26676: “I would rather not go in the boat,” she said. “Take some one else with
26677: you.”
26678: 
26679: “Very well; if you don’t go, I shall not go,” said Grandcourt. “We
26680: shall stay suffocating here, that’s all.”
26681: 
26682: “I can’t bear to go in a boat,” said Gwendolen, angrily.
26683: 
26684: “That is a sudden change,” said Grandcourt, with a slight sneer. “But,
26685: since you decline, we shall stay indoors.”
26686: 
26687: He laid down his hat again, lit his cigar, and walked up and down the
26688: room, pausing now and then to look out of the windows. Gwendolen’s
26689: temper told her to persist. She knew very well now that Grandcourt
26690: would not go without her; but if he must tyrannize over her, he should
26691: not do it precisely in the way he would choose. She would oblige him to
26692: stay in the hotel. Without speaking again, she passed into the
26693: adjoining bedroom and threw herself into a chair with her anger, seeing
26694: no purpose or issue—only feeling that the wave of evil had rushed back
26695: upon her, and dragged her away from her momentary breathing-place.
26696: 
26697: Presently Grandcourt came in with his hat on, but threw it off and sat
26698: down sideways on a chair nearly in front of her, saying, in his
26699: superficial drawl,
26700: 
26701: “Have you come round yet? or do you find it agreeable to be out of
26702: temper. You make things uncommonly pleasant for me.”
26703: 
26704: “Why do you want to make them unpleasant for _me_?” said Gwendolen,
26705: getting helpless again, and feeling the hot tears rise.
26706: 
26707: “Now, will you be good enough to say what it is you have to complain
26708: of?” said Grandcourt, looking into her eyes, and using his most inward
26709: voice. “Is it that I stay indoors when you stay?”
26710: 
26711: She could give no answer. The sort of truth that made any excuse for
26712: her anger could not be uttered. In the conflict of despair and
26713: humiliation she began to sob, and the tears rolled down her cheeks—a
26714: form of agitation which she had never shown before in her husband’s
26715: presence.
26716: 
26717: “I hope this is useful,” said Grandcourt, after a moment or two. “All I
26718: can say is, it’s most confoundedly unpleasant. What the devil women can
26719: see in this kind of thing, I don’t know. _You_ see something to be got
26720: by it, of course. All I can see is, that we shall be shut up here when
26721: we might have been having a pleasant sail.”
26722: 
26723: “Let us go, then,” said Gwendolen, impetuously. “Perhaps we shall be
26724: drowned.” She began to sob again.
26725: 
26726: This extraordinary behavior, which had evidently some relation to
26727: Deronda, gave more definiteness to Grandcourt’s conclusions. He drew
26728: his chair quite close in front of her, and said, in a low tone, “Just
26729: be quiet and listen, will you?”
26730: 
26731: There seemed to be a magical effect in this close vicinity. Gwendolen
26732: shrank and ceased to sob. She kept her eyelids down and clasped her
26733: hands tightly.
26734: 
26735: “Let us understand each other,” said Grandcourt, in the same tone. “I
26736: know very well what this nonsense means. But if you suppose I am going
26737: to let you make a fool of me, just dismiss that notion from your mind.
26738: What are you looking forward to, if you can’t behave properly as my
26739: wife? There is disgrace for you, if you like to have it, but I don’t
26740: know anything else; and as to Deronda, it’s quite clear that he hangs
26741: back from you.”
26742: 
26743: “It’s all false!” said Gwendolen, bitterly. “You don’t in the least
26744: imagine what is in my mind. I have seen enough of the disgrace that
26745: comes in that way. And you had better leave me at liberty to speak with
26746: any one I like. It will be better for you.”
26747: 
26748: “You will allow me to judge of that,” said Grandcourt, rising and
26749: moving to a little distance toward the window, but standing there
26750: playing with his whiskers as if he were awaiting something.
26751: 
26752: Gwendolen’s words had so clear and tremendous a meaning for herself
26753: that she thought they must have expressed it to Grandcourt, and had no
26754: sooner uttered them than she dreaded their effect. But his soul was
26755: garrisoned against presentiments and fears: he had the courage and
26756: confidence that belong to domination, and he was at that moment feeling
26757: perfectly satisfied that he held his wife with bit and bridle. By the
26758: time they had been married a year she would cease to be restive. He
26759: continued standing with his air of indifference, till she felt her
26760: habitual stifling consciousness of having an immovable obstruction in
26761: her life, like the nightmare of beholding a single form that serves to
26762: arrest all passage though the wide country lies open.
26763: 
26764: “What decision have you come to?” he said, presently looking at her.
26765: “What orders shall I give?”
26766: 
26767: “Oh, let us go,” said Gwendolen. The walls had begun to be an
26768: imprisonment, and while there was breath in this man he would have the
26769: mastery over her. His words had the power of thumb-screws and the cold
26770: touch of the rock. To resist was to act like a stupid animal unable to
26771: measure results.
26772: 
26773: So the boat was ordered. She even went down to the quay again with him
26774: to see it before midday. Grandcourt had recovered perfect quietude of
26775: temper, and had a scornful satisfaction in the attention given by the
26776: nautical groups to the _milord_, owner of the handsome yacht which had
26777: just put in for repairs, and who being an Englishman was naturally so
26778: at home on the sea that he could manage a sail with the same ease that
26779: he could manage a horse. The sort of exultation he had discerned in
26780: Gwendolen this morning she now thought that she discerned in him; and
26781: it was true that he had set his mind on this boating, and carried out
26782: his purpose as something that people might not expect him to do, with
26783: the gratified impulse of a strong will which had nothing better to
26784: exert itself upon. He had remarkable physical courage, and was proud of
26785: it—or rather he had a great contempt for the coarser, bulkier men who
26786: generally had less. Moreover, he was ruling that Gwendolen should go
26787: with him.
26788: 
26789: And when they came down again at five o’clock, equipped for their
26790: boating, the scene was as good as a theatrical representation for all
26791: beholders. This handsome, fair-skinned English couple, manifesting the
26792: usual eccentricity of their nation, both of them proud, pale, and calm,
26793: without a smile on their faces, moving like creatures who were
26794: fulfilling a supernatural destiny—it was a thing to go out and see, a
26795: thing to paint. The husband’s chest, back, and arms, showed very well
26796: in his close-fitting dress, and the wife was declared to be a statue.
26797: 
26798: Some suggestions were proffered concerning a possible change in the
26799: breeze, and the necessary care in putting about, but Grandcourt’s
26800: manner made the speakers understand that they were too officious, and
26801: that he knew better than they.
26802: 
26803: Gwendolen, keeping her impassable air, as they moved away from the
26804: strand, felt her imagination obstinately at work. She was not afraid of
26805: any outward dangers—she was afraid of her own wishes which were taking
26806: shapes possible and impossible, like a cloud of demon-faces. She was
26807: afraid of her own hatred, which under the cold iron touch that had
26808: compelled her to-day had gathered a fierce intensity. As she sat
26809: guiding the tiller under her husband’s eyes, doing just what he told
26810: her, the strife within her seemed like her own effort to escape from
26811: herself. She clung to the thought of Deronda: she persuaded herself
26812: that he would not go away while she was there—he knew that she needed
26813: help. The sense that he was there would save her from acting out the
26814: evil within. And yet quick, quick, came images, plans of evil that
26815: would come again and seize her in the night, like furies preparing the
26816: deed that they would straightway avenge.
26817: 
26818: They were taken out of the port and carried eastward by a gentle
26819: breeze. Some clouds tempered the sunlight, and the hour was always
26820: deepening toward the supreme beauty of evening. Sails larger and
26821: smaller changed their aspect like sensitive things, and made a cheerful
26822: companionship, alternately near and far. The grand city shone more
26823: vaguely, the mountains looked out above it, and there was stillness as
26824: in an island sanctuary. Yet suddenly Gwendolen let her hands fall, and
26825: said in a scarcely audible tone, “God help me!”
26826: 
26827: “What is the matter?” said Grandcourt, not distinguishing the words.
26828: 
26829: “Oh, nothing,” said Gwendolen, rousing herself from her momentary
26830: forgetfulness and resuming the ropes.
26831: 
26832: “Don’t you find this pleasant?” said Grandcourt.
26833: 
26834: “Very.”
26835: 
26836: “You admit now we couldn’t have done anything better?”
26837: 
26838: “No—I see nothing better. I think we shall go on always, like the
26839: Flying Dutchman,” said Gwendolen wildly.
26840: 
26841: Grandcourt gave her one of his narrow examining glances, and then said,
26842: “If you like, we can go to Spezia in the morning, and let them take us
26843: up there.”
26844: 
26845: “No; I shall like nothing better than this.”
26846: 
26847: “Very well: we’ll do the same to-morrow. But we must be turning in
26848: soon. I shall put about.”
26849: 
26850: 
26851: 
26852: 
26853: CHAPTER LV.
26854: 
26855:         “Ritorna a tua scienza
26856:   Che vuol, quanto la cosa e più perfetta
26857:   Più senta il bene, e cosi la doglienza.”
26858:                                          —DANTE.
26859: 
26860: 
26861: When Deronda met Gwendolen and Grandcourt on the staircase, his mind
26862: was seriously preoccupied. He had just been summoned to the second
26863: interview with his mother.
26864: 
26865: In two hours after his parting from her he knew that the Princess
26866: Halm-Eberstein had left the hotel, and so far as the purpose of his
26867: journey to Genoa was concerned, he might himself have set off on his
26868: way to Mainz, to deliver the letter from Joseph Kalonymos, and get
26869: possession of the family chest. But mixed mental conditions, which did
26870: not resolve themselves into definite reasons, hindered him from
26871: departure. Long after the farewell he was kept passive by a weight of
26872: retrospective feeling. He lived again, with the new keenness of emotive
26873: memory, through the exciting scenes which seemed past only in the sense
26874: of preparation for their actual presence in his soul. He allowed
26875: himself in his solitude to sob, with perhaps more than a woman’s
26876: acuteness of compassion, over that woman’s life so near to his, and yet
26877: so remote. He beheld the world changed for him by the certitude of ties
26878: that altered the poise of hopes and fears, and gave him a new sense of
26879: fellowship, as if under cover of the night he had joined the wrong band
26880: of wanderers, and found with the rise of morning that the tents of his
26881: kindred were grouped far off. He had a quivering imaginative sense of
26882: close relation to the grandfather who had been animated by strong
26883: impulses and beloved thoughts, which were now perhaps being roused from
26884: their slumber within himself. And through all this passionate
26885: meditation Mordecai and Mirah were always present, as beings who
26886: clasped hands with him in sympathetic silence.
26887: 
26888: Of such quick, responsive fibre was Deronda made, under that mantle of
26889: self-controlled reserve into which early experience had thrown so much
26890: of his young strength.
26891: 
26892: When the persistent ringing of a bell as a signal reminded him of the
26893: hour he thought of looking into _Bradshaw_, and making the brief
26894: necessary preparations for starting by the next train—thought of it,
26895: but made no movement in consequence. Wishes went to Mainz and what he
26896: was to get possession of there—to London and the beings there who made
26897: the strongest attachments of his life; but there were other wishes that
26898: clung in these moments to Genoa, and they kept him where he was by that
26899: force which urges us to linger over an interview that carries a
26900: presentiment of final farewell or of overshadowing sorrow. Deronda did
26901: not formally say, “I will stay over to-night, because it is Friday, and
26902: I should like to go to the evening service at the synagogue where they
26903: must all have gone; and besides, I may see the Grandcourts again.” But
26904: simply, instead of packing and ringing for his bill, he sat doing
26905: nothing at all, while his mind went to the synagogue and saw faces
26906: there probably little different from those of his grandfather’s time,
26907: and heard the Spanish-Hebrew liturgy which had lasted through the
26908: seasons of wandering generations like a plant with wandering seed, that
26909: gives the far-off lands a kinship to the exile’s home—while, also, his
26910: mind went toward Gwendolen, with anxious remembrance of what had been,
26911: and with a half-admitted impression that it would be hardness in him
26912: willingly to go away at once without making some effort, in spite of
26913: Grandcourt’s probable dislike, to manifest the continuance of his
26914: sympathy with her since their abrupt parting.
26915: 
26916: In this state of mind he deferred departure, ate his dinner without
26917: sense of flavor, rose from it quickly to find the synagogue, and in
26918: passing the porter asked if Mr. and Mrs. Grandcourt were still in the
26919: hotel, and what was the number of their apartment. The porter gave him
26920: the number, but added that they were gone out boating. That information
26921: had somehow power enough over Deronda to divide his thoughts with the
26922: memories wakened among the sparse _talithim_ and keen dark faces of
26923: worshippers whose way of taking awful prayers and invocations with the
26924: easy familiarity which might be called Hebrew dyed Italian, made him
26925: reflect that his grandfather, according to the Princess’s hints of his
26926: character, must have been almost as exceptional a Jew as Mordecai. But
26927: were not men of ardent zeal and far-reaching hope everywhere
26928: exceptional? the men who had the visions which, as Mordecai said, were
26929: the creators and feeders of the world—moulding and feeding the more
26930: passive life which without them would dwindle and shrivel into the
26931: narrow tenacity of insects, unshaken by thoughts beyond the reach of
26932: their antennae. Something of a mournful impatience perhaps added itself
26933: to the solicitude about Gwendolen (a solicitude that had room to grow
26934: in his present release from immediate cares) as an incitement to hasten
26935: from the synagogue and choose to take his evening walk toward the quay,
26936: always a favorite haunt with him, and just now attractive with the
26937: possibility that he might be in time to see the Grandcourts come in
26938: from their boating. In this case, he resolved that he would advance to
26939: greet them deliberately, and ignore any grounds that the husband might
26940: have for wishing him elsewhere.
26941: 
26942: The sun had set behind a bank of cloud, and only a faint yellow light
26943: was giving its farewell kisses to the waves, which were agitated by an
26944: active breeze. Deronda, sauntering slowly within sight of what took
26945: place on the strand, observed the groups there concentrating their
26946: attention on a sailing-boat which was advancing swiftly landward, being
26947: rowed by two men. Amidst the clamorous talk in various languages,
26948: Deronda held it the surer means of getting information not to ask
26949: questions, but to elbow his way to the foreground and be an
26950: unobstructed witness of what was occurring. Telescopes were being used,
26951: and loud statements made that the boat held somebody who had been
26952: drowned. One said it was the _milord_ who had gone out in a sailing
26953: boat; another maintained that the prostrate figure he discerned was
26954: _miladi_; a Frenchman who had no glass would rather say that it was
26955: _milord_ who had probably taken his wife out to drown her, according to
26956: the national practice—a remark which an English skipper immediately
26957: commented on in our native idiom (as nonsense which—had undergone a
26958: mining operation), and further dismissed by the decision that the
26959: reclining figure was a woman. For Deronda, terribly excited by
26960: fluctuating fears, the strokes of the oars as he watched them were
26961: divided by swift visions of events, possible and impossible, which
26962: might have brought about this issue, or this broken-off fragment of an
26963: issue, with a worse half undisclosed—if this woman apparently snatched
26964: from the waters were really Mrs. Grandcourt.
26965: 
26966: But soon there was no longer any doubt: the boat was being pulled to
26967: land, and he saw Gwendolen half raising herself on her hands, by her
26968: own effort, under her heavy covering of tarpaulin and pea-jackets—pale
26969: as one of the sheeted dead, shivering, with wet hair streaming, a wild
26970: amazed consciousness in her eyes, as if she had waked up in a world
26971: where some judgment was impending, and the beings she saw around were
26972: coming to seize her. The first rower who jumped to land was also wet
26973: through, and ran off; the sailors, close about the boat, hindered
26974: Deronda from advancing, and he could only look on while Gwendolen gave
26975: scared glances, and seemed to shrink with terror as she was carefully,
26976: tenderly helped out, and led on by the strong arms of those rough,
26977: bronzed men, her wet clothes clinging about her limbs, and adding to
26978: the impediment of her weakness. Suddenly her wandering eyes fell on
26979: Deronda, standing before her, and immediately, as if she had been
26980: expecting him and looking for him, she tried to stretch out her arms,
26981: which were held back by her supporters, saying, in a muffled voice,
26982: 
26983: “It is come, it is come! He is dead!”
26984: 
26985: “Hush, hush!” said Deronda, in a tone of authority; “quiet yourself.”
26986: Then to the men who were assisting her, “I am a connection of this
26987: lady’s husband. If you will get her on to the _Italia_ as quickly as
26988: possible, I will undertake everything else.”
26989: 
26990: He stayed behind to hear from the remaining boatman that her husband
26991: had gone down irrecoverably, and that his boat was left floating empty.
26992: He and his comrade had heard a cry, had come up in time to see the lady
26993: jump in after her husband, and had got her out fast enough to save her
26994: from much damage.
26995: 
26996: After this, Deronda hastened to the hotel to assure himself that the
26997: best medical help would be provided; and being satisfied on this point,
26998: he telegraphed the event to Sir Hugo, begging him to come forthwith,
26999: and also to Mr. Gascoigne, whose address at the rectory made his
27000: nearest known way of getting the information to Gwendolen’s mother.
27001: Certain words of Gwendolen’s in the past had come back to him with the
27002: effectiveness of an inspiration: in moments of agitated confession she
27003: had spoken of her mother’s presence, as a possible help, if she could
27004: have had it.

27009: CHAPTER LVI.
27010: 
27011:   “The pang, the curse with which they died,
27012:     Had never passed away:
27013:   I could not draw my eyes from theirs,
27014:     Nor lift them up to pray.”
27015:                                   —COLERIDGE.
27016: 
27017: 
27018: Deronda did not take off his clothes that night. Gwendolen, after
27019: insisting on seeing him again before she would consent to be undressed,
27020: had been perfectly quiet, and had only asked him, with a whispering,
27021: repressed eagerness, to promise that he would come to her when she sent
27022: for him in the morning. Still, the possibility that a change might come
27023: over her, the danger of a supervening feverish condition, and the
27024: suspicion that something in the late catastrophe was having an effect
27025: which might betray itself in excited words, acted as a foreboding
27026: within him. He mentioned to her attendant that he should keep himself
27027: ready to be called if there were any alarming change of symptoms,
27028: making it understood by all concerned that he was in communication with
27029: her friends in England, and felt bound meanwhile to take all care on
27030: her behalf—a position which it was the easier for him to assume,
27031: because he was well known to Grandcourt’s valet, the only old servant
27032: who had come on the late voyage.
27033: 
27034: But when fatigue from the strangely various emotion of the day at last
27035: sent Deronda to sleep, he remained undisturbed except by the morning
27036: dreams, which came as a tangled web of yesterday’s events, and finally
27037: waked him, with an image drawn by his pressing anxiety.
27038: 
27039: Still, it was morning, and there had been no summons—an augury which
27040: cheered him while he made his toilet, and reflected that it was too
27041: early to send inquiries. Later, he learned that she had passed a too
27042: wakeful night, but had shown no violent signs of agitation, and was at
27043: last sleeping. He wondered at the force that dwelt in this creature, so
27044: alive to dread; for he had an irresistible impression that even under
27045: the effects of a severe physical shock she was mastering herself with a
27046: determination of concealment. For his own part, he thought that his
27047: sensibilities had been blunted by what he had been going through in the
27048: meeting with his mother: he seemed to himself now to be only fulfilling
27049: claims, and his more passionate sympathy was in abeyance. He had lately
27050: been living so keenly in an experience quite apart from Gwendolen’s
27051: lot, that his present cares for her were like a revisiting of scenes
27052: familiar in the past, and there was not yet a complete revival of the
27053: inward response to them.
27054: 
27055: Meanwhile he employed himself in getting a formal, legally recognized
27056: statement from the fishermen who had rescued Gwendolen. Few details
27057: came to light. The boat in which Grandcourt had gone out had been found
27058: drifting with its sail loose, and had been towed in. The fishermen
27059: thought it likely that he had been knocked overboard by the flapping of
27060: the sail while putting about, and that he had not known how to swim;
27061: but, though they were near, their attention had been first arrested by
27062: a cry which seemed like that of a man in distress, and while they were
27063: hastening with their oars, they heard a shriek from the lady, and saw
27064: her jump in.
27065: 
27066: On re-entering the hotel, Deronda was told that Gwendolen had risen,
27067: and was desiring to see him. He was shown into a room darkened by
27068: blinds and curtains, where she was seated with a white shawl wrapped
27069: round her, looking toward the opening door like one waiting uneasily.
27070: But her long hair was gathered up and coiled carefully, and, through
27071: all, the blue stars in her ears had kept their place: as she started
27072: impulsively to her full height, sheathed in her white shawl, her face
27073: and neck not less white, except for a purple line under her eyes, her
27074: lips a little apart with the peculiar expression of one accused and
27075: helpless, she looked like the unhappy ghost of that Gwendolen Harleth
27076: whom Deronda had seen turning with firm lips and proud self-possession
27077: from her losses at the gaming table. The sight pierced him with pity,
27078: and the effects of all their past relations began to revive within him.
27079: 
27080: “I beseech you to rest—not to stand,” said Deronda, as he approached
27081: her; and she obeyed, falling back into her chair again.
27082: 
27083: “Will you sit down near me?” she said. “I want to speak very low.”
27084: 
27085: She was in a large arm-chair, and he drew a small one near to her side.
27086: The action seemed to touch her peculiarly: turning her pale face full
27087: upon his, which was very near, she said, in the lowest audible tone,
27088: “You know I am a guilty woman?”
27089: 
27090: Deronda himself turned paler as he said, “I know nothing.” He did not
27091: dare to say more.
27092: 
27093: “He is dead.” She uttered this with the same undertoned decision.
27094: 
27095: “Yes,” said Deronda, in a mournful suspense which made him reluctant to
27096: speak.
27097: 
27098: “His face will not be seen above the water again,” said Gwendolen, in a
27099: tone that was not louder, but of a suppressed eagerness, while she held
27100: both her hands clenched.
27101: 
27102: “No.”
27103: 
27104: “Not by any one else—only by me—a dead face—I shall never get away
27105: from it.”
27106: 
27107: It was with an inward voice of desperate self-repression that she spoke
27108: these last words, while she looked away from Deronda toward something
27109: at a distance from her on the floor. She was seeing the whole
27110: event—her own acts included—through an exaggerating medium of
27111: excitement and horror? Was she in a state of delirium into which there
27112: entered a sense of concealment and necessity for self-repression? Such
27113: thoughts glanced through Deronda as a sort of hope. But imagine the
27114: conflict of feeling that kept him silent. She was bent on confession,
27115: and he dreaded hearing her confession. Against his better will he
27116: shrank from the task that was laid on him: he wished, and yet rebuked
27117: the wish as cowardly, that she could bury her secrets in her own bosom.
27118: He was not a priest. He dreaded the weight of this woman’s soul flung
27119: upon his own with imploring dependence. But she spoke again, hurriedly,
27120: looking at him,
27121: 
27122: “You will not say that I ought to tell the world? you will not say that
27123: I ought to be disgraced? I could not do it. I could not bear it. I
27124: cannot have my mother know. Not if I were dead. I could not have her
27125: know. I must tell you; but you will not say that any one else should
27126: know.”
27127: 
27128: “I can say nothing in my ignorance,” said Deronda, mournfully, “except
27129: that I desire to help you.”
27130: 
27131: “I told you from the beginning—as soon as I could—I told you I was
27132: afraid of myself.” There was a piteous pleading in the low murmur in
27133: which Deronda turned his ear only. Her face afflicted him too much. “I
27134: felt a hatred in me that was always working like an evil
27135: spirit—contriving things. Everything I could do to free myself came
27136: into my mind; and it got worse—all things got worse. That is why I
27137: asked you to come to me in town. I thought then I would tell you the
27138: worst about myself. I tried. But I could not tell everything. And _he_
27139: came in.”
27140: 
27141: She paused, while a shudder passed through her; but soon went on.
27142: 
27143: “I will tell you everything now. Do you think a woman who cried, and
27144: prayed, and struggled to be saved from herself, could be a murderess?”
27145: 
27146: “Great God!” said Deronda, in a deep, shaken voice, “don’t torture me
27147: needlessly. You have not murdered him. You threw yourself into the
27148: water with the impulse to save him. Tell me the rest afterward. This
27149: death was an accident that you could not have hindered.”
27150: 
27151: “Don’t be impatient with me.” The tremor, the childlike beseeching in
27152: these words compelled Deronda to turn his head and look at her face.
27153: The poor quivering lips went on. “You said—you used to say—you felt
27154: more for those who had done something wicked and were miserable; you
27155: said they might get better—they might be scourged into something
27156: better. If you had not spoken in that way, everything would have been
27157: worse. I _did_ remember all you said to me. It came to me always. It
27158: came to me at the very last—that was the reason why I—But now, if you
27159: cannot bear with me when I tell you everything—if you turn away from
27160: me and forsake me, what shall I do? Am I worse than I was when you
27161: found me and wanted to make me better? All the wrong I have done was in
27162: me then—and more—and more—if you had not come and been patient with
27163: me. And now—will you forsake me?”
27164: 
27165: Her hands, which had been so tightly clenched some minutes before, were
27166: now helplessly relaxed and trembling on the arm of her chair. Her
27167: quivering lips remained parted as she ceased speaking. Deronda could
27168: not answer; he was obliged to look away. He took one of her hands, and
27169: clasped it as if they were going to walk together like two children: it
27170: was the only way in which he could answer, “I will not forsake you.”
27171: And all the while he felt as if he were putting his name to a blank
27172: paper which might be filled up terribly. Their attitude, his adverted
27173: face with its expression of a suffering which he was solemnly resolved
27174: to undergo, might have told half the truth of the situation to a
27175: beholder who had suddenly entered.
27176: 
27177: That grasp was an entirely new experience to Gwendolen: she had never
27178: before had from any man a sign of tenderness which her own being had
27179: needed, and she interpreted its powerful effect on her into a promise
27180: of inexhaustible patience and constancy. The stream of renewed strength
27181: made it possible for her to go on as she had begun—with that fitful,
27182: wandering confession where the sameness of experience seems to nullify
27183: the sense of time or of order in events. She began again in a
27184: fragmentary way,
27185: 
27186: “All sorts of contrivances in my mind—but all so difficult. And I
27187: fought against them—I was terrified at them—I saw his dead
27188: face”—here her voice sank almost to a whisper close to Deronda’s
27189: ear—“ever so long ago I saw it and I wished him to be dead. And yet it
27190: terrified me. I was like two creatures. I could not speak—I wanted to
27191: kill—it was as strong as thirst—and then directly—I felt beforehand
27192: I had done something dreadful, unalterable—that would make me like an
27193: evil spirit. And it came—it came.”
27194: 
27195: She was silent a moment or two, as if her memory had lost itself in a
27196: web where each mesh drew all the rest.
27197: 
27198: “It had all been in my mind when I first spoke to you—when we were at
27199: the Abbey. I had done something then. I could not tell you that. It was
27200: the only thing I did toward carrying out my thoughts. They went about
27201: over everything; but they all remained like dreadful dreams—all but
27202: one. I did one act—and I never undid it—it is there still—as long
27203: ago as when we were at Ryelands. There it was—something my fingers
27204: longed for among the beautiful toys in the cabinet in my boudoir—small
27205: and sharp like a long willow leaf in a silver sheath. I locked it in
27206: the drawer of my dressing-case. I was continually haunted with it and
27207: how I should use it. I fancied myself putting it under my pillow. But I
27208: never did. I never looked at it again. I dared not unlock the drawer:
27209: it had a key all to itself; and not long ago, when we were in the
27210: yacht, I dropped the key into the deep water. It was my wish to drop it
27211: and deliver myself. After that I began to think how I could open the
27212: drawer without the key: and when I found we were to stay at Genoa, it
27213: came into my mind that I could get it opened privately at the hotel.
27214: But then, when we were going up the stairs, I met you; and I thought I
27215: should talk to you alone and tell you this—everything I could not tell
27216: you in town; and then I was forced to go out in the boat.”
27217: 
27218: A sob had for the first time risen with the last words, and she sank
27219: back in her chair. The memory of that acute disappointment seemed for
27220: the moment to efface what had come since. Deronda did not look at her,
27221: but he said, insistently,
27222: 
27223: “And it has all remained in your imagination. It has gone on only in
27224: your thought. To the last the evil temptation has been resisted?”
27225: 
27226: There was silence. The tears had rolled down her cheeks. She pressed
27227: her handkerchief against them and sat upright. She was summoning her
27228: resolution; and again, leaning a little toward Deronda’s ear, she began
27229: in a whisper,
27230: 
27231: “No, no; I will tell you everything as God knows it. I will tell you no
27232: falsehood; I will tell you the exact truth. What should I do else? I
27233: used to think I could never be wicked. I thought of wicked people as if
27234: they were a long way off me. Since then I have been wicked. I have felt
27235: wicked. And everything has been a punishment to me—all the things I
27236: used to wish for—it is as if they had been made red-hot. The very
27237: daylight has often been a punishment to me. Because—you know—I ought
27238: not to have married. That was the beginning of it. I wronged some one
27239: else. I broke my promise. I meant to get pleasure for myself, and it
27240: all turned to misery. I wanted to make my gain out of another’s
27241: loss—you remember?—it was like roulette—and the money burned into
27242: me. And I could not complain. It was as if I had prayed that another
27243: should lose and I should win. And I had won, I knew it all—I knew I
27244: was guilty. When we were on the sea, and I lay awake at night in the
27245: cabin, I sometimes felt that everything I had done lay open without
27246: excuse—nothing was hidden—how could anything be known to me only?—it
27247: was not my own knowledge, it was God’s that had entered into me, and
27248: even the stillness—everything held a punishment for me—everything but
27249: you. I always thought that you would not want me to be punished—you
27250: would have tried and helped me to be better. And only thinking of that
27251: helped me. You will not change—you will not want to punish me now?”
27252: 
27253: Again a sob had risen.
27254: 
27255: “God forbid!” groaned Deronda. But he sat motionless.
27256: 
27257: This long wandering with the conscious-stricken one over her past was
27258: difficult to bear, but he dared not again urge her with a question. He
27259: must let her mind follow its own need. She unconsciously left intervals
27260: in her retrospect, not clearly distinguishing between what she said and
27261: what she had only an inward vision of. Her next words came after such
27262: an interval.
27263: 
27264: “That all made it so hard when I was forced to go in the boat. Because
27265: when I saw you it was an unexpected joy, and I thought I could tell you
27266: everything—about the locked-up drawer and what I had not told you
27267: before. And if I had told you, and knew it was in your mind, it would
27268: have less power over me. I hoped and trusted in that. For after all my
27269: struggles and my crying, the hatred and rage, the temptation that
27270: frightened me, the longing, the thirst for what I dreaded, always came
27271: back. And that disappointment—when I was quite shut out from speaking
27272: to you, and was driven to go in the boat—brought all the evil back, as
27273: if I had been locked in a prison with it and no escape. Oh, it seems so
27274: long ago now since I stepped into that boat! I could have given up
27275: everything in that moment, to have the forked lightning for a weapon to
27276: strike him dead.”
27277: 
27278: Some of the compressed fierceness that she was recalling seemed to find
27279: its way into her undertoned utterance. After a little silence she said,
27280: with agitated hurry,
27281: 
27282: “If he were here again, what should I do? I cannot wish him here—and
27283: yet I cannot bear his dead face. I was a coward. I ought to have borne
27284: contempt. I ought to have gone away—gone and wandered like a beggar
27285: rather than stay to feel like a fiend. But turn where I would there
27286: was something I could not bear. Sometimes I thought he would kill _me_
27287: if I resisted his will. But now—his dead face is there, and I cannot
27288: bear it.”
27289: 
27290: Suddenly loosing Deronda’s hand, she started up, stretching her arms to
27291: their full length upward, and said with a sort of moan,
27292: 
27293: “I have been a cruel woman! What can _I_ do but cry for help? _I_ am
27294: sinking. Die—die—you are forsaken—go down, go down into darkness.
27295: Forsaken—no pity—_I_ shall be forsaken.”
27296: 
27297: She sank in her chair again and broke into sobs. Even Deronda had no
27298: place in her consciousness at that moment. He was completely unmanned.
27299: Instead of finding, as he had imagined, that his late experience had
27300: dulled his susceptibility to fresh emotion, it seemed that the lot of
27301: this young creature, whose swift travel from her bright rash girlhood
27302: into this agony of remorse he had had to behold in helplessness,
27303: pierced him the deeper because it came close upon another sad
27304: revelation of spiritual conflict: he was in one of those moments when
27305: the very anguish of passionate pity makes us ready to choose that we
27306: will know pleasure no more, and live only for the stricken and
27307: afflicted. He had risen from his seat while he watched that terrible
27308: outburst—which seemed the more awful to him because, even in this
27309: supreme agitation, she kept the suppressed voice of one who confesses
27310: in secret. At last he felt impelled to turn his back toward her and
27311: walk to a distance.
27312: 
27313: But presently there was stillness. Her mind had opened to the sense
27314: that he had gone away from her. When Deronda turned round to approach
27315: her again, he saw her face bent toward him, her eyes dilated, her lips
27316: parted. She was an image of timid forlorn beseeching—too timid to
27317: entreat in words while he kept himself aloof from her. Was she forsaken
27318: by him—now—already? But his eyes met hers sorrowfully—met hers for
27319: the first time fully since she had said, “You know I am a guilty
27320: woman,” and that full glance in its intense mournfulness seemed to say,
27321: “I know it, but I shall all the less forsake you.” He sat down by her
27322: side again in the same attitude—without turning his face toward her
27323: and without again taking her hand.
27324: 
27325: Once more Gwendolen was pierced, as she had been by his face of sorrow
27326: at the Abbey, with a compunction less egoistic than that which urged
27327: her to confess, and she said, in a tone of loving regret,
27328: 
27329: “I make you very unhappy.”
27330: 
27331: Deronda gave an indistinct “Oh,” just shrinking together and changing
27332: his attitude a little. Then he had gathered resolution enough to say
27333: clearly, “There is no question of being happy or unhappy. What I most
27334: desire at this moment is what will most help you. Tell me all you feel
27335: it a relief to tell.”
27336: 
27337: Devoted as these words were, they widened his spiritual distance from
27338: her, and she felt it more difficult to speak: she had a vague need of
27339: getting nearer to that compassion which seemed to be regarding her from
27340: a halo of superiority, and the need turned into an impulse to humble
27341: herself more. She was ready to throw herself on her knees before him;
27342: but no—her wonderfully mixed consciousness held checks on that
27343: impulse, and she was kept silent and motionless by the pressure of
27344: opposing needs. Her stillness made Deronda at last say,
27345: 
27346: “Perhaps you are too weary. Shall I go away, and come again whenever
27347: you wish it?”
27348: 
27349: “No, no,” said Gwendolen—the dread of his leaving her bringing back
27350: her power of speech. She went on with her low-toned eagerness, “I want
27351: to tell you what it was that came over me in that boat. I was full of
27352: rage at being obliged to go—full of rage—and I could do nothing but
27353: sit there like a galley slave. And then we got away—out of the
27354: port—into the deep—and everything was still—and we never looked at
27355: each other, only he spoke to order me—and the very light about me
27356: seemed to hold me a prisoner and force me to sit as I did. It came over
27357: me that when I was a child I used to fancy sailing away into a world
27358: where people were not forced to live with any one they did not like—I
27359: did not like my father-in-law to come home. And now, I thought, just
27360: the opposite had come to me. I had stepped into a boat, and my life was
27361: a sailing and sailing away—gliding on and no help—always into
27362: solitude with _him_, away from deliverance. And because I felt more
27363: helpless than ever, my thoughts went out over worse things—I longed
27364: for worse things—I had cruel wishes—I fancied impossible ways of—I
27365: did not want to die myself; I was afraid of our being drowned together.
27366: If it had been any use I should have prayed—I should have prayed that
27367: something might befall him. I should have prayed that he might sink out
27368: of my sight and leave me alone. I knew no way of killing him there, but
27369: I did, I did kill him in my thoughts.”
27370: 
27371: She sank into silence for a minute, submerged by the weight of memory
27372: which no words could represent.
27373: 
27374: “But yet, all the while I felt that I was getting more wicked. And what
27375: had been with me so much, came to me just then—what you once
27376: said—about dreading to increase my wrong-doing and my remorse—I
27377: should hope for nothing then. It was all like a writing of fire within
27378: me. Getting wicked was misery—being shut out forever from knowing what
27379: you—what better lives were. That had always been coming back to me
27380: then—but yet with a despair—a feeling that it was no use—evil wishes
27381: were too strong. I remember then letting go the tiller and saying ‘God
27382: help me!’ But then I was forced to take it again and go on; and the
27383: evil longings, the evil prayers came again and blotted everything else
27384: dim, till, in the midst of them—I don’t know how it was—he was
27385: turning the sail—there was a gust—he was struck—I know nothing—I
27386: only know that I saw my wish outside me.”
27387: 
27388: She began to speak more hurriedly, and in more of a whisper.
27389: 
27390: “I saw him sink, and my heart gave a leap as if it were going out of
27391: me. I think I did not move. I kept my hands tight. It was long enough
27392: for me to be glad, and yet to think it was no use—he would come up
27393: again. And he _was_ come—farther off—the boat had moved. It was all
27394: like lightning. ‘The rope!’ he called out in a voice—not his own—I
27395: hear it now—and I stooped for the rope—I felt I must—I felt sure he
27396: could swim, and he would come back whether or not, and I dreaded him.
27397: That was in my mind—he would come back. But he was gone down again,
27398: and I had the rope in my hand—no, there he was again—his face above
27399: the water—and he cried again—and I held my hand, and my heart said,
27400: ‘Die!’—and he sank; and I felt ‘It is done—I am wicked, I am
27401: lost!—and I had the rope in my hand—I don’t know what I thought—I
27402: was leaping away from myself—I would have saved him then. I was
27403: leaping from my crime, and there it was—close to me as I fell—there
27404: was the dead face—dead, dead. It can never be altered. That was what
27405: happened. That was what I did. You know it all. It can never be
27406: altered.”
27407: 
27408: She sank back in her chair, exhausted with the agitation of memory and
27409: speech. Deronda felt the burden on his spirit less heavy than the
27410: foregoing dread. The word “guilty” had held a possibility of
27411: interpretations worse than the fact; and Gwendolen’s confession, for
27412: the very reason that her conscience made her dwell on the determining
27413: power of her evil thoughts, convinced him the more that there had been
27414: throughout a counterbalancing struggle of her better will. It seemed
27415: almost certain that her murderous thought had had no outward
27416: effect—that, quite apart from it, the death was inevitable. Still, a
27417: question as to the outward effectiveness of a criminal desire dominant
27418: enough to impel even a momentary act, cannot alter our judgment of the
27419: desire; and Deronda shrank from putting that question forward in the
27420: first instance. He held it likely that Gwendolen’s remorse aggravated
27421: her inward guilt, and that she gave the character of decisive action to
27422: what had been an inappreciably instantaneous glance of desire. But her
27423: remorse was the precious sign of a recoverable nature; it was the
27424: culmination of that self-disapproval which had been the awakening of a
27425: new life within her; it marked her off from the criminals whose only
27426: regret is failure in securing their evil wish. Deronda could not utter
27427: one word to diminish that sacred aversion to her worst self—that
27428: thorn-pressure which must come with the crowning of the sorrowful
27429: better, suffering because of the worse. All this mingled thought and
27430: feeling kept him silent; speech was too momentous to be ventured on
27431: rashly. There were no words of comfort that did not carry some
27432: sacrilege. If he had opened his lips to speak, he could only have
27433: echoed, “It can never be altered—it remains unaltered, to alter other
27434: things.” But he was silent and motionless—he did not know how
27435: long—before he turned to look at her, and saw her sunk back with
27436: closed eyes, like a lost, weary, storm-beaten white doe, unable to rise
27437: and pursue its unguided way. He rose and stood before her. The movement
27438: touched her consciousness, and she opened her eyes with a slight
27439: quivering that seemed like fear.
27440: 
27441: “You must rest now. Try to rest: try to sleep. And may I see you again
27442: this evening—to-morrow—when you have had some rest? Let us say no
27443: more now.”
27444: 
27445: The tears came, and she could not answer except by a slight movement of
27446: the head. Deronda rang for attendance, spoke urgently of the necessity
27447: that she should be got to rest, and then left her.
27448: 
27449: 
27450: 
27451: 
27452: CHAPTER LVII.
27453: 
27454:     “The unripe grape, the ripe, and the dried. All things are changes,
27455:     not into nothing, but into that which is not at present.”—MARCUS
27456:     AURELIUS.
27457: 
27458:     Deeds are the pulse of Time, his beating life,
27459:     And righteous or unrighteous, being done,
27460:     Must throb in after-throbs till Time itself
27461:     Be laid in darkness, and the universe
27462:     Quiver and breathe upon no mirror more.
27463: 
27464: 
27465: In the evening she sent for him again. It was already near the hour at
27466: which she had been brought in from the sea the evening before, and the
27467: light was subdued enough with blinds drawn up and windows open. She was
27468: seated gazing fixedly on the sea, resting her cheek on her hand,
27469: looking less shattered than when he had left her, but with a deep
27470: melancholy in her expression which as Deronda approached her passed
27471: into an anxious timidity. She did not put out her hand, but said, “How
27472: long ago it is!” Then, “Will you sit near me again a little while?”
27473: 
27474: He placed himself by her side as he had done before, and seeing that
27475: she turned to him with that indefinable expression which implies a wish
27476: to say something, he waited for her to speak. But again she looked
27477: toward the window silently, and again turned with the same expression,
27478: which yet did not issue in speech. There was some fear hindering her,
27479: and Deronda, wishing to relieve her timidity, averted his face.
27480: Presently he heard her cry imploringly,
27481: 
27482: “You will not say that any one else should know?”
27483: 
27484: “Most decidedly not,” said Deronda. “There is no action that ought to
27485: be taken in consequence. There is no injury that could be righted in
27486: that way. There is no retribution that any mortal could apportion
27487: justly.”
27488: 
27489: She was so still during a pause that she seemed to be holding her
27490: breath before she said,
27491: 
27492: “But if I had not had that murderous will—that moment—if I had thrown
27493: the rope on the instant—perhaps it would have hindered death?”
27494: 
27495: “No—I think not,” said Deronda, slowly. “If it were true that he could
27496: swim, he must have been seized with cramp. With your quickest, utmost
27497: effort, it seems impossible that you could have done anything to save
27498: him. That momentary murderous will cannot, I think, have altered the
27499: course of events. Its effect is confined to the motives in your own
27500: breast. Within ourselves our evil will is momentous, and sooner or
27501: later it works its way outside us—it may be in the vitiation that
27502: breeds evil acts, but also it may be in the self-abhorrence that stings
27503: us into better striving.”
27504: 
27505: “I am saved from robbing others—there are others—they will have
27506: everything—they will have what they ought to have. I knew that some
27507: time before I left town. You do not suspect me of wrong desires about
27508: those things?” She spoke hesitatingly.
27509: 
27510: “I had not thought of them,” said Deronda; “I was thinking too much of
27511: the other things.”
27512: 
27513: “Perhaps you don’t quite know the beginning of it all,” said Gwendolen,
27514: slowly, as if she were overcoming her reluctance. “There was some one
27515: else he ought to have married. And I knew it, and I told her I would
27516: not hinder it. And I went away—that was when you first saw me. But
27517: then we became poor all at once, and I was very miserable, and I was
27518: tempted. I thought, ‘I shall do as I like and make everything right.’ I
27519: persuaded myself. And it was all different. It was all dreadful. Then
27520: came hatred and wicked thoughts. That was how it all came. I told you I
27521: was afraid of myself. And I did what you told me—I did try to make my
27522: fear a safeguard. I thought of what would be if I—I felt what would
27523: come—how I should dread the morning—wishing it would be always
27524: night—and yet in the darkness always seeing something—seeing death.
27525: If you did not know how miserable I was, you might—but now it has all
27526: been no use. I can care for nothing but saving the rest from
27527: knowing—poor mamma, who has never been happy.”
27528: 
27529: There was silence again before she said with a repressed sob—“You
27530: cannot bear to look at me any more. You think I am too wicked. You do
27531: not believe that I can become any better—worth anything—worthy
27532: enough—I shall always be too wicked to—” The voice broke off helpless.
27533: 
27534: Deronda’s heart was pierced. He turned his eyes on her poor beseeching
27535: face and said, “I believe that you may become worthier than you have
27536: ever yet been—worthy to lead a life that may be a blessing. No evil
27537: dooms us hopelessly except the evil we love, and desire to continue in,
27538: and make no effort to escape from. You _have_ made efforts—you will go
27539: on making them.”
27540: 
27541: “But you were the beginning of them. You must not forsake me,” said
27542: Gwendolen, leaning with her clasped hands on the arm of her chair and
27543: looking at him, while her face bore piteous traces of the
27544: life-experience concentrated in the twenty-four hours—that new
27545: terrible life lying on the other side of the deed which fulfills a
27546: criminal desire. “I will bear any penance. I will lead any life you
27547: tell me. But you must not forsake me. You must be near. If you had been
27548: near me—if I could have said everything to you, I should have been
27549: different. You will not forsake me?”
27550: 
27551: “It could never be my impulse to forsake you,” said Deronda promptly,
27552: with that voice which, like his eyes, had the unintentional effect of
27553: making his ready sympathy seem more personal and special than it really
27554: was. And in that moment he was not himself quite free from a foreboding
27555: of some such self-committing effect. His strong feeling for this
27556: stricken creature could not hinder rushing images of future difficulty.
27557: He continued to meet her appealing eyes as he spoke, but it was with
27558: the painful consciousness that to her ear his words might carry a
27559: promise which one day would seem unfulfilled: he was making an
27560: indefinite promise to an indefinite hope. Anxieties, both immediate and
27561: distant, crowded on his thought, and it was under their influence that,
27562: after a moment’s silence, he said,
27563: 
27564: “I expect Sir Hugo Mallinger to arrive by to-morrow night at least; and
27565: I am not without hope that Mrs. Davilow may shortly follow him. Her
27566: presence will be the greatest comfort to you—it will give you a motive
27567: to save her from unnecessary pain?”
27568: 
27569: “Yes, yes—I will try. And you will not go away?”
27570: 
27571: “Not till after Sir Hugo has come.”
27572: 
27573: “But we shall all go to England?”
27574: 
27575: “As soon as possible,” said Deronda, not wishing to enter into
27576: particulars.
27577: 
27578: Gwendolen looked toward the window again with an expression which
27579: seemed like a gradual awakening to new thoughts. The twilight was
27580: perceptibly deepening, but Deronda could see a movement in her eyes and
27581: hands such as accompanies a return of perception in one who has been
27582: stunned.
27583: 
27584: “You will always be with Sir Hugo now!” she said presently, looking at
27585: him. “You will always live at the Abbey—or else at Diplow?”
27586: 
27587: “I am quite uncertain where I shall live,” said Deronda, coloring.
27588: 
27589: She was warned by his changed color that she had spoken too rashly, and
27590: fell silent. After a little while she began, again looking away,
27591: 
27592: “It is impossible to think how my life will go on. I think now it would
27593: be better for me to be poor and obliged to work.”
27594: 
27595: “New promptings will come as the days pass. When you are among your
27596: friends again, you will discern new duties,” said Deronda. “Make it a
27597: task now to get as well and calm—as much like yourself as you can,
27598: before—” He hesitated.
27599: 
27600: “Before my mother comes,” said Gwendolen. “Ah! I must be changed. I
27601: have not looked at myself. Should you have known me,” she added,
27602: turning toward him, “if you had met me now?—should you have known me
27603: for the one you saw at Leubronn?”
27604: 
27605: “Yes, I should have known you,” said Deronda, mournfully. “The outside
27606: change is not great. I should have seen at once that it was you, and
27607: that you had gone through some great sorrow.”
27608: 
27609: “Don’t wish now that you had never seen me; don’t wish that,” said
27610: Gwendolen, imploringly, while the tears gathered.
27611: 
27612: “I should despise myself for wishing it,” said Deronda. “How could I
27613: know what I was wishing? We must find our duties in what comes to us,
27614: not in what we imagine might have been. If I took to foolish wishing of
27615: that sort, I should wish—not that I had never seen you, but that I had
27616: been able to save you from this.”
27617: 
27618: “You have saved me from worse,” said Gwendolen, in a sobbing voice. “I
27619: should have been worse if it had not been for you. If you had not been
27620: good, I should have been more wicked than I am.”
27621: 
27622: “It will be better for me to go now,” said Deronda, worn in spirit by
27623: the perpetual strain of this scene. “Remember what we said of your
27624: task—to get well and calm before other friends come.”
27625: 
27626: He rose as he spoke, and she gave him her hand submissively. But when
27627: he had left her she sank on her knees, in hysterical crying. The
27628: distance between them was too great. She was a banished soul—beholding
27629: a possible life which she had sinned herself away from.
27630: 
27631: She was found in this way, crushed on the floor. Such grief seemed
27632: natural in a poor lady whose husband had been drowned in her presence.

27640: CHAPTER LVIII.

27642: 
27643:   “Much adoe there was, God wot;
27644:   He wold love and she wold not.”
27645:                    —NICHOLAS BRETON.
27646: 
27647: 
27648: Extension, we know, is a very imperfect measure of things; and the
27649: length of the sun’s journeying can no more tell us how life has
27650: advanced than the acreage of a field can tell us what growths may be
27651: active within it. A man may go south, and, stumbling over a bone, may
27652: meditate upon it till he has found a new starting-point for anatomy; or
27653: eastward, and discover a new key to language telling a new story of
27654: races; or he may head an expedition that opens new continental
27655: pathways, get himself maimed in body, and go through a whole heroic
27656: poem of resolve and endurance; and at the end of a few months he may
27657: come back to find his neighbors grumbling at the same parish grievance
27658: as before, or to see the same elderly gentleman treading the pavement
27659: in discourse with himself, shaking his head after the same percussive
27660: butcher’s boy, and pausing at the same shop-window to look at the same
27661: prints. If the swiftest thinking has about the pace of a greyhound, the
27662: slowest must be supposed to move, like the limpet, by an apparent
27663: sticking, which after a good while is discerned to be a slight
27664: progression. Such differences are manifest in the variable intensity
27665: which we call human experience, from the revolutionary rush of change
27666: which makes a new inner and outer life, to that quiet recurrence of the
27667: familiar, which has no other epochs than those of hunger and the
27668: heavens.
27669: 
27670: Something of this contrast was seen in the year’s experience which had
27671: turned the brilliant, self-confident Gwendolen Harleth of the Archery
27672: Meeting into the crushed penitent impelled to confess her unworthiness
27673: where it would have been her happiness to be held worthy; while it had
27674: left her family in Pennicote without deeper change than that of some
27675: outward habits, and some adjustment of prospects and intentions to
27676: reduced income, fewer visits, and fainter compliments. The rectory was
27677: as pleasant a home as before: and the red and pink peonies on the lawn,
27678: the rows of hollyhocks by the hedges, had bloomed as well this year as
27679: last: the rector maintained his cheerful confidence in the good will of
27680: patrons and his resolution to deserve it by diligence in the
27681: fulfillment of his duties, whether patrons were likely to hear of it or
27682: not; doing nothing solely with an eye to promotion except, perhaps, the
27683: writing of two ecclesiastical articles, which having no signature, were
27684: attributed to some one else, except by the patrons who had a special
27685: copy sent them, and these certainly knew the author but did not read
27686: the articles. The rector, however, chewed no poisonous cud of suspicion
27687: on this point: he made marginal notes on his own copies to render them
27688: a more interesting loan, and was gratified that the Archdeacon and
27689: other authorities had nothing to say against the general tenor of his
27690: argument. Peaceful authorship!—living in the air of the fields and
27691: downs, and not in the thrice-breathed breath of criticism—bringing no
27692: Dantesque leanness; rather, assisting nutrition by complacency, and
27693: perhaps giving a more suffusive sense of achievement than the
27694: production of a whole _Divina Commedia_. Then there was the father’s
27695: recovered delight in his favorite son, which was a happiness
27696: outweighing the loss of eighteen hundred a year. Of whatever nature
27697: might be the hidden change wrought in Rex by the disappointment of his
27698: first love, it was apparently quite secondary to that evidence of more
27699: serious ambition which dated from the family misfortune; indeed, Mr.
27700: Gascoigne was inclined to regard the little affair which had caused him
27701: so much anxiety the year before as an evaporation of superfluous
27702: moisture, a kind of finish to the baking process which the human dough
27703: demands. Rex had lately come down for a summer visit to the rectory,
27704: bringing Anna home, and while he showed nearly the old liveliness with
27705: his brothers and sisters, he continued in his holiday the habits of the
27706: eager student, rising early in the morning and shutting himself up
27707: early in the evenings to carry on a fixed course of study.
27708: 
27709: “You don’t repent the choice of the law as a profession, Rex?” said his
27710: father.
27711: 
27712: “There is no profession I would choose before it,” said Rex. “I should
27713: like to end my life as a first-rate judge, and help to draw up a code.
27714: I reverse the famous dictum. I should say, ‘Give me something to do
27715: with making the laws, and let who will make the songs.’”
27716: 
27717: “You will have to stow in an immense amount of rubbish, I
27718: suppose—that’s the worst of it,” said the rector.
27719: 
27720: “I don’t see that law-rubbish is worse than any other sort. It is not
27721: so bad as the rubbishy literature that people choke their minds with.
27722: It doesn’t make one so dull. Our wittiest men have often been lawyers.
27723: Any orderly way of looking at things as cases and evidence seems to me
27724: better than a perpetual wash of odds and ends bearing on nothing in
27725: particular. And then, from a higher point of view, the foundations and
27726: the growth of law make the most interesting aspects of philosophy and
27727: history. Of course there will be a good deal that is troublesome,
27728: drudging, perhaps exasperating. But the great prizes in life can’t be
27729: won easily—I see that.”
27730: 
27731: “Well, my boy, the best augury of a man’s success in his profession is
27732: that he thinks it the finest in the world. But I fancy it so with most
27733: work when a man goes into it with a will. Brewitt, the blacksmith, said
27734: to me the other day that his ’prentice had no mind to his trade; ‘and
27735: yet, sir,’ said Brewitt, ‘what would a young fellow have if he doesn’t
27736: like the blacksmithing?”
27737: 
27738: The rector cherished a fatherly delight, which he allowed to escape him
27739: only in moderation. Warham, who had gone to India, he had easily borne
27740: parting with, but Rex was that romance of later life which a man
27741: sometimes finds in a son whom he recognizes as superior to himself,
27742: picturing a future eminence for him according to a variety of famous
27743: examples. It was only to his wife that he said with decision: “Rex will
27744: be a distinguished man, Nancy, I am sure of it—as sure as Paley’s
27745: father was about his son.”
27746: 
27747: “Was Paley an old bachelor?” said Mrs. Gascoigne.
27748: 
27749: “That is hardly to the point, my dear,” said the rector, who did not
27750: remember that irrelevant detail. And Mrs. Gascoigne felt that she had
27751: spoken rather weakly.
27752: 
27753: This quiet trotting of time at the rectory was shared by the group who
27754: had exchanged the faded dignity of Offendene for the low white house
27755: not a mile off, well enclosed with evergreens, and known to the
27756: villagers, as “Jodson’s.” Mrs. Davilow’s delicate face showed only a
27757: slight deepening of its mild melancholy, her hair only a few more
27758: silver lines, in consequence of the last year’s trials; the four girls
27759: had bloomed out a little from being less in the shade; and the good
27760: Jocosa preserved her serviceable neutrality toward the pleasures and
27761: glories of the world as things made for those who were not “in a
27762: situation.”
27763: 
27764: The low narrow drawing-room, enlarged by two quaint projecting windows,
27765: with lattices wide open on a July afternoon to the scent of monthly
27766: roses, the faint murmurs of the garden, and the occasional rare sound
27767: of hoofs and wheels seeming to clarify the succeeding silence, made
27768: rather a crowded, lively scene, Rex and Anna being added to the usual
27769: group of six. Anna, always a favorite with her younger cousins, had
27770: much to tell of her new experience, and the acquaintances she had made
27771: in London, and when on her first visit she came alone, many questions
27772: were asked her about Gwendolen’s house in Grosvenor Square, what
27773: Gwendolen herself had said, and what any one else had said about
27774: Gwendolen. Had Anna been to see Gwendolen after she had known about the
27775: yacht? No:—an answer which left speculation free concerning everything
27776: connected with that interesting unknown vessel beyond the fact that
27777: Gwendolen had written just before she set out to say that Mr.
27778: Grandcourt and she were going yachting on the Mediterranean, and again
27779: from Marseilles to say that she was sure to like the yachting, the
27780: cabins were very elegant, and she would probably not send another
27781: letter till she had written quite a long diary filled with _dittos_.
27782: Also, this movement of Mr. and Mrs. Grandcourt had been mentioned in
27783: “the newspaper;” so that altogether this new phase of Gwendolen’s
27784: exalted life made a striking part of the sisters’ romance, the
27785: book-devouring Isabel throwing in a corsair or two to make an adventure
27786: that might end well.
27787: 
27788: But when Rex was present, the girls, according to instructions, never
27789: started this fascinating topic, and to-day there had only been animated
27790: descriptions of the Meyricks and their extraordinary Jewish friends,
27791: which caused some astonished questioning from minds to which the idea
27792: of live Jews, out of a book, suggested a difference deep enough to be
27793: almost zoological, as of a strange race in Pliny’s Natural History that
27794: might sleep under the shade of its own ears. Bertha could not imagine
27795: what Jews believed now; and she had a dim idea that they rejected the
27796: Old Testament since it proved the New; Miss Merry thought that Mirah
27797: and her brother could “never have been properly argued with,” and the
27798: amiable Alice did not mind what the Jews believed, she was sure she
27799: “couldn’t bear them.” Mrs. Davilow corrected her by saying that the
27800: great Jewish families who were in society were quite what they ought to
27801: be both in London and Paris, but admitted that the commoner unconverted
27802: Jews were objectionable; and Isabel asked whether Mirah talked just as
27803: they did, or whether you might be with her and not find out that she
27804: was a Jewess.
27805: 
27806: Rex, who had no partisanship with the Israelites, having made a
27807: troublesome acquaintance with the minutiae of their ancient history in
27808: the form of “cram,” was amusing himself by playfully exaggerating the
27809: notion of each speaker, while Anna begged them all to understand that
27810: he was only joking, when the laughter was interrupted by the bringing
27811: in of a letter for Mrs. Davilow. A messenger had run with it in great
27812: haste from the rectory. It enclosed a telegram, and as Mrs. Davilow
27813: read and re-read it in silence and agitation, all eyes were turned on
27814: her with anxiety, but no one dared to speak. Looking up at last and
27815: seeing the young faces “painted with fear,” she remembered that they
27816: might be imagining something worse than the truth, something like her
27817: own first dread which made her unable to understand what was written,
27818: and she said, with a sob which was half relief,
27819: 
27820: “My dears, Mr. Grandcourt—” She paused an instant, and then began
27821: again, “Mr. Grandcourt is drowned.”
27822: 
27823: Rex started up as if a missile had been suddenly thrown into the room.
27824: He could not help himself, and Anna’s first look was at him. But then,
27825: gathering some self-command while Mrs. Davilow was reading what the
27826: rector had written on the enclosing paper, he said,
27827: 
27828: “Can I do anything, aunt? Can I carry any word to my father from you?”
27829: 
27830: “Yes, dear. Tell him I will be ready—he is very good. He says he will
27831: go with me to Genoa—he will be here at half-past six. Jocosa and
27832: Alice, help me to get ready. She is safe—Gwendolen is safe—but she
27833: must be ill. I am sure she must be very ill. Rex, dear—Rex and
27834: Anna—go and and tell your father I will be quite ready. I would not
27835: for the world lose another night. And bless him for being ready so
27836: soon. I can travel night and day till we get there.”
27837: 
27838: Rex and Anna hurried away through the sunshine which was suddenly
27839: solemn to them, without uttering a word to each other: she chiefly
27840: possessed by solicitude about any reopening of his wound, he struggling
27841: with a tumultuary crowd of thoughts that were an offence against his
27842: better will. The tumult being undiminished when they were at the
27843: rectory gate, he said,
27844: 
27845: “Nannie, I will leave you to say everything to my father. If he wants
27846: me immediately, let me know. I shall stay in the shrubbery for ten
27847: minutes—only ten minutes.”
27848: 
27849: Who has been quite free from egoistic escapes of the imagination,
27850: picturing desirable consequences on his own future in the presence of
27851: another’s misfortune, sorrow, or death? The expected promotion or
27852: legacy is the common type of a temptation which makes speech and even
27853: prayer a severe avoidance of the most insistent thoughts, and sometimes
27854: raises an inward shame, a self-distaste that is worse than any other
27855: form of unpleasant companionship. In Rex’s nature the shame was
27856: immediate, and overspread like an ugly light all the hurrying images of
27857: what might come, which thrust themselves in with the idea that
27858: Gwendolen was again free—overspread them, perhaps, the more
27859: persistently because every phantasm of a hope was quickly nullified by
27860: a more substantial obstacle. Before the vision of “Gwendolen free” rose
27861: the impassable vision of “Gwendolen rich, exalted, courted;” and if in
27862: the former time, when both their lives were fresh, she had turned from
27863: his love with repugnance, what ground was there for supposing that her
27864: heart would be more open to him in the future?
27865: 
27866: These thoughts, which he wanted to master and suspend, were like a
27867: tumultuary ringing of opposing chimes that he could not escape from by
27868: running. During the last year he had brought himself into a state of
27869: calm resolve, and now it seemed that three words had been enough to
27870: undo all that difficult work, and cast him back into the wretched
27871: fluctuations of a longing which he recognized as simply perturbing and
27872: hopeless. And at this moment the activity of such longing had an
27873: untimeliness that made it repulsive to his better self. Excuse poor
27874: Rex; it was not much more than eighteen months since he had been laid
27875: low by an archer who sometimes touches his arrow with a subtle,
27876: lingering poison. The disappointment of a youthful passion has effects
27877: as incalculable as those of small-pox which may make one person plain
27878: and a genius, another less plain and more foolish, another plain
27879: without detriment to his folly, and leave perhaps the majority without
27880: obvious change. Everything depends—not on the mere fact of
27881: disappointment, but—on the nature affected and the force that stirs
27882: it. In Rex’s well-endowed nature, brief as the hope had been, the
27883: passionate stirring had gone deep, and the effect of disappointment was
27884: revolutionary, though fraught with a beneficent new order which
27885: retained most of the old virtues; in certain respects he believed that
27886: it had finally determined the bias and color of his life. Now, however,
27887: it seemed that his inward peace was hardly more than that of republican
27888: Florence, and his heart no better than the alarm-bell that made work
27889: slack and tumult busy.
27890: 
27891: Rex’s love had been of that sudden, penetrating, clinging sort which
27892: the ancients knew and sung, and in singing made a fashion of talk for
27893: many moderns whose experience has by no means a fiery, demonic
27894: character. To have the consciousness suddenly steeped with another’s
27895: personality, to have the strongest inclinations possessed by an image
27896: which retains its dominance in spite of change and apart from
27897: worthiness—nay, to feel a passion which clings faster for the tragic
27898: pangs inflicted by a cruel, reorganized unworthiness—is a phase of
27899: love which in the feeble and common-minded has a repulsive likeness to
27900: his blind animalism insensible to the higher sway of moral affinity or
27901: heaven-lit admiration. But when this attaching force is present in a
27902: nature not of brutish unmodifiableness, but of a human dignity that can
27903: risk itself safely, it may even result in a devotedness not unfit to be
27904: called divine in a higher sense than the ancient. Phlegmatic
27905: rationality stares and shakes its head at these unaccountable
27906: prepossessions, but they exist as undeniably as the winds and waves,
27907: determining here a wreck and there a triumphant voyage.
27908: 
27909: This sort of passion had nested in the sweet-natured, strong Rex, and
27910: he had made up his mind to its companionship, as if it had been an
27911: object supremely dear, stricken dumb and helpless, and turning all the
27912: future of tenderness into a shadow of the past. But he had also made up
27913: his mind that his life was not to be pauperized because he had had to
27914: renounce one sort of joy; rather, he had begun life again with a new
27915: counting-up of the treasures that remained to him, and he had even felt
27916: a release of power such as may come from ceasing to be afraid of your
27917: own neck.
27918: 
27919: And now, here he was pacing the shrubbery, angry with himself that the
27920: sense of irrevocableness in his lot, which ought in reason to have been
27921: as strong as ever, had been shaken by a change of circumstances that
27922: could make no change in relation to him. He told himself the truth
27923: quite roughly,
27924: 
27925: “She would never love me; and that is not the question—I could never
27926: approach her as a lover in her present position. I am exactly of no
27927: consequence at all, and am not likely to be of much consequence till my
27928: head is turning gray. But what has that to do with it? She would not
27929: have me on any terms, and I would not ask her. It is a meanness to be
27930: thinking about it now—no better than lurking about the battle-field to
27931: strip the dead; but there never was more gratuitous sinning. I have
27932: nothing to gain there—absolutely nothing. Then why can’t I face the
27933: facts, and behave as they demand, instead of leaving my father to
27934: suppose that there are matters he can’t speak to me about, though I
27935: might be useful in them?”
27936: 
27937: The last thought made one wave with the impulse that sent Rex walking
27938: firmly into the house and through the open door of the study, where he
27939: saw his father packing a traveling-desk.
27940: 
27941: “Can I be of any use, sir?” said Rex, with rallied courage, as his
27942: father looked up at him.
27943: 
27944: “Yes, my boy; when I’m gone, just see to my letters, and answer where
27945: necessary, and send me word of everything. Dymock will manage the
27946: parish very well, and you will stay with your mother, or, at least, go
27947: up and down again, till I come back, whenever that may be.”
27948: 
27949: “You will hardly be very long, sir, I suppose,” said Rex, beginning to
27950: strap a railway rug. “You will perhaps bring my cousin back to
27951: England?” He forced himself to speak of Gwendolen for the first time,
27952: and the rector noticed the epoch with satisfaction.
27953: 
27954: “That depends,” he answered, taking the subject as a matter-of-course
27955: between them. “Perhaps her mother may stay there with her, and I may
27956: come back very soon. This telegram leaves us in ignorance which is
27957: rather anxious. But no doubt the arrangements of the will lately made
27958: are satisfactory, and there may possibly be an heir yet to be born. In
27959: any case, I feel confident that Gwendolen will be liberally—I should
27960: expect, splendidly—provided for.”
27961: 
27962: “It must have been a great shock for her,” said Rex, getting more
27963: resolute after the first twinge had been borne. “I suppose he was a
27964: devoted husband.”
27965: 
27966: “No doubt of it,” said the rector, in his most decided manner. “Few men
27967: of his position would have come forward as he did under the
27968: circumstances.”
27969: 
27970: Rex had never seen Grandcourt, had never been spoken to about him by
27971: any one of the family, and knew nothing of Gwendolen’s flight from her
27972: suitor to Leubronn. He only knew that Grandcourt, being very much in
27973: love with her, had made her an offer in the first weeks of her sudden
27974: poverty, and had behaved very handsomely in providing for her mother
27975: and sisters. That was all very natural and what Rex himself would have
27976: liked to do. Grandcourt had been a lucky fellow, and had had some
27977: happiness before he got drowned. Yet Rex wondered much whether
27978: Gwendolen had been in love with the successful suitor, or had only
27979: forborne to tell him that she hated being made love to.

27985: 
27986:   “I count myself in nothing else so happy
27987:   As in a soul remembering my good friends.”
27988:                                   —SHAKESPEARE.
27989: 
27990: 
27991: Sir Hugo Mallinger was not so prompt in starting for Genoa as Mr.
27992: Gascoigne had been, and Deronda on all accounts would not take his
27993: departure until he had seen the baronet. There was not only
27994: Grandcourt’s death, but also the late crisis in his own life to make
27995: reasons why his oldest friend would desire to have the unrestrained
27996: communication of speech with him, for in writing he had not felt able
27997: to give any details concerning the mother who had come and gone like an
27998: apparition. It was not till the fifth evening that Deronda, according
27999: to telegram, waited for Sir Hugo at the station, where he was to arrive
28000: between eight and nine; and while he was looking forward to the sight
28001: of the kind, familiar face, which was part of his earliest memories,
28002: something like a smile, in spite of his late tragic experience, might
28003: have been detected in his eyes and the curve of his lips at the idea of
28004: Sir Hugo’s pleasure in being now master of his estates, able to leave
28005: them to his daughters, or at least—according to a view of inheritance
28006: which had just been strongly impressed on Deronda’s imagination—to
28007: take makeshift feminine offspring as intermediate to a satisfactory
28008: heir in a grandson. We should be churlish creatures if we could have no
28009: joy in our fellow-mortals’ joy, unless it were in agreement with our
28010: theory of righteous distribution and our highest ideal of human good:
28011: what sour corners our mouths would get—our eyes, what frozen glances!
28012: and all the while our own possessions and desires would not exactly
28013: adjust themselves to our ideal. We must have some comradeship with
28014: imperfection; and it is, happily, possible to feel gratitude even where
28015: we discern a mistake that may have been injurious, the vehicle of the
28016: mistake being an affectionate intention prosecuted through a life-time
28017: of kindly offices. Deronda’s feeling and judgment were strongly against
28018: the action of Sir Hugo in making himself the agent of a falsity—yes, a
28019: falsity: he could give no milder name to the concealment under which he
28020: had been reared. But the baronet had probably had no clear knowledge
28021: concerning the mother’s breach of trust, and with his light, easy way
28022: of taking life, had held it a reasonable preference in her that her son
28023: should be made an English gentleman, seeing that she had the
28024: eccentricity of not caring to part from her child, and be to him as if
28025: she were not. Daniel’s affectionate gratitude toward Sir Hugo made him
28026: wish to find grounds of excuse rather than blame; for it is as possible
28027: to be rigid in principle and tender in blame, as it is to suffer from
28028: the sight of things hung awry, and yet to be patient with the hanger
28029: who sees amiss. If Sir Hugo in his bachelorhood had been beguiled into
28030: regarding children chiefly as a product intended to make life more
28031: agreeable to the full-grown, whose convenience alone was to be
28032: consulted in the disposal of them—why, he had shared an assumption
28033: which, if not formally avowed, was massively acted on at that date of
28034: the world’s history; and Deronda, with all his keen memory of the
28035: painful inward struggle he had gone through in his boyhood, was able
28036: also to remember the many signs that his experience had been entirely
28037: shut out from Sir Hugo’s conception. Ignorant kindness may have the
28038: effect of cruelty; but to be angry with it as if it were direct cruelty
28039: would be an ignorant _un_kindness, the most remote from Deronda’s large
28040: imaginative lenience toward others. And perhaps now, after the
28041: searching scenes of the last ten days, in which the curtain had been
28042: lifted for him from the secrets of lives unlike his own, he was more
28043: than ever disposed to check that rashness of indignation or resentment
28044: which has an unpleasant likeness to the love of punishing. When he saw
28045: Sir Hugo’s familiar figure descending from the railway carriage, the
28046: life-long affection which had been well accustomed to make excuses,
28047: flowed in and submerged all newer knowledge that might have seemed
28048: fresh ground for blame.
28049: 
28050: “Well, Dan,” said Sir Hugo, with a serious fervor, grasping Deronda’s
28051: hand. He uttered no other words of greeting; there was too strong a
28052: rush of mutual consciousness. The next thing was to give orders to the
28053: courier, and then to propose walking slowly in the mild evening, there
28054: being no hurry to get to the hotel.
28055: 
28056: “I have taken my journey easily, and am in excellent condition,” he
28057: said, as he and Deronda came out under the starlight, which was still
28058: faint with the lingering sheen of day. “I didn’t hurry in setting off,
28059: because I wanted to inquire into things a little, and so I got sight of
28060: your letter to Lady Mallinger before I started. But now, how is the
28061: widow?”
28062: 
28063: “Getting calmer,” said Deronda. “She seems to be escaping the bodily
28064: illness that one might have feared for her, after her plunge and
28065: terrible excitement. Her uncle and mother came two days ago, and she is
28066: being well taken care of.”
28067: 
28068: “Any prospect of an heir being born?”
28069: 
28070: “From what Mr. Gascoigne said to me, I conclude not. He spoke as if it
28071: were a question whether the widow would have the estates for her life.”
28072: 
28073: “It will not be much of a wrench to her affections, I fancy, this loss
28074: of the husband?” said Sir Hugo, looking round at Deronda.
28075: 
28076: “The suddenness of the death has been a great blow to her,” said
28077: Deronda, quietly evading the question.
28078: 
28079: “I wonder whether Grandcourt gave her any notion what were the
28080: provisions of his will?” said Sir Hugo.
28081: 
28082: “Do you know what they are, sir?” parried Deronda.
28083: 
28084: “Yes, I do,” said the baronet, quickly. “Gad! if there is no prospect
28085: of a legitimate heir, he has left everything to a boy he had by a Mrs.
28086: Glasher; you know nothing about the affair, I suppose, but she was a
28087: sort of wife to him for a good many years, and there are three older
28088: children—girls. The boy is to take his father’s name; he is Henleigh
28089: already, and he is to be Henleigh Mallinger Grandcourt. The Mallinger
28090: will be of no use to him, I am happy to say; but the young dog will
28091: have more than enough with his fourteen years’ minority—no need to
28092: have had holes filled up with my fifty thousand for Diplow that he had
28093: no right to: and meanwhile my beauty, the young widow, is to put up
28094: with a poor two thousand a year and the house at Gadsmere—a nice kind
28095: of banishment for her if she chose to shut herself up there, which I
28096: don’t think she will. The boy’s mother has been living there of late
28097: years. I’m perfectly disgusted with Grandcourt. I don’t know that I’m
28098: obliged to think the better of him because he’s drowned, though, so far
28099: as my affairs are concerned, nothing in his life became him like the
28100: leaving it.”
28101: 
28102: “In my opinion he did wrong when he married this wife—not in leaving
28103: his estates to the son,” said Deronda, rather dryly.
28104: 
28105: “I say nothing against his leaving the land to the lad,” said Sir Hugo;
28106: “but since he had married this girl he ought to have given her a
28107: handsome provision, such as she could live on in a style fitted to the
28108: rank he had raised her to. She ought to have had four or five thousand
28109: a year and the London house for her life; that’s what I should have
28110: done for her. I suppose, as she was penniless, her friends couldn’t
28111: stand out for a settlement, else it’s ill trusting to the will a man
28112: may make after he’s married. Even a wise man generally lets some folly
28113: ooze out of him in his will—my father did, I know; and if a fellow has
28114: any spite or tyranny in him, he’s likely to bottle off a good deal for
28115: keeping in that sort of document. It’s quite clear Grandcourt meant
28116: that his death should put an extinguisher on his wife, if she bore him
28117: no heir.”
28118: 
28119: “And, in the other case, I suppose everything would have been
28120: reversed—illegitimacy would have had the extinguisher?” said Deronda,
28121: with some scorn.
28122: 
28123: “Precisely—Gadsmere and the two thousand. It’s queer. One nuisance is
28124: that Grandcourt has made me an executor; but seeing he was the son of
28125: my only brother, I can’t refuse to act. And I shall mind it less if I
28126: can be of any use to the widow. Lush thinks she was not in ignorance
28127: about the family under the rose, and the purport of the will. He hints
28128: that there was no very good understanding between the couple. But I
28129: fancy you are the man who knew most about what Mrs. Grandcourt felt or
28130: did not feel—eh, Dan?” Sir Hugo did not put this question with his
28131: usual jocoseness, but rather with a lowered tone of interested inquiry;
28132: and Deronda felt that any evasion would be misinterpreted. He answered
28133: gravely,
28134: 
28135: “She was certainly not happy. They were unsuited to each other. But as
28136: to the disposal of the property—from all I have seen of her, I should
28137: predict that she will be quite contented with it.”
28138: 
28139: “Then she is not much like the rest of her sex; that’s all I can say,”
28140: said Sir Hugo, with a slight shrug. “However, she ought to be something
28141: extraordinary, for there must be an entanglement between your horoscope
28142: and hers—eh? When that tremendous telegram came, the first thing Lady
28143: Mallinger said was, ‘How very strange that it should be Daniel who
28144: sends it!’ But I have had something of the same sort in my own life. I
28145: was once at a foreign hotel where a lady had been left by her husband
28146: without money. When I heard of it, and came forward to help her, who
28147: should she be but an early flame of mine, who had been fool enough to
28148: marry an Austrian baron with a long mustache and short affection? But
28149: it was an affair of my own that called me there—nothing to do with
28150: knight-errantry, any more than you coming to Genoa had to do with the
28151: Grandcourts.”
28152: 
28153: There was silence for a little while. Sir Hugo had begun to talk of the
28154: Grandcourts as the less difficult subject between himself and Deronda;
28155: but they were both wishing to overcome a reluctance to perfect
28156: frankness on the events which touched their relation to each other.
28157: Deronda felt that his letter, after the first interview with his
28158: mother, had been rather a thickening than a breaking of the ice, and
28159: that he ought to wait for the first opening to come from Sir Hugo. Just
28160: when they were about to lose sight of the port, the baronet turned, and
28161: pausing as if to get a last view, said in a tone of more serious
28162: feeling—“And about the main business of your coming to Genoa, Dan? You
28163: have not been deeply pained by anything you have learned, I hope? There
28164: is nothing that you feel need change your position in any way? You
28165: know, whatever happens to you must always be of importance to me.”
28166: 
28167: “I desire to meet your goodness by perfect confidence, sir,” said
28168: Deronda. “But I can’t answer those questions truly by a simple yes or
28169: no. Much that I have heard about the past has pained me. And it has
28170: been a pain to meet and part with my mother in her suffering state, as
28171: I have been compelled to do. But it is no pain—it is rather a clearing
28172: up of doubts for which I am thankful, to know my parentage. As to the
28173: effect on my position, there will be no change in my gratitude to you,
28174: sir, for the fatherly care and affection you have always shown me. But
28175: to know that I was born a Jew, may have a momentous influence on my
28176: life, which I am hardly able to tell you of at present.”
28177: 
28178: Deronda spoke the last sentence with a resolve that overcame some
28179: diffidence. He felt that the differences between Sir Hugo’s nature and
28180: his own would have, by-and-by, to disclose themselves more markedly
28181: than had ever yet been needful. The baronet gave him a quick glance,
28182: and turned to walk on. After a few moments’ silence, in which he had
28183: reviewed all the material in his memory which would enable him to
28184: interpret Deronda’s words, he said,
28185: 
28186: “I have long expected something remarkable from you, Dan; but, for
28187: God’s sake, don’t go into any eccentricities! I can tolerate any man’s
28188: difference of opinion, but let him tell it me without getting himself
28189: up as a lunatic. At this stage of the world, if a man wants to be taken
28190: seriously, he must keep clear of melodrama. Don’t misunderstand me. I
28191: am not suspecting you of setting up any lunacy on your own account. I
28192: only think you might easily be led arm in arm with a lunatic,
28193: especially if he wanted defending. You have a passion for people who
28194: are pelted, Dan. I’m sorry for them too; but so far as company goes,
28195: it’s a bad ground of selection. However, I don’t ask you to anticipate
28196: your inclination in anything you have to tell me. When you make up your
28197: mind to a course that requires money, I have some sixteen thousand
28198: pounds that have been accumulating for you over and above what you have
28199: been having the interest of as income. And now I am come, I suppose you
28200: want to get back to England as soon as you can?”
28201: 
28202: “I must go first to Mainz to get away a chest of my grandfather’s, and
28203: perhaps to see a friend of his,” said Deronda. “Although the chest has
28204: been lying there these twenty years, I have an unreasonable sort of
28205: nervous eagerness to get it away under my care, as if it were more
28206: likely now than before that something might happen to it. And perhaps I
28207: am the more uneasy, because I lingered after my mother left, instead of
28208: setting out immediately. Yet I can’t regret that I was here—else Mrs.
28209: Grandcourt would have had none but servants to act for her.”
28210: 
28211: “Yes, yes,” said Sir Hugo, with a flippancy which was an escape of some
28212: vexation hidden under his more serious speech; “I hope you are not
28213: going to set a dead Jew above a living Christian.”
28214: 
28215: Deronda colored, and repressed a retort. They were just turning into
28216: the _Italia_.

28221: CHAPTER LX.
28222: 
28223:     “But I shall say no more of this at this time; for this is to be felt
28224:     and not to be talked of; and they who never touched it with their
28225:     fingers may secretly perhaps laugh at it in their hearts and be never
28226:     the wiser.”—JEREMY TAYLOR.
28227: 
28228:     The Roman Emperor in the legend put to death ten learned Israelites to
28229:     avenge the sale of Joseph by his brethren. And there have always been
28230:     enough of his kidney, whose piety lies in punishing who can see the
28231:     justice of grudges but not of gratitude. For you shall never convince
28232:     the stronger feeling that it hath not the stronger reason, or incline
28233:     him who hath no love to believe that there is good ground for loving.
28234:     As we may learn from the order of word-making, wherein _love_
28235:     precedeth _lovable_.
28236: 
28237: 
28238: When Deronda presented his letter at the banking-house in the _Schuster
28239: Strasse_ at Mainz, and asked for Joseph Kalonymos, he was presently
28240: shown into an inner room, where, seated at a table arranging open
28241: letters, was the white-bearded man whom he had seen the year before in
28242: the synagogue at Frankfort. He wore his hat—it seemed to be the same
28243: old felt hat as before—and near him was a packed portmanteau with a
28244: wrap and overcoat upon it. On seeing Deronda enter he rose, but did not
28245: advance or put out his hand. Looking at him with small penetrating eyes
28246: which glittered like black gems in the midst of his yellowish face and
28247: white hair, he said in German,
28248: 
28249: “Good! It is now you who seek me, young man.”
28250: 
28251: “Yes; I seek you with gratitude, as a friend of my grandfather’s,” said
28252: Deronda, “and I am under an obligation to you for giving yourself much
28253: trouble on my account.” He spoke without difficulty in that liberal
28254: German tongue which takes many strange accents to its maternal bosom.
28255: 
28256: Kalonymos now put out his hand and said cordially, “So you are no
28257: longer angry at being something more than an Englishman?”
28258: 
28259: “On the contrary. I thank you heartily for helping to save me from
28260: remaining in ignorance of my parentage, and for taking care of the
28261: chest that my grandfather left in trust for me.”
28262: 
28263: “Sit down, sit down,” said Kalonymos, in a quick undertone, seating
28264: himself again, and pointing to a chair near him. Then deliberately
28265: laying aside his hat and showing a head thickly covered, with white
28266: hair, he stroked and clutched his beard while he looked examiningly at
28267: the young face before him. The moment wrought strongly on Deronda’s
28268: imaginative susceptibility: in the presence of one linked still in
28269: zealous friendship with the grandfather whose hope had yearned toward
28270: him when he was unborn, and who, though dead, was yet to speak with him
28271: in those written memorials which, says Milton, “contain a potency of
28272: life in them to be as active as that soul whose progeny they are,” he
28273: seemed to himself to be touching the electric chain of his own
28274: ancestry; and he bore the scrutinizing look of Kalonymos with a
28275: delighted awe, something like what one feels in the solemn
28276: commemoration of acts done long ago but still telling markedly on the
28277: life of to-day. Impossible for men of duller fibre—men whose
28278: affection is not ready to diffuse itself through the wide travel of
28279: imagination, to comprehend, perhaps even to credit this sensibility of
28280: Deronda’s; but it subsisted, like their own dullness, notwithstanding
28281: their lack of belief in it—and it gave his face an expression which
28282: seemed very satisfactory to the observer.
28283: 
28284: He said in Hebrew, quoting from one of the fine hymns in the Hebrew
28285: liturgy, “As thy goodness has been great to the former generations,
28286: even so may it be to the latter.” Then after pausing a little he began,
28287: “Young man, I rejoice that I was not yet set off again on my travels,
28288: and that you are come in time for me to see the image of my friend as
28289: he was in his youth—no longer perverted from the fellowship of your
28290: people—no longer shrinking in proud wrath from the touch of him who
28291: seemed to be claiming you as a Jew. You come with thankfulness yourself
28292: to claim the kindred and heritage that wicked contrivance would have
28293: robbed you of. You come with a willing soul to declare, ‘I am the
28294: grandson of Daniel Charisi.’ Is it not so?”
28295: 
28296: “Assuredly it is,” said Deronda. “But let me say that I should at no
28297: time have been inclined to treat a Jew with incivility simply because
28298: he was a Jew. You can understand that I shrank from saying to a
28299: stranger, ‘I know nothing of my mother.’”
28300: 
28301: “A sin, a sin!” said Kalonymos, putting up his hand and closing his
28302: eyes in disgust. “A robbery of our people—as when our youths and
28303: maidens were reared for the Roman Edom. But it is frustrated. I have
28304: frustrated it. When Daniel Charisi—may his Rock and his Redeemer guard
28305: him!—when Daniel Charisi was a stripling and I was a lad little above
28306: his shoulder, we made a solemn vow always to be friends. He said, ‘Let
28307: us bind ourselves with duty, as if we were sons of the same mother.’
28308: That was his bent from first to last—as he said, to fortify his soul
28309: with bonds. It was a saying of his, ‘Let us bind love with duty; for
28310: duty is the love of law; and law is the nature of the Eternal.’ So we
28311: bound ourselves. And though we were much apart in our later life, the
28312: bond has never been broken. When he was dead, they sought to rob him;
28313: but they could not rob him of me. I rescued that remainder of him which
28314: he had prized and preserved for his offspring. And I have restored to
28315: him the offspring they had robbed him of. I will bring you the chest
28316: forthwith.”
28317: 
28318: Kalonymos left the room for a few minutes, and returned with a clerk
28319: who carried the chest, set it down on the floor, drew off a leather
28320: cover, and went out again. It was not very large, but was made heavy by
28321: ornamental bracers and handles of gilt iron. The wood was beautifully
28322: incised with Arabic lettering.
28323: 
28324: “So!” said Kalonymos, returning to his seat. “And here is the curious
28325: key,” he added, taking it from a small leathern bag. “Bestow it
28326: carefully. I trust you are methodic and wary.” He gave Deronda the
28327: monitory and slightly suspicious look with which age is apt to commit
28328: any object to the keeping of youth.
28329: 
28330: “I shall be more careful of this than of any other property,” said
28331: Deronda, smiling and putting the key in his breast-pocket. “I never
28332: before possessed anything that was a sign to me of so much cherished
28333: hope and effort. And I shall never forget that the effort was partly
28334: yours. Have you time to tell me more of my grandfather? Or shall I be
28335: trespassing in staying longer?”
28336: 
28337: “Stay yet a while. In an hour and eighteen minutes I start for
28338: Trieste,” said Kalonymos, looking at his watch, “and presently my sons
28339: will expect my attention. Will you let me make you known to them, so
28340: that they may have the pleasure of showing hospitality to my friend’s
28341: grandson? They dwell here in ease and luxury, though I choose to be a
28342: wanderer.”
28343: 
28344: “I shall be glad if you will commend me to their acquaintance for some
28345: future opportunity,” said Deronda. “There are pressing claims calling
28346: me to England—friends who may be much in need of my presence. I have
28347: been kept away from them too long by unexpected circumstances. But to
28348: know more of you and your family would be motive enough to bring me
28349: again to Mainz.”
28350: 
28351: “Good! Me you will hardly find, for I am beyond my threescore years and
28352: ten, and I am a wanderer, carrying my shroud with me. But my sons and
28353: their children dwell here in wealth and unity. The days are changed for
28354: us since Karl the Great fetched my ancestors from Italy to bring some
28355: tincture of knowledge to our rough German brethren. I and my
28356: contemporaries have had to fight for it too. Our youth fell on evil
28357: days; but this we have won; we increase our wealth in safety, and the
28358: learning of all Germany is fed and fattened by Jewish brains—though
28359: they keep not always their Jewish hearts. Have you been left altogether
28360: ignorant of your people’s life, young man?”
28361: 
28362: “No,” said Deronda, “I have lately, before I had any true suspicion of
28363: my parentage, been led to study everything belonging to their history
28364: with more interest than any other subject. It turns out that I have
28365: been making myself ready to understand my grandfather a little.” He was
28366: anxious less the time should be consumed before this circuitous course
28367: of talk could lead them back to the topic he most cared about. Age does
28368: not easily distinguish between what it needs to express and what youth
28369: needs to know—distance seeming to level the objects of memory; and
28370: keenly active as Joseph Kalonymos showed himself, an inkstand in the
28371: wrong place would have hindered his imagination from getting to
28372: Beyrout: he had been used to unite restless travel with punctilious
28373: observation. But Deronda’s last sentence answered its purpose.
28374: 
28375: “So—you would perhaps have been such a man as he if your education had
28376: not hindered; for you are like him in features:—yet not altogether,
28377: young man. He had an iron will in his face: it braced up everybody
28378: about him. When he was quite young he had already got one deep upright
28379: line in his brow. I see none of that in you. Daniel Charisi used to
28380: say, ‘Better, a wrong will than a wavering; better a steadfast enemy
28381: than an uncertain friend; better a false belief than no belief at all.’
28382: What he despised most was indifference. He had longer reasons than I
28383: can give you.”
28384: 
28385: “Yet his knowledge was not narrow?” said Deronda, with a tacit
28386: reference to the usual excuse for indecision—that it comes from
28387: knowing too much.
28388: 
28389: “Narrow? no,” said Kalonymos, shaking his head with a compassionate
28390: smile “From his childhood upward, he drank in learning as easily as the
28391: plant sucks up water. But he early took to medicine and theories about
28392: life and health. He traveled to many countries, and spent much of his
28393: substance in seeing and knowing. What he used to insist on was that the
28394: strength and wealth of mankind depended on the balance of separateness
28395: and communication, and he was bitterly against our people losing
28396: themselves among the Gentiles; ‘It’s no better,’ said he, ‘than the
28397: many sorts of grain going back from their variety into sameness.’ He
28398: mingled all sorts of learning; and in that he was like our Arabic
28399: writers in the golden time. We studied together, but he went beyond me.
28400: Though we were bosom friends, and he poured himself out to me, we were
28401: as different as the inside and outside of the bowl. I stood up for two
28402: notions of my own: I took Charisi’s sayings as I took the shape of the
28403: trees: they were there, not to be disputed about. It came to the same
28404: thing in both of us; we were both faithful Jews, thankful not to be
28405: Gentiles. And since I was a ripe man, I have been what I am now, for
28406: all but age—loving to wander, loving transactions, loving to behold all
28407: things, and caring nothing about hardship. Charisi thought continually
28408: of our people’s future: he went with all his soul into that part of our
28409: religion: I, not. So we have freedom, I am content. Our people wandered
28410: before they were driven. Young man when I am in the East, I lie much on
28411: deck and watch the greater stars. The sight of them satisfies me. I
28412: know them as they rise, and hunger not to know more. Charisi was
28413: satisfied with no sight, but pieced it out with what had been before
28414: and what would come after. Yet we loved each other, and as he said, he
28415: bound our love with duty; we solemnly pledged ourselves to help and
28416: defend each other to the last. I have fulfilled my pledge.” Here
28417: Kalonymos rose, and Deronda, rising also, said,
28418: 
28419: “And in being faithful to him you have caused justice to be done to me.
28420: It would have been a robbery of me too that I should never have known
28421: of the inheritance he had prepared for me. I thank you with my whole
28422: soul.”
28423: 
28424: “Be worthy of him, young man. What is your vocation?” This question was
28425: put with a quick abruptness which embarrassed Deronda, who did not feel
28426: it quite honest to allege his law-reading as a vocation. He answered,
28427: 
28428: “I cannot say that I have any.”
28429: 
28430: “Get one, get one. The Jew must be diligent. You will call yourself a
28431: Jew and profess the faith of your fathers?” said Kalonymos, putting his
28432: hand on Deronda’s shoulder and looking sharply in his face.
28433: 
28434: “I shall call myself a Jew,” said Deronda, deliberately, becoming
28435: slightly paler under the piercing eyes of his questioner. “But I will
28436: not say that I shall profess to believe exactly as my fathers have
28437: believed. Our fathers themselves changed the horizon of their belief
28438: and learned of other races. But I think I can maintain my grandfather’s
28439: notion of separateness with communication. I hold that my first duty is
28440: to my own people, and if there is anything to be done toward restoring
28441: or perfecting their common life, I shall make that my vocation.”
28442: 
28443: It happened to Deronda at that moment, as it has often happened to
28444: others, that the need for speech made an epoch in resolve. His respect
28445: for the questioner would not let him decline to answer, and by the
28446: necessity to answer he found out the truth for himself.
28447: 
28448: “Ah, you argue and you look forward—you are Daniel Charisi’s
28449: grandson,” said Kalonymos, adding a benediction in Hebrew.
28450: 
28451: With that they parted; and almost as soon as Deronda was in London, the
28452: aged man was again on shipboard, greeting the friendly stars without
28453: any eager curiosity.
28454:

28458: CHAPTER LXI.
28459: 
28460:   “Within the gentle heart Love shelters him,
28461:     As birds within the green shade of the grove.
28462:   Before the gentle heart, in Nature’s scheme,
28463:     Love was not, nor the gentle heart ere Love.”
28464:             —GUIDO GUINICELLI (_Rossetti’s Translation_).
28465: 
28466: 
28467: There was another house besides the white house at Pennicote, another
28468: breast besides Rex Gascoigne’s, in which the news of Grandcourt’s death
28469: caused both strong agitation and the effort to repress it.
28470: 
28471: It was Hans Meyrick’s habit to send or bring in the _Times_ for his
28472: mother’s reading. She was a great reader of news, from the
28473: widest-reaching politics to the list of marriages; the latter, she
28474: said, giving her the pleasant sense of finishing the fashionable novels
28475: without having read them, and seeing the heroes and heroines happy
28476: without knowing what poor creatures they were. On a Wednesday, there
28477: were reasons why Hans always chose to bring the paper, and to do so
28478: about the time that Mirah had nearly ended giving Mab her weekly
28479: lesson, avowing that he came then because he wanted to hear Mirah sing.
28480: But on the particular Wednesday now in question, after entering the
28481: house as quietly as usual with his latch-key, he appeared in the
28482: parlor, shaking the _Times_ aloft with a crackling noise, in
28483: remorseless interruption of Mab’s attempt to render _Lascia ch’io
28484: pianga_ with a remote imitation of her teacher. Piano and song ceased
28485: immediately; Mirah, who had been playing the accompaniment,
28486: involuntarily started up and turned round, the crackling sound, after
28487: the occasional trick of sounds, having seemed to her something
28488: thunderous; and Mab said,
28489: 
28490: “O-o-o, Hans! why do you bring a more horrible noise than my singing?”
28491: 
28492: “What on earth is the wonderful news?” said Mrs. Meyrick, who was the
28493: only other person in the room. “Anything about Italy—anything about
28494: the Austrians giving up Venice?”
28495: 
28496: “Nothing about Italy, but something from Italy,” said Hans, with a
28497: peculiarity in his tone and manner which set his mother interpreting.
28498: Imagine how some of us feel and behave when an event, not disagreeable
28499: seems to be confirming and carrying out our private constructions. We
28500: say, “What do you think?” in a pregnant tone to some innocent person
28501: who has not embarked his wisdom in the same boat with ours, and finds
28502: our information flat.
28503: 
28504: “Nothing bad?” said Mrs. Meyrick anxiously, thinking immediately of
28505: Deronda; and Mirah’s heart had been already clutched by the same
28506: thought.
28507: 
28508: “Not bad for anybody we care much about,” said Hans, quickly; “rather
28509: uncommonly lucky, I think. I never knew anybody die conveniently
28510: before. Considering what a dear gazelle I am, I am constantly wondering
28511: to find myself alive.”
28512: 
28513: “Oh me, Hans!” said Mab, impatiently, “if you must talk of yourself,
28514: let it be behind your own back. What _is_ it that has happened?”
28515: 
28516: “Duke Alfonso is drowned, and the Duchess is alive, that’s all,” said
28517: Hans, putting the paper before Mrs. Meyrick, with his finger against a
28518: paragraph. “But more than all is—Deronda was at Genoa in the same
28519: hotel with them, and he saw her brought in by the fishermen who had got
28520: her out of the water time enough to save her from any harm. It seems
28521: they saw her jump in after her husband, which was a less judicious
28522: action than I should have expected of the Duchess. However Deronda is a
28523: lucky fellow in being there to take care of her.”
28524: 
28525: Mirah had sunk on the music stool again, with her eyelids down and her
28526: hands tightly clasped; and Mrs. Meyrick, giving up the paper to Mab,
28527: said,
28528: 
28529: “Poor thing! she must have been fond of her husband to jump in after
28530: him.”
28531: 
28532: “It was an inadvertence—a little absence of mind,” said Hans, creasing
28533: his face roguishly, and throwing himself into a chair not far from
28534: Mirah. “Who can be fond of a jealous baritone, with freezing glances,
28535: always singing asides?—that was the husband’s _rôle_, depend upon it.
28536: Nothing can be neater than his getting drowned. The Duchess is at
28537: liberty now to marry a man with a fine head of hair, and glances that
28538: will melt instead of freezing her. And I shall be invited to the
28539: wedding.”
28540: 
28541: Here Mirah started from her sitting posture, and fixing her eyes on
28542: Hans, with an angry gleam in them, she said, in a deeply-shaken voice
28543: of indignation,
28544: 
28545: “Mr. Hans, you ought not to speak in that way. Mr. Deronda would not
28546: like you to speak so. Why will you say he is lucky—why will you use
28547: words of that sort about life and death—when what is life to one is
28548: death to another? How do you know it would be lucky if he loved Mrs.
28549: Grandcourt? It might be a great evil to him. She would take him away
28550: from my brother—I know she would. Mr. Deronda would not call that
28551: lucky to pierce my brother’s heart.”
28552: 
28553: All three were struck with the sudden transformation. Mirah’s face,
28554: with a look of anger that might have suited Ithuriel, pale, even to the
28555: lips that were usually so rich of tint, was not far from poor Hans, who
28556: sat transfixed, blushing under it as if he had been a girl, while he
28557: said, nervously,
28558: 
28559: “I am a fool and a brute, and I withdraw every word. I’ll go and hang
28560: myself like Judas—if it’s allowable to mention him.” Even in Hans’s
28561: sorrowful moments, his improvised words had inevitably some drollery.
28562: 
28563: But Mirah’s anger was not appeased: how could it be? She had burst into
28564: indignant speech as creatures in intense pain bite and make their teeth
28565: meet even through their own flesh, by way of making their agony
28566: bearable. She said no more, but, seating herself at the piano, pressed
28567: the sheet of music before her, as if she thought of beginning to play
28568: again.
28569: 
28570: It was Mab who spoke, while Mrs. Meyrick’s face seemed to reflect some
28571: of Hans’ discomfort.
28572: 
28573: “Mirah is quite right to scold you, Hans. You are always taking Mr.
28574: Deronda’s name in vain. And it is horrible, joking in that way about
28575: his marrying Mrs. Grandcourt. Men’s minds must be very black, I think,”
28576: ended Mab, with much scorn.
28577: 
28578: “Quite true, my dear,” said Hans, in a low tone, rising and turning on
28579: his heel to walk toward the back window.
28580: 
28581: “We had better go on, Mab; you have not given your full time to the
28582: lesson,” said Mirah, in a higher tone than usual. “Will you sing this
28583: again, or shall I sing it to you?”
28584: 
28585: “Oh, please sing it to me,” said Mab, rejoiced to take no more notice
28586: of what had happened.
28587: 
28588: And Mirah immediately sang _Lascia ch’io pianga_, giving forth its
28589: melodious sobs and cries with new fullness and energy. Hans paused in
28590: his walk and leaned against the mantel-piece, keeping his eyes
28591: carefully away from his mother’s. When Mirah had sung her last note and
28592: touched the last chord, she rose and said, “I must go home now. Ezra
28593: expects me.”
28594: 
28595: She gave her hand silently to Mrs. Meyrick and hung back a little, not
28596: daring to look at her, instead of kissing her, as usual. But the little
28597: mother drew Mirah’s face down to hers, and said, soothingly, “God bless
28598: you, my dear.” Mirah felt that she had committed an offense against
28599: Mrs. Meyrick by angrily rebuking Hans, and mixed with the rest of her
28600: suffering was the sense that she had shown something like a proud
28601: ingratitude, an unbecoming assertion of superiority. And her friend had
28602: divined this compunction.
28603: 
28604: Meanwhile Hans had seized his wide-awake, and was ready to open the
28605: door.
28606: 
28607: “Now, Hans,” said Mab, with what was really a sister’s tenderness
28608: cunningly disguised, “you are not going to walk home with Mirah. I am
28609: sure she would rather not. You are so dreadfully disagreeable to-day.”
28610: 
28611: “I shall go to take care of her, if she does not forbid me,” said Hans,
28612: opening the door.
28613: 
28614: Mirah said nothing, and when he had opened the outer door for her and
28615: closed it behind him, he walked by her side unforbidden. She had not
28616: the courage to begin speaking to him again—conscious that she had
28617: perhaps been unbecomingly severe in her words to him, yet finding only
28618: severer words behind them in her heart. Besides, she was pressed upon
28619: by a crowd of thoughts thrusting themselves forward as interpreters of
28620: that consciousness which still remained unaltered to herself.
28621: 
28622: Hans, on his side, had a mind equally busy. Mirah’s anger had waked in
28623: him a new perception, and with it the unpleasant sense that he was a
28624: dolt not to have had it before. Suppose Mirah’s heart were entirely
28625: preoccupied with Deronda in another character than that of her own and
28626: her brother’s benefactor; the supposition was attended in Hans’s mind
28627: with anxieties which, to do him justice, were not altogether selfish.
28628: He had a strong persuasion, which only direct evidence to the contrary
28629: could have dissipated, and that was that there was a serious attachment
28630: between Deronda and Mrs. Grandcourt; he had pieced together many
28631: fragments of observation, and gradually gathered knowledge, completed
28632: by what his sisters had heard from Anna Gascoigne, which convinced him
28633: not only that Mrs. Grandcourt had a passion for Deronda, but also,
28634: notwithstanding his friend’s austere self-repression, that Deronda’s
28635: susceptibility about her was the sign of concealed love. Some men,
28636: having such a conviction, would have avoided allusions that could have
28637: roused that susceptibility; but Hans’s talk naturally fluttered toward
28638: mischief, and he was given to a form of experiment on live animals
28639: which consisted in irritating his friends playfully. His experiments
28640: had ended in satisfying him that what he thought likely was true.
28641: 
28642: On the other hand, any susceptibility Deronda had manifested about a
28643: lover’s attentions being shown to Mirah, Hans took to be sufficiently
28644: accounted for by the alleged reason, namely, her dependent position;
28645: for he credited his friend with all possible unselfish anxiety for
28646: those whom he could rescue and protect. And Deronda’s insistence that
28647: Mirah would never marry one who was not a Jew necessarily seemed to
28648: exclude himself, since Hans shared the ordinary opinion, which he knew
28649: nothing to disturb, that Deronda was the son of Sir Hugo Mallinger.
28650: 
28651: Thus he felt himself in clearness about the state of Deronda’s
28652: affections; but now, the events which really struck him as concurring
28653: toward the desirable union with Mrs. Grandcourt, had called forth a
28654: flash of revelation from Mirah—a betrayal of her passionate feeling on
28655: this subject which had made him melancholy on her account as well as
28656: his own—yet on the whole less melancholy than if he had imagined
28657: Deronda’s hopes fixed on her. It is not sublime, but it is common, for
28658: a man to see the beloved object unhappy because his rival loves
28659: another, with more fortitude and a milder jealousy than if he saw her
28660: entirely happy in his rival. At least it was so with the mercurial
28661: Hans, who fluctuated between the contradictory states of feeling,
28662: wounded because Mirah was wounded, and of being almost obliged to
28663: Deronda for loving somebody else. It was impossible for him to give
28664: Mirah any direct sign of the way in which he had understood her anger,
28665: yet he longed that his speechless companionship should be eloquent in a
28666: tender, penitent sympathy which is an admissible form of wooing a
28667: bruised heart.
28668: 
28669: Thus the two went side by side in a companionship that yet seemed an
28670: agitated communication, like that of two chords whose quick vibrations
28671: lie outside our hearing. But when they reached the door of Mirah’s
28672: home, and Hans said “Good-bye,” putting out his hand with an appealing
28673: look of penitence, she met the look with melancholy gentleness, and
28674: said, “Will you not come in and see my brother?”
28675: 
28676: Hans could not but interpret this invitation as a sign of pardon. He
28677: had not enough understanding of what Mirah’s nature had been wrought
28678: into by her early experience, to divine how the very strength of her
28679: late excitement had made it pass more quickly into the resolute
28680: acceptance of pain. When he had said, “If you will let me,” and they
28681: went in together, half his grief was gone, and he was spinning a little
28682: romance of how his devotion might make him indispensable to Mirah in
28683: proportion as Deronda gave his devotion elsewhere. This was quite fair,
28684: since his friend was provided for according to his own heart; and on
28685: the question of Judaism Hans felt thoroughly fortified:—who ever heard
28686: in tale or history that a woman’s love went in the track of her race
28687: and religion? Moslem and Jewish damsels were always attracted toward
28688: Christians, and now if Mirah’s heart had gone forth too precipitately
28689: toward Deronda, here was another case in point. Hans was wont to make
28690: merry with his own arguments, to call himself a Giaour, and antithesis
28691: the sole clue to events; but he believed a little in what he laughed
28692: at. And thus his bird-like hope, constructed on the lightest
28693: principles, soared again in spite of heavy circumstances.
28694: 
28695: They found Mordecai looking singularly happy, holding a closed letter
28696: in his hand, his eyes glowing with a quiet triumph which in his
28697: emaciated face gave the idea of a conquest over assailing death. After
28698: the greeting between him and Hans, Mirah put her arm round her
28699: brother’s neck and looked down at the letter in his hand, without the
28700: courage to ask about it, though she felt sure that it was the cause of
28701: his happiness.
28702: 
28703: “A letter from Daniel Deronda,” said Mordecai, answering her look.
28704: “Brief—only saying that he hopes soon to return. Unexpected claims
28705: have detained him. The promise of seeing him again is like the bow in
28706: the cloud to me,” continued Mordecai, looking at Hans; “and to you it
28707: must be a gladness. For who has two friends like him?”
28708: 
28709: While Hans was answering Mirah slipped away to her own room; but not to
28710: indulge in any outburst of the passion within her. If the angels, once
28711: supposed to watch the toilet of women, had entered the little chamber
28712: with her and let her shut the door behind them, they would only have
28713: seen her take off her hat, sit down and press her hands against her
28714: temples as if she had suddenly reflected that her head ached; then rise
28715: to dash cold water on her eyes and brow and hair till her backward
28716: curls were full of crystal beads, while she had dried her brow and
28717: looked out like a freshly-opened flower from among the dewy tresses of
28718: the woodland; then give deep sighs of relief, and putting on her little
28719: slippers, sit still after that action for a couple of minutes, which
28720: seemed to her so long, so full of things to come, that she rose with an
28721: air of recollection, and went down to make tea.
28722: 
28723: Something of the old life had returned. She had been used to remember
28724: that she must learn her part, must go to rehearsal, must act and sing
28725: in the evening, must hide her feelings from her father; and the more
28726: painful her life grew, the more she had been used to hide. The force of
28727: her nature had long found its chief action in resolute endurance, and
28728: to-day the violence of feeling which had caused the first jet of anger
28729: had quickly transformed itself into a steady facing of trouble, the
28730: well-known companion of her young years. But while she moved about and
28731: spoke as usual, a close observer might have discerned a difference
28732: between this apparent calm, which was the effect of restraining energy,
28733: and the sweet genuine calm of the months when she first felt a return
28734: of her infantine happiness.
28735: 
28736: Those who have been indulged by fortune and have always thought of
28737: calamity as what happens to others, feel a blind incredulous rage at
28738: the reversal of their lot, and half believe that their wild cries will
28739: alter the course of the storm. Mirah felt no such surprise when
28740: familiar Sorrow came back from brief absence, and sat down with her
28741: according to the old use and wont. And this habit of expecting trouble
28742: rather than joy, hindered her from having any persistent belief in
28743: opposition to the probabilities which were not merely suggested by
28744: Hans, but were supported by her own private knowledge and long-growing
28745: presentiment. An attachment between Deronda and Mrs. Grandcourt, to end
28746: in their future marriage, had the aspect of a certainty for her
28747: feeling. There had been no fault in him: facts had ordered themselves
28748: so that there was a tie between him and this woman who belonged to
28749: another world than hers and Ezra’s—nay, who seemed another sort of
28750: being than Deronda, something foreign that would be a disturbance in
28751: his life instead of blending with it. Well, well—but if it could have
28752: been deferred so as to make no difference while Ezra was there! She did
28753: not know all the momentousness of the relation between Deronda and her
28754: brother, but she had seen, and instinctively felt enough to forebode
28755: its being incongruous with any close tie to Mrs. Grandcourt; at least
28756: this was the clothing that Mirah first gave to her mortal repugnance.
28757: But in the still, quick action of her consciousness, thoughts went on
28758: like changing states of sensation unbroken by her habitual acts; and
28759: this inward language soon said distinctly that the mortal repugnance
28760: would remain even if Ezra were secured from loss.
28761: 
28762: “What I have read about and sung about and seen acted, is happening to
28763: me—this that I am feeling is the love that makes jealousy;” so
28764: impartially Mirah summed up the charge against herself. But what
28765: difference could this pain of hers make to any one else? It must remain
28766: as exclusively her own, and hidden, as her early yearning and devotion
28767: to her lost mother. But unlike that devotion, it was something that she
28768: felt to be a misfortune of her nature—a discovery that what should
28769: have been pure gratitude and reverence had sunk into selfish pain, that
28770: the feeling she had hitherto delighted to pour out in words was
28771: degraded into something she was ashamed to betray—an absurd longing
28772: that she who had received all and given nothing should be of importance
28773: where she was of no importance—an angry feeling toward another woman
28774: who possessed the good she wanted. But what notion, what vain reliance
28775: could it be that had lain darkly within her and was now burning itself
28776: into sight as disappointment and jealousy? It was as if her soul had
28777: been steeped in poisonous passion by forgotten dreams of deep sleep,
28778: and now flamed out in this unaccountable misery. For with her waking
28779: reason she had never entertained what seemed the wildly unfitting
28780: thought that Deronda could love her. The uneasiness she had felt before
28781: had been comparatively vague and easily explained as part of a general
28782: regret that he was only a visitant in her and her brother’s world, from
28783: which the world where his home lay was as different as a portico with
28784: lights and lacqueys was different from the door of a tent, where the
28785: only splendor came from the mysterious inaccessible stars. But her
28786: feeling was no longer vague: the cause of her pain—the image of Mrs.
28787: Grandcourt by Deronda’s side, drawing him farther and farther into the
28788: distance, was as definite as pincers on her flesh. In the Psyche-mould
28789: of Mirah’s frame there rested a fervid quality of emotion, sometimes
28790: rashly supposed to require the bulk of a Cleopatra; her impressions had
28791: the thoroughness and tenacity that give to the first selection of
28792: passionate feeling the character of a life-long faithfulness. And now a
28793: selection had declared itself, which gave love a cruel heart of
28794: jealousy: she had been used to a strong repugnance toward certain
28795: objects that surrounded her, and to walk inwardly aloof from them while
28796: they touched her sense. And now her repugnance concentrated itself on
28797: Mrs. Grandcourt, of whom she involuntarily conceived more evil than she
28798: knew. “I could bear everything that used to be—but this is worse—this
28799: is worse,—I used not to have horrible feelings!” said the poor child
28800: in a loud whisper to her pillow. Strange that she should have to pray
28801: against any feeling which concerned Deronda!
28802: 
28803: But this conclusion had been reached through an evening spent in
28804: attending to Mordecai, whose exaltation of spirit in the prospect of
28805: seeing his friend again, disposed him to utter many thoughts aloud to
28806: Mirah, though such communication was often interrupted by intervals
28807: apparently filled with an inward utterance that animated his eyes and
28808: gave an occasional silent action to his lips. One thought especially
28809: occupied him.
28810: 
28811: “Seest thou, Mirah,” he said once, after a long silence, “the _Shemah_,
28812: wherein we briefly confess the divine Unity, is the chief devotional
28813: exercise of the Hebrew; and this made our religion the fundamental
28814: religion for the whole world; for the divine Unity embraced as its
28815: consequence the ultimate unity of mankind. See, then—the nation which
28816: has been scoffed at for its separateness, has given a binding theory to
28817: the human race. Now, in complete unity a part possesses the whole as
28818: the whole possesses every part: and in this way human life is tending
28819: toward the image of the Supreme Unity: for as our life becomes more
28820: spiritual by capacity of thought, and joy therein, possession tends to
28821: become more universal, being independent of gross material contact; so
28822: that in a brief day the soul of man may know in fuller volume the good
28823: which has been and is, nay, is to come, than all he could possess in a
28824: whole life where he had to follow the creeping paths of the senses. In
28825: this moment, my sister, I hold the joy of another’s future within me: a
28826: future which these eyes will not see, and which my spirit may not then
28827: recognize as mine. I recognize it now, and love it so, that I can lay
28828: down this poor life upon its altar and say: ‘Burn, burn indiscernibly
28829: into that which shall be, which is my love and not me.’ Dost thou
28830: understand, Mirah?”
28831: 
28832: “A little,” said Mirah, faintly, “but my mind is too poor to have felt
28833: it.”
28834: 
28835: “And yet,” said Mordecai, rather insistently, “women are specially
28836: framed for the love which feels possession in renouncing, and is thus a
28837: fit image of what I mean. Somewhere in the later _Midrash_, I think, is
28838: the story of a Jewish maiden who loved a Gentile king so well, that
28839: this was what she did:—she entered into prison and changed clothes
28840: with the woman who was beloved by the king, that she might deliver that
28841: woman from death by dying in her stead, and leave the king to be happy
28842: in his love which was not for her. This is the surpassing love, that
28843: loses self in the object of love.”
28844: 
28845: “No, Ezra, no,” said Mirah, with low-toned intensity, “that was not it.
28846: She wanted the king when she was dead to know what she had done, and
28847: feel that she was better than the other. It was her strong self,
28848: wanting to conquer, that made her die.”
28849: 
28850: Mordecai was silent a little, and then argued,
28851: 
28852: “That might be, Mirah. But if she acted so, believing the king would
28853: never know.”
28854: 
28855: “You can make the story so in your mind, Ezra, because you are great,
28856: and like to fancy the greatest that could be. But I think it was not
28857: really like that. The Jewish girl must have had jealousy in her heart,
28858: and she wanted somehow to have the first place in the king’s mind. That
28859: is what she would die for.”
28860: 
28861: “My sister, thou hast read too many plays, where the writers delight in
28862: showing the human passions as indwelling demons, unmixed with the
28863: relenting and devout elements of the soul. Thou judgest by the plays,
28864: and not by thy own heart, which is like our mother’s.”
28865: 
28866: Mirah made no answer.
28867: 
28868: 
28869: 
28870: 
28871: CHAPTER LXII.
28872: 
28873:   “Das Glück ist eine leichte Dirne,
28874:   Und weilt nicht gern am selben Ort;
28875:   Sie streicht das Haar dir von der Stirne
28876:   Und küsst dich rasch und flattert fort
28877: 
28878:   Frau Unglück hat im Gegentheile
28879:   Dich liebefest an’s Herz gedrückt;
28880:   Sie sagt, sie habe keine Eile,
28881:   Setzt sich zu dir an’s Bett und strickt.”
28882:                                      —HEINE.
28883: 
28884: 
28885: Something which Mirah had lately been watching for as the fulfilment of
28886: a threat, seemed now the continued visit of that familiar sorrow which
28887: had lately come back, bringing abundant luggage.
28888: 
28889: Turning out of Knightsbridge, after singing at a charitable morning
28890: concert in a wealthy house, where she had been recommended by Klesmer,
28891: and where there had been the usual groups outside to see the departing
28892: company, she began to feel herself dogged by footsteps that kept an
28893: even pace with her own. Her concert dress being simple black, over
28894: which she had thrown a dust cloak, could not make her an object of
28895: unpleasant attention, and render walking an imprudence; but this
28896: reflection did not occur to Mirah: another kind of alarm lay uppermost
28897: in her mind. She immediately thought of her father, and could no more
28898: look round than if she had felt herself tracked by a ghost. To turn and
28899: face him would be voluntarily to meet the rush of emotions which
28900: beforehand seemed intolerable. If it were her father he must mean to
28901: claim recognition, and he would oblige her to face him. She must wait
28902: for that compulsion. She walked on, not quickening her pace—of what
28903: use was that?—but picturing what was about to happen as if she had the
28904: full certainty that the man behind her was her father; and along with
28905: her picturing went a regret that she had given her word to Mrs. Meyrick
28906: not to use any concealment about him. The regret at last urged her, at
28907: least, to try and hinder any sudden betrayal that would cause her
28908: brother an unnecessary shock. Under the pressure of this motive, she
28909: resolved to turn before she reached her own door, and firmly will the
28910: encounter instead of merely submitting to it. She had already reached
28911: the entrance of the small square where her home lay, and had made up
28912: her mind to turn, when she felt her embodied presentiment getting
28913: closer to her, then slipping to her side, grasping her wrist, and
28914: saying, with a persuasive curl of accent, “Mirah!”
28915: 
28916: She paused at once without any start; it was the voice she expected,
28917: and she was meeting the expected eyes. Her face was as grave as if she
28918: had been looking at her executioner, while his was adjusted to the
28919: intention of soothing and propitiating her. Once a handsome face, with
28920: bright color, it was now sallow and deep-lined, and had that peculiar
28921: impress of impudent suavity which comes from courting favor while
28922: accepting disrespect. He was lightly made and active, with something of
28923: youth about him which made the signs of age seem a disguise; and in
28924: reality he was hardly fifty-seven. His dress was shabby, as when she
28925: had seen him before. The presence of this unreverend father now, more
28926: than ever, affected Mirah with the mingled anguish of shame and grief,
28927: repulsion and pity—more than ever, now that her own world was changed
28928: into one where there was no comradeship to fence him from scorn and
28929: contempt.
28930: 
28931: Slowly, with a sad, tremulous voice, she said, “It is you, father.”
28932: 
28933: “Why did you run away from me, child?” he began with rapid speech which
28934: was meant to have a tone of tender remonstrance, accompanied with
28935: various quick gestures like an abbreviated finger-language. “What were
28936: you afraid of? You knew I never made you do anything against your will.
28937: It was for your sake I broke up your engagement in the Vorstadt,
28938: because I saw it didn’t suit you, and you repaid me by leaving me to
28939: the bad times that came in consequence. I had made an easier engagement
28940: for you at the Vorstadt Theater in Dresden: I didn’t tell you, because
28941: I wanted to take you by surprise. And you left me planted
28942: there—obliged to make myself scarce because I had broken contract.
28943: That was hard lines for me, after I had given up everything for the
28944: sake of getting you an education which was to be a fortune to you. What
28945: father devoted himself to his daughter more than I did to you? You know
28946: how I bore that disappointment in your voice, and made the best of it:
28947: and when I had nobody besides you, and was getting broken, as a man
28948: must who has had to fight his way with his brains—you chose that time
28949: to leave me. Who else was it you owed everything to, if not to me? and
28950: where was your feeling in return? For what my daughter cared, I might
28951: have died in a ditch.”
28952: 
28953: Lapidoth stopped short here, not from lack of invention, but because he
28954: had reached a pathetic climax, and gave a sudden sob, like a woman’s,
28955: taking out hastily an old yellow silk handkerchief. He really felt that
28956: his daughter had treated him ill—a sort of sensibility which is
28957: naturally strong in unscrupulous persons, who put down what is owing to
28958: them, without any _per contra_. Mirah, in spite of that sob, had energy
28959: enough not to let him suppose that he deceived her. She answered more
28960: firmly, though it was the first time she had ever used accusing words
28961: to him.
28962: 
28963: “You know why I left you, father; and I had reason to distrust you,
28964: because I felt sure that you had deceived my mother. If I could have
28965: trusted you, I would have stayed with you and worked for you.”
28966: 
28967: “I never meant to deceive your mother, Mirah,” said Lapidoth, putting
28968: back his handkerchief, but beginning with a voice that seemed to
28969: struggle against further sobbing. “I meant to take you back to her, but
28970: chances hindered me just at the time, and then there came information
28971: of her death. It was better for you that I should stay where I was, and
28972: your brother could take care of himself. Nobody had any claim on me but
28973: you. I had word of your mother’s death from a particular friend, who
28974: had undertaken to manage things for me, and I sent him over money to
28975: pay expenses. There’s one chance to be sure—” Lapidoth had quickly
28976: conceived that he must guard against something unlikely, yet
28977: possible—“he may have written me lies for the sake of getting the
28978: money out of me.”
28979: 
28980: Mirah made no answer; she could not bear to utter the only true one—“I
28981: don’t believe one word of what you say”—and she simply showed a wish
28982: that they should walk on, feeling that their standing still might draw
28983: down unpleasant notice. Even as they walked along, their companionship
28984: might well have made a passer-by turn back to look at them. The figure
28985: of Mirah, with her beauty set off by the quiet, careful dress of an
28986: English lady, made a strange pendant to this shabby, foreign-looking,
28987: eager, and gesticulating man, who withal had an ineffaceable jauntiness
28988: of air, perhaps due to the bushy curls of his grizzled hair, the
28989: smallness of his hands and feet, and his light walk.
28990: 
28991: “You seem to have done well for yourself, Mirah? _You_ are in no want,
28992: I see,” said the father, looking at her with emphatic examination.
28993: 
28994: “Good friends who found me in distress have helped me to get work,”
28995: said Mirah, hardly knowing what she actually said, from being occupied
28996: with what she would presently have to say. “I give lessons. I have sung
28997: in private houses. I have just been singing at a private concert.” She
28998: paused, and then added, with significance, “I have very good friends,
28999: who know all about me.”
29000: 
29001: “And you would be ashamed they should see your father in this plight?
29002: No wonder. I came to England with no prospect, but the chance of
29003: finding you. It was a mad quest; but a father’s heart is
29004: superstitious—feels a loadstone drawing it somewhere or other. I might
29005: have done very well, staying abroad: when I hadn’t you to take care of,
29006: I could have rolled or settled as easily as a ball; but it’s hard being
29007: lonely in the world, when your spirit’s beginning to break. And I
29008: thought my little Mirah would repent leaving her father when she came
29009: to look back. I’ve had a sharp pinch to work my way; I don’t know what
29010: I shall come down to next. Talents like mine are no use in this
29011: country. When a man’s getting out at elbows nobody will believe in him.
29012: I couldn’t get any decent employ with my appearance. I’ve been obliged
29013: to get pretty low for a shilling already.”
29014: 
29015: Mirah’s anxiety was quick enough to imagine her father’s sinking into a
29016: further degradation, which she was bound to hinder if she could. But
29017: before she could answer his string of inventive sentences, delivered
29018: with as much glibness as if they had been learned by rote, he added
29019: promptly,
29020: 
29021: “Where do you live, Mirah?”
29022: 
29023: “Here, in this square. We are not far from the house.”
29024: 
29025: “In lodgings?”
29026: 
29027: “Yes.”
29028: 
29029: “Any one to take care of you?”
29030: 
29031: “Yes,” said Mirah again, looking full at the keen face which was turned
29032: toward hers—“my brother.”
29033: 
29034: The father’s eyelids fluttered as if the lightning had come across
29035: them, and there was a slight movement of the shoulders. But he said,
29036: after a just perceptible pause: “Ezra? How did you know—how did you
29037: find him?”
29038: 
29039: “That would take long to tell. Here we are at the door. My brother
29040: would not wish me to close it on you.”
29041: 
29042: Mirah was already on the doorstep, but had her face turned toward her
29043: father, who stood below her on the pavement. Her heart had begun to
29044: beat faster with the prospect of what was coming in the presence of
29045: Ezra; and already in this attitude of giving leave to the father whom
29046: she had been used to obey—in this sight of him standing below her,
29047: with a perceptible shrinking from the admission which he had been
29048: indirectly asking for, she had a pang of the peculiar, sympathetic
29049: humiliation and shame—the stabbed heart of reverence—which belongs to
29050: a nature intensely filial.
29051: 
29052: “Stay a minute, _Liebchen_,” said Lapidoth, speaking in a lowered tone;
29053: “what sort of man has Ezra turned out?”
29054: 
29055: “A good man—a wonderful man,” said Mirah, with slow emphasis, trying
29056: to master the agitation which made her voice more tremulous as she went
29057: on. She felt urged to prepare her father for the complete penetration
29058: of himself which awaited him. “But he was very poor when my friends
29059: found him for me—a poor workman. Once—twelve years ago—he was strong
29060: and happy, going to the East, which he loved to think of; and my mother
29061: called him back because—because she had lost me. And he went to her,
29062: and took care of her through great trouble, and worked for her till she
29063: died—died in grief. And Ezra, too, had lost his health and strength.
29064: The cold had seized him coming back to my mother, because she was
29065: forsaken. For years he has been getting weaker—always poor, always
29066: working—but full of knowledge, and great-minded. All who come near him
29067: honor him. To stand before him is like standing before a prophet of
29068: God”—Mirah ended with difficulty, her heart throbbing—“falsehoods are
29069: no use.”
29070: 
29071: She had cast down her eyes that she might not see her father while she
29072: spoke the last words—unable to bear the ignoble look of frustration
29073: that gathered in his face. But he was none the less quick in invention
29074: and decision.
29075: 
29076: “Mirah, _Liebchen_,” he said, in the old caressing way, “shouldn’t you
29077: like me to make myself a little more respectable before my son sees me?
29078: If I had a little sum of money, I could fit myself out and come home to
29079: you as your father ought, and then I could offer myself for some decent
29080: place. With a good shirt and coat on my back, people would be glad
29081: enough to have me. I could offer myself for a courier, if I didn’t look
29082: like a broken-down mountebank. I should like to be with my children,
29083: and forget and forgive. But you have never seen your father look like
29084: this before. If you had ten pounds at hand—or I could appoint you to
29085: bring it me somewhere—I could fit myself out by the day after
29086: to-morrow.”
29087: 
29088: Mirah felt herself under a temptation which she must try to overcome.
29089: She answered, obliging herself to look at him again,
29090: 
29091: “I don’t like to deny you what you ask, father; but I have given a
29092: promise not to do things for you in secret. It _is_ hard to see you
29093: looking needy; but we will bear that for a little while; and then you
29094: can have new clothes, and we can pay for them.” Her practical sense
29095: made her see now what was Mrs. Meyrick’s wisdom in exacting a promise
29096: from her.
29097: 
29098: Lapidoth’s good humor gave way a little. He said, with a sneer, “You
29099: are a hard and fast young lady—you have been learning useful
29100: virtues—keeping promises not to help your father with a pound or two
29101: when you are getting money to dress yourself in silk—your father who
29102: made an idol of you, and gave up the best part of his life to providing
29103: for you.”
29104: 
29105: “It seems cruel—I know it seems cruel,” said Mirah, feeling this a
29106: worse moment than when she meant to drown herself. Her lips were
29107: suddenly pale. “But, father, it is more cruel to break the promises
29108: people trust in. That broke my mother’s heart—it has broken Ezra’s
29109: life. You and I must eat now this bitterness from what has been. Bear
29110: it. Bear to come in and be cared for as you are.”
29111: 
29112: “To-morrow, then,” said Lapidoth, almost turning on his heel away from
29113: this pale, trembling daughter, who seemed now to have got the
29114: inconvenient world to back her; but he quickly turned on it again, with
29115: his hands feeling about restlessly in his pockets, and said, with some
29116: return to his appealing tone, “I’m a little cut up with all this,
29117: Mirah. I shall get up my spirits by to-morrow. If you’ve a little money
29118: in your pocket, I suppose it isn’t against your promise to give me a
29119: trifle—to buy a cigar with.”
29120: 
29121: Mirah could not ask herself another question—could not do anything
29122: else than put her cold trembling hands in her pocket for her
29123: _portemonnaie_ and hold it out. Lapidoth grasped it at once, pressed
29124: her fingers the while, said, “Good-bye, my little girl—to-morrow
29125: then!” and left her. He had not taken many steps before he looked
29126: carefully into all the folds of the purse, found two half-sovereigns
29127: and odd silver, and, pasted against the folding cover, a bit of paper
29128: on which Ezra had inscribed, in a beautiful Hebrew character, the name
29129: of his mother, the days of her birth, marriage, and death, and the
29130: prayer, “May Mirah be delivered from evil.” It was Mirah’s liking to
29131: have this little inscription on many articles that she used. The father
29132: read it, and had a quick vision of his marriage day, and the bright,
29133: unblamed young fellow he was at that time; teaching many things, but
29134: expecting by-and-by to get money more easily by writing; and very fond
29135: of his beautiful bride Sara—crying when she expected him to cry, and
29136: reflecting every phase of her feeling with mimetic susceptibility.
29137: Lapidoth had traveled a long way from that young self, and thought of
29138: all that this inscription signified with an unemotional memory, which
29139: was like the ocular perception of a touch to one who has lost the sense
29140: of touch, or like morsels on an untasting palate, having shape and
29141: grain, but no flavor. Among the things we may gamble away in a lazy
29142: selfish life is the capacity for ruth, compunction, or any unselfish
29143: regret—which we may come to long for as one in slow death longs to
29144: feel laceration, rather than be conscious of a widening margin where
29145: consciousness once was. Mirah’s purse was a handsome one—a gift to
29146: her, which she had been unable to reflect about giving away—and
29147: Lapidoth presently found himself outside of his reverie, considering
29148: what the purse would fetch in addition to the sum it contained, and
29149: what prospect there was of his being able to get more from his daughter
29150: without submitting to adopt a penitential form of life under the eyes
29151: of that formidable son. On such a subject his susceptibilities were
29152: still lively.
29153: 
29154: Meanwhile Mirah had entered the house with her power of reticence
29155: overcome by the cruelty of her pain. She found her brother quietly
29156: reading and sifting old manuscripts of his own, which he meant to
29157: consign to Deronda. In the reaction from the long effort to master
29158: herself, she fell down before him and clasped his knees, sobbing, and
29159: crying, “Ezra, Ezra!”
29160: 
29161: He did not speak. His alarm for her spending itself on conceiving the
29162: cause of her distress, the more striking from the novelty in her of
29163: this violent manifestation. But Mirah’s own longing was to be able to
29164: speak and tell him the cause. Presently she raised her hand, and still
29165: sobbing, said brokenly,
29166: 
29167: “Ezra, my father! our father! He followed me. I wanted him to come in.
29168: I said you would let him come in. And he said No, he would not—not
29169: now, but to-morrow. And he begged for money from me. And I gave him my
29170: purse, and he went away.”
29171: 
29172: Mirah’s words seemed to herself to express all the misery she felt in
29173: them. Her brother found them less grievous than his preconceptions, and
29174: said gently, “Wait for calm, Mirah, and then tell me all,”—putting off
29175: her hat and laying his hands tenderly on her head. She felt the
29176: soothing influence, and in a few minutes told him as exactly as she
29177: could all that had happened.
29178: 
29179: “He will not come to-morrow,” said Mordecai. Neither of them said to
29180: the other what they both thought, namely, that he might watch for
29181: Mirah’s outgoings and beg from her again.
29182: 
29183: “Seest thou,” he presently added, “our lot is the lot of Israel. The
29184: grief and the glory are mingled as the smoke and the flame. It is
29185: because we children have inherited the good that we feel the evil.
29186: These things are wedded for us, as our father was wedded to our mother.”
29187: 
29188: The surroundings were of Brompton, but the voice might have come from a
29189: Rabbi transmitting the sentences of an elder time to be registered in
29190: _Babli_—by which (to our ears) affectionate-sounding diminutive is
29191: meant the voluminous Babylonian Talmud. “The Omnipresent,” said a
29192: Rabbi, “is occupied in making marriages.” The levity of the saying lies
29193: in the ear of him who hears it; for by marriages the speaker meant all
29194: the wondrous combinations of the universe whose issue makes our good
29195: and evil.
29196: 
29197: 
29198: 
29199: 
29200: CHAPTER LXIII.
29201: 
29202:    “Moses, trotz seiner Befeindung der Kunst, dennoch selber ein großer
29203:    Künstler war und den wahren Künstlergeist besaß. Nur war dieser
29204:    Künstlergeist bei ihm, wie bei seinen ägyptischen Landsleuten, nur
29205:    auf das Kolossale und Unverwüstliche gerichtet. Aber nicht wie die
29206:    Ägypter formierte er seine Kunstwerke aus Backstein und Granit,
29207:    sondern er baute Menschenpyramiden, er meisselte Menschenobelisken,
29208:    er nahm einen armen Hirtenstamm und schuf daraus ein Volk, das
29209:    ebenfalls den Jahrhunderten trotzen sollte . . . er schuf
29210:    Israel!”—HEINE:    _Geständnisse_.
29211: 
29212: 
29213: Imagine the difference in Deronda’s state of mind when he left England
29214: and when he returned to it. He had set out for Genoa in total
29215: uncertainty how far the actual bent of his wishes and affections would
29216: be encouraged—how far the claims revealed to him might draw him into
29217: new paths, far away from the tracks his thoughts had lately been
29218: pursuing with a consent of desire which uncertainty made dangerous. He
29219: came back with something like a discovered charter warranting the
29220: inherited right that his ambition had begun to yearn for: he came back
29221: with what was better than freedom—with a duteous bond which his
29222: experience had been preparing him to accept gladly, even if it had been
29223: attended with no promise of satisfying a secret passionate longing
29224: never yet allowed to grow into a hope. But now he dared avow to himself
29225: the hidden selection of his love. Since the hour when he left the house
29226: at Chelsea in full-hearted silence under the effect of Mirah’s farewell
29227: look and words—their exquisite appealingness stirring in him that
29228: deep-laid care for womanhood which had begun when his own lip was like
29229: a girl’s—her hold on his feeling had helped him to be blameless in
29230: word and deed under the difficult circumstances we know of. There
29231: seemed no likelihood that he could ever woo this creature who had
29232: become dear to him amidst associations that forbade wooing; yet she had
29233: taken her place in his soul as a beloved type—reducing the power of
29234: other fascination and making a difference in it that became deficiency.
29235: The influence had been continually strengthened. It had lain in the
29236: course of poor Gwendolen’s lot that her dependence on Deronda tended to
29237: rouse in him the enthusiasm of self-martyring pity rather than of
29238: personal love, and his less constrained tenderness flowed with the
29239: fuller stream toward an indwelling image in all things unlike
29240: Gwendolen. Still more, his relation to Mordecai had brought with it a
29241: new nearness to Mirah which was not the less agitating because there
29242: was no apparent change in his position toward her; and she had
29243: inevitably been bound up in all the thoughts that made him shrink from
29244: an issue disappointing to her brother. This process had not gone on
29245: unconsciously in Deronda: he was conscious of it as we are of some
29246: covetousness that it would be better to nullify by encouraging other
29247: thoughts than to give it the insistency of confession even to
29248: ourselves: but the jealous fire had leaped out at Hans’s pretensions,
29249: and when his mother accused him of being in love with a Jewess any
29250: evasion suddenly seemed an infidelity. His mother had compelled him to
29251: a decisive acknowledgment of his love, as Joseph Kalonymos had
29252: compelled him to a definite expression of his resolve. This new state
29253: of decision wrought on Deronda with a force which surprised even
29254: himself. There was a release of all the energy which had long been
29255: spent in self-checking and suppression because of doubtful conditions;
29256: and he was ready to laugh at his own impetuosity when, as he neared
29257: England on his way from Mainz, he felt the remaining distance more and
29258: more of an obstruction. It was as if he had found an added soul in
29259: finding his ancestry—his judgment no longer wandering in the mazes of
29260: impartial sympathy, but choosing, with that partiality which is man’s
29261: best strength, the closer fellowship that makes sympathy
29262: practical—exchanging that bird’s eye reasonableness which soars to
29263: avoid preference and loses all sense of quality for the generous
29264: reasonableness of drawing shoulder to shoulder with men of like
29265: inheritance. He wanted now to be again with Mordecai, to pour forth
29266: instead of restraining his feeling, to admit agreement and maintain
29267: dissent, and all the while to find Mirah’s presence without the
29268: embarrassment of obviously seeking it, to see her in the light of a new
29269: possibility, to interpret her looks and words from a new
29270: starting-point. He was not greatly alarmed about the effect of Hans’s
29271: attentions, but he had a presentiment that her feeling toward himself
29272: had from the first lain in a channel from which it was not likely to be
29273: diverted into love. To astonish a woman by turning into her lover when
29274: she has been thinking of you merely as a Lord Chancellor is what a man
29275: naturally shrinks from: he is anxious to create an easier transition.
29276: 
29277: What wonder that Deronda saw no other course than to go straight from
29278: the London railway station to the lodgings in that small square in
29279: Brompton? Every argument was in favor of his losing no time. He had
29280: promised to run down the next day to see Lady Mallinger at the Abbey,
29281: and it was already sunset. He wished to deposit the precious chest with
29282: Mordecai, who would study its contents, both in his absence and in
29283: company with him; and that he should pay this visit without pause would
29284: gratify Mordecai’s heart. Hence, and for other reasons, it gratified
29285: Deronda’s heart. The strongest tendencies of his nature were rushing in
29286: one current—the fervent affectionateness which made him delight in
29287: meeting the wish of beings near to him, and the imaginative need of
29288: some far-reaching relation to make the horizon of his immediate, daily
29289: acts. It has to be admitted that in this classical, romantic,
29290: world-historic position of his, bringing as it were from its
29291: hiding-place his hereditary armor, he wore—but so, one must suppose,
29292: did the most ancient heroes, whether Semitic or Japhetic—the summer
29293: costume of his contemporaries. He did not reflect that the drab tints
29294: were becoming to him, for he rarely went to the expense of such
29295: thinking; but his own depth of coloring, which made the becomingness,
29296: got an added radiance in the eyes, a fleeting and returning glow in the
29297: skin, as he entered the house wondering what exactly he should find. He
29298: made his entrance as noiseless as possible.
29299: 
29300: It was the evening of that same afternoon on which Mirah had had the
29301: interview with her father. Mordecai, penetrated by her grief, and also
29302: the sad memories which the incident had awakened, had not resumed his
29303: task of sifting papers: some of them had fallen scattered on the floor
29304: in the first moments of anxiety, and neither he nor Mirah had thought
29305: of laying them in order again. They had sat perfectly still together,
29306: not knowing how long; while the clock ticked on the mantel-piece, and
29307: the light was fading, Mirah, unable to think of the food that she ought
29308: to have been taking, had not moved since she had thrown off her
29309: dust-cloak and sat down beside Mordecai with her hand in his, while he
29310: had laid his head backward, with closed eyes and difficult breathing,
29311: looking, Mirah thought, as he would look when the soul within him could
29312: no longer live in its straitened home. The thought that his death might
29313: be near was continually visiting her when she saw his face in this way,
29314: without its vivid animation; and now, to the rest of her grief, was
29315: added the regret that she had been unable to control the violent
29316: outburst which had shaken him. She sat watching him—her oval cheeks
29317: pallid, her eyes with the sorrowful brilliancy left by young tears, her
29318: curls in as much disorder as a just-awakened child’s—watching that
29319: emaciated face, where it might have been imagined that a veil had been
29320: drawn never to be lifted, as if it were her dead joy which had left her
29321: strong enough to live on in sorrow. And life at that moment stretched
29322: before Mirah with more than a repetition of former sadness. The shadow
29323: of the father was there, and more than that, a double bereavement—of
29324: one living as well as one dead.
29325: 
29326: But now the door was opened, and while none entered, a well-known voice
29327: said: “Daniel Deronda—may he come in?”
29328: 
29329: “Come! come!” said Mordecai, immediately rising with an irradiated face
29330: and opened eyes—apparently as little surprised as if he had seen
29331: Deronda in the morning, and expected this evening visit; while Mirah
29332: started up blushing with confused, half-alarmed expectation.
29333: 
29334: Yet when Deronda entered, the sight of him was like the clearness after
29335: rain: no clouds to come could hinder the cherishing beam of that
29336: moment. As he held out his right hand to Mirah, who was close to her
29337: brother’s left, he laid his other hand on Mordecai’s right shoulder,
29338: and stood so a moment, holding them both at once, uttering no word, but
29339: reading their faces, till he said anxiously to Mirah, “Has anything
29340: happened?—any trouble?”
29341: 
29342: “Talk not of trouble now,” said Mordecai, saving her from the need to
29343: answer. “There is joy in your face—let the joy be ours.”
29344: 
29345: Mirah thought, “It is for something he cannot tell us.” But they all
29346: sat down, Deronda drawing a chair close in front of Mordecai.
29347: 
29348: “That is true,” he said, emphatically. “I have a joy which will remain
29349: to us even in the worst trouble. I did not tell you the reason of my
29350: journey abroad, Mordecai, because—never mind—I went to learn my
29351: parentage. And you were right. I am a Jew.”
29352: 
29353: The two men clasped hands with a movement that seemed part of the flash
29354: from Mordecai’s eyes, and passed through Mirah like an electric shock.
29355: But Deronda went on without pause, speaking from Mordecai’s mind as
29356: much as from his own,
29357: 
29358: “We have the same people. Our souls have the same vocation. We shall
29359: not be separated by life or by death.”
29360: 
29361: Mordecai’s answer was uttered in Hebrew, and in no more than a loud
29362: whisper. It was in the liturgical words which express the religious
29363: bond: “Our God and the God of our fathers.”
29364: 
29365: The weight of feeling pressed too strongly on that ready-winged speech
29366: which usually moved in quick adaptation to every stirring of his fervor.
29367: 
29368: Mirah fell on her knees by her brother’s side, and looked at his now
29369: illuminated face, which had just before been so deathly. The action was
29370: an inevitable outlet of the violent reversal from despondency to a
29371: gladness which came over her as solemnly as if she had been beholding a
29372: religious rite. For the moment she thought of the effect on her own
29373: life only through the effect on her brother.
29374: 
29375: “And it is not only that I am a Jew,” Deronda went on, enjoying one of
29376: those rare moments when our yearnings and our acts can be completely
29377: one, and the real we behold is our ideal good; “but I come of a strain
29378: that has ardently maintained the fellowship of our race—a line of
29379: Spanish Jews that has borne many students and men of practical power.
29380: And I possess what will give us a sort of communion with them. My
29381: grandfather, Daniel Charisi, preserved manuscripts, family records
29382: stretching far back, in the hope that they would pass into the hands of
29383: his grandson. And now his hope is fulfilled, in spite of attempts to
29384: thwart it by hiding my parentage from me. I possess the chest
29385: containing them, with his own papers, and it is down below in this
29386: house. I mean to leave it with you, Mordecai, that you may help me to
29387: study the manuscripts. Some of them I can read easily enough—those in
29388: Spanish and Italian. Others are in Hebrew, and, I think, Arabic; but
29389: there seem to be Latin translations. I was only able to look at them
29390: cursorily while I stayed at Mainz. We will study them together.”
29391: 
29392: Deronda ended with that bright smile which, beaming out from the
29393: habitual gravity of his face, seemed a revelation (the reverse of the
29394: continual smile that discredits all expression). But when this happy
29395: glance passed from Mordecai to rest on Mirah, it acted like a little
29396: too much sunshine, and made her change her attitude. She had knelt
29397: under an impulse with which any personal embarrassment was incongruous,
29398: and especially any thoughts about how Mrs. Grandcourt might stand to
29399: this new aspect of things—thoughts which made her color under
29400: Deronda’s glance, and rise to take her seat again in her usual posture
29401: of crossed hands and feet, with the effort to look as quiet as
29402: possible. Deronda, equally sensitive, imagined that the feeling of
29403: which he was conscious, had entered too much into his eyes, and had
29404: been repugnant to her. He was ready enough to believe that any
29405: unexpected manifestation might spoil her feeling toward him—and then
29406: his precious relation to brother and sister would be marred. If Mirah
29407: could have no love for him, any advances of love on his part would make
29408: her wretched in that continual contact with him which would remain
29409: inevitable.
29410: 
29411: While such feelings were pulsating quickly in Deronda and Mirah,
29412: Mordecai, seeing nothing in his friend’s presence and words but a
29413: blessed fulfillment, was already speaking with his old sense of
29414: enlargement in utterance,
29415: 
29416: “Daniel, from the first, I have said to you, we know not all the
29417: pathways. Has there not been a meeting among them, as of the operations
29418: in one soul, where an idea being born and breathing draws the elements
29419: toward it, and is fed and glows? For all things are bound together in
29420: that Omnipresence which is the place and habitation of the world, and
29421: events are of a glass wherethrough our eyes see some of the pathways.
29422: And if it seems that the erring and unloving wills of men have helped
29423: to prepare you, as Moses was prepared, to serve your people the better,
29424: that depends on another order than the law which must guide our
29425: footsteps. For the evil will of man makes not a people’s good except by
29426: stirring the righteous will of man; and beneath all the clouds with
29427: which our thought encompasses the Eternal, this is clear—that a people
29428: can be blessed only by having counsellors and a multitude whose will
29429: moves in obedience to the laws of justice and love. For see, now, it
29430: was your loving will that made a chief pathway, and resisted the effect
29431: of evil; for, by performing the duties of brotherhood to my sister, and
29432: seeking out her brother in the flesh, your soul has been prepared to
29433: receive with gladness this message of the Eternal, ‘behold the
29434: multitude of your brethren.’”
29435: 
29436: “It is quite true that you and Mirah have been my teachers,” said
29437: Deronda. “If this revelation had been made to me before I knew you
29438: both, I think my mind would have rebelled against it. Perhaps I should
29439: have felt then—‘If I could have chosen, I would not have been a Jew.’
29440: What I feel now is—that my whole being is a consent to the fact. But
29441: it has been the gradual accord between your mind and mine which has
29442: brought about that full consent.”
29443: 
29444: At the moment Deronda was speaking, that first evening in the book-shop
29445: was vividly in his remembrance, with all the struggling aloofness he
29446: had then felt from Mordecai’s prophetic confidence. It was his nature
29447: to delight in satisfying to the utmost the eagerly-expectant soul,
29448: which seemed to be looking out from the face before him, like the
29449: long-enduring watcher who at last sees the mountain signal-flame; and
29450: he went on with fuller fervor,
29451: 
29452: “It is through your inspiration that I have discerned what may be my
29453: life’s task. It is you who have given shape to what, I believe, was an
29454: inherited yearning—the effect of brooding, passionate thoughts in many
29455: ancestors—thoughts that seem to have been intensely present in my
29456: grandfather. Suppose the stolen offspring of some mountain tribe
29457: brought up in a city of the plain, or one with an inherited genius for
29458: painting, and born blind—the ancestral life would lie within them as a
29459: dim longing for unknown objects and sensations, and the spell-bound
29460: habit of their inherited frames would be like a cunningly-wrought
29461: musical instrument, never played on, but quivering throughout in uneasy
29462: mysterious meanings of its intricate structure that, under the right
29463: touch, gives music. Something like that, I think, has been my
29464: experience. Since I began to read and know, I have always longed for
29465: some ideal task, in which I might feel myself the heart and brain of a
29466: multitude—some social captainship, which would come to me as a duty,
29467: and not be striven for as a personal prize. You have raised the image
29468: of such a task for me—to bind our race together in spite of heresy.
29469: You have said to me—‘Our religion united us before it divided us—it
29470: made us a people before it made Rabbanites and Karaites.’ I mean to try
29471: what can be done with that union—I mean to work in your spirit.
29472: Failure will not be ignoble, but it would be ignoble for me not to try.”
29473: 
29474: “Even as my brother that fed at the breasts of my mother,” said
29475: Mordecai, falling back in his chair with a look of exultant repose, as
29476: after some finished labor.
29477: 
29478: To estimate the effect of this ardent outpouring from Deronda we must
29479: remember his former reserve, his careful avoidance of premature assent
29480: or delusive encouragement, which gave to this decided pledge of himself
29481: a sacramental solemnity, both for his own mind and Mordecai’s. On Mirah
29482: the effect was equally strong, though with a difference: she felt a
29483: surprise which had no place in her brother’s mind, at Deronda’s
29484: suddenly revealed sense of nearness to them: there seemed to be a
29485: breaking of day around her which might show her other facts unlike her
29486: forebodings in the darkness. But after a moment’s silence Mordecai
29487: spoke again,
29488: 
29489: “It has begun already—the marriage of our souls. It waits but the
29490: passing away of this body, and then they who are betrothed shall unite
29491: in a stricter bond, and what is mine shall be thine. Call nothing mine
29492: that I have written, Daniel; for though our masters delivered rightly
29493: that everything should be quoted in the name of him that said it—and
29494: their rule is good—yet it does not exclude the willing marriage which
29495: melts soul into soul, and makes thought fuller as the clear waters are
29496: made fuller, where the fullness is inseparable and the clearness is
29497: inseparable. For I have judged what I have written, and I desire the
29498: body that I gave my thought to pass away as this fleshly body will
29499: pass; but let the thought be born again from our fuller soul which
29500: shall be called yours.”
29501: 
29502: “You must not ask me to promise that,” said Deronda, smiling. “I must
29503: be convinced first of special reasons for it in the writings
29504: themselves. And I am too backward a pupil yet. That blent transmission
29505: must go on without any choice of ours; but what we can’t hinder must
29506: not make our rule for what we ought to choose. I think our duty is
29507: faithful tradition where we can attain it. And so you would insist for
29508: any one but yourself. Don’t ask me to deny my spiritual parentage, when
29509: I am finding the clue of my life in the recognition of natural
29510: parentage.”
29511: 
29512: “I will ask for no promise till you see the reason,” said Mordecai.
29513: “You have said the truth: I would obey the Master’s rule for another.
29514: But for years my hope, nay, my confidence, has been, not that the
29515: imperfect image of my thought, which is an ill-shaped work of the
29516: youthful carver who has seen a heavenly pattern, and trembles in
29517: imitating the vision—not that this should live, but that my vision and
29518: passion should enter into yours—yea, into yours; for he whom I longed
29519: for afar, was he not you whom I discerned as mine when you came near?
29520: Nevertheless, you shall judge. For my soul is satisfied.” Mordecai
29521: paused, and then began in a changed tone, reverting to previous
29522: suggestions from Deronda’s disclosure: “What moved your parents——?”
29523: but he immediately checked himself, and added, “Nay, I ask not that you
29524: should tell me aught concerning others, unless it is your pleasure.”
29525: 
29526: “Some time—gradually—you will know all,” said Deronda. “But now tell
29527: me more about yourselves, and how the time has passed since I went
29528: away. I am sure there has been some trouble. Mirah has been in distress
29529: about something.”
29530: 
29531: He looked at Mirah, but she immediately turned to her brother,
29532: appealing to him to give the difficult answer. She hoped he would not
29533: think it necessary to tell Deronda the facts about her father on such
29534: an evening as this. Just when Deronda had brought himself so near, and
29535: identified himself with her brother, it was cutting to her that he
29536: should hear of this disgrace clinging about them, which seemed to have
29537: become partly his. To relieve herself she rose to take up her hat and
29538: cloak, thinking she would go to her own room: perhaps they would speak
29539: more easily when she had left them. But meanwhile Mordecai said,
29540: 
29541: “To-day there has been a grief. A duty which seemed to have gone far
29542: into the distance, has come back and turned its face upon us, and
29543: raised no gladness—has raised a dread that we must submit to. But for
29544: the moment we are delivered from any visible yoke. Let us defer
29545: speaking of it as if this evening which is deepening about us were the
29546: beginning of the festival in which we must offer the first fruits of
29547: our joy, and mingle no mourning with them.”
29548: 
29549: Deronda divined the hinted grief, and left it in silence, rising as he
29550: saw Mirah rise, and saying to her, “Are you going? I must leave almost
29551: immediately—when I and Mrs. Adam have mounted the precious chest, and
29552: I have delivered the key to Mordecai—no, Ezra,—may I call him Ezra
29553: now? I have learned to think of him as Ezra since I have heard you call
29554: him so.”
29555: 
29556: “Please call him Ezra,” said Mirah, faintly, feeling a new timidity
29557: under Deronda’s glance and near presence. Was there really something
29558: different about him, or was the difference only in her feeling? The
29559: strangely various emotions of the last few hours had exhausted her; she
29560: was faint with fatigue and want of food. Deronda, observing her pallor
29561: and tremulousness, longed to show more feeling, but dared not. She put
29562: out her hand with an effort to smile, and then he opened the door for
29563: her. That was all.
29564: 
29565: A man of refined pride shrinks from making a lover’s approaches to a
29566: woman whose wealth or rank might make them appear presumptuous or
29567: low-motived; but Deronda was finding a more delicate difficulty in a
29568: position which, superficially taken, was the reverse of that—though to
29569: an ardent reverential love, the loved woman has always a kind of wealth
29570: and rank which makes a man keenly susceptible about the aspect of his
29571: addresses. Deronda’s difficulty was what any generous man might have
29572: felt in some degree; but it affected him peculiarly through his
29573: imaginative sympathy with a mind in which gratitude was strong. Mirah,
29574: he knew, felt herself bound to him by deep obligations, which to her
29575: sensibilities might give every wish of his the aspect of a claim; and
29576: an inability to fulfill it would cause her a pain continually revived
29577: by their inevitable communion in care of Ezra. Here were fears not of
29578: pride only, but of extreme tenderness. Altogether, to have the
29579: character of a benefactor seemed to Deronda’s anxiety an insurmountable
29580: obstacle to confessing himself a lover, unless in some inconceivable
29581: way it could be revealed to him that Mirah’s heart had accepted him
29582: beforehand. And the agitation on his own account, too, was not small.
29583: 
29584: Even a man who has practised himself in love-making till his own
29585: glibness has rendered him sceptical, may at last be overtaken by the
29586: lover’s awe—may tremble, stammer, and show other signs of recovered
29587: sensibility no more in the range of his acquired talents than pins and
29588: needles after numbness: how much more may that energetic timidity
29589: possess a man whose inward history has cherished his susceptibilities
29590: instead of dulling them, and has kept all the language of passion fresh
29591: and rooted as the lovely leafage about the hill-side spring!
29592: 
29593: As for Mirah her dear head lay on its pillow that night with its former
29594: suspicions thrown out of shape but still present, like an ugly story
29595: which had been discredited but not therefore dissipated. All that she
29596: was certain of about Deronda seemed to prove that he had no such
29597: fetters upon him as she had been allowing herself to believe in. His
29598: whole manner as well as his words implied that there were no hidden
29599: bonds remaining to have any effect in determining his future. But
29600: notwithstanding this plainly reasonable inference, uneasiness still
29601: clung about Mirah’s heart. Deronda was not to blame, but he had an
29602: importance for Mrs. Grandcourt which must give her some hold on him.
29603: And the thought of any close confidence between them stirred the little
29604: biting snake that had long lain curled and harmless in Mirah’s gentle
29605: bosom.
29606: 
29607: But did she this evening feel as completely as before that her jealousy
29608: was no less remote from any possibility for herself personally than if
29609: her human soul had been lodged in the body of a fawn that Deronda had
29610: saved from the archers? Hardly. Something indefinable had happened and
29611: made a difference. The soft warm rain of blossoms which had fallen just
29612: where she was—did it really come because she was there? What spirit
29613: was there among the boughs?
29614: 
29615: 
29616: 
29617: 
29618: CHAPTER LXIV.
29619: 
29620:         “Questa montagna è tale,
29621:   Che sempre al cominciar di sotto è grave.
29622:   E quanto uom più va su e men fa male.”
29623:                   —DANTE: _Il Purgatorio_.
29624: 
29625: 
29626: It was not many days after her mother’s arrival that Gwendolen would
29627: consent to remain at Genoa. Her desire to get away from that gem of the
29628: sea, helped to rally her strength and courage. For what place, though
29629: it were the flowery vale of Enna, may not the inward sense turn into a
29630: circle of punishment where the flowers are no better than a crop of
29631: flame-tongues burning the soles of our feet?
29632: 
29633: “I shall never like to see the Mediterranean again,” said Gwendolen, to
29634: her mother, who thought that she quite understood her child’s
29635: feeling—even in her tacit prohibition of any express reference to her
29636: late husband.
29637: 
29638: Mrs. Davilow, indeed, though compelled formally to regard this time as
29639: one of severe calamity, was virtually enjoying her life more than she
29640: had ever done since her daughter’s marriage. It seemed that her darling
29641: was brought back to her not merely with all the old affection, but with
29642: a conscious cherishing of her mother’s nearness, such as we give to a
29643: possession that we have been on the brink of losing.
29644: 
29645: “Are you there, mamma?” cried Gwendolen, in the middle of the night (a
29646: bed had been made for her mother in the same room with hers), very much
29647: as she would have done in her early girlhood, if she had felt
29648: frightened in lying awake.
29649: 
29650: “Yes, dear; can I do anything for you?”
29651: 
29652: “No, thank you; only I like so to know you are there. Do you mind my
29653: waking you?” (This question would hardly have been Gwendolen’s in her
29654: early girlhood.)
29655: 
29656: “I was not asleep, darling.”
29657: 
29658: “It seemed not real that you were with me. I wanted to make it real. I
29659: can bear things if you are with me. But you must not lie awake, anxious
29660: about me. You must be happy now. You must let me make you happy now at
29661: last—else what shall I do?”
29662: 
29663: “God bless you, dear; I have the best happiness I can have, when you
29664: make much of me.”
29665: 
29666: But the next night, hearing that she was sighing and restless Mrs.
29667: Davilow said, “Let me give you your sleeping-draught, Gwendolen.”
29668: 
29669: “No, mamma, thank you; I don’t want to sleep.”
29670: 
29671: “It would be so good for you to sleep more, my darling.”
29672: 
29673: “Don’t say what would be good for me, mamma,” Gwendolen answered,
29674: impetuously. “You don’t know what would be good for me. You and my
29675: uncle must not contradict me and tell me anything is good for me when I
29676: feel it is not good.”
29677: 
29678: Mrs. Davilow was silent, not wondering that the poor child was
29679: irritable. Presently Gwendolen said,
29680: 
29681: “I was always naughty to you, mamma.”
29682: 
29683: “No, dear, no.”
29684: 
29685: “Yes, I was,” said Gwendolen insistently. “It is because I was always
29686: wicked that I am miserable now.”
29687: 
29688: She burst into sobs and cries. The determination to be silent about all
29689: the facts of her married life and its close, reacted in these escapes
29690: of enigmatic excitement.
29691: 
29692: But dim lights of interpretation were breaking on the mother’s mind
29693: through the information that came from Sir Hugo to Mr. Gascoigne, and,
29694: with some omissions, from Mr. Gascoigne to herself. The good-natured
29695: baronet, while he was attending to all decent measures in relation to
29696: his nephew’s death, and the possible washing ashore of the body,
29697: thought it the kindest thing he could do to use his present friendly
29698: intercourse with the rector as an opportunity for communicating with
29699: him, in the mildest way, the purport of Grandcourt’s will, so as to
29700: save him the additional shock that would be in store for him if he
29701: carried his illusions all the way home. Perhaps Sir Hugo would have
29702: been communicable enough without that kind motive, but he really felt
29703: the motive. He broke the unpleasant news to the rector by degrees: at
29704: first he only implied his fear that the widow was not so splendidly
29705: provided for as Mr. Gascoigne, nay, as the baronet himself had
29706: expected; and only at last, after some previous vague reference to
29707: large claims on Grandcourt, he disclosed the prior relations which, in
29708: the unfortunate absence of a legitimate heir, had determined all the
29709: splendor in another direction.
29710: 
29711: The rector was deeply hurt, and remembered, more vividly than he had
29712: ever done before, how offensively proud and repelling the manners of
29713: the deceased had been toward him—remembered also that he himself, in
29714: that interesting period just before the arrival of the new occupant at
29715: Diplow, had received hints of former entangling dissipations, and an
29716: undue addiction to pleasure, though he had not foreseen that the
29717: pleasure which had probably, so to speak, been swept into private
29718: rubbish-heaps, would ever present itself as an array of live
29719: caterpillars, disastrous to the green meat of respectable people. But
29720: he did not make these retrospective thoughts audible to Sir Hugo, or
29721: lower himself by expressing any indignation on merely personal grounds,
29722: but behaved like a man of the world who had become a conscientious
29723: clergyman. His first remark was,
29724: 
29725: “When a young man makes his will in health, he usually counts on living
29726: a long while. Probably Mr. Grandcourt did not believe that this will
29727: would ever have its present effect.” After a moment, he added, “The
29728: effect is painful in more ways than one. Female morality is likely to
29729: suffer from this marked advantage and prominence being given to
29730: illegitimate offspring.”
29731: 
29732: “Well, in point of fact,” said Sir Hugo, in his comfortable way, “since
29733: the boy is there, this was really the best alternative for the disposal
29734: of the estates. Grandcourt had nobody nearer than his cousin. And it’s
29735: a chilling thought that you go out of this life only for the benefit of
29736: a cousin. A man gets a little pleasure in making his will, if it’s for
29737: the good of his own curly heads; but it’s a nuisance when you’re giving
29738: the bequeathing to a used-up fellow like yourself, and one you don’t
29739: care two straws for. It’s the next worse thing to having only a life
29740: interest in your estates. No; I forgive Grandcourt for that part of his
29741: will. But, between ourselves, what I don’t forgive him for, is the
29742: shabby way he has provided for your niece—_our_ niece, I will say—no
29743: better a position than if she had been a doctor’s widow. Nothing grates
29744: on me more than that posthumous grudgingness toward a wife. A man ought
29745: to have some pride and fondness for his widow. _I_ should, I know. I
29746: take it as a test of a man, that he feels the easier about his death
29747: when he can think of his wife and daughters being comfortable after it.
29748: I like that story of the fellows in the Crimean war, who were ready to
29749: go to the bottom of the sea if their widows were provided for.”
29750: 
29751: “It has certainly taken me by surprise,” said Mr. Gascoigne, “all the
29752: more because, as the one who stood in the place of father to my niece,
29753: I had shown my reliance on Mr. Grandcourt’s apparent liberality in
29754: money matters by making no claims for her beforehand. That seemed to me
29755: due to him under the circumstances. Probably you think me blamable.”
29756: 
29757: “Not blamable exactly. I respect a man for trusting another. But take
29758: my advice. If you marry another niece, though it may be to the
29759: Archbishop of Canterbury, bind him down. Your niece can’t be married
29760: for the first time twice over. And if he’s a good fellow, he’ll wish to
29761: be bound. But as to Mrs. Grandcourt, I can only say that I feel my
29762: relation to her all the nearer because I think that she has not been
29763: well treated. And I hope you will urge her to rely on me as a friend.”
29764: 
29765: Thus spake the chivalrous Sir Hugo, in his disgust at the young and
29766: beautiful widow of a Mallinger Grandcourt being left with only two
29767: thousand a year and a house in a coal-mining district. To the rector
29768: that income naturally appeared less shabby and less accompanied with
29769: mortifying privations; but in this conversation he had devoured a much
29770: keener sense than the baronet’s of the humiliation cast over his niece,
29771: and also over her nearest friends, by the conspicuous publishing of her
29772: husband’s relation to Mrs. Glasher. And like all men who are good
29773: husbands and fathers, he felt the humiliation through the minds of the
29774: women who would be chiefly affected by it; so that the annoyance of
29775: first hearing the facts was far slighter than what he felt in
29776: communicating them to Mrs. Davilow, and in anticipating Gwendolen’s
29777: feeling whenever her mother saw fit to tell her of them. For the good
29778: rector had an innocent conviction that his niece was unaware of Mrs.
29779: Glasher’s existence, arguing with masculine soundness from what maidens
29780: and wives were likely to know, do, and suffer, and having had a most
29781: imperfect observation of the particular maiden and wife in question.
29782: Not so Gwendolen’s mother, who now thought that she saw an explanation
29783: of much that had been enigmatic in her child’s conduct and words before
29784: and after her engagement, concluding that in some inconceivable way
29785: Gwendolen had been informed of this left-handed marriage and the
29786: existence of the children. She trusted to opportunities that would
29787: arise in moments of affectionate confidence before and during their
29788: journey to England, when she might gradually learn how far the actual
29789: state of things was clear to Gwendolen, and prepare her for anything
29790: that might be a disappointment. But she was spared from devices on the
29791: subject.
29792: 
29793: “I hope you don’t expect that I am going to be rich and grand, mamma,”
29794: said Gwendolen, not long after the rector’s communication; “perhaps I
29795: shall have nothing at all.”
29796: 
29797: She was dressed, and had been sitting long in quiet meditation. Mrs.
29798: Davilow was startled, but said, after a moment’s reflection,
29799: 
29800: “Oh yes, dear, you will have something. Sir Hugo knows all about the
29801: will.”
29802: 
29803: “That will not decide,” said Gwendolen, abruptly.
29804: 
29805: “Surely, dear: Sir Hugo says you are to have two thousand a year and
29806: the house at Gadsmere.”
29807: 
29808: “What I have will depend on what I accept,” said Gwendolen. “You and my
29809: uncle must not attempt to cross me and persuade me about this. I will
29810: do everything I can do to make you happy, but in anything about my
29811: husband I must not be interfered with. Is eight hundred a year enough
29812: for you, mamma?”
29813: 
29814: “More than enough, dear. You must not think of giving me so much.” Mrs.
29815: Davilow paused a little, and then said, “Do you know who is to have the
29816: estates and the rest of the money?”
29817: 
29818: “Yes,” said Gwendolen, waving her hand in dismissal of the subject. “I
29819: know everything. It is all perfectly right, and I wish never to have it
29820: mentioned.”
29821: 
29822: The mother was silent, looked away, and rose to fetch a fan-screen,
29823: with a slight flush on her delicate cheeks. Wondering, imagining, she
29824: did not like to meet her daughter’s eyes, and sat down again under a
29825: sad constraint. What wretchedness her child had perhaps gone through,
29826: which yet must remain as it always had been, locked away from their
29827: mutual speech. But Gwendolen was watching her mother with that new
29828: divination which experience had given her; and in tender relenting at
29829: her own peremptoriness, said, “Come and sit nearer to me, mamma, and
29830: don’t be unhappy.”
29831: 
29832: Mrs. Davilow did as she was told, but bit her lips in the vain attempt
29833: to hinder smarting tears. Gwendolen leaned toward her caressingly and
29834: said, “I mean to be very wise; I do, really. And good—oh, so good to
29835: you, dear, old, sweet mamma, you won’t know me. Only you must not cry.”
29836: 
29837: The resolve that Gwendolen had in her mind was that she would ask
29838: Deronda whether she ought to accept any of her husband’s money—whether
29839: she might accept what would enable her to provide for her mother. The
29840: poor thing felt strong enough to do anything that would give her a
29841: higher place in Deronda’s mind.
29842: 
29843: An invitation that Sir Hugo pressed on her with kind urgency was that
29844: she and Mrs. Davilow should go straight with him to Park Lane, and make
29845: his house their abode as long as mourning and other details needed
29846: attending to in London. Town, he insisted, was just then the most
29847: retired of places; and he proposed to exert himself at once in getting
29848: all articles belonging to Gwendolen away from the house in Grosvenor
29849: Square. No proposal could have suited her better than this of staying a
29850: little while in Park Lane. It would be easy for her there to have an
29851: interview with Deronda, if she only knew how to get a letter into his
29852: hands, asking him to come to her. During the journey, Sir Hugo, having
29853: understood that she was acquainted with the purport of her husband’s
29854: will, ventured to talk before her and to her about her future
29855: arrangements, referring here and there to mildly agreeable prospects as
29856: matters of course, and otherwise shedding a decorous cheerfulness over
29857: her widowed position. It seemed to him really the more graceful course
29858: for a widow to recover her spirits on finding that her husband had not
29859: dealt as handsomely by her as he might have done; it was the testator’s
29860: fault if he compromised all her grief at his departure by giving a
29861: testamentary reason for it, so that she might be supposed to look sad,
29862: not because he had left her, but because he had left her poor. The
29863: baronet, having his kindliness doubly fanned by the favorable wind on
29864: his fortunes and by compassion for Gwendolen, had become quite fatherly
29865: in his behavior to her, called her “my dear,” and in mentioning
29866: Gadsmere to Mr. Gascoigne, with its various advantages and
29867: disadvantages, spoke of what “we” might do to make the best of that
29868: property. Gwendolen sat by in pale silence while Sir Hugo, with his
29869: face turned toward Mrs. Davilow or Mr. Gascoigne, conjectured that Mrs.
29870: Grandcourt might perhaps prefer letting Gadsmere to residing there
29871: during any part of the year, in which case he thought that it might be
29872: leased on capital terms to one of the fellows engaged with the coal:
29873: Sir Hugo had seen enough of the place to know that it was as
29874: comfortable and picturesque a box as any man need desire, providing his
29875: desires were circumscribed within a coal area.
29876: 
29877: “_I_ shouldn’t mind about the soot myself,” said the baronet, with that
29878: dispassionateness which belongs to the potential mood. “Nothing is more
29879: healthy. And if one’s business lay there, Gadsmere would be a paradise.
29880: It makes quite a feature in Scrogg’s history of the county, with the
29881: little tower and the fine piece of water—the prettiest print in the
29882: book.”
29883: 
29884: “A more important place than Offendene, I suppose?” said Mr. Gascoigne.
29885: 
29886: “Much,” said the baronet, decisively. “I was there with my poor
29887: brother—it is more than a quarter of a century ago, but I remember it
29888: very well. The rooms may not be larger, but the grounds are on a
29889: different scale.”
29890: 
29891: “Our poor dear Offendene is empty after all,” said Mrs. Davilow. “When
29892: it came to the point, Mr. Haynes declared off, and there has been no
29893: one to take it since. I might as well have accepted Lord Brackenshaw’s
29894: kind offer that I should remain in it another year rent-free: for I
29895: should have kept the place aired and warmed.”
29896: 
29897: “I hope you’ve something snug instead,” said Sir Hugo.
29898: 
29899: “A little too snug,” said Mr. Gascoigne, smiling at his sister-in-law.
29900: “You are rather thick upon the ground.”
29901: 
29902: Gwendolen had turned with a changed glance when her mother spoke of
29903: Offendene being empty. This conversation passed during one of the long
29904: unaccountable pauses often experienced in foreign trains at some
29905: country station. There was a dreamy, sunny stillness over the hedgeless
29906: fields stretching to the boundary of poplars; and to Gwendolen the talk
29907: within the carriage seemed only to make the dreamland larger with an
29908: indistinct region of coal-pits, and a purgatorial Gadsmere which she
29909: would never visit; till at her mother’s words, this mingled, dozing
29910: view seemed to dissolve and give way to a more wakeful vision of
29911: Offendene and Pennicote under their cooler lights. She saw the gray
29912: shoulders of the downs, the cattle-specked fields, the shadowy
29913: plantations with rutted lanes where the barked timber lay for a wayside
29914: seat, the neatly-clipped hedges on the road from the parsonage to
29915: Offendene, the avenue where she was gradually discerned from the
29916: window, the hall-door opening, and her mother or one of the troublesome
29917: sisters coming out to meet her. All that brief experience of a quiet
29918: home which had once seemed a dullness to be fled from, now came back to
29919: her as a restful escape, a station where she found the breath of
29920: morning and the unreproaching voice of birds after following a lure
29921: through a long Satanic masquerade, which she had entered on with an
29922: intoxicated belief in its disguises, and had seen the end of in
29923: shrieking fear lest she herself had become one of the evil spirits who
29924: were dropping their human mummery and hissing around her with serpent
29925: tongues.
29926: 
29927: In this way Gwendolen’s mind paused over Offendene and made it the
29928: scene of many thoughts; but she gave no further outward sign of
29929: interest in this conversation, any more than in Sir Hugo’s opinion on
29930: the telegraphic cable or her uncle’s views of the Church Rate Abolition
29931: Bill. What subjects will not our talk embrace in leisurely
29932: day-journeying from Genoa to London? Even strangers, after glancing
29933: from China to Peru and opening their mental stores with a liberality
29934: threatening a mutual impression of poverty on any future meeting, are
29935: liable to become excessively confidential. But the baronet and the
29936: rector were under a still stronger pressure toward cheerful
29937: communication: they were like acquaintances compelled to a long drive
29938: in a mourning-coach who having first remarked that the occasion is a
29939: melancholy one, naturally proceed to enliven it by the most
29940: miscellaneous discourse. “I don’t mind telling _you_,” said Sir Hugo to
29941: the rector, in mentioning some private details; while the rector,
29942: without saying so, did not mind telling the baronet about his sons, and
29943: the difficulty of placing them in the world. By the dint of discussing
29944: all persons and things within driving-reach of Diplow, Sir Hugo got
29945: himself wrought to a pitch of interest in that former home, and of
29946: conviction that it was his pleasant duty to regain and strengthen his
29947: personal influence in the neighborhood, that made him declare his
29948: intention of taking his family to the place for a month or two before
29949: the autumn was over; and Mr. Gascoigne cordially rejoiced in that
29950: prospect. Altogether, the journey was continued and ended with mutual
29951: liking between the male fellow-travellers.
29952: 
29953: Meanwhile Gwendolen sat by like one who had visited the spirit-world
29954: and was full to the lips of an unutterable experience that threw a
29955: strange unreality over all the talk she was hearing of her own and the
29956: world’s business; and Mrs. Davilow was chiefly occupied in imagining
29957: what her daughter was feeling, and in wondering what was signified by
29958: her hinted doubt whether she would accept her husband’s bequest.
29959: Gwendolen in fact had before her the unsealed wall of an immediate
29960: purpose shutting off every other resolution. How to scale the wall? She
29961: wanted again to see and consult Deronda, that she might secure herself
29962: against any act he would disapprove. Would her remorse have maintained
29963: its power within her, or would she have felt absolved by secrecy, if it
29964: had not been for that outer conscience which was made for her by
29965: Deronda? It is hard to say how much we could forgive ourselves if we
29966: were secure from judgment by another whose opinion is the
29967: breathing-medium of all our joy—who brings to us with close pressure
29968: and immediate sequence that judgment of the Invisible and Universal
29969: which self-flattery and the world’s tolerance would easily melt and
29970: disperse. In this way our brother may be in the stead of God to us, and
29971: his opinion which has pierced even to the joints and marrow, may be our
29972: virtue in the making. That mission of Deronda to Gwendolen had begun
29973: with what she had felt to be his judgment of her at the gaming-table.
29974: He might easily have spoiled it:—much of our lives is spent in marring
29975: our own influence and turning others’ belief in us into a widely
29976: concluding unbelief which they call knowledge of the world, while it is
29977: really disappointment in you or me. Deronda had not spoiled his mission.
29978: 
29979: But Gwendolen had forgotten to ask him for his address in case she
29980: wanted to write, and her only way of reaching him was through Sir Hugo.
29981: She was not in the least blind to the construction that all witnesses
29982: might put on her giving signs of dependence on Deronda, and her seeking
29983: him more than he sought her: Grandcourt’s rebukes had sufficiently
29984: enlightened her pride. But the force, the tenacity of her nature had
29985: thrown itself into that dependence, and she would no more let go her
29986: hold on Deronda’s help, or deny herself the interview her soul needed,
29987: because of witnesses, than if she had been in prison in danger of being
29988: condemned to death. When she was in Park Lane and knew that the baronet
29989: would be going down to the Abbey immediately (just to see his family
29990: for a couple of days and then return to transact needful business for
29991: Gwendolen), she said to him without any air of hesitation, while her
29992: mother was present,
29993: 
29994: “Sir Hugo, I wish to see Mr. Deronda again as soon as possible. I don’t
29995: know his address. Will you tell it me, or let him know that I want to
29996: see him?”
29997: 
29998: A quick thought passed across Sir Hugo’s face, but made no difference
29999: to the ease with which he said, “Upon my word, I don’t know whether
30000: he’s at his chambers or the Abbey at this moment. But I’ll make sure of
30001: him. I’ll send a note now to his chambers telling him to come, and if
30002: he’s at the Abbey I can give him your message and send him up at once.
30003: I am sure he will want to obey your wish,” the baronet ended, with
30004: grave kindness, as if nothing could seem to him more in the appropriate
30005: course of things than that she should send such a message.
30006: 
30007: But he was convinced that Gwendolen had a passionate attachment to
30008: Deronda, the seeds of which had been laid long ago, and his former
30009: suspicion now recurred to him with more strength than ever, that her
30010: feeling was likely to lead her into imprudences—in which kind-hearted
30011: Sir Hugo was determined to screen and defend her as far as lay in his
30012: power. To him it was as pretty a story as need be that this fine
30013: creature and his favorite Dan should have turned out to be formed for
30014: each other, and that the unsuitable husband should have made his exit
30015: in such excellent time. Sir Hugo liked that a charming woman should be
30016: made as happy as possible. In truth, what most vexed his mind in this
30017: matter at present was a doubt whether the too lofty and inscrutable Dan
30018: had not got some scheme or other in his head, which would prove to be
30019: dearer to him than the lovely Mrs. Grandcourt, and put that
30020: neatly-prepared marriage with her out of the question. It was among the
30021: usual paradoxes of feeling that Sir Hugo, who had given his fatherly
30022: cautions to Deronda against too much tenderness in his relations with
30023: the bride, should now feel rather irritated against him by the
30024: suspicion that he had not fallen in love as he ought to have done. Of
30025: course all this thinking on Sir Hugo’s part was eminently premature,
30026: only a fortnight or so after Grandcourt’s death. But it is the trick of
30027: thinking to be either premature or behind-hand.
30028: 
30029: However, he sent the note to Deronda’s chambers, and it found him there.

30041: Deronda did not obey Gwendolen’s new summons without some agitation.
30042: Not his vanity, but his keen sympathy made him susceptible to the
30043: danger that another’s heart might feel larger demands on him than he
30044: would be able to fulfill; and it was no longer a matter of argument
30045: with him, but of penetrating consciousness, that Gwendolen’s soul clung
30046: to his with a passionate need. We do not argue the existence of the
30047: anger or the scorn that thrills through us in a voice; we simply feel
30048: it, and it admits of no disproof. Deronda felt this woman’s destiny
30049: hanging on his over a precipice of despair. Any one who knows him
30050: cannot wonder at his inward confession, that if all this had happened
30051: little more than a year ago, he would hardly have asked himself whether
30052: he loved her; the impetuous determining impulse which would have moved
30053: him would have been to save her from sorrow, to shelter her life
30054: forevermore from the dangers of loneliness, and carry out to the last
30055: the rescue he had begun in that monitory redemption of the necklace.
30056: But now, love and duty had thrown other bonds around him, and that
30057: impulse could no longer determine his life; still, it was present in
30058: him as a compassionate yearning, a painful quivering at the very
30059: imagination of having again and again to meet the appeal of her eyes
30060: and words. The very strength of the bond, the certainty of the resolve,
30061: that kept him asunder from her, made him gaze at her lot apart with the
30062: more aching pity.
30063: 
30064: He awaited her coming in the back drawing-room—part of that white and
30065: crimson space where they had sat together at the musical party, where
30066: Gwendolen had said for the first time that her lot depended on his not
30067: forsaking her, and her appeal had seemed to melt into the melodic
30068: cry—_Per pietà non dirmi addio_. But the melody had come from Mirah’s
30069: dear voice.
30070: 
30071: Deronda walked about this room, which he had for years known by heart,
30072: with a strange sense of metamorphosis in his own life. The familiar
30073: objects around him, from Lady Mallinger’s gently smiling portrait to
30074: the also human and urbane faces of the lions on the pilasters of the
30075: chimney-piece, seemed almost to belong to a previous state of existence
30076: which he was revisiting in memory only, not in reality; so deep and
30077: transforming had been the impressions he had lately experienced, so new
30078: were the conditions under which he found himself in the house he had
30079: been accustomed to think of as a home—standing with his hat in his
30080: hand awaiting the entrance of a young creature whose life had also been
30081: undergoing a transformation—a tragic transformation toward a wavering
30082: result, in which he felt with apprehensiveness that his own action was
30083: still bound up.
30084: 
30085: But Gwendolen was come in, looking changed; not only by her mourning
30086: dress, but by a more satisfied quietude of expression than he had seen
30087: in her face at Genoa. Her satisfaction was that Deronda was there; but
30088: there was no smile between them as they met and clasped hands; each was
30089: full of remembrance—full of anxious prevision. She said, “It was good
30090: of you to come. Let us sit down,” immediately seating herself in the
30091: nearest chair. He placed himself opposite to her.
30092: 
30093: “I asked you to come because I want you to tell me what I ought to do,”
30094: she began, at once. “Don’t be afraid of telling me what you think is
30095: right, because it seems hard. I have made up my mind to do it. I was
30096: afraid once of being poor; I could not bear to think of being under
30097: other people; and that was why I did something—why I married. I have
30098: borne worse things now. I think I could bear to be poor, if you think I
30099: ought. Do you know about my husband’s will?”
30100: 
30101: “Yes, Sir Hugo told me,” said Deronda, already guessing the question
30102: she had to ask.
30103: 
30104: “Ought I to take anything he has left me? I will tell you what I have
30105: been thinking,” said Gwendolen, with a more nervous eagerness. “Perhaps
30106: you may not quite know that I really did think a good deal about my
30107: mother when I married. I _was_ selfish, but I did love her, and feel
30108: about her poverty; and what comforted me most at first, when I was
30109: miserable, was her being better off because I had married. The thing
30110: that would be hardest to me now would be to see her in poverty again;
30111: and I have been thinking that if I took enough to provide for her, and
30112: no more—nothing for myself—it would not be wrong; for I was very
30113: precious to my mother—and he took me from her—and he meant—and if
30114: she had known—”
30115: 
30116: Gwendolen broke off. She had been preparing herself for this interview
30117: by thinking of hardly anything else than this question of right toward
30118: her mother; but the question had carried with it thoughts and reasons
30119: which it was impossible for her to utter, and these perilous
30120: remembrances swarmed between her words, making her speech more and more
30121: agitated and tremulous. She looked down helplessly at her hands, now
30122: unladen of all rings except her wedding-ring.
30123: 
30124: “Do not hurt yourself by speaking of that,” said Deronda, tenderly.
30125: “There is no need; the case is very simple. I think I can hardly judge
30126: wrongly about it. You consult me because I am the only person to whom
30127: you have confided the most painful part of your experience: and I can
30128: understand your scruples.” He did not go on immediately, waiting for
30129: her to recover herself. The silence seemed to Gwendolen full of the
30130: tenderness that she heard in his voice, and she had courage to lift up
30131: her eyes and look at him as he said, “You are conscious of something
30132: which you feel to be a crime toward one who is dead. You think that you
30133: have forfeited all claim as a wife. You shrink from taking what was
30134: his. You want to keep yourself from profiting by his death. Your
30135: feeling even urges you to some self-punishment—some scourging of the
30136: self that disobeyed your better will—the will that struggled against
30137: temptation. I have known something of that myself. Do I understand you?”
30138: 
30139: “Yes—at least, I want to be good—not like what I have been,” said
30140: Gwendolen. “I will try to bear what you think I ought to bear. I have
30141: tried to tell you the worst about myself. What ought I to do?”
30142: 
30143: “If no one but yourself were concerned in this question of income,”
30144: said Deronda, “I should hardly dare to urge you against any remorseful
30145: prompting; but I take as a guide now, your feeling about Mrs. Davilow,
30146: which seems to me quite just. I cannot think that your husband’s dues
30147: even to yourself are nullified by any act you have committed. He
30148: voluntarily entered into your life, and affected its course in what is
30149: always the most momentous way. But setting that aside, it was due from
30150: him in his position that he should provide for your mother, and he of
30151: course understood that if this will took effect she would share the
30152: provision he had made for you.”
30153: 
30154: “She has had eight hundred a year. What I thought of was to take that
30155: and leave the rest,” said Gwendolen. She had been so long inwardly
30156: arguing for this as a permission, that her mind could not at once take
30157: another attitude.
30158: 
30159: “I think it is not your duty to fix a limit in that way,” said Deronda.
30160: “You would be making a painful enigma for Mrs. Davilow; an income from
30161: which you shut yourself out must be embittered to her. And your own
30162: course would become too difficult. We agreed at Genoa that the burden
30163: on your conscience is one what no one ought to be admitted to the
30164: knowledge of. The future beneficence of your life will be best
30165: furthered by your saving all others from the pain of that knowledge. In
30166: my opinion you ought simply to abide by the provisions of your
30167: husband’s will, and let your remorse tell only on the use that you will
30168: make of your monetary independence.”
30169: 
30170: In uttering the last sentence Deronda automatically took up his hat
30171: which he had laid on the floor beside him. Gwendolen, sensitive to his
30172: slightest movement, felt her heart giving a great leap, as if it too
30173: had a consciousness of its own, and would hinder him from going: in the
30174: same moment she rose from her chair, unable to reflect that the
30175: movement was an acceptance of his apparent intention to leave her; and
30176: Deronda, of course, also rose, advancing a little.
30177: 
30178: “I will do what you tell me,” said Gwendolen, hurriedly; “but what else
30179: shall I do?” No other than these simple words were possible to her; and
30180: even these were too much for her in a state of emotion where her proud
30181: secrecy was disenthroned: as the childlike sentences fell from her
30182: lips they reacted on her like a picture of her own helplessness, and
30183: she could not check the sob which sent the large tears to her eyes.
30184: Deronda, too, felt a crushing pain; but imminent consequences were
30185: visible to him, and urged him to the utmost exertion of conscience.
30186: When she had pressed her tears away, he said, in a gently questioning
30187: tone,
30188: 
30189: “You will probably be soon going with Mrs. Davilow into the country.”
30190: 
30191: “Yes, in a week or ten days.” Gwendolen waited an instant, turning her
30192: eyes vaguely toward the window, as if looking at some imagined
30193: prospect. “I want to be kind to them all—they can be happier than I
30194: can. Is that the best I can do?”
30195: 
30196: “I think so. It is a duty that cannot be doubtful,” said Deronda. He
30197: paused a little between his sentences, feeling a weight of anxiety on
30198: all his words. “Other duties will spring from it. Looking at your life
30199: as a debt may seem the dreariest view of things at a distance; but it
30200: cannot really be so. What makes life dreary is the want of motive: but
30201: once beginning to act with that penitential, loving purpose you have in
30202: your mind, there will be unexpected satisfactions—there will be
30203: newly-opening needs—continually coming to carry you on from day to
30204: day. You will find your life growing like a plant.”
30205: 
30206: Gwendolen turned her eyes on him with the look of one athirst toward
30207: the sound of unseen waters. Deronda felt the look as if she had been
30208: stretching her arms toward him from a forsaken shore. His voice took an
30209: affectionate imploringness when he said,
30210: 
30211: “This sorrow, which has cut down to the root, has come to you while you
30212: are so young—try to think of it not as a spoiling of your life, but as
30213: a preparation for it. Let it be a preparation——” Any one overhearing
30214: his tones would have thought he was entreating for his own happiness.
30215: “See! you have been saved from the worst evils that might have come
30216: from your marriage, which you feel was wrong. You have had a vision of
30217: injurious, selfish action—a vision of possible degradation; think that
30218: a severe angel, seeing you along the road of error, grasped you by the
30219: wrist and showed you the horror of the life you must avoid. And it has
30220: come to you in your spring-time. Think of it as a preparation. You can,
30221: you will, be among the best of women, such as make others glad that
30222: they were born.”
30223: 
30224: The words were like the touch of a miraculous hand to Gwendolen.
30225: Mingled emotions streamed through her frame with a strength that seemed
30226: the beginning of a new existence, having some new power or other which
30227: stirred in her vaguely. So pregnant is the divine hope of moral
30228: recovery with the energy that fulfills it. So potent in us is the
30229: infused action of another soul, before which we bow in complete love.
30230: But the new existence seemed inseparable from Deronda: the hope seemed
30231: to make his presence permanent. It was not her thought, that he loved
30232: her, and would cling to her—a thought would have tottered with
30233: improbability; it was her spiritual breath. For the first time since
30234: that terrible moment on the sea a flush rose and spread over her cheek,
30235: brow and neck, deepened an instant or two, and then gradually
30236: disappeared. She did not speak.
30237: 
30238: Deronda advanced and put out his hand, saying, “I must not weary you.”
30239: 
30240: She was startled by the sense that he was going, and put her hand in
30241: his, still without speaking.
30242: 
30243: “You look ill yet—unlike yourself,” he added, while he held her hand.
30244: 
30245: “I can’t sleep much,” she answered, with some return of her dispirited
30246: manner. “Things repeat themselves in me so. They come back—they will
30247: all come back,” she ended, shudderingly, a chill fear threatening her.
30248: 
30249: “By degrees they will be less insistent,” said Deronda. He could not
30250: drop her hand or move away from her abruptly.
30251: 
30252: “Sir Hugo says he shall come to stay at Diplow,” said Gwendolen,
30253: snatching at previously intended words which had slipped away from her.
30254: “You will come too.”
30255: 
30256: “Probably,” said Deronda, and then feeling that the word was cold, he
30257: added, correctively, “Yes, I shall come,” and then released her hand,
30258: with the final friendly pressure of one who has virtually said good-bye.
30259: 
30260: “And not again here, before I leave town?” said Gwendolen, with timid
30261: sadness, looking as pallid as ever.
30262: 
30263: What could Deronda say? “If I can be of any use—if you wish
30264: me—certainly I will.”
30265: 
30266: “I must wish it,” said Gwendolen, impetuously; “you know I must wish
30267: it. What strength have I? Who else is there?” Again a sob was rising.
30268: 
30269: Deronda felt a pang, which showed itself in his face. He looked
30270: miserable as he said, “I will certainly come.”
30271: 
30272: Gwendolen perceived the change in his face; but the intense relief of
30273: expecting him to come again could not give way to any other feeling,
30274: and there was a recovery of the inspired hope and courage in her.
30275: 
30276: “Don’t be unhappy about me,” she said, in a tone of affectionate
30277: assurance. “I shall remember your words—every one of them. I shall
30278: remember what you believe about me; I shall try.”
30279: 
30280: She looked at him firmly, and put out her hand again as if she had
30281: forgotten what had passed since those words of his which she promised
30282: to remember. But there was no approach to a smile on her lips. She had
30283: never smiled since her husband’s death. When she stood still and in
30284: silence, she looked like a melancholy statue of the Gwendolen whose
30285: laughter had once been so ready when others were grave.
30286: 
30287: It is only by remembering the searching anguish which had changed the
30288: aspect of the world for her that we can understand her behavior to
30289: Deronda—the unreflecting openness, nay, the importunate pleading, with
30290: which she expressed her dependence on him. Considerations such as would
30291: have filled the minds of indifferent spectators could not occur to her,
30292: any more than if flames had been mounting around her, and she had flung
30293: herself into his open arms and clung about his neck that he might carry
30294: her into safety. She identified him with the struggling regenerative
30295: process in her which had begun with his action. Is it any wonder that
30296: she saw her own necessity reflected in his feeling? She was in that
30297: state of unconscious reliance and expectation which is a common
30298: experience with us when we are preoccupied with our own trouble or our
30299: own purposes. We diffuse our feeling over others, and count on their
30300: acting from our motives. Her imagination had not been turned to a
30301: future union with Deronda by any other than the spiritual tie which had
30302: been continually strengthening; but also it had not been turned toward
30303: a future separation from him. Love-making and marriage—how could they
30304: now be the imagery in which poor Gwendolen’s deepest attachment could
30305: spontaneously clothe itself? Mighty Love had laid his hand upon her;
30306: but what had he demanded of her? Acceptance of rebuke—the hard task of
30307: self-change—confession—endurance. If she cried toward him, what then?
30308: She cried as the child cries whose little feet have fallen
30309: backward—cried to be taken by the hand, lest she should lose herself.
30310: 
30311: The cry pierced Deronda. What position could have been more difficult
30312: for a man full of tenderness, yet with clear foresight? He was the only
30313: creature who knew the real nature of Gwendolen’s trouble: to withdraw
30314: himself from any appeal of hers would be to consign her to a dangerous
30315: loneliness. He could not reconcile himself to the cruelty of apparently
30316: rejecting her dependence on him; and yet in the nearer or farther
30317: distance he saw a coming wrench, which all present strengthening of
30318: their bond would make the harder.
30319: 
30320: He was obliged to risk that. He went once and again to Park Lane before
30321: Gwendolen left; but their interviews were in the presence of Mrs.
30322: Davilow, and were therefore less agitating. Gwendolen, since she had
30323: determined to accept her income, had conceived a project which she
30324: liked to speak of: it was to place her mother and sisters with herself
30325: in Offendene again, and, as she said, piece back her life unto that
30326: time when they first went there, and when everything was happiness
30327: about her, only she did not know it. The idea had been mentioned to Sir
30328: Hugo, who was going to exert himself about the letting of Gadsmere for
30329: a rent which would more than pay the rent of Offendene. All this was
30330: told to Deronda, who willingly dwelt on a subject that seemed to give
30331: some soothing occupation to Gwendolen. He said nothing and she asked
30332: nothing, of what chiefly occupied himself. Her mind was fixed on his
30333: coming to Diplow before the autumn was over; and she no more thought of
30334: the Lapidoths—the little Jewess and her brother—as likely to make a
30335: difference in her destiny, than of the fermenting political and social
30336: leaven which was making a difference in the history of the world. In
30337: fact poor Gwendolen’s memory had been stunned, and all outside the
30338: lava-lit track of her troubled conscience, and her effort to get
30339: deliverance from it, lay for her in dim forgetfulness.
30340: 
30341: 
30342: 
30343: 
30344: CHAPTER LXVI.
30345: 
30346: 
30347:   “One day still fierce ’mid many a day struck calm.”
30348:                     —BROWNING: _The King and the Book_.
30349: 
30350: 
30351: Meanwhile Ezra and Mirah, whom Gwendolen did not include in her
30352: thinking about Deronda, were having their relation to him drawn closer
30353: and brought into fuller light.
30354: 
30355: The father Lapidoth had quitted his daughter at the doorstep, ruled by
30356: that possibility of staking something in play or betting which
30357: presented itself with the handling of any sum beyond the price of
30358: staying actual hunger, and left no care for alternative prospects or
30359: resolutions. Until he had lost everything he never considered whether
30360: he would apply to Mirah again or whether he would brave his son’s
30361: presence. In the first moment he had shrunk from encountering Ezra as
30362: he would have shrunk from any other situation of disagreeable
30363: constraint; and the possession of Mirah’s purse was enough to banish
30364: the thought of future necessities. The gambling appetite is more
30365: absolutely dominant than bodily hunger, which can be neutralized by an
30366: emotional or intellectual excitation; but the passion for watching
30367: chances—the habitual suspensive poise of the mind in actual or
30368: imaginary play—nullifies the susceptibility of other excitation. In
30369: its final, imperious stage, it seems the unjoyous dissipation of
30370: demons, seeking diversion on the burning marl of perdition.
30371: 
30372: But every form of selfishness, however abstract and unhuman, requires
30373: the support of at least one meal a day; and though Lapidoth’s appetite
30374: for food and drink was extremely moderate, he had slipped into a
30375: shabby, unfriendly form of life in which the appetite could not be
30376: satisfied without some ready money. When, in a brief visit at a house
30377: which announced “Pyramids” on the window-blind, he had first doubled
30378: and trebled and finally lost Mirah’s thirty shillings, he went out with
30379: her empty purse in his pocket, already balancing in his mind whether he
30380: should get another immediate stake by pawning the purse, or whether he
30381: should go back to her giving himself a good countenance by restoring
30382: the purse, and declaring that he had used the money in paying a score
30383: that was standing against him. Besides, among the sensibilities still
30384: left strong in Lapidoth was the sensibility to his own claims, and he
30385: appeared to himself to have a claim on any property his children might
30386: possess, which was stronger than the justice of his son’s resentment.
30387: After all, to take up his lodging with his children was the best thing
30388: he could do; and the more he thought of meeting Ezra the less he winced
30389: from it, his imagination being more wrought on by the chances of his
30390: getting something into his pocket with safety and without exertion,
30391: than by the threat of a private humiliation. Luck had been against him
30392: lately; he expected it to turn—and might not the turn begin with some
30393: opening of supplies which would present itself through his daughter’s
30394: affairs and the good friends she had spoken of? Lapidoth counted on the
30395: fascination of his cleverness—an old habit of mind which early
30396: experience had sanctioned: and it is not only women who are unaware of
30397: their diminished charm, or imagine that they can feign not to be worn
30398: out.
30399: 
30400: The result of Lapidoth’s rapid balancing was that he went toward the
30401: little square in Brompton with the hope that, by walking about and
30402: watching, he might catch sight of Mirah going out or returning, in
30403: which case his entrance into the house would be made easier. But it was
30404: already evening—the evening of the day next to that which he had first
30405: seen her; and after a little waiting, weariness made him reflect that
30406: he might ring, and if she were not at home he might ask the time at
30407: which she was expected. But on coming near the house he knew that she
30408: was at home: he heard her singing.
30409: 
30410: Mirah, seated at the piano, was pouring forth “_Herz, mein Herz_,”
30411: while Ezra was listening with his eyes shut, when Mrs. Adam opened the
30412: door, and said in some embarrassment,
30413: 
30414: “A gentleman below says he is your father, miss.”
30415: 
30416: “I will go down to him,” said Mirah, starting up immediately and
30417: looking at her brother.
30418: 
30419: “No, Mirah, not so,” said Ezra, with decision. “Let him come up, Mrs.
30420: Adam.”
30421: 
30422: Mirah stood with her hands pinching each other, and feeling sick with
30423: anxiety, while she continued looking at Ezra, who had also risen, and
30424: was evidently much shaken. But there was an expression in his face
30425: which she had never seen before; his brow was knit, his lips seemed
30426: hardened with the same severity that gleamed from his eye.
30427: 
30428: When Mrs. Adam opened the door to let in the father, she could not help
30429: casting a look at the group, and after glancing from the younger man to
30430: the elder, said to herself as she closed the door, “Father, sure
30431: enough.” The likeness was that of outline, which is always most
30432: striking at the first moment; the expression had been wrought into the
30433: strongest contrasts by such hidden or inconspicuous differences as can
30434: make the genius of a Cromwell within the outward type of a father who
30435: was no more than a respectable parishioner.
30436: 
30437: Lapidoth had put on a melancholy expression beforehand, but there was
30438: some real wincing in his frame as he said,
30439: 
30440: “Well, Ezra, my boy, you hardly know me after so many years.”
30441: 
30442: “I know you—too well—father,” said Ezra, with a slow biting solemnity
30443: which made the word father a reproach.
30444: 
30445: “Ah, you are not pleased with me. I don’t wonder at it. Appearances
30446: have been against me. When a man gets into straits he can’t do just as
30447: he would by himself or anybody else, _I_’ve suffered enough, I know,”
30448: said Lapidoth, quickly. In speaking he always recovered some glibness
30449: and hardihood; and now turning toward Mirah, he held out her purse,
30450: saying, “Here’s your little purse, my dear. I thought you’d be anxious
30451: about it because of that bit of writing. I’ve emptied it, you’ll see,
30452: for I had a score to pay for food and lodging. I knew you would like me
30453: to clear myself, and here I stand—without a single farthing in my
30454: pocket—at the mercy of my children. You can turn me out if you like,
30455: without getting a policeman. Say the word, Mirah; say, ‘Father, I’ve
30456: had enough of you; you made a pet of me, and spent your all on me, when
30457: I couldn’t have done without you; but I can do better without you
30458: now,’—say that, and I’m gone out like a spark. I shan’t spoil your
30459: pleasure again.” The tears were in his voice as usual, before he had
30460: finished.
30461: 
30462: “You know I could never say it, father,” answered Mirah, with not the
30463: less anguish because she felt the falsity of everything in his speech
30464: except the implied wish to remain in the house.
30465: 
30466: “Mirah, my sister, leave us!” said Ezra, in a tone of authority.
30467: 
30468: She looked at her brother falteringly, beseechingly—in awe of his
30469: decision, yet unable to go without making a plea for this father who
30470: was like something that had grown in her flesh with pain. She went
30471: close to her brother, and putting her hand in his, said, in a low
30472: voice, but not so low as to be unheard by Lapidoth, “Remember,
30473: Ezra—you said my mother would not have shut him out.”
30474: 
30475: “Trust me, and go,” said Ezra.
30476: 
30477: She left the room, but after going a few steps up the stairs, sat down
30478: with a palpitating heart. If, because of anything her brother said to
30479: him, he went away—
30480: 
30481: Lapidoth had some sense of what was being prepared for him in his son’s
30482: mind, but he was beginning to adjust himself to the situation and find
30483: a point of view that would give him a cool superiority to any attempt
30484: at humiliating him. This haggard son, speaking as from a sepulchre, had
30485: the incongruity which selfish levity learns to see in suffering, and
30486: until the unrelenting pincers of disease clutch its own flesh. Whatever
30487: preaching he might deliver must be taken for a matter of course, as a
30488: man finding shelter from hail in an open cathedral might take a little
30489: religious howling that happened to be going on there.
30490: 
30491: Lapidoth was not born with this sort of callousness: he had achieved it.
30492: 
30493: “This home that we have here,” Ezra began, “is maintained partly by the
30494: generosity of a beloved friend who supports me, and partly by the
30495: labors of my sister, who supports herself. While we have a home we will
30496: not shut you out from it. We will not cast you out to the mercy of your
30497: vices. For you are our father, and though you have broken your bond, we
30498: acknowledge ours. But I will never trust you. You absconded with money,
30499: leaving your debts unpaid; you forsook my mother; you robbed her of her
30500: little child and broke her heart; you have become a gambler, and where
30501: shame and conscience were there sits an insatiable desire; you were
30502: ready to sell my sister—you had sold her, but the price was denied
30503: you. The man who has done these things must never expect to be trusted
30504: any more. We will share our food with you—you shall have a bed, and
30505: clothing. We will do this duty to you, because you are our father. But
30506: you will never be trusted. You are an evil man: you made the misery of
30507: our mother. That such a man is our father is a brand on our flesh which
30508: will not cease smarting. But the Eternal has laid it upon us; and
30509: though human justice were to flog you for crimes, and your body fell
30510: helpless before the public scorn, we would still say, ‘This is our
30511: father; make way, that we may carry him out of your sight.’”
30512: 
30513: Lapidoth, in adjusting himself to what was coming, had not been able to
30514: foresee the exact intensity of the lightning or the exact course it
30515: would take—that it would not fall outside his frame but through it. He
30516: could not foresee what was so new to him as this voice from the soul of
30517: his son. It touched that spring of hysterical excitability which Mirah
30518: used to witness in him when he sat at home and sobbed. As Ezra ended,
30519: Lapidoth threw himself into a chair and cried like a woman, burying his
30520: face against the table—and yet, strangely, while this hysterical
30521: crying was an inevitable reaction in him under the stress of his son’s
30522: words, it was also a conscious resource in a difficulty; just as in
30523: early life, when he was a bright-faced curly young man, he had been
30524: used to avail himself of this subtly-poised physical susceptibility to
30525: turn the edge of resentment or disapprobation.
30526: 
30527: Ezra sat down again and said nothing—exhausted by the shock of his own
30528: irrepressible utterance, the outburst of feelings which for years he
30529: had borne in solitude and silence. His thin hands trembled on the arms
30530: of the chair; he would hardly have found voice to answer a question; he
30531: felt as if he had taken a step toward beckoning Death. Meanwhile
30532: Mirah’s quick expectant ear detected a sound which her heart
30533: recognized: she could not stay out of the room any longer. But on
30534: opening the door her immediate alarm was for Ezra, and it was to his
30535: side that she went, taking his trembling hand in hers, which he pressed
30536: and found support in; but he did not speak or even look at her. The
30537: father with his face buried was conscious that Mirah had entered, and
30538: presently lifted up his head, pressed his handkerchief against his
30539: eyes, put out his hand toward her, and said with plaintive hoarseness,
30540: “Good-bye, Mirah; your father will not trouble you again. He deserves
30541: to die like a dog by the roadside, and he will. If your mother had
30542: lived, she would have forgiven me—thirty-four years ago I put the ring
30543: on her finger under the _Chuppa_, and we were made one. She would have
30544: forgiven me, and we should have spent our old age together. But I
30545: haven’t deserved it. Good-bye.”
30546: 
30547: He rose from the chair as he said the last “good-bye.” Mirah had put
30548: her hand in his and held him. She was not tearful and grieving, but
30549: frightened and awe-struck, as she cried out,
30550: 
30551: “No, father, no!” Then turning to her brother, “Ezra, you have not
30552: forbidden him?—Stay, father, and leave off wrong things. Ezra, I
30553: cannot bear it. How can I say to my father, ‘Go and die!’”
30554: 
30555: “I have not said it,” Ezra answered, with great effort. “I have said,
30556: stay and be sheltered.”
30557: 
30558: “Then you will stay, father—and be taken care of—and come with me,”
30559: said Mirah, drawing him toward the door.
30560: 
30561: This was really what Lapidoth wanted. And for the moment he felt a sort
30562: of comfort in recovering his daughter’s dutiful attendance, that made a
30563: change of habits seem possible to him. She led him down to the parlor
30564: below, and said,
30565: 
30566: “This is my sitting-room when I am not with Ezra, and there is a
30567: bedroom behind which shall be yours. You will stay and be good,
30568: father. Think that you are come back to my mother, and that she has
30569: forgiven you—she speaks to you through me.” Mirah’s tones were
30570: imploring, but she could not give one of her former caresses.
30571: 
30572: Lapidoth quickly recovered his composure, began to speak to Mirah of
30573: the improvement in her voice, and other easy subjects, and when Mrs.
30574: Adam came to lay out his supper, entered into converse with her in
30575: order to show her that he was not a common person, though his clothes
30576: were just now against him.
30577: 
30578: But in his usual wakefulness at night, he fell to wondering what money
30579: Mirah had by her, and went back over old Continental hours at
30580: _Roulette_, reproducing the method of his play, and the chances that
30581: had frustrated it. He had had his reasons for coming to England, but
30582: for most things it was a cursed country.
30583: 
30584: These were the stronger visions of the night with Lapidoth, and not the
30585: worn frame of his ireful son uttering a terrible judgment. Ezra did
30586: pass across the gaming-table, and his words were audible; but he passed
30587: like an insubstantial ghost, and his words had the heart eaten out of
30588: them by numbers and movements that seemed to make the very tissue of
30589: Lapidoth’s consciousness.
30590: 
30591: 
30592: 
30593: 
30594: CHAPTER LXVII.
30595: 
30596:   The godhead in us wrings our noble deeds
30597:   From our reluctant selves.
30598: 
30599: 
30600: It was an unpleasant surprise to Deronda when he returned from the
30601: Abbey to find the undesirable father installed in the lodgings at
30602: Brompton. Mirah had felt it necessary to speak of Deronda to her
30603: father, and even to make him as fully aware as she could of the way in
30604: which the friendship with Ezra had begun, and of the sympathy which had
30605: cemented it. She passed more lightly over what Deronda had done for
30606: her, omitting altogether the rescue from drowning, and speaking of the
30607: shelter she had found in Mrs. Meyrick’s family so as to leave her
30608: father to suppose that it was through these friends Deronda had become
30609: acquainted with her. She could not persuade herself to more
30610: completeness in her narrative: she could not let the breath of her
30611: father’s soul pass over her relation to Deronda. And Lapidoth, for
30612: reasons, was not eager in his questioning about the circumstances of
30613: her flight and arrival in England. But he was much interested in the
30614: fact of his children having a beneficent friend apparently high in the
30615: world.
30616: 
30617: It was the brother who told Deronda of this new condition added to
30618: their life. “I am become calm in beholding him now,” Ezra ended, “and I
30619: try to think it possible that my sister’s tenderness, and the daily
30620: tasting a life of peace, may win him to remain aloof from temptation. I
30621: have enjoined her, and she has promised, to trust him with no money. I
30622: have convinced her that he will buy with it his own destruction.”
30623: 
30624: Deronda first came on the third day from Lapidoth’s arrival. The new
30625: clothes for which he had been measured were not yet ready, and wishing
30626: to make a favorable impression, he did not choose to present himself in
30627: the old ones. He watched for Deronda’s departure, and, getting a view
30628: of him from the window, was rather surprised at his youthfulness, which
30629: Mirah had not mentioned, and which he had somehow thought out of the
30630: question in a personage who had taken up a grave friendship and hoary
30631: studies with the sepulchral Ezra. Lapidoth began to imagine that
30632: Deronda’s real or chief motive must be that he was in love with Mirah.
30633: And so much the better; for a tie to Mirah had more promise of
30634: indulgence for her father than a tie to Ezra: and Lapidoth was not
30635: without the hope of recommending himself to Deronda, and of softening
30636: any hard prepossessions. He was behaving with much amiability, and
30637: trying in all ways at his command to get himself into easy
30638: domestication with his children—entering into Mirah’s music, showing
30639: himself docile about smoking, which Mrs. Adam could not tolerate in her
30640: parlor, and walking out in the square with his German pipe, and the
30641: tobacco with which Mirah supplied him. He was too acute to offer any
30642: present remonstrance against the refusal of money, which Mirah told him
30643: that she must persist in as a solemn duty promised to her brother. He
30644: was comfortable enough to wait.
30645: 
30646: The next time Deronda came, Lapidoth, equipped in his new clothes, and
30647: satisfied with his own appearance, was in the room with Ezra, who was
30648: teaching himself, as a part of his severe duty, to tolerate his
30649: father’s presence whenever it was imposed. Deronda was cold and
30650: distant, the first sight of this man, who had blighted the lives of his
30651: wife and children, creating in him a repulsion that was even a physical
30652: discomfort. But Lapidoth did not let himself be discouraged, asked
30653: leave to stay and hear the reading of papers from the old chest, and
30654: actually made himself useful in helping to decipher some difficult
30655: German manuscript. This led him to suggest that it might be desirable
30656: to make a transcription of the manuscript, and he offered his services
30657: for this purpose, and also to make copies of any papers in Roman
30658: characters. Though Ezra’s young eyes he observed were getting weak, his
30659: own were still strong. Deronda accepted the offer, thinking that
30660: Lapidoth showed a sign of grace in the willingness to be employed
30661: usefully; and he saw a gratified expression in Ezra’s face, who,
30662: however, presently said, “Let all the writing be done here; for I
30663: cannot trust the papers out of my sight, lest there be an accident by
30664: burning or otherwise.” Poor Ezra felt very much as if he had a convict
30665: on leave under his charge. Unless he saw his father working, it was not
30666: possible to believe that he would work in good faith. But by this
30667: arrangement he fastened on himself the burden of his father’s presence,
30668: which was made painful not only through his deepest, longest
30669: associations, but also through Lapidoth’s restlessness of temperament,
30670: which showed itself the more as he become familiarized with his
30671: situation, and lost any awe he had felt of his son. The fact was, he
30672: was putting a strong constraint on himself in confining his attention
30673: for the sake of winning Deronda’s favor; and like a man in an
30674: uncomfortable garment he gave himself relief at every opportunity,
30675: going out to smoke, or moving about and talking, or throwing himself
30676: back in his chair and remaining silent, but incessantly carrying on a
30677: dumb language of facial movement or gesticulation: and if Mirah were in
30678: the room, he would fall into his old habit of talk with her, gossiping
30679: about their former doings and companions, or repeating quirks and
30680: stories, and plots of the plays he used to adapt, in the belief that he
30681: could at will command the vivacity of his earlier time. All this was a
30682: mortal infliction to Ezra; and when Mirah was at home she tried to
30683: relieve him, by getting her father down into the parlor and keeping
30684: watch over him there. What duty is made of a single difficult resolve?
30685: The difficulty lies in the daily unflinching support of consequences
30686: that mar the blessed return of morning with the prospect of irritation
30687: to be suppressed or shame to be endured. And such consequences were
30688: being borne by these, as by many other heroic children of an unworthy
30689: father—with the prospect, at least to Mirah, of their stretching
30690: onward through the solid part of life.
30691: 
30692: Meanwhile Lapidoth’s presence had raised a new impalpable partition
30693: between Deronda and Mirah—each of them dreading the soiling inferences
30694: of his mind, each of them interpreting mistakenly the increased reserve
30695: and diffidence of the other. But it was not very long before some light
30696: came to Deronda.
30697: 
30698: As soon as he could, after returning from his brief visit to the Abbey,
30699: he had called at Hans Meyrick’s rooms, feeling it, on more grounds than
30700: one, a due of friendship that Hans should be at once acquainted with
30701: the reasons of his late journey, and the changes of intention it had
30702: brought about. Hans was not there; he was said to be in the country for
30703: a few days; and Deronda, after leaving a note, waited a week, rather
30704: expecting a note in return. But receiving no word, and fearing some
30705: freak of feeling in the incalculably susceptible Hans, whose proposed
30706: sojourn at the Abbey he knew had been deferred, he at length made a
30707: second call, and was admitted into the painting-room, where he found
30708: his friend in a light coat, without a waistcoat, his long hair still
30709: wet from a bath, but with a face looking worn and wizened—anything but
30710: country-like. He had taken up his palette and brushes, and stood before
30711: his easel when Deronda entered, but the equipment and attitude seemed
30712: to have been got up on short notice.
30713: 
30714: As they shook hands, Deronda said, “You don’t look much as if you had
30715: been in the country, old fellow. Is it Cambridge you have been to?”
30716: 
30717: “No,” said Hans, curtly, throwing down his palette with the air of one
30718: who has begun to feign by mistake; then pushing forward a chair for
30719: Deronda, he threw himself into another, and leaned backward with his
30720: hands behind his head, while he went on, “I’ve been to
30721: I-don’t-know-where—No man’s land—and a mortally unpleasant country it
30722: is.”
30723: 
30724: “You don’t mean to say you have been drinking, Hans,” said Deronda, who
30725: had seated himself opposite, in anxious survey.
30726: 
30727: “Nothing so good. I’ve been smoking opium. I always meant to do it some
30728: time or other, to try how much bliss could be got by it; and having
30729: found myself just now rather out of other bliss, I thought it judicious
30730: to seize the opportunity. But I pledge you my word I shall never tap a
30731: cask of that bliss again. It disagrees with my constitution.”
30732: 
30733: “What has been the matter? You were in good spirits enough when you
30734: wrote to me.”
30735: 
30736: “Oh, nothing in particular. The world began to look seedy—a sort of
30737: cabbage-garden with all the cabbages cut. A malady of genius, you may
30738: be sure,” said Hans, creasing his face into a smile; “and, in fact, I
30739: was tired of being virtuous without reward, especially in this hot
30740: London weather.”
30741: 
30742: “Nothing else? No real vexation?” said Deronda.
30743: 
30744: Hans shook his head.
30745: 
30746: “I came to tell you of my own affairs, but I can’t do it with a good
30747: grace if you are to hide yours.”
30748: 
30749: “Haven’t an affair in the world,” said Hans, in a flighty way, “except
30750: a quarrel with a bric-à-brac man. Besides, as it is the first time in
30751: our lives that you ever spoke to me about your own affairs, you are
30752: only beginning to pay a pretty long debt.”
30753: 
30754: Deronda felt convinced that Hans was behaving artificially, but he
30755: trusted to a return of the old frankness by-and-by if he gave his own
30756: confidence.
30757: 
30758: “You laughed at the mystery of my journey to Italy, Hans,” he began.
30759: “It was for an object that touched my happiness at the very roots. I
30760: had never known anything about my parents, and I really went to Genoa
30761: to meet my mother. My father has been long dead—died when I was an
30762: infant. My mother was the daughter of an eminent Jew; my father was her
30763: cousin. Many things had caused me to think of this origin as almost a
30764: probability before I set out. I was so far prepared for the result that
30765: I was glad of it—glad to find myself a Jew.”
30766: 
30767: “You must not expect me to look surprised, Deronda,” said Hans, who had
30768: changed his attitude, laying one leg across the other and examining the
30769: heel of his slipper.
30770: 
30771: “You knew it?”
30772: 
30773: “My mother told me. She went to the house the morning after you had
30774: been there—brother and sister both told her. You may imagine we can’t
30775: rejoice as they do. But whatever you are glad of, I shall come to be
30776: glad of in the end—_when_ exactly the end may be I can’t predict,”
30777: said Hans, speaking in a low tone, which was as usual with him as it
30778: was to be out of humor with his lot, and yet bent on making no fuss
30779: about it.
30780: 
30781: “I quite understand that you can’t share my feeling,” said Deronda;
30782: “but I could not let silence lie between us on what casts quite a new
30783: light over my future. I have taken up some of Mordecai’s ideas, and I
30784: mean to try and carry them out, so far as one man’s efforts can go. I
30785: dare say I shall by and by travel to the East and be away for some
30786: years.”
30787: 
30788: Hans said nothing, but rose, seized his palette and began to work his
30789: brush on it, standing before his picture with his back to Deronda, who
30790: also felt himself at a break in his path embarrassed by Hans’s
30791: embarrassment.
30792: 
30793: Presently Hans said, again speaking low, and without turning, “Excuse
30794: the question, but does Mrs. Grandcourt know of all this?”
30795: 
30796: “No; and I must beg of you, Hans,” said Deronda, rather angrily, “to
30797: cease joking on that subject. Any notions you have are wide of the
30798: truth—are the very reverse of the truth.”
30799: 
30800: “I am no more inclined to joke than I shall be at my own funeral,” said
30801: Hans. “But I am not at all sure that you are aware what are my notions
30802: on that subject.”
30803: 
30804: “Perhaps not,” said Deronda. “But let me say, once for all, that in
30805: relation to Mrs. Grandcourt, I never have had, and never shall have the
30806: position of a lover. If you have ever seriously put that interpretation
30807: on anything you have observed, you are supremely mistaken.”
30808: 
30809: There was silence a little while, and to each the silence was like an
30810: irritating air, exaggerating discomfort.
30811: 
30812: “Perhaps I have been mistaken in another interpretation, also,” said
30813: Hans, presently.
30814: 
30815: “What is that?”
30816: 
30817: “That you had no wish to hold the position of a lover toward another
30818: woman, who is neither wife nor widow.”
30819: 
30820: “I can’t pretend not to understand you, Meyrick. It is painful that our
30821: wishes should clash. I hope you will tell me if you have any ground for
30822: supposing that you would succeed.”
30823: 
30824: “That seems rather a superfluous inquiry on your part, Deronda,” said
30825: Hans, with some irritation.
30826: 
30827: “Why superfluous?”
30828: 
30829: “Because you are perfectly convinced on the subject—and probably have
30830: had the very best evidence to convince you.”
30831: 
30832: “I will be more frank with you than you are with me,” said Deronda,
30833: still heated by Hans’ show of temper, and yet sorry for him. “I have
30834: never had the slightest evidence that I should succeed myself. In fact,
30835: I have very little hope.”
30836: 
30837: Hans looked round hastily at his friend, but immediately turned to his
30838: picture again.
30839: 
30840: “And in our present situation,” said Deronda, hurt by the idea that
30841: Hans suspected him of insincerity, and giving an offended emphasis to
30842: his words, “I don’t see how I can deliberately make known my feeling to
30843: her. If she could not return it, I should have embittered her best
30844: comfort; for neither she nor I can be parted from her brother, and we
30845: should have to meet continually. If I were to cause her that sort of
30846: pain by an unwilling betrayal of my feeling, I should be no better than
30847: a mischievous animal.”
30848: 
30849: “I don’t know that I have ever betrayed _my_ feeling to her,” said
30850: Hans, as if he were vindicating himself.
30851: 
30852: “You mean that we are on a level, then; you have no reason to envy me.”
30853: 
30854: “Oh, not the slightest,” said Hans, with bitter irony. “You have
30855: measured my conceit and know that it out-tops all your advantages.”
30856: 
30857: “I am a nuisance to you, Meyrick. I am sorry, but I can’t help it,”
30858: said Deronda, rising. “After what passed between us before, I wished to
30859: have this explanation; and I don’t see that any pretensions of mine
30860: have made a real difference to you. They are not likely to make any
30861: pleasant difference to myself under present circumstances. Now the
30862: father is there—did you know that the father is there?”
30863: 
30864: “Yes. If he were not a Jew I would permit myself to damn him—with
30865: faint praise, I mean,” said Hans, but with no smile.
30866: 
30867: “She and I meet under greater constraint than ever. Things might go on
30868: in this way for two years without my getting any insight into her
30869: feeling toward me. That is the whole state of affairs, Hans. Neither
30870: you nor I have injured the other, that I can see. We must put up with
30871: this sort of rivalry in a hope that is likely enough to come to
30872: nothing. Our friendship can bear that strain, surely.”
30873: 
30874: “No, it can’t,” said Hans, impetuously, throwing down his tools,
30875: thrusting his hands into his coat-pockets, and turning round to face
30876: Deronda, who drew back a little and looked at him with amazement. Hans
30877: went on in the same tone,
30878: 
30879: “Our friendship—my friendship—can’t bear the strain of behaving to
30880: you like an ungrateful dastard and grudging you your happiness. For you
30881: _are_ the happiest dog in the world. If Mirah loves anybody better than
30882: her brother, _you are the man_.”
30883: 
30884: Hans turned on his heel and threw himself into his chair, looking up at
30885: Deronda with an expression the reverse of tender. Something like a
30886: shock passed through Deronda, and, after an instant, he said,
30887: 
30888: “It is a good-natured fiction of yours, Hans.”
30889: 
30890: “I am not in a good-natured mood. I assure you I found the fact
30891: disagreeable when it was thrust on me—all the more, or perhaps all the
30892: less, because I believed then that your heart was pledged to the
30893: duchess. But now, confound you! you turn out to be in love in the right
30894: place—a Jew—and everything eligible.”
30895: 
30896: “Tell me what convinced you—there’s a good fellow,” said Deronda,
30897: distrusting a delight that he was unused to.
30898: 
30899: “Don’t ask. Little mother was witness. The upshot is, that Mirah is
30900: jealous of the duchess, and the sooner you relieve your mind the
30901: better. There! I’ve cleared off a score or two, and may be allowed to
30902: swear at you for getting what you deserve—which is just the very best
30903: luck I know of.”
30904: 
30905: “God bless you, Hans!” said Deronda, putting out his hand, which the
30906: other took and wrung in silence.
30907: 
30908: 
30909: 
30910: 
30911: CHAPTER LXVIII.
30912: 
30913:   “All thoughts, all passions, all delights,
30914:   Whatever stirs this mortal frame,
30915:   All are but ministers of Love,
30916:   And feed his sacred flame.”
30917:                                 —COLERIDGE.
30918: 
30919: 
30920: Deronda’s eagerness to confess his love could hardly have had a
30921: stronger stimulus than Hans had given it in his assurance that Mirah
30922: needed relief from jealousy. He went on his next visit to Ezra with the
30923: determination to be resolute in using—nay, in requesting—an
30924: opportunity of private conversation with her. If she accepted his love,
30925: he felt courageous about all other consequences, and as her betrothed
30926: husband he would gain a protective authority which might be a desirable
30927: defense for her in future difficulties with her father. Deronda had not
30928: observed any signs of growing restlessness in Lapidoth, or of
30929: diminished desire to recommend himself; but he had forebodings of some
30930: future struggle, some mortification, or some intolerable increase of
30931: domestic disquietude in which he might save Ezra and Mirah from being
30932: helpless victims.
30933: 
30934: His forebodings would have been strengthened if he had known what was
30935: going on in the father’s mind. That amount of restlessness, that
30936: desultoriness of attention, which made a small torture to Ezra, was to
30937: Lapidoth an irksome submission to restraint, only made bearable by his
30938: thinking of it as a means of by-and-by securing a well-conditioned
30939: freedom. He began with the intention of awaiting some really good
30940: chance, such as an opening for getting a considerable sum from Deronda;
30941: but all the while he was looking about curiously, and trying to
30942: discover where Mirah deposited her money and her keys. The imperious
30943: gambling desire within him, which carried on its activity through every
30944: other occupation, and made a continuous web of imagination that held
30945: all else in its meshes, would hardly have been under the control of a
30946: contracted purpose, if he had been able to lay his hands on any sum
30947: worth capturing. But Mirah, with her practical clear-sightedness,
30948: guarded against any frustration of the promise she had given to Ezra,
30949: by confiding all money, except what she was immediately in want of, to
30950: Mrs. Meyrick’s care, and Lapidoth felt himself under an irritating
30951: completeness of supply in kind as in a lunatic asylum where everything
30952: was made safe against him. To have opened a desk or drawer of Mirah’s,
30953: and pocketed any bank-notes found there, would have been to his mind a
30954: sort of domestic appropriation which had no disgrace in it; the degrees
30955: of liberty a man allows himself with other people’s property being
30956: often delicately drawn, even beyond the boundary where the law begins
30957: to lay its hold—which is the reason why spoons are a safer investment
30958: than mining shares. Lapidoth really felt himself injuriously treated by
30959: his daughter, and thought that he ought to have had what he wanted of
30960: her other earnings as he had of her apple-tart. But he remained
30961: submissive; indeed, the indiscretion that most tempted him, was not any
30962: insistence with Mirah, but some kind of appeal to Deronda. Clever
30963: persons who have nothing else to sell can often put a good price on
30964: their absence, and Lapidoth’s difficult search for devices forced upon
30965: him the idea that his family would find themselves happier without him,
30966: and that Deronda would be willing to advance a considerable sum for the
30967: sake of getting rid of him. But, in spite of well-practiced hardihood,
30968: Lapidoth was still in some awe of Ezra’s imposing friend, and deferred
30969: his purpose indefinitely.
30970: 
30971: On this day, when Deronda had come full of a gladdened consciousness,
30972: which inevitably showed itself in his air and speech, Lapidoth was at a
30973: crisis of discontent and longing that made his mind busy with schemes
30974: of freedom, and Deronda’s new amenity encouraged them. This
30975: preoccupation was at last so strong as to interfere with his usual
30976: show of interest in what went forward, and his persistence in sitting
30977: by even when there was reading which he could not follow. After sitting
30978: a little while, he went out to smoke and walk in the square, and the
30979: two friends were all the easier. Mirah was not at home, but she was
30980: sure to be in again before Deronda left, and his eyes glowed with a
30981: secret anticipation: he thought that when he saw her again he should
30982: see some sweetness of recognition for himself to which his eyes had
30983: been sealed before. There was an additional playful affectionateness in
30984: his manner toward Ezra.
30985: 
30986: “This little room is too close for you, Ezra,” he said, breaking off
30987: his reading. “The week’s heat we sometimes get here is worse than the
30988: heat in Genoa, where one sits in the shaded coolness of large rooms.
30989: You must have a better home now. I shall do as I like with you, being
30990: the stronger half.” He smiled toward Ezra, who said,
30991: 
30992: “I am straitened for nothing except breath. But you, who might be in a
30993: spacious palace, with the wide green country around you, find this a
30994: narrow prison. Nevertheless, I cannot say, ‘Go.’”
30995: 
30996: “Oh, the country would be a banishment while you are here,” said
30997: Deronda, rising and walking round the double room, which yet offered no
30998: long promenade, while he made a great fan of his handkerchief. “This is
30999: the happiest room in the world to me. Besides, I will imagine myself in
31000: the East, since I am getting ready to go there some day. Only I will
31001: not wear a cravat and a heavy ring there,” he ended emphatically,
31002: pausing to take off those superfluities and deposit them on a small
31003: table behind Ezra, who had the table in front of him covered with books
31004: and papers.
31005: 
31006: “I have been wearing my memorable ring ever since I came home,” he went
31007: on, as he reseated himself. “But I am such a Sybarite that I constantly
31008: put it off as a burden when I am doing anything. I understand why the
31009: Romans had summer rings—_if_ they had them. Now then, I shall get on
31010: better.”
31011: 
31012: They were soon absorbed in their work again. Deronda was reading a
31013: piece of rabbinical Hebrew under Ezra’s correction and comment, and
31014: they took little notice when Lapidoth re-entered and took a seat
31015: somewhat in the background.
31016: 
31017: His rambling eyes quickly alighted on the ring that sparkled on the bit
31018: of dark mahogany. During his walk, his mind had been occupied with the
31019: fiction of an advantageous opening for him abroad, only requiring a sum
31020: of ready money, which, on being communicated to Deronda in private,
31021: might immediately draw from him a question as to the amount of the
31022: required sum: and it was this part of his forecast that Lapidoth found
31023: the most debatable, there being a danger in asking too much, and a
31024: prospective regret in asking too little. His own desire gave him no
31025: limit, and he was quite without guidance as to the limit of Deronda’s
31026: willingness. But now, in the midst of these airy conditions preparatory
31027: to a receipt which remained indefinite, this ring, which on Deronda’s
31028: finger had become familiar to Lapidoth’s envy, suddenly shone detached
31029: and within easy grasp. Its value was certainly below the smallest of
31030: the imaginary sums that his purpose fluctuated between; but then it was
31031: before him as a solid fact, and his desire at once leaped into the
31032: thought (not yet an intention) that if he were quietly to pocket that
31033: ring and walk away he would have the means of comfortable escape from
31034: present restraint, without trouble, and also without danger; for any
31035: property of Deronda’s (available without his formal consent) was all
31036: one with his children’s property, since their father would never be
31037: prosecuted for taking it. The details of this thinking followed each
31038: other so quickly that they seemed to rise before him as one picture.
31039: Lapidoth had never committed larceny; but larceny is a form of
31040: appropriation for which people are punished by law; and, take this ring
31041: from a virtual relation, who would have been willing to make a much
31042: heavier gift, would not come under the head of larceny. Still, the
31043: heavier gift was to be preferred, if Lapidoth could only make haste
31044: enough in asking for it, and the imaginary action of taking the ring,
31045: which kept repeating itself like an inward tune, sank into a rejected
31046: idea. He satisfied his urgent longing by resolving to go below, and
31047: watch for the moment of Deronda’s departure, when he would ask leave to
31048: join him in his walk and boldly carry out his meditated plan. He rose
31049: and stood looking out of the window, but all the while he saw what lay
31050: beyond him—the brief passage he would have to make to the door close
31051: by the table where the ring was. However he was resolved to go down;
31052: but—by no distinct change of resolution, rather by a dominance of
31053: desire, like the thirst of the drunkard—it so happened that in passing
31054: the table his fingers fell noiselessly on the ring, and he found
31055: himself in the passage with the ring in his hand. It followed that he
31056: put on his hat and quitted the house. The possibility of again throwing
31057: himself on his children receded into the indefinite distance, and
31058: before he was out on the square his sense of haste had concentrated
31059: itself on selling the ring and getting on shipboard.
31060: 
31061: Deronda and Ezra were just aware of his exit; that was all. But,
31062: by-and-by, Mirah came in and made a real interruption. She had not
31063: taken off her hat; and when Deronda rose and advanced to shake hands
31064: with her, she said, in a confusion at once unaccountable and
31065: troublesome to herself,
31066: 
31067: “I only came in to see that Ezra had his new draught. I must go
31068: directly to Mrs. Meyrick’s to fetch something.”
31069: 
31070: “Pray allow me to walk with you,” said Deronda urgently. “I must not
31071: tire Ezra any further; besides my brains are melting. I want to go to
31072: Mrs. Meyrick’s: may I go with you?”
31073: 
31074: “Oh, yes,” said Mirah, blushing still more, with the vague sense of
31075: something new in Deronda, and turning away to pour out Ezra’s draught;
31076: Ezra meanwhile throwing back his head with his eyes shut, unable to get
31077: his mind away from the ideas that had been filling it while the reading
31078: was going on. Deronda for a moment stood thinking of nothing but the
31079: walk, till Mirah turned round again and brought the draught, when he
31080: suddenly remembered that he had laid aside his cravat, and
31081: saying—“Pray excuse my dishabille—I did not mean you to see it,” he
31082: went to the little table, took up his cravat, and exclaimed with a
31083: violent impulse of surprise, “Good heavens, where is my ring gone?”
31084: beginning to search about on the floor.
31085: 
31086: Ezra looked round the corner of his chair. Mirah, quick as thought,
31087: went to the spot where Deronda was seeking, and said, “Did you lay it
31088: down?”
31089: 
31090: “Yes,” said Deronda, still unvisited by any other explanation than that
31091: the ring had fallen and was lurking in shadow, indiscernable on the
31092: variegated carpet. He was moving the bits of furniture near, and
31093: searching in all possible and impossible places with hand and eyes.
31094: 
31095: But another explanation had visited Mirah and taken the color from her
31096: cheeks. She went to Ezra’s ear and whispered “Was my father here?” He
31097: bent his head in reply, meeting her eyes with terrible understanding.
31098: She darted back to the spot where Deronda was still casting down his
31099: eyes in that hopeless exploration which we are apt to carry on over a
31100: space we have examined in vain. “You have not found it?” she said,
31101: hurriedly.
31102: 
31103: He, meeting her frightened gaze, immediately caught alarm from it and
31104: answered, “I perhaps put it in my pocket,” professing to feel for it
31105: there.
31106: 
31107: She watched him and said, “It is not there?—you put it on the table,”
31108: with a penetrating voice that would not let him feign to have found it
31109: in his pocket; and immediately she rushed out of the room. Deronda
31110: followed her—she was gone into the sitting-room below to look for her
31111: father—she opened the door of the bedroom to see if he were there—she
31112: looked where his hat usually hung—she turned with her hands clasped
31113: tight and her lips pale, gazing despairingly out of the window. Then
31114: she looked up at Deronda, who had not dared to speak to her in her
31115: white agitation. She looked up at him, unable to utter a word—the look
31116: seemed a tacit acceptance of the humiliation she felt in his presence.
31117: But he, taking her clasped hands between both his, said, in a tone of
31118: reverent adoration,
31119: 
31120: “Mirah, let me think that he is my father as well as yours—that we can
31121: have no sorrow, no disgrace, no joy apart. I will rather take your
31122: grief to be mine than I would take the brightest joy of another woman.
31123: Say you will not reject me—say you will take me to share all things
31124: with you. Say you will promise to be my wife—say it now. I have been
31125: in doubt so long—I have had to hide my love so long. Say that now and
31126: always I may prove to you that I love you with complete love.”
31127: 
31128: The change in Mirah had been gradual. She had not passed at once from
31129: anguish to the full, blessed consciousness that, in this moment of
31130: grief and shame, Deronda was giving her the highest tribute man can
31131: give to woman. With the first tones and the first words, she had only a
31132: sense of solemn comfort, referring this goodness of Deronda’s to his
31133: feeling for Ezra. But by degrees the rapturous assurance of unhoped-for
31134: good took possession of her frame: her face glowed under Deronda’s as
31135: he bent over her; yet she looked up still with intense gravity, as when
31136: she had first acknowledged with religious gratitude that he had thought
31137: her “worthy of the best;” and when he had finished, she could say
31138: nothing—she could only lift up her lips to his and just kiss them, as
31139: if that were the simplest “yes.” They stood then, only looking at each
31140: other, he holding her hands between his—too happy to move, meeting so
31141: fully in their new consciousness that all signs would have seemed to
31142: throw them farther apart, till Mirah said in a whisper: “Let us go and
31143: comfort Ezra.”
31144: 
31145: 
31146: 
31147: 
31148: CHAPTER LXIX.
31149: 
31150:   “The human nature unto which I felt
31151:   That I belonged, and reverenced with love,
31152:   Was not a punctual presence, but a spirit
31153:   Diffused through time and space, with aid derived
31154:   Of evidence from monuments, erect,
31155:   Prostrate, or leaning toward their common rest
31156:   In earth, the widely scattered wreck sublime
31157:   Of vanished nations.”
31158:                        —WORDSWORTH: _The Prelude_.
31159: 
31160: 
31161: Sir Hugo carried out his plan of spending part of the autumn at Diplow,
31162: and by the beginning of October his presence was spreading some
31163: cheerfulness in the neighborhood, among all ranks and persons
31164: concerned, from the stately home of Brackenshaw and Quetcham to the
31165: respectable shop-parlors in Wanchester. For Sir Hugo was a man who
31166: liked to show himself and be affable, a Liberal of good lineage, who
31167: confided entirely in reform as not likely to make any serious
31168: difference in English habits of feeling, one of which undoubtedly is
31169: the liking to behold society well fenced and adorned with hereditary
31170: rank. Hence he made Diplow a most agreeable house, extending his
31171: invitations to old Wanchester solicitors and young village curates, but
31172: also taking some care in the combination of the guests, and not feeding
31173: all the common poultry together, so that they should think their meal
31174: no particular compliment. Easy-going Lord Brackenshaw, for example,
31175: would not mind meeting Robinson the attorney, but Robinson would have
31176: been naturally piqued if he had been asked to meet a set of people who
31177: passed for his equals. On all these points Sir Hugo was well informed
31178: enough at once to gain popularity for himself and give pleasure to
31179: others—two results which eminently suited his disposition. The rector
31180: of Pennicote now found a reception at Diplow very different from the
31181: haughty tolerance he had undergone during the reign of Grandcourt. It
31182: was not that the baronet liked Mr. Gascoigne; it was that he desired to
31183: keep up a marked relation of friendliness with him on account of Mrs.
31184: Grandcourt, for whom Sir Hugo’s chivalry had become more and more
31185: engaged. Why? The chief reason was one that he could not fully
31186: communicate, even to Lady Mallinger—for he would not tell what he
31187: thought one woman’s secret to another, even though the other was his
31188: wife—which shows that his chivalry included a rare reticence.
31189: 
31190: Deronda, after he had become engaged to Mirah, felt it right to make a
31191: full statement of his position and purposes to Sir Hugo, and he chose
31192: to make it by letter. He had more than a presentiment that his fatherly
31193: friend would feel some dissatisfaction, if not pain, at this turn of
31194: his destiny. In reading unwelcome news, instead of hearing it, there is
31195: the advantage that one avoids a hasty expression of impatience which
31196: may afterward be repented of. Deronda dreaded that verbal collision
31197: which makes otherwise pardonable feeling lastingly offensive.
31198: 
31199: And Sir Hugo, though not altogether surprised, was thoroughly vexed.
31200: His immediate resource was to take the letter to Lady Mallinger, who
31201: would be sure to express an astonishment which her husband could argue
31202: against as unreasonable, and in this way divide the stress of his
31203: discontent. And in fact when she showed herself astonished and
31204: distressed that all Daniel’s wonderful talents, and the comfort of
31205: having him in the house, should have ended in his going mad in this way
31206: about the Jews, the baronet could say,
31207: 
31208: “Oh, nonsense, my dear! depend upon it, Dan will not make a fool of
31209: himself. He has large notions about Judaism—political views which you
31210: can’t understand. No fear but Dan will keep himself head uppermost.”
31211: 
31212: But with regard to the prospective marriage she afforded him no
31213: counter-irritant. The gentle lady observed, without rancor, that she
31214: had little dreamed of what was coming when she had Mirah to sing at her
31215: musical party and give lessons to Amabel. After some hesitation,
31216: indeed, she confessed it _had_ passed through her mind that after a
31217: proper time Daniel might marry Mrs. Grandcourt—because it seemed so
31218: remarkable that he should be at Genoa just at that time—and although
31219: she herself was not fond of widows she could not help thinking that
31220: such a marriage would have been better than his going altogether with
31221: the Jews. But Sir Hugo was so strongly of the same opinion that he
31222: could not correct it as a feminine mistake; and his ill-humor at the
31223: disproof of his disagreeable conclusions on behalf of Gwendolen was
31224: left without vent. He desired Lady Mallinger not to breathe a word
31225: about the affair till further notice, saying to himself, “If it is an
31226: unkind cut to the poor thing (meaning Gwendolen), the longer she is
31227: without knowing it the better, in her present nervous state. And she
31228: will best learn it from Dan himself.” Sir Hugo’s conjectures had worked
31229: so industriously with his knowledge, that he fancied himself well
31230: informed concerning the whole situation.
31231: 
31232: Meanwhile his residence with his family at Diplow enabled him to
31233: continue his fatherly attentions to Gwendolen; and in these Lady
31234: Mallinger, notwithstanding her small liking for widows, was quite
31235: willing to second him.
31236: 
31237: The plan of removal to Offendene had been carried out; and Gwendolen,
31238: in settling there, maintained a calm beyond her mother’s hopes. She was
31239: experiencing some of that peaceful melancholy which comes from the
31240: renunciation of demands for self, and from taking the ordinary good of
31241: existence, and especially kindness, even from a dog, as a gift above
31242: expectation. Does one who has been all but lost in a pit of darkness
31243: complain of the sweet air and the daylight? There is a way of looking
31244: at our life daily as an escape, and taking the quiet return of morn and
31245: evening—still more the star-like out-glowing of some pure
31246: fellow-feeling, some generous impulse breaking our inward darkness—as
31247: a salvation that reconciles us to hardship. Those who have a
31248: self-knowledge prompting such self-accusation as Hamlet’s, can
31249: understand this habitual feeling of rescue. And it was felt by
31250: Gwendolen as she lived through and through again the terrible history
31251: of her temptations, from their first form of illusory self-pleasing
31252: when she struggled away from the hold of conscience, to their latest
31253: form of an urgent hatred dragging her toward its satisfaction, while
31254: she prayed and cried for the help of that conscience which she had once
31255: forsaken. She was now dwelling on every word of Deronda’s that pointed
31256: to her past deliverance from the worst evil in herself, and the worst
31257: infliction of it on others, and on every word that carried a force to
31258: resist self-despair.
31259: 
31260: But she was also upborne by the prospect of soon seeing him again: she
31261: did not imagine him otherwise than always within her reach, her supreme
31262: need of him blinding her to the separateness of his life, the whole
31263: scene of which she filled with his relation to her—no unique
31264: preoccupation of Gwendolen’s, for we are all apt to fall into this
31265: passionate egoism of imagination, not only toward our fellow-men, but
31266: toward God. And the future which she turned her face to with a willing
31267: step was one where she would be continually assimilating herself to
31268: some type that he would hold before her. Had he not first risen on her
31269: vision as a corrective presence which she had recognized in the
31270: beginning with resentment, and at last with entire love and trust? She
31271: could not spontaneously think of an end to that reliance, which had
31272: become to her imagination like the firmness of the earth, the only
31273: condition of her walking.
31274: 
31275: And Deronda was not long before he came to Diplow, which was a more
31276: convenient distance from town than the Abbey. He had wished to carry
31277: out a plan for taking Ezra and Mirah to a mild spot on the coast, while
31278: he prepared another home which Mirah might enter as his bride, and
31279: where they might unitedly watch over her brother. But Ezra begged not
31280: to be removed, unless it were to go with them to the East. All outward
31281: solicitations were becoming more and more of a burden to him; but his
31282: mind dwelt on the possibility of this voyage with a visionary joy.
31283: Deronda, in his preparations for the marriage, which he hoped might not
31284: be deferred beyond a couple of months, wished to have fuller
31285: consultation as to his resources and affairs generally with Sir Hugo,
31286: and here was a reason for not delaying his visit to Diplow. But he
31287: thought quite as much of another reason—his promise to Gwendolen. The
31288: sense of blessedness in his own lot had yet an aching anxiety at his
31289: heart: this may be held paradoxical, for the beloved lover is always
31290: called happy, and happiness is considered as a well-fleshed
31291: indifference to sorrow outside it. But human experience is usually
31292: paradoxical, if that means incongruous with the phrases of current talk
31293: or even current philosophy. It was no treason to Mirah, but a part of
31294: that full nature which made his love for her the more worthy, that his
31295: joy in her could hold by its side the care for another. For what is
31296: love itself, for the one we love best?—an enfolding of immeasurable
31297: cares which yet are better than any joys outside our love.
31298: 
31299: Deronda came twice to Diplow, and saw Gwendolen twice—and yet he went
31300: back to town without having told her anything about the change in his
31301: lot and prospects. He blamed himself; but in all momentous
31302: communication likely to give pain we feel dependent on some preparatory
31303: turn of words or associations, some agreement of the other’s mood with
31304: the probable effect of what we have to impart. In the first interview
31305: Gwendolen was so absorbed in what she had to say to him, so full of
31306: questions which he must answer, about the arrangement of her life, what
31307: she could do to make herself less ignorant, how she could be kindest to
31308: everybody, and make amends for her selfishness and try to be rid of it,
31309: that Deronda utterly shrank from waiving her immediate wants in order
31310: to speak of himself, nay, from inflicting a wound on her in these
31311: moments when she was leaning on him for help in her path. In the second
31312: interview, when he went with new resolve to command the conversation
31313: into some preparatory track, he found her in a state of deep
31314: depression, overmastered by some distasteful miserable memories which
31315: forced themselves on her as something more real and ample than any new
31316: material out of which she could mould her future. She cried
31317: hysterically, and said that he would always despise her. He could only
31318: seek words of soothing and encouragement: and when she gradually
31319: revived under them, with that pathetic look of renewed childlike
31320: interest which we see in eyes where the lashes are still beaded with
31321: tears, it was impossible to lay another burden on her.
31322: 
31323: But time went on, and he felt it a pressing duty to make the difficult
31324: disclosure. Gwendolen, it was true, never recognized his having any
31325: affairs; and it had never even occurred to her to ask him why he
31326: happened to be at Genoa. But this unconsciousness of hers would make a
31327: sudden revelation of affairs that were determining his course in life
31328: all the heavier blow to her; and if he left the revelation to be made
31329: by different persons, she would feel that he had treated her with cruel
31330: inconsiderateness. He could not make the communication in writing: his
31331: tenderness could not bear to think of her reading his virtual farewell
31332: in solitude, and perhaps feeling his words full of a hard gladness for
31333: himself and indifference for her. He went down to Diplow again, feeling
31334: that every other peril was to be incurred rather than that of returning
31335: and leaving her still in ignorance.
31336: 
31337: On this third visit Deronda found Hans Meyrick installed with his easel
31338: at Diplow, beginning his picture of the three daughters sitting on a
31339: bank, “in the Gainsborough style,” and varying his work by rambling to
31340: Pennicote to sketch the village children and improve his acquaintance
31341: with the Gascoignes. Hans appeared to have recovered his vivacity, but
31342: Deronda detected some feigning in it, as we detect the artificiality of
31343: a lady’s bloom from its being a little too high-toned and steadily
31344: persistent (a “Fluctuating Rouge” not having yet appeared among the
31345: advertisements). Also with all his grateful friendship and admiration
31346: for Deronda, Hans could not help a certain irritation against him, such
31347: as extremely incautious, open natures are apt to feel when the breaking
31348: of a friend’s reserve discloses a state of things not merely
31349: unsuspected but the reverse of what had been hoped and ingeniously
31350: conjectured. It is true that poor Hans had always cared chiefly to
31351: confide in Deronda, and had been quite incurious as to any confidence
31352: that might have been given in return; but what outpourer of his own
31353: affairs is not tempted to think any hint of his friend’s affairs is an
31354: egotistic irrelevance? That was no reason why it was not rather a sore
31355: reflection to Hans that while he had been all along naively opening his
31356: heart about Mirah, Deronda had kept secret a feeling of rivalry which
31357: now revealed itself as the important determining fact. Moreover, it is
31358: always at their peril that our friends turn out to be something more
31359: than we were aware of. Hans must be excused for these promptings of
31360: bruised sensibility, since he had not allowed them to govern his
31361: substantial conduct: he had the consciousness of having done right by
31362: his fortunate friend; or, as he told himself, “his metal had given a
31363: better ring than he would have sworn to beforehand.” For Hans had
31364: always said that in point of virtue he was a _dilettante_: which meant
31365: that he was very fond of it in other people, but if he meddled with it
31366: himself he cut a poor figure. Perhaps in reward of his good behavior he
31367: gave his tongue the more freedom; and he was too fully possessed by the
31368: notion of Deronda’s happiness to have a conception of what he was
31369: feeling about Gwendolen, so that he spoke of her without hesitation.
31370: 
31371: “When did you come down, Hans?” said Deronda, joining him in the
31372: grounds where he was making a study of the requisite bank and trees.
31373: 
31374: “Oh, ten days ago; before the time Sir Hugo fixed. I ran down with Rex
31375: Gascoigne and stayed at the rectory a day or two. I’m up in all the
31376: gossip of these parts; I know the state of the wheelwright’s interior,
31377: and have assisted at an infant school examination. Sister Anna, with
31378: the good upper lip, escorted me, else I should have been mobbed by
31379: three urchins and an idiot, because of my long hair and a general
31380: appearance which departs from the Pennicote type of the beautiful.
31381: Altogether, the village is idyllic. Its only fault is a dark curate
31382: with broad shoulders and broad trousers who ought to have gone into the
31383: heavy drapery line. The Gascoignes are perfect—besides being related
31384: to the Vandyke duchess. I caught a glimpse of her in her black robes at
31385: a distance, though she doesn’t show to visitors.”
31386: 
31387: “She was not staying at the rectory?” said Deronda.
31388: 
31389: “No; but I was taken to Offendene to see the old house, and as a
31390: consequence I saw the duchess’ family. I suppose you have been there
31391: and know all about them?”
31392: 
31393: “Yes, I have been there,” said Deronda, quietly.
31394: 
31395: “A fine old place. An excellent setting for a widow with romantic
31396: fortunes. And she seems to have had several romances. I think I have
31397: found out that there was one between her and my friend Rex.”
31398: 
31399: “Not long before her marriage, then?” said Deronda, really interested,
31400: “for they had only been a year at Offendene. How came you to know
31401: anything of it?”
31402: 
31403: “Oh—not ignorant of what it is to be a miserable devil, I learn to
31404: gloat on the signs of misery in others. I found out that Rex never goes
31405: to Offendene, and has never seen the duchess since she came back; and
31406: Miss Gascoigne let fall something in our talk about charade-acting—for
31407: I went through some of my nonsense to please the young ones—something
31408: that proved to me that Rex was once hovering about his fair cousin
31409: close enough to get singed. I don’t know what was her part in the
31410: affair. Perhaps the duke came in and carried her off. That is always
31411: the way when an exceptionally worthy young man forms an attachment. I
31412: understand now why Gascoigne talks of making the law his mistress and
31413: remaining a bachelor. But these are green resolves. Since the duke did
31414: not get himself drowned for your sake, it may turn out to be for my
31415: friend Rex’s sake. Who knows?”
31416: 
31417: “Is it absolutely necessary that Mrs. Grandcourt should marry again?”
31418: said Deronda, ready to add that Hans’s success in constructing her
31419: fortunes hitherto had not been enough to warrant a new attempt.
31420: 
31421: “You monster!” retorted Hans, “do you want her to wear weeds for _you_
31422: all her life—burn herself in perpetual suttee while you are alive and
31423: merry?”
31424: 
31425: Deronda could say nothing, but he looked so much annoyed that Hans
31426: turned the current of his chat, and when he was alone shrugged his
31427: shoulders a little over the thought that there really had been some
31428: stronger feeling between Deronda and the duchess than Mirah would like
31429: to know of. “Why didn’t she fall in love with me?” thought Hans,
31430: laughing at himself. “She would have had no rivals. No woman ever
31431: wanted to discuss theology with me.”
31432: 
31433: No wonder that Deronda winced under that sort of joking with a
31434: whip-lash. It touched sensibilities that were already quivering with
31435: the anticipation of witnessing some of that pain to which even Hans’s
31436: light words seemed to give more reality:—any sort of recognition by
31437: another giving emphasis to the subject of our anxiety. And now he had
31438: come down with the firm resolve that he would not again evade the
31439: trial. The next day he rode to Offendene. He had sent word that he
31440: intended to call and to ask if Gwendolen could receive him; and he
31441: found her awaiting him in the old drawing-room where some chief crises
31442: of her life had happened. She seemed less sad than he had seen her
31443: since her husband’s death; there was no smile on her face, but a placid
31444: self-possession, in contrast with the mood in which he had last found
31445: her. She was all the more alive to the sadness perceptible in Deronda;
31446: and they were no sooner seated—he at a little distance opposite to
31447: her—than she said:
31448: 
31449: “You were afraid of coming to see me, because I was so full of grief
31450: and despair the last time. But I am not so to-day. I have been sorry
31451: ever since. I have been making it a reason why I should keep up my hope
31452: and be as cheerful as I can, because I would not give you any pain
31453: about me.”
31454: 
31455: There was an unwonted sweetness in Gwendolen’s tone and look as she
31456: uttered these words that seemed to Deronda to infuse the utmost cruelty
31457: into the task now laid upon him. But he felt obliged to make his answer
31458: a beginning of the task.
31459: 
31460: “I _am_ in some trouble to-day,” he said, looking at her rather
31461: mournfully; “but it is because I have things to tell you which you will
31462: almost think it a want of confidence on my part not to have spoken of
31463: before. They are things affecting my own life—my own future. I shall
31464: seem to have made an ill return to you for the trust you have placed in
31465: me—never to have given you an idea of events that make great changes
31466: for me. But when we have been together we have hardly had time to enter
31467: into subjects which at the moment were really less pressing to me than
31468: the trials you have been going through.” There was a sort of timid
31469: tenderness in Deronda’s deep tones, and he paused with a pleading look,
31470: as if it had been Gwendolen only who had conferred anything in her
31471: scenes of beseeching and confession.
31472: 
31473: A thrill of surprise was visible in her. Such meaning as she found in
31474: his words had shaken her, but without causing fear. Her mind had flown
31475: at once to some change in his position with regard to Sir Hugo and Sir
31476: Hugo’s property. She said, with a sense of comfort from Deronda’s way
31477: of asking her pardon,
31478: 
31479: “You never thought of anything but what you could do to help me; and I
31480: was so troublesome. How could you tell me things?”
31481: 
31482: “It will perhaps astonish you,” said Deronda, “that I have only quite
31483: lately known who were my parents.”
31484: 
31485: Gwendolen was not astonished: she felt the more assured that her
31486: expectations of what was coming were right. Deronda went on without
31487: check.
31488: 
31489: “The reason why you found me in Italy was that I had gone there to
31490: learn that—in fact, to meet my mother. It was by her wish that I was
31491: brought up in ignorance of my parentage. She parted with me after my
31492: father’s death, when I was a little creature. But she is now very ill,
31493: and she felt that the secrecy ought not to be any longer maintained.
31494: Her chief reason had been that she did not wish me to know I was a Jew.”
31495: 
31496: “_A Jew_!” Gwendolen exclaimed, in a low tone of amazement, with an
31497: utterly frustrated look, as if some confusing potion were creeping
31498: through her system.
31499: 
31500: Deronda colored, and did not speak, while Gwendolen, with her eyes
31501: fixed on the floor, was struggling to find her way in the dark by the
31502: aid of various reminiscences. She seemed at last to have arrived at
31503: some judgment, for she looked up at Deronda again and said, as if
31504: remonstrating against the mother’s conduct,
31505: 
31506: “What difference need that have made?”
31507: 
31508: “It has made a great difference to me that I have known it,” said
31509: Deronda, emphatically; but he could not go on easily—the distance
31510: between her ideas and his acted like a difference of native language,
31511: making him uncertain what force his words would carry.
31512: 
31513: Gwendolen meditated again, and then said feelingly, “I hope there is
31514: nothing to make you mind. _You_ are just the same as if you were not a
31515: Jew.”
31516: 
31517: She meant to assure him that nothing of that external sort could affect
31518: the way in which she regarded him, or the way in which he could
31519: influence her. Deronda was a little helped by this misunderstanding.
31520: 
31521: “The discovery was far from being painful to me,” he said, “I had been
31522: gradually prepared for it, and I was glad of it. I had been prepared
31523: for it by becoming intimate with a very remarkable Jew, whose ideas
31524: have attracted me so much that I think of devoting the best part of my
31525: life to some effort at giving them effect.”
31526: 
31527: Again Gwendolen seemed shaken—again there was a look of frustration,
31528: but this time it was mingled with alarm. She looked at Deronda with
31529: lips childishly parted. It was not that she had yet connected his words
31530: with Mirah and her brother, but that they had inspired her with a
31531: dreadful presentiment of mountainous travel for her mind before it
31532: could reach Deronda’s. Great ideas in general which she had attributed
31533: to him seemed to make no great practical difference, and were not
31534: formidable in the same way as these mysteriously-shadowed particular
31535: ideas. He could not quite divine what was going on within her; he could
31536: only seek the least abrupt path of disclosure.
31537: 
31538: “That is an object,” he said, after a moment, “which will by-and-by
31539: force me to leave England for some time—for some years. I have
31540: purposes which will take me to the East.”
31541: 
31542: Here was something clearer, but all the more immediately agitating.
31543: Gwendolen’s lips began to tremble. “But you will come back?” she said,
31544: tasting her own tears as they fell, before she thought of drying them.
31545: 
31546: Deronda could not sit still. He rose, and went to prop himself against
31547: the corner of the mantel-piece, at a different angle from her face. But
31548: when she had pressed her handkerchief against her cheeks, she turned
31549: and looked up at him, awaiting an answer.
31550: 
31551: “If I live,” said Deronda—“_some time_.”
31552: 
31553: They were both silent. He could not persuade himself to say more unless
31554: she led up to it by a question; and she was apparently meditating
31555: something that she had to say.
31556: 
31557: “What are you going to do?” she asked, at last, very mildly. “Can I
31558: understand the ideas, or am I too ignorant?”
31559: 
31560: “I am going to the East to become better acquainted with the condition
31561: of my race in various countries there,” said Deronda, gently—anxious
31562: to be as explanatory as he could on what was the impersonal part of
31563: their separateness from each other. “The idea that I am possessed with
31564: is that of restoring a political existence to my people, making them a
31565: nation again, giving them a national center, such as the English have,
31566: though they too are scattered over the face of the globe. That is a
31567: task which presents itself to me as a duty; I am resolved to begin it,
31568: however feebly. I am resolved to devote my life to it. At the least, I
31569: may awaken a movement in other minds, such as has been awakened in my
31570: own.”
31571: 
31572: There was a long silence between them. The world seemed getting larger
31573: round poor Gwendolen, and she more solitary and helpless in the midst.
31574: The thought that he might come back after going to the East, sank
31575: before the bewildering vision of these wild-stretching purposes in
31576: which she felt herself reduced to a mere speck. There comes a terrible
31577: moment to many souls when the great movements of the world, the larger
31578: destinies of mankind, which have lain aloof in newspapers and other
31579: neglected reading, enter like an earthquake into their own lives—where
31580: the slow urgency of growing generations turns into the tread of an
31581: invading army or the dire clash of civil war, and gray fathers know
31582: nothing to seek for but the corpses of their blooming sons, and girls
31583: forget all vanity to make lint and bandages which may serve for the
31584: shattered limbs of their betrothed husbands. Then it is as if the
31585: Invisible Power that had been the object of lip-worship and
31586: lip-resignation became visible, according to the imagery of the Hebrew
31587: poet, making the flames his chariot, and riding on the wings of the
31588: wind, till the mountains smoke and the plains shudder under the rolling
31589: fiery visitations. Often the good cause seems to lie prostrate under
31590: the thunder of unrelenting force, the martyrs live reviled, they die, and
31591: no angel is seen holding forth the crown and the palm branch. Then it
31592: is that the submission of the soul to the Highest is tested, and even
31593: in the eyes of frivolity life looks out from the scene of human
31594: struggle with the awful face of duty, and a religion shows itself which
31595: is something else than a private consolation.
31596: 
31597: That was the sort of crisis which was at this moment beginning in
31598: Gwendolen’s small life: she was for the first time feeling the pressure
31599: of a vast mysterious movement, for the first time being dislodged from
31600: her supremacy in her own world, and getting a sense that her horizon
31601: was but a dipping onward of an existence with which her own was
31602: revolving. All the troubles of her wifehood and widowhood had still
31603: left her with the implicit impression which had accompanied her from
31604: childhood, that whatever surrounded her was somehow specially for her,
31605: and it was because of this that no personal jealousy had been roused in
31606: her relation to Deronda: she could not spontaneously think of him as
31607: rightfully belonging to others more than to her. But here had come a
31608: shock which went deeper than personal jealousy—something spiritual and
31609: vaguely tremendous that thrust her away, and yet quelled all her anger
31610: into self-humiliation.
31611: 
31612: There had been a long silence. Deronda had stood still, even thankful
31613: for an interval before he needed to say more, and Gwendolen had sat
31614: like a statue with her wrists lying over each other and her eyes
31615: fixed—the intensity of her mental action arresting all other
31616: excitation. At length something occurred to her that made her turn her
31617: face to Deronda and say in a trembling voice,
31618: 
31619: “Is that all you can tell me?”
31620: 
31621: The question was like a dart to him. “The Jew whom I mentioned just
31622: now,” he answered, not without a certain tremor in his tones too, “the
31623: remarkable man who has greatly influenced my mind, has not perhaps been
31624: totally unheard of by you. He is the brother of Miss Lapidoth, whom you
31625: have often heard sing.”
31626: 
31627: A great wave of remembrance passed through Gwendolen and spread as a
31628: deep, painful flush over neck and face. It had come first at the scene
31629: of that morning when she had called on Mirah, and heard Deronda’s voice
31630: reading, and been told, without then heeding it, that he was reading
31631: Hebrew with Mirah’s brother.
31632: 
31633: “He is very ill—very near death now,” Deronda went on, nervously, and
31634: then stopped short. He felt that he must wait. Would she divine the
31635: rest?
31636: 
31637: “Did she tell you that I went to her?” said Gwendolen, abruptly,
31638: looking up at him.
31639: 
31640: “No,” said Deronda. “I don’t understand you.”
31641: 
31642: She turned away her eyes again, and sat thinking. Slowly the color
31643: dried out of face and neck, and she was as pale as before—with that
31644: almost withered paleness which is seen after a painful flush. At last
31645: she said—without turning toward him—in a low, measured voice, as if
31646: she were only thinking aloud in preparation for future speech,
31647: 
31648: “But _can_ you marry?”
31649: 
31650: “Yes,” said Deronda, also in a low voice. “I am going to marry.”
31651: 
31652: At first there was no change in Gwendolen’s attitude: she only began to
31653: tremble visibly; then she looked before her with dilated eyes, as at
31654: something lying in front of her, till she stretched her arms out
31655: straight, and cried with a smothered voice,
31656: 
31657: “I said I should be forsaken. I have been a cruel woman. And I am
31658: forsaken.”
31659: 
31660: Deronda’s anguish was intolerable. He could not help himself. He seized
31661: her outstretched hands and held them together, and kneeled at her feet.
31662: She was the victim of his happiness.
31663: 
31664: “I am cruel, too, I am cruel,” he repeated, with a sort of groan,
31665: looking up at her imploringly.
31666: 
31667: His presence and touch seemed to dispel a horrible vision, and she met
31668: his upward look of sorrow with something like the return of
31669: consciousness after fainting. Then she dwelt on it with that growing
31670: pathetic movement of the brow which accompanies the revival of some
31671: tender recollection. The look of sorrow brought back what seemed a very
31672: far-off moment—the first time she had ever seen it, in the library at
31673: the Abbey. Sobs rose, and great tears fell fast. Deronda would not let
31674: her hands go—held them still with one of his, and himself pressed her
31675: handkerchief against her eyes. She submitted like a half-soothed child,
31676: making an effort to speak, which was hindered by struggling sobs. At
31677: last she succeeded in saying, brokenly,
31678: 
31679: “I said—I said—it should be better—better with me—for having known
31680: you.”
31681: 
31682: His eyes too were larger with tears. She wrested one of her hands from
31683: his, and returned his action, pressing his tears away.
31684: 
31685: “We shall not be quite parted,” he said. “I will write to you always,
31686: when I can, and you will answer?”
31687: 
31688: He waited till she said in a whisper, “I will try.”
31689: 
31690: “I shall be more with you than I used to be,” Deronda said with gentle
31691: urgency, releasing her hands and rising from his kneeling posture. “If
31692: we had been much together before, we should have felt our differences
31693: more, and seemed to get farther apart. Now we can perhaps never see
31694: each other again. But our minds may get nearer.”
31695: 
31696: Gwendolen said nothing, but rose too, automatically. Her withered look
31697: of grief, such as the sun often shines on when the blinds are drawn up
31698: after the burial of life’s joy, made him hate his own words: they
31699: seemed to have the hardness of easy consolation in them. She felt that
31700: he was going, and that nothing could hinder it. The sense of it was
31701: like a dreadful whisper in her ear, which dulled all other
31702: consciousness; and she had not known that she was rising.
31703: 
31704: Deronda could not speak again. He thought that they must part in
31705: silence, but it was difficult to move toward the parting, till she
31706: looked at him with a sort of intention in her eyes, which helped him.
31707: He advanced to put out his hand silently, and when she had placed hers
31708: within it, she said what her mind had been laboring with,
31709: 
31710: “You have been very good to me. I have deserved nothing. I will
31711: try—try to live. I shall think of you. What good have I been? Only
31712: harm. Don’t let me be harm to _you_. It shall be the better for me—”
31713: 
31714: She could not finish. It was not that she was sobbing, but that the
31715: intense effort with which she spoke made her too tremulous. The burden
31716: of that difficult rectitude toward him was a weight her frame tottered
31717: under.
31718: 
31719: She bent forward to kiss his cheek, and he kissed hers. Then they
31720: looked at each other for an instant with clasped hands, and he turned
31721: away.
31722: 
31723: When he was quite gone, her mother came in and found her sitting
31724: motionless.
31725: 
31726: “Gwendolen, dearest, you look very ill,” she said, bending over her and
31727: touching her cold hands.
31728: 
31729: “Yes, mamma. But don’t be afraid. I am going to live,” said Gwendolen,
31730: bursting out hysterically.
31731: 
31732: Her mother persuaded her to go to bed, and watched by her. Through the
31733: day and half the night she fell continually into fits of shrieking, but
31734: cried in the midst of them to her mother, “Don’t be afraid. I shall
31735: live. I mean to live.”
31736: 
31737: After all, she slept; and when she waked in the morning light, she
31738: looked up fixedly at her mother and said tenderly, “Ah, poor mamma! You
31739: have been sitting up with me. Don’t be unhappy. I shall live. I shall
31740: be better.”
31741: 
31742: 
31743: 
31744: 
31745: CHAPTER LXX.
31746: 
31747:     In the checkered area of human experience the seasons are all mingled
31748:     as in the golden age: fruit and blossom hang together; in the same
31749:     moment the sickle is reaping and the seed is sprinkled; one tends the
31750:     green cluster and another treads the winepress. Nay, in each of our
31751:     lives harvest and spring-time are continually one, until himself
31752:     gathers us and sows us anew in his invisible fields.
31753: 
31754: 
31755: Among the blessings of love there is hardly one more exquisite than the
31756: sense that in uniting the beloved life to ours we can watch over its
31757: happiness, bring comfort where hardship was, and over memories of
31758: privation and suffering open the sweetest fountains of joy. Deronda’s
31759: love for Mirah was strongly imbued with that blessed protectiveness.
31760: Even with infantine feet she had begun to tread among thorns; and the
31761: first time he had beheld her face it had seemed to him the girlish
31762: image of despair.
31763: 
31764: But now she was glowing like a dark-tipped yet delicate ivory-tinted
31765: flower in the warm sunlight of content, thinking of any possible grief
31766: as part of that life with Deronda, which she could call by no other
31767: name than good. And he watched the sober gladness which gave new beauty
31768: to her movements; and her habitual attitudes of repose, with a delight
31769: which made him say to himself that it was enough of personal joy for
31770: him to save her from pain. She knew nothing of Hans’s struggle or of
31771: Gwendolen’s pang; for after the assurance that Deronda’s hidden love
31772: had been for her, she easily explained Gwendolen’s eager solicitude
31773: about him as part of a grateful dependence on his goodness, such as she
31774: herself had known. And all Deronda’s words about Mrs. Grandcourt
31775: confirmed that view of their relation, though he never touched on it
31776: except in the most distant manner. Mirah was ready to believe that he
31777: had been a rescuing angel to many besides herself. The only wonder was,
31778: that she among them all was to have the bliss of being continually by
31779: his side.
31780: 
31781: So, when the bridal veil was around Mirah it hid no doubtful
31782: tremors—only a thrill of awe at the acceptance of a great gift which
31783: required great uses. And the velvet canopy never covered a more goodly
31784: bride and bridegroom, to whom their people might more wisely wish
31785: offspring; more truthful lips never touched the sacrament
31786: marriage-wine; the marriage-blessing never gathered stronger promise of
31787: fulfillment than in the integrity of their mutual pledge. Naturally,
31788: they were married according to the Jewish rite. And since no religion
31789: seems yet to have demanded that when we make a feast we should invite
31790: only the highest rank of our acquaintances, few, it is to be hoped,
31791: will be offended to learn that among the guests at Deronda’s little
31792: wedding-feast was the entire Cohen family, with the one exception of
31793: the baby who carried on her teething intelligently at home. How could
31794: Mordecai have borne that those friends of his adversity should have
31795: been shut out from rejoicing in common with him?
31796: 
31797: Mrs. Meyrick so fully understood this that she had quite reconciled
31798: herself to meeting the Jewish pawnbroker, and was there with her three
31799: daughters—all of them enjoying the consciousness that Mirah’s marriage
31800: to Deronda crowned a romance which would always make a sweet memory to
31801: them. For which of them, mother or girls, had not had a generous part
31802: in it—giving their best in feeling and in act to her who needed? If
31803: Hans could have been there, it would have been better; but Mab had
31804: already observed that men must suffer for being so inconvenient;
31805: suppose she, Kate, and Amy had all fallen in love with Mr.
31806: Deronda?—but being women they were not so ridiculous.
31807: 
31808: The Meyricks were rewarded for conquering their prejudices by hearing a
31809: speech from Mr. Cohen, which had the rare quality among speeches of not
31810: being quite after the usual pattern. Jacob ate beyond his years, and
31811: contributed several small whinnying laughs as a free accompaniment of
31812: his father’s speech, not irreverently, but from a lively sense that his
31813: family was distinguishing itself; while Adelaide Rebekah, in a new
31814: Sabbath frock, maintained throughout a grave air of responsibility.
31815: 
31816: Mordecai’s brilliant eyes, sunken in their large sockets, dwelt on the
31817: scene with the cherishing benignancy of a spirit already lifted into an
31818: aloofness which nullified only selfish requirements and left sympathy
31819: alive. But continually, after his gaze had been traveling round on the
31820: others, it returned to dwell on Deronda with a fresh gleam of trusting
31821: affection.
31822: 
31823: The wedding-feast was humble, but Mirah was not without splendid
31824: wedding-gifts. As soon as the betrothal had been known, there were
31825: friends who had entertained graceful devices. Sir Hugo and Lady
31826: Mallinger had taken trouble to provide a complete equipment for Eastern
31827: travel, as well as a precious locket containing an inscription—“_To
31828: the bride of our dear Daniel Deronda all blessings. H. and L. M._” The
31829: Klesmers sent a perfect watch, also with a pretty inscription.
31830: 
31831: But something more precious than gold and gems came to Deronda from the
31832: neighborhood of Diplow on the morning of his marriage. It was a letter
31833: containing these words:
31834: 
31835:     Do not think of me sorrowfully on your wedding-day. I have remembered
31836:     your words—that I may live to be one of the best of women, who
31837:     make others glad that they were born. I do not yet see how that can
31838:     be, but you know better than I. If it ever comes true, it will be
31839:     because you helped me. I only thought of myself, and I made you
31840:     grieve. It hurts me now to think of your grief. You must not grieve
31841:     any more for me. It is better—it shall be better with me because I
31842:     have known you.
31843: 
31844:     GWENDOLEN GRANDCOURT.
31845: 
31846: The preparations for the departure of all three to the East began at
31847: once; for Deronda could not deny Ezra’s wish that they should set out
31848: on the voyage forthwith, so that he might go with them, instead of
31849: detaining them to watch over him. He had no belief that Ezra’s life
31850: would last through the voyage, for there were symptoms which seemed to
31851: show that the last stage of his malady had set in. But Ezra himself had
31852: said, “Never mind where I die, so that I am with you.”
31853: 
31854: He did not set out with them. One morning early he said to Deronda, “Do
31855: not quit me to-day. I shall die before it is ended.”
31856: 
31857: He chose to be dressed and sit up in his easy chair as usual, Deronda
31858: and Mirah on each side of him, and for some hours he was unusually
31859: silent, not even making the effort to speak, but looking at them
31860: occasionally with eyes full of some restful meaning, as if to assure
31861: them that while this remnant of breathing-time was difficult, he felt
31862: an ocean of peace beneath him.
31863: 
31864: It was not till late in the afternoon, when the light was falling, that
31865: he took a hand of each in his and said, looking at Deronda, “Death is
31866: coming to me as the divine kiss which is both parting and
31867: reunion—which takes me from your bodily eyes and gives me full
31868: presence in your soul. Where thou goest, Daniel, I shall go. Is it not
31869: begun? Have I not breathed my soul into you? We shall live together.”
31870: 
31871: He paused, and Deronda waited, thinking that there might be another
31872: word for him. But slowly and with effort Ezra, pressing on their hands,
31873: raised himself and uttered in Hebrew the confession of the divine
31874: Unity, which long for generations has been on the lips of the dying
31875: Israelite.
31876: 
31877: He sank back gently into his chair, and did not speak again. But it was
31878: some hours before he had ceased to breathe, with Mirah’s and Deronda’s
31879: arms around him.
31880: 
31881:   “Nothing is here for tears, nothing to wail
31882:   Or knock the breast; no weakness, no contempt,
31883:   Dispraise or blame; nothing but well and fair,
31884:   And what may quiet us in a death so noble.”
