85: Chapter I
86: The Workshop
87: 
88: 
89: With a single drop of ink for a mirror, the Egyptian sorcerer
90: undertakes to reveal to any chance comer far-reaching visions of the
91: past. This is what I undertake to do for you, reader. With this drop of
92: ink at the end of my pen, I will show you the roomy workshop of Mr.
93: Jonathan Burge, carpenter and builder, in the village of Hayslope, as
94: it appeared on the eighteenth of June, in the year of our Lord 1799.
95: 
96: The afternoon sun was warm on the five workmen there, busy upon doors
97: and window-frames and wainscoting. A scent of pine-wood from a tentlike
98: pile of planks outside the open door mingled itself with the scent of
99: the elder-bushes which were spreading their summer snow close to the
100: open window opposite; the slanting sunbeams shone through the
101: transparent shavings that flew before the steady plane, and lit up the
102: fine grain of the oak panelling which stood propped against the wall.
103: On a heap of those soft shavings a rough, grey shepherd dog had made
104: himself a pleasant bed, and was lying with his nose between his
105: fore-paws, occasionally wrinkling his brows to cast a glance at the
106: tallest of the five workmen, who was carving a shield in the centre of
107: a wooden mantelpiece. It was to this workman that the strong barytone
108: belonged which was heard above the sound of plane and hammer singing—
109: 
110: Awake, my soul, and with the sun
111: Thy daily stage of duty run;
112: Shake off dull sloth...
113: 
114: 
115: Here some measurement was to be taken which required more concentrated
116: attention, and the sonorous voice subsided into a low whistle; but it
117: presently broke out again with renewed vigour—
118: 
119: Let all thy converse be sincere,
120: Thy conscience as the noonday clear.
121: 
122: 
123: Such a voice could only come from a broad chest, and the broad chest
124: belonged to a large-boned, muscular man nearly six feet high, with a
125: back so flat and a head so well poised that when he drew himself up to
126: take a more distant survey of his work, he had the air of a soldier
127: standing at ease. The sleeve rolled up above the elbow showed an arm
128: that was likely to win the prize for feats of strength; yet the long
129: supple hand, with its broad finger-tips, looked ready for works of
130: skill. In his tall stalwartness Adam Bede was a Saxon, and justified
131: his name; but the jet-black hair, made the more noticeable by its
132: contrast with the light paper cap, and the keen glance of the dark eyes
133: that shone from under strongly marked, prominent and mobile eyebrows,
134: indicated a mixture of Celtic blood. The face was large and roughly
135: hewn, and when in repose had no other beauty than such as belongs to an
136: expression of good-humoured honest intelligence.
137: 
138: It is clear at a glance that the next workman is Adam’s brother. He is
139: nearly as tall; he has the same type of features, the same hue of hair
140: and complexion; but the strength of the family likeness seems only to
141: render more conspicuous the remarkable difference of expression both in
142: form and face. Seth’s broad shoulders have a slight stoop; his eyes are
143: grey; his eyebrows have less prominence and more repose than his
144: brother’s; and his glance, instead of being keen, is confiding and
145: benign. He has thrown off his paper cap, and you see that his hair is
146: not thick and straight, like Adam’s, but thin and wavy, allowing you to
147: discern the exact contour of a coronal arch that predominates very
148: decidedly over the brow.
149: 
150: The idle tramps always felt sure they could get a copper from Seth;
151: they scarcely ever spoke to Adam.
152: 
153: The concert of the tools and Adam’s voice was at last broken by Seth,
154: who, lifting the door at which he had been working intently, placed it
155: against the wall, and said, “There! I’ve finished my door to-day,
156: anyhow.”
157: 
158: The workmen all looked up; Jim Salt, a burly, red-haired man known as
159: Sandy Jim, paused from his planing, and Adam said to Seth, with a sharp
160: glance of surprise, “What! Dost think thee’st finished the door?”
161: 
162: “Aye, sure,” said Seth, with answering surprise; “what’s awanting
163: to’t?”
164: 
165: A loud roar of laughter from the other three workmen made Seth look
166: round confusedly. Adam did not join in the laughter, but there was a
167: slight smile on his face as he said, in a gentler tone than before,
168: “Why, thee’st forgot the panels.”
169: 
170: The laughter burst out afresh as Seth clapped his hands to his head,
171: and coloured over brow and crown.
172: 
173: “Hoorray!” shouted a small lithe fellow called Wiry Ben, running
174: forward and seizing the door. “We’ll hang up th’ door at fur end o’ th’
175: shop an’ write on’t ‘Seth Bede, the Methody, his work.’ Here, Jim,
176: lend’s hould o’ th’ red pot.”
177: 
178: “Nonsense!” said Adam. “Let it alone, Ben Cranage. You’ll mayhap be
179: making such a slip yourself some day; you’ll laugh o’ th’ other side o’
180: your mouth then.”
181: 
182: “Catch me at it, Adam. It’ll be a good while afore my head’s full o’
183: th’ Methodies,” said Ben.
184: 
185: “Nay, but it’s often full o’ drink, and that’s worse.”
186: 
187: Ben, however, had now got the “red pot” in his hand, and was about to
188: begin writing his inscription, making, by way of preliminary, an
189: imaginary S in the air.
190: 
191: “Let it alone, will you?” Adam called out, laying down his tools,
192: striding up to Ben, and seizing his right shoulder. “Let it alone, or
193: I’ll shake the soul out o’ your body.”
194: 
195: Ben shook in Adam’s iron grasp, but, like a plucky small man as he was,
196: he didn’t mean to give in. With his left hand he snatched the brush
197: from his powerless right, and made a movement as if he would perform
198: the feat of writing with his left. In a moment Adam turned him round,
199: seized his other shoulder, and, pushing him along, pinned him against
200: the wall. But now Seth spoke.
201: 
202: “Let be, Addy, let be. Ben will be joking. Why, he’s i’ the right to
203: laugh at me—I canna help laughing at myself.”
204: 
205: “I shan’t loose him till he promises to let the door alone,” said Adam.
206: 
207: “Come, Ben, lad,” said Seth, in a persuasive tone, “don’t let’s have a
208: quarrel about it. You know Adam will have his way. You may’s well try
209: to turn a waggon in a narrow lane. Say you’ll leave the door alone, and
210: make an end on’t.”
211: 
212: “I binna frighted at Adam,” said Ben, “but I donna mind sayin’ as I’ll
213: let ’t alone at your askin’, Seth.”
214: 
215: “Come, that’s wise of you, Ben,” said Adam, laughing and relaxing his
216: grasp.
217: 
218: They all returned to their work now; but Wiry Ben, having had the worst
219: in the bodily contest, was bent on retrieving that humiliation by a
220: success in sarcasm.
221: 
222: “Which was ye thinkin’ on, Seth,” he began—“the pretty parson’s face or
223: her sarmunt, when ye forgot the panels?”
224: 
225: “Come and hear her, Ben,” said Seth, good-humouredly; “she’s going to
226: preach on the Green to-night; happen ye’d get something to think on
227: yourself then, instead o’ those wicked songs you’re so fond on. Ye
228: might get religion, and that ’ud be the best day’s earnings y’ ever
229: made.”
230: 
231: “All i’ good time for that, Seth; I’ll think about that when I’m
232: a-goin’ to settle i’ life; bachelors doesn’t want such heavy earnin’s.
233: Happen I shall do the coortin’ an’ the religion both together, as _ye_
234: do, Seth; but ye wouldna ha’ me get converted an’ chop in atween ye an’
235: the pretty preacher, an’ carry her aff?”
236: 
237: “No fear o’ that, Ben; she’s neither for you nor for me to win, I
238: doubt. Only you come and hear her, and you won’t speak lightly on her
239: again.”
240: 
241: “Well, I’m half a mind t’ ha’ a look at her to-night, if there isn’t
242: good company at th’ Holly Bush. What’ll she take for her text? Happen
243: ye can tell me, Seth, if so be as I shouldna come up i’ time for’t.
244: Will’t be—what come ye out for to see? A prophetess? Yea, I say unto
245: you, and more than a prophetess—a uncommon pretty young woman.”
246: 
247: “Come, Ben,” said Adam, rather sternly, “you let the words o’ the Bible
248: alone; you’re going too far now.”
249: 
250: “What! Are _ye_ a-turnin’ roun’, Adam? I thought ye war dead again th’
251: women preachin’, a while agoo?”
252: 
253: “Nay, I’m not turnin’ noway. I said nought about the women preachin’. I
254: said, You let the Bible alone: you’ve got a jest-book, han’t you, as
255: you’re rare and proud on? Keep your dirty fingers to that.”
256: 
257: “Why, y’ are gettin’ as big a saint as Seth. Y’ are goin’ to th’
258: preachin’ to-night, I should think. Ye’ll do finely t’ lead the
259: singin’. But I don’ know what Parson Irwine ’ull say at his gran’
260: favright Adam Bede a-turnin’ Methody.”
261: 
262: “Never do you bother yourself about me, Ben. I’m not a-going to turn
263: Methodist any more nor you are—though it’s like enough you’ll turn to
264: something worse. Mester Irwine’s got more sense nor to meddle wi’
265: people’s doing as they like in religion. That’s between themselves and
266: God, as he’s said to me many a time.”
267: 
268: “Aye, aye; but he’s none so fond o’ your dissenters, for all that.”
269: 
270: “Maybe; I’m none so fond o’ Josh Tod’s thick ale, but I don’t hinder
271: you from making a fool o’ yourself wi’t.”
272: 
273: There was a laugh at this thrust of Adam’s, but Seth said, very
274: seriously. “Nay, nay, Addy, thee mustna say as anybody’s religion’s
275: like thick ale. Thee dostna believe but what the dissenters and the
276: Methodists have got the root o’ the matter as well as the church
277: folks.”
278: 
279: “Nay, Seth, lad; I’m not for laughing at no man’s religion. Let ’em
280: follow their consciences, that’s all. Only I think it ’ud be better if
281: their consciences ’ud let ’em stay quiet i’ the church—there’s a deal
282: to be learnt there. And there’s such a thing as being oversperitial; we
283: must have something beside Gospel i’ this world. Look at the canals,
284: an’ th’ aqueduc’s, an’ th’ coal-pit engines, and Arkwright’s mills
285: there at Cromford; a man must learn summat beside Gospel to make them
286: things, I reckon. But t’ hear some o’ them preachers, you’d think as a
287: man must be doing nothing all’s life but shutting’s eyes and looking
288: what’s agoing on inside him. I know a man must have the love o’ God in
289: his soul, and the Bible’s God’s word. But what does the Bible say? Why,
290: it says as God put his sperrit into the workman as built the
291: tabernacle, to make him do all the carved work and things as wanted a
292: nice hand. And this is my way o’ looking at it: there’s the sperrit o’
293: God in all things and all times—weekday as well as Sunday—and i’ the
294: great works and inventions, and i’ the figuring and the mechanics. And
295: God helps us with our headpieces and our hands as well as with our
296: souls; and if a man does bits o’ jobs out o’ working hours—builds a
297: oven for ’s wife to save her from going to the bakehouse, or scrats at
298: his bit o’ garden and makes two potatoes grow istead o’ one, he’s doin’
299: more good, and he’s just as near to God, as if he was running after
300: some preacher and a-praying and a-groaning.”
301: 
302: “Well done, Adam!” said Sandy Jim, who had paused from his planing to
303: shift his planks while Adam was speaking; “that’s the best sarmunt I’ve
304: heared this long while. By th’ same token, my wife’s been a-plaguin’ on
305: me to build her a oven this twelvemont.”
306: 
307: “There’s reason in what thee say’st, Adam,” observed Seth, gravely.
308: “But thee know’st thyself as it’s hearing the preachers thee find’st so
309: much fault with has turned many an idle fellow into an industrious un.
310: It’s the preacher as empties th’ alehouse; and if a man gets religion,
311: he’ll do his work none the worse for that.”
312: 
313: “On’y he’ll lave the panels out o’ th’ doors sometimes, eh, Seth?” said
314: Wiry Ben.
315: 
316: “Ah, Ben, you’ve got a joke again’ me as ’ll last you your life. But it
317: isna religion as was i’ fault there; it was Seth Bede, as was allays a
318: wool-gathering chap, and religion hasna cured him, the more’s the
319: pity.”
320: 
321: “Ne’er heed me, Seth,” said Wiry Ben, “y’ are a down-right good-hearted
322: chap, panels or no panels; an’ ye donna set up your bristles at every
323: bit o’ fun, like some o’ your kin, as is mayhap cliverer.”
324: 
325: “Seth, lad,” said Adam, taking no notice of the sarcasm against
326: himself, “thee mustna take me unkind. I wasna driving at thee in what I
327: said just now. Some ’s got one way o’ looking at things and some ’s got
328: another.”
329: 
330: “Nay, nay, Addy, thee mean’st me no unkindness,” said Seth, “I know
331: that well enough. Thee’t like thy dog Gyp—thee bark’st at me sometimes,
332: but thee allays lick’st my hand after.”
333: 
334: All hands worked on in silence for some minutes, until the church clock
335: began to strike six. Before the first stroke had died away, Sandy Jim
336: had loosed his plane and was reaching his jacket; Wiry Ben had left a
337: screw half driven in, and thrown his screwdriver into his tool-basket;
338: Mum Taft, who, true to his name, had kept silence throughout the
339: previous conversation, had flung down his hammer as he was in the act
340: of lifting it; and Seth, too, had straightened his back, and was
341: putting out his hand towards his paper cap. Adam alone had gone on with
342: his work as if nothing had happened. But observing the cessation of the
343: tools, he looked up, and said, in a tone of indignation, “Look there,
344: now! I can’t abide to see men throw away their tools i’ that way, the
345: minute the clock begins to strike, as if they took no pleasure i’ their
346: work and was afraid o’ doing a stroke too much.”
347: 
348: Seth looked a little conscious, and began to be slower in his
349: preparations for going, but Mum Taft broke silence, and said, “Aye,
350: aye, Adam lad, ye talk like a young un. When y’ are six-an’-forty like
351: me, istid o’ six-an’-twenty, ye wonna be so flush o’ workin’ for
352: nought.”
353: 
354: “Nonsense,” said Adam, still wrathful; “what’s age got to do with it, I
355: wonder? Ye arena getting stiff yet, I reckon. I hate to see a man’s
356: arms drop down as if he was shot, before the clock’s fairly struck,
357: just as if he’d never a bit o’ pride and delight in ’s work. The very
358: grindstone ’ull go on turning a bit after you loose it.”
359: 
360: “Bodderation, Adam!” exclaimed Wiry Ben; “lave a chap aloon, will ’ee?
361: Ye war afinding faut wi’ preachers a while agoo—y’ are fond enough o’
362: preachin’ yoursen. Ye may like work better nor play, but I like play
363: better nor work; that’ll ’commodate ye—it laves ye th’ more to do.”
364: 
365: With this exit speech, which he considered effective, Wiry Ben
366: shouldered his basket and left the workshop, quickly followed by Mum
367: Taft and Sandy Jim. Seth lingered, and looked wistfully at Adam, as if
368: he expected him to say something.
369: 
370: “Shalt go home before thee go’st to the preaching?” Adam asked, looking
371: up.
372: 
373: “Nay; I’ve got my hat and things at Will Maskery’s. I shan’t be home
374: before going for ten. I’ll happen see Dinah Morris safe home, if she’s
375: willing. There’s nobody comes with her from Poyser’s, thee know’st.”
376: 
377: “Then I’ll tell mother not to look for thee,” said Adam.
378: 
379: “Thee artna going to Poyser’s thyself to-night?” said Seth rather
380: timidly, as he turned to leave the workshop.
381: 
382: “Nay, I’m going to th’ school.”
383: 
384: Hitherto Gyp had kept his comfortable bed, only lifting up his head and
385: watching Adam more closely as he noticed the other workmen departing.
386: But no sooner did Adam put his ruler in his pocket, and begin to twist
387: his apron round his waist, than Gyp ran forward and looked up in his
388: master’s face with patient expectation. If Gyp had had a tail he would
389: doubtless have wagged it, but being destitute of that vehicle for his
390: emotions, he was like many other worthy personages, destined to appear
391: more phlegmatic than nature had made him.
392: 
393: “What! Art ready for the basket, eh, Gyp?” said Adam, with the same
394: gentle modulation of voice as when he spoke to Seth.
395: 
396: Gyp jumped and gave a short bark, as much as to say, “Of course.” Poor
397: fellow, he had not a great range of expression.
398: 
399: The basket was the one which on workdays held Adam’s and Seth’s dinner;
400: and no official, walking in procession, could look more resolutely
401: unconscious of all acquaintances than Gyp with his basket, trotting at
402: his master’s heels.
403: 
404: On leaving the workshop Adam locked the door, took the key out, and
405: carried it to the house on the other side of the woodyard. It was a low
406: house, with smooth grey thatch and buff walls, looking pleasant and
407: mellow in the evening light. The leaded windows were bright and
408: speckless, and the door-stone was as clean as a white boulder at ebb
409: tide. On the door-stone stood a clean old woman, in a dark-striped
410: linen gown, a red kerchief, and a linen cap, talking to some speckled
411: fowls which appeared to have been drawn towards her by an illusory
412: expectation of cold potatoes or barley. The old woman’s sight seemed to
413: be dim, for she did not recognize Adam till he said, “Here’s the key,
414: Dolly; lay it down for me in the house, will you?”
415: 
416: “Aye, sure; but wunna ye come in, Adam? Miss Mary’s i’ th’ house, and
417: Mester Burge ’ull be back anon; he’d be glad t’ ha’ ye to supper wi’m,
418: I’ll be’s warrand.”
419: 
420: “No, Dolly, thank you; I’m off home. Good evening.”
421: 
422: Adam hastened with long strides, Gyp close to his heels, out of the
423: workyard, and along the highroad leading away from the village and down
424: to the valley. As he reached the foot of the slope, an elderly
425: horseman, with his portmanteau strapped behind him, stopped his horse
426: when Adam had passed him, and turned round to have another long look at
427: the stalwart workman in paper cap, leather breeches, and dark-blue
428: worsted stockings.
429: 
430: Adam, unconscious of the admiration he was exciting, presently struck
431: across the fields, and now broke out into the tune which had all day
432: long been running in his head:
433: 
434: Let all thy converse be sincere,
435: Thy conscience as the noonday clear;
436: For God’s all-seeing eye surveys
437: Thy secret thoughts, thy works and ways.
438:

442: Chapter II
443: The Preaching
444: 
445: 
446: About a quarter to seven there was an unusual appearance of excitement
447: in the village of Hayslope, and through the whole length of its little
448: street, from the Donnithorne Arms to the churchyard gate, the
449: inhabitants had evidently been drawn out of their houses by something
450: more than the pleasure of lounging in the evening sunshine. The
451: Donnithorne Arms stood at the entrance of the village, and a small
452: farmyard and stackyard which flanked it, indicating that there was a
453: pretty take of land attached to the inn, gave the traveller a promise
454: of good feed for himself and his horse, which might well console him
455: for the ignorance in which the weather-beaten sign left him as to the
456: heraldic bearings of that ancient family, the Donnithornes. Mr. Casson,
457: the landlord, had been for some time standing at the door with his
458: hands in his pockets, balancing himself on his heels and toes and
459: looking towards a piece of unenclosed ground, with a maple in the
460: middle of it, which he knew to be the destination of certain
461: grave-looking men and women whom he had observed passing at intervals.
462: 
463: Mr. Casson’s person was by no means of that common type which can be
464: allowed to pass without description. On a front view it appeared to
465: consist principally of two spheres, bearing about the same relation to
466: each other as the earth and the moon: that is to say, the lower sphere
467: might be said, at a rough guess, to be thirteen times larger than the
468: upper which naturally performed the function of a mere satellite and
469: tributary. But here the resemblance ceased, for Mr. Casson’s head was
470: not at all a melancholy-looking satellite nor was it a “spotty globe,”
471: as Milton has irreverently called the moon; on the contrary, no head
472: and face could look more sleek and healthy, and its expression—which
473: was chiefly confined to a pair of round and ruddy cheeks, the slight
474: knot and interruptions forming the nose and eyes being scarcely worth
475: mention—was one of jolly contentment, only tempered by that sense of
476: personal dignity which usually made itself felt in his attitude and
477: bearing. This sense of dignity could hardly be considered excessive in
478: a man who had been butler to “the family” for fifteen years, and who,
479: in his present high position, was necessarily very much in contact with
480: his inferiors. How to reconcile his dignity with the satisfaction of
481: his curiosity by walking towards the Green was the problem that Mr.
482: Casson had been revolving in his mind for the last five minutes; but
483: when he had partly solved it by taking his hands out of his pockets,
484: and thrusting them into the armholes of his waistcoat, by throwing his
485: head on one side, and providing himself with an air of contemptuous
486: indifference to whatever might fall under his notice, his thoughts were
487: diverted by the approach of the horseman whom we lately saw pausing to
488: have another look at our friend Adam, and who now pulled up at the door
489: of the Donnithorne Arms.
490: 
491: “Take off the bridle and give him a drink, ostler,” said the traveller
492: to the lad in a smock-frock, who had come out of the yard at the sound
493: of the horse’s hoofs.
494: 
495: “Why, what’s up in your pretty village, landlord?” he continued,
496: getting down. “There seems to be quite a stir.”
497: 
498: “It’s a Methodis’ preaching, sir; it’s been gev hout as a young woman’s
499: a-going to preach on the Green,” answered Mr. Casson, in a treble and
500: wheezy voice, with a slightly mincing accent. “Will you please to step
501: in, sir, an’ tek somethink?”
502: 
503: “No, I must be getting on to Rosseter. I only want a drink for my
504: horse. And what does your parson say, I wonder, to a young woman
505: preaching just under his nose?”
506: 
507: “Parson Irwine, sir, doesn’t live here; he lives at Brox’on, over the
508: hill there. The parsonage here’s a tumble-down place, sir, not fit for
509: gentry to live in. He comes here to preach of a Sunday afternoon, sir,
510: an’ puts up his hoss here. It’s a grey cob, sir, an’ he sets great
511: store by’t. He’s allays put up his hoss here, sir, iver since before I
512: hed the Donnithorne Arms. I’m not this countryman, you may tell by my
513: tongue, sir. They’re cur’ous talkers i’ this country, sir; the gentry’s
514: hard work to hunderstand ’em. I was brought hup among the gentry, sir,
515: an’ got the turn o’ their tongue when I was a bye. Why, what do you
516: think the folks here says for ‘hevn’t you?’—the gentry, you know, says,
517: ‘hevn’t you’—well, the people about here says ‘hanna yey.’ It’s what
518: they call the dileck as is spoke hereabout, sir. That’s what I’ve
519: heared Squire Donnithorne say many a time; it’s the dileck, says he.”
520: 
521: “Aye, aye,” said the stranger, smiling. “I know it very well. But
522: you’ve not got many Methodists about here, surely—in this agricultural
523: spot? I should have thought there would hardly be such a thing as a
524: Methodist to be found about here. You’re all farmers, aren’t you? The
525: Methodists can seldom lay much hold on _them_.”
526: 
527: “Why, sir, there’s a pretty lot o’ workmen round about, sir. There’s
528: Mester Burge as owns the timber-yard over there, he underteks a good
529: bit o’ building an’ repairs. An’ there’s the stone-pits not far off.
530: There’s plenty of emply i’ this countryside, sir. An’ there’s a fine
531: batch o’ Methodisses at Treddles’on—that’s the market town about three
532: mile off—you’ll maybe ha’ come through it, sir. There’s pretty nigh a
533: score of ’em on the Green now, as come from there. That’s where our
534: people gets it from, though there’s only two men of ’em in all
535: Hayslope: that’s Will Maskery, the wheelwright, and Seth Bede, a young
536: man as works at the carpenterin’.”
537: 
538: “The preacher comes from Treddleston, then, does she?”
539: 
540: “Nay, sir, she comes out o’ Stonyshire, pretty nigh thirty mile off.
541: But she’s a-visitin’ hereabout at Mester Poyser’s at the Hall Farm—it’s
542: them barns an’ big walnut-trees, right away to the left, sir. She’s own
543: niece to Poyser’s wife, an’ they’ll be fine an’ vexed at her for making
544: a fool of herself i’ that way. But I’ve heared as there’s no holding
545: these Methodisses when the maggit’s once got i’ their head: many of ’em
546: goes stark starin’ mad wi’ their religion. Though this young woman’s
547: quiet enough to look at, by what I can make out; I’ve not seen her
548: myself.”
549: 
550: “Well, I wish I had time to wait and see her, but I must get on. I’ve
551: been out of my way for the last twenty minutes to have a look at that
552: place in the valley. It’s Squire Donnithorne’s, I suppose?”
553: 
554: “Yes, sir, that’s Donnithorne Chase, that is. Fine hoaks there, isn’t
555: there, sir? I should know what it is, sir, for I’ve lived butler there
556: a-going i’ fifteen year. It’s Captain Donnithorne as is th’ heir,
557: sir—Squire Donnithorne’s grandson. He’ll be comin’ of hage this
558: ’ay-’arvest, sir, an’ we shall hev fine doin’s. He owns all the land
559: about here, sir, Squire Donnithorne does.”
560: 
561: “Well, it’s a pretty spot, whoever may own it,” said the traveller,
562: mounting his horse; “and one meets some fine strapping fellows about
563: too. I met as fine a young fellow as ever I saw in my life, about half
564: an hour ago, before I came up the hill—a carpenter, a tall,
565: broad-shouldered fellow with black hair and black eyes, marching along
566: like a soldier. We want such fellows as he to lick the French.”
567: 
568: “Aye, sir, that’s Adam Bede, that is, I’ll be bound—Thias Bede’s son
569: everybody knows him hereabout. He’s an uncommon clever stiddy fellow,
570: an’ wonderful strong. Lord bless you, sir—if you’ll hexcuse me for
571: saying so—he can walk forty mile a-day, an’ lift a matter o’ sixty
572: ston’. He’s an uncommon favourite wi’ the gentry, sir: Captain
573: Donnithorne and Parson Irwine meks a fine fuss wi’ him. But he’s a
574: little lifted up an’ peppery-like.”
575: 
576: “Well, good evening to you, landlord; I must get on.”
577: 
578: “Your servant, sir; good evenin’.”
579: 
580: The traveller put his horse into a quick walk up the village, but when
581: he approached the Green, the beauty of the view that lay on his right
582: hand, the singular contrast presented by the groups of villagers with
583: the knot of Methodists near the maple, and perhaps yet more, curiosity
584: to see the young female preacher, proved too much for his anxiety to
585: get to the end of his journey, and he paused.
586: 
587: The Green lay at the extremity of the village, and from it the road
588: branched off in two directions, one leading farther up the hill by the
589: church, and the other winding gently down towards the valley. On the
590: side of the Green that led towards the church, the broken line of
591: thatched cottages was continued nearly to the churchyard gate; but on
592: the opposite northwestern side, there was nothing to obstruct the view
593: of gently swelling meadow, and wooded valley, and dark masses of
594: distant hill. That rich undulating district of Loamshire to which
595: Hayslope belonged lies close to a grim outskirt of Stonyshire,
596: overlooked by its barren hills as a pretty blooming sister may
597: sometimes be seen linked in the arm of a rugged, tall, swarthy brother;
598: and in two or three hours’ ride the traveller might exchange a bleak
599: treeless region, intersected by lines of cold grey stone, for one where
600: his road wound under the shelter of woods, or up swelling hills,
601: muffled with hedgerows and long meadow-grass and thick corn; and where
602: at every turn he came upon some fine old country-seat nestled in the
603: valley or crowning the slope, some homestead with its long length of
604: barn and its cluster of golden ricks, some grey steeple looking out
605: from a pretty confusion of trees and thatch and dark-red tiles. It was
606: just such a picture as this last that Hayslope Church had made to the
607: traveller as he began to mount the gentle slope leading to its pleasant
608: uplands, and now from his station near the Green he had before him in
609: one view nearly all the other typical features of this pleasant land.
610: High up against the horizon were the huge conical masses of hill, like
611: giant mounds intended to fortify this region of corn and grass against
612: the keen and hungry winds of the north; not distant enough to be
613: clothed in purple mystery, but with sombre greenish sides visibly
614: specked with sheep, whose motion was only revealed by memory, not
615: detected by sight; wooed from day to day by the changing hours, but
616: responding with no change in themselves—left for ever grim and sullen
617: after the flush of morning, the winged gleams of the April noonday, the
618: parting crimson glory of the ripening summer sun. And directly below
619: them the eye rested on a more advanced line of hanging woods, divided
620: by bright patches of pasture or furrowed crops, and not yet deepened
621: into the uniform leafy curtains of high summer, but still showing the
622: warm tints of the young oak and the tender green of the ash and lime.
623: Then came the valley, where the woods grew thicker, as if they had
624: rolled down and hurried together from the patches left smooth on the
625: slope, that they might take the better care of the tall mansion which
626: lifted its parapets and sent its faint blue summer smoke among them.
627: Doubtless there was a large sweep of park and a broad glassy pool in
628: front of that mansion, but the swelling slope of meadow would not let
629: our traveller see them from the village green. He saw instead a
630: foreground which was just as lovely—the level sunlight lying like
631: transparent gold among the gently curving stems of the feathered grass
632: and the tall red sorrel, and the white ambels of the hemlocks lining
633: the bushy hedgerows. It was that moment in summer when the sound of the
634: scythe being whetted makes us cast more lingering looks at the
635: flower-sprinkled tresses of the meadows.
636: 
637: He might have seen other beauties in the landscape if he had turned a
638: little in his saddle and looked eastward, beyond Jonathan Burge’s
639: pasture and woodyard towards the green corn-fields and walnut-trees of
640: the Hall Farm; but apparently there was more interest for him in the
641: living groups close at hand. Every generation in the village was there,
642: from old “Feyther Taft” in his brown worsted night-cap, who was bent
643: nearly double, but seemed tough enough to keep on his legs a long
644: while, leaning on his short stick, down to the babies with their little
645: round heads lolling forward in quilted linen caps. Now and then there
646: was a new arrival; perhaps a slouching labourer, who, having eaten his
647: supper, came out to look at the unusual scene with a slow bovine gaze,
648: willing to hear what any one had to say in explanation of it, but by no
649: means excited enough to ask a question. But all took care not to join
650: the Methodists on the Green, and identify themselves in that way with
651: the expectant audience, for there was not one of them that would not
652: have disclaimed the imputation of having come out to hear the “preacher
653: woman”—they had only come out to see “what war a-goin’ on, like.” The
654: men were chiefly gathered in the neighbourhood of the blacksmith’s
655: shop. But do not imagine them gathered in a knot. Villagers never
656: swarm: a whisper is unknown among them, and they seem almost as
657: incapable of an undertone as a cow or a stag. Your true rustic turns
658: his back on his interlocutor, throwing a question over his shoulder as
659: if he meant to run away from the answer, and walking a step or two
660: farther off when the interest of the dialogue culminates. So the group
661: in the vicinity of the blacksmith’s door was by no means a close one,
662: and formed no screen in front of Chad Cranage, the blacksmith himself,
663: who stood with his black brawny arms folded, leaning against the
664: door-post, and occasionally sending forth a bellowing laugh at his own
665: jokes, giving them a marked preference over the sarcasms of Wiry Ben,
666: who had renounced the pleasures of the Holly Bush for the sake of
667: seeing life under a new form. But both styles of wit were treated with
668: equal contempt by Mr. Joshua Rann. Mr. Rann’s leathern apron and
669: subdued griminess can leave no one in any doubt that he is the village
670: shoemaker; the thrusting out of his chin and stomach and the twirling
671: of his thumbs are more subtle indications, intended to prepare unwary
672: strangers for the discovery that they are in the presence of the parish
673: clerk. “Old Joshway,” as he is irreverently called by his neighbours,
674: is in a state of simmering indignation; but he has not yet opened his
675: lips except to say, in a resounding bass undertone, like the tuning of
676: a violoncello, “Sehon, King of the Amorites; for His mercy endureth for
677: ever; and Og the King of Basan: for His mercy endureth for ever”—a
678: quotation which may seem to have slight bearing on the present
679: occasion, but, as with every other anomaly, adequate knowledge will
680: show it to be a natural sequence. Mr. Rann was inwardly maintaining the
681: dignity of the Church in the face of this scandalous irruption of
682: Methodism, and as that dignity was bound up with his own sonorous
683: utterance of the responses, his argument naturally suggested a
684: quotation from the psalm he had read the last Sunday afternoon.
685: 
686: The stronger curiosity of the women had drawn them quite to the edge of
687: the Green, where they could examine more closely the Quakerlike costume
688: and odd deportment of the female Methodists. Underneath the maple there
689: was a small cart, which had been brought from the wheelwright’s to
690: serve as a pulpit, and round this a couple of benches and a few chairs
691: had been placed. Some of the Methodists were resting on these, with
692: their eyes closed, as if wrapt in prayer or meditation. Others chose to
693: continue standing, and had turned their faces towards the villagers
694: with a look of melancholy compassion, which was highly amusing to Bessy
695: Cranage, the blacksmith’s buxom daughter, known to her neighbours as
696: Chad’s Bess, who wondered “why the folks war amakin’ faces a that’ns.”
697: Chad’s Bess was the object of peculiar compassion, because her hair,
698: being turned back under a cap which was set at the top of her head,
699: exposed to view an ornament of which she was much prouder than of her
700: red cheeks—namely, a pair of large round ear-rings with false garnets
701: in them, ornaments condemned not only by the Methodists, but by her own
702: cousin and namesake Timothy’s Bess, who, with much cousinly feeling,
703: often wished “them ear-rings” might come to good.
704: 
705: Timothy’s Bess, though retaining her maiden appellation among her
706: familiars, had long been the wife of Sandy Jim, and possessed a
707: handsome set of matronly jewels, of which it is enough to mention the
708: heavy baby she was rocking in her arms, and the sturdy fellow of five
709: in knee-breeches, and red legs, who had a rusty milk-can round his neck
710: by way of drum, and was very carefully avoided by Chad’s small terrier.
711: This young olive-branch, notorious under the name of Timothy’s Bess’s
712: Ben, being of an inquiring disposition, unchecked by any false modesty,
713: had advanced beyond the group of women and children, and was walking
714: round the Methodists, looking up in their faces with his mouth wide
715: open, and beating his stick against the milk-can by way of musical
716: accompaniment. But one of the elderly women bending down to take him by
717: the shoulder, with an air of grave remonstrance, Timothy’s Bess’s Ben
718: first kicked out vigorously, then took to his heels and sought refuge
719: behind his father’s legs.
720: 
721: “Ye gallows young dog,” said Sandy Jim, with some paternal pride, “if
722: ye donna keep that stick quiet, I’ll tek it from ye. What dy’e mane by
723: kickin’ foulks?”
724: 
725: “Here! Gie him here to me, Jim,” said Chad Cranage; “I’ll tie hirs up
726: an’ shoe him as I do th’ hosses. Well, Mester Casson,” he continued, as
727: that personage sauntered up towards the group of men, “how are ye t’
728: naight? Are ye coom t’ help groon? They say folks allays groon when
729: they’re hearkenin’ to th’ Methodys, as if they war bad i’ th’ inside. I
730: mane to groon as loud as your cow did th’ other naight, an’ then the
731: praicher ’ull think I’m i’ th’ raight way.”
732: 
733: “I’d advise you not to be up to no nonsense, Chad,” said Mr. Casson,
734: with some dignity; “Poyser wouldn’t like to hear as his wife’s niece
735: was treated any ways disrespectful, for all he mayn’t be fond of her
736: taking on herself to preach.”
737: 
738: “Aye, an’ she’s a pleasant-looked un too,” said Wiry Ben. “I’ll stick
739: up for the pretty women preachin’; I know they’d persuade me over a
740: deal sooner nor th’ ugly men. I shouldna wonder if I turn Methody afore
741: the night’s out, an’ begin to coort the preacher, like Seth Bede.”
742: 
743: “Why, Seth’s looking rether too high, I should think,” said Mr. Casson.
744: “This woman’s kin wouldn’t like her to demean herself to a common
745: carpenter.”
746: 
747: “Tchu!” said Ben, with a long treble intonation, “what’s folks’s kin
748: got to do wi’t? Not a chip. Poyser’s wife may turn her nose up an’
749: forget bygones, but this Dinah Morris, they tell me, ’s as poor as iver
750: she was—works at a mill, an’s much ado to keep hersen. A strappin’
751: young carpenter as is a ready-made Methody, like Seth, wouldna be a bad
752: match for her. Why, Poysers make as big a fuss wi’ Adam Bede as if he
753: war a nevvy o’ their own.”
754: 
755: “Idle talk! idle talk!” said Mr. Joshua Rann. “Adam an’ Seth’s two men;
756: you wunna fit them two wi’ the same last.”
757: 
758: “Maybe,” said Wiry Ben, contemptuously, “but Seth’s the lad for me,
759: though he war a Methody twice o’er. I’m fair beat wi’ Seth, for I’ve
760: been teasin’ him iver sin’ we’ve been workin’ together, an’ he bears me
761: no more malice nor a lamb. An’ he’s a stout-hearted feller too, for
762: when we saw the old tree all afire a-comin’ across the fields one
763: night, an’ we thought as it war a boguy, Seth made no more ado, but he
764: up to’t as bold as a constable. Why, there he comes out o’ Will
765: Maskery’s; an’ there’s Will hisself, lookin’ as meek as if he couldna
766: knock a nail o’ the head for fear o’ hurtin’t. An’ there’s the pretty
767: preacher woman! My eye, she’s got her bonnet off. I mun go a bit
768: nearer.”
769: 
770: Several of the men followed Ben’s lead, and the traveller pushed his
771: horse on to the Green, as Dinah walked rather quickly and in advance of
772: her companions towards the cart under the maple-tree. While she was
773: near Seth’s tall figure, she looked short, but when she had mounted the
774: cart, and was away from all comparison, she seemed above the middle
775: height of woman, though in reality she did not exceed it—an effect
776: which was due to the slimness of her figure and the simple line of her
777: black stuff dress. The stranger was struck with surprise as he saw her
778: approach and mount the cart—surprise, not so much at the feminine
779: delicacy of her appearance, as at the total absence of
780: self-consciousness in her demeanour. He had made up his mind to see her
781: advance with a measured step and a demure solemnity of countenance; he
782: had felt sure that her face would be mantled with the smile of
783: conscious saintship, or else charged with denunciatory bitterness. He
784: knew but two types of Methodist—the ecstatic and the bilious. But Dinah
785: walked as simply as if she were going to market, and seemed as
786: unconscious of her outward appearance as a little boy: there was no
787: blush, no tremulousness, which said, “I know you think me a pretty
788: woman, too young to preach”; no casting up or down of the eyelids, no
789: compression of the lips, no attitude of the arms that said, “But you
790: must think of me as a saint.” She held no book in her ungloved hands,
791: but let them hang down lightly crossed before her, as she stood and
792: turned her grey eyes on the people. There was no keenness in the eyes;
793: they seemed rather to be shedding love than making observations; they
794: had the liquid look which tells that the mind is full of what it has to
795: give out, rather than impressed by external objects. She stood with her
796: left hand towards the descending sun, and leafy boughs screened her
797: from its rays; but in this sober light the delicate colouring of her
798: face seemed to gather a calm vividness, like flowers at evening. It was
799: a small oval face, of a uniform transparent whiteness, with an egg-like
800: line of cheek and chin, a full but firm mouth, a delicate nostril, and
801: a low perpendicular brow, surmounted by a rising arch of parting
802: between smooth locks of pale reddish hair. The hair was drawn straight
803: back behind the ears, and covered, except for an inch or two above the
804: brow, by a net Quaker cap. The eyebrows, of the same colour as the
805: hair, were perfectly horizontal and firmly pencilled; the eyelashes,
806: though no darker, were long and abundant—nothing was left blurred or
807: unfinished. It was one of those faces that make one think of white
808: flowers with light touches of colour on their pure petals. The eyes had
809: no peculiar beauty, beyond that of expression; they looked so simple,
810: so candid, so gravely loving, that no accusing scowl, no light sneer
811: could help melting away before their glance. Joshua Rann gave a long
812: cough, as if he were clearing his throat in order to come to a new
813: understanding with himself; Chad Cranage lifted up his leather
814: skull-cap and scratched his head; and Wiry Ben wondered how Seth had
815: the pluck to think of courting her.
816: 
817: “A sweet woman,” the stranger said to himself, “but surely nature never
818: meant her for a preacher.”
819: 
820: Perhaps he was one of those who think that nature has theatrical
821: properties and, with the considerate view of facilitating art and
822: psychology, “makes up,” her characters, so that there may be no mistake
823: about them. But Dinah began to speak.
824: 
825: “Dear friends,” she said in a clear but not loud voice “let us pray for
826: a blessing.”
827: 
828: She closed her eyes, and hanging her head down a little continued in
829: the same moderate tone, as if speaking to some one quite near her:
830: “Saviour of sinners! When a poor woman laden with sins, went out to the
831: well to draw water, she found Thee sitting at the well. She knew Thee
832: not; she had not sought Thee; her mind was dark; her life was unholy.
833: But Thou didst speak to her, Thou didst teach her, Thou didst show her
834: that her life lay open before Thee, and yet Thou wast ready to give her
835: that blessing which she had never sought. Jesus, Thou art in the midst
836: of us, and Thou knowest all men: if there is any here like that poor
837: woman—if their minds are dark, their lives unholy—if they have come out
838: not seeking Thee, not desiring to be taught; deal with them according
839: to the free mercy which Thou didst show to her. Speak to them, Lord,
840: open their ears to my message, bring their sins to their minds, and
841: make them thirst for that salvation which Thou art ready to give.
842: 
843: “Lord, Thou art with Thy people still: they see Thee in the
844: night-watches, and their hearts burn within them as Thou talkest with
845: them by the way. And Thou art near to those who have not known Thee:
846: open their eyes that they may see Thee—see Thee weeping over them, and
847: saying ‘Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life’—see Thee
848: hanging on the cross and saying, ‘Father, forgive them, for they know
849: not what they do’—see Thee as Thou wilt come again in Thy glory to
850: judge them at the last. Amen.”
851: 
852: Dinah opened her eyes again and paused, looking at the group of
853: villagers, who were now gathered rather more closely on her right hand.
854: 
855: “Dear friends,” she began, raising her voice a little, “you have all of
856: you been to church, and I think you must have heard the clergyman read
857: these words: ‘The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath
858: anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor.’ Jesus Christ spoke those
859: words—he said he came _to preach the Gospel to the poor:_ I don’t know
860: whether you ever thought about those words much, but I will tell you
861: when I remember first hearing them. It was on just such a sort of
862: evening as this, when I was a little girl, and my aunt as brought me up
863: took me to hear a good man preach out of doors, just as we are here. I
864: remember his face well: he was a very old man, and had very long white
865: hair; his voice was very soft and beautiful, not like any voice I had
866: ever heard before. I was a little girl and scarcely knew anything, and
867: this old man seemed to me such a different sort of a man from anybody I
868: had ever seen before that I thought he had perhaps come down from the
869: sky to preach to us, and I said, ‘Aunt, will he go back to the sky
870: to-night, like the picture in the Bible?’
871: 
872: “That man of God was Mr. Wesley, who spent his life in doing what our
873: blessed Lord did—preaching the Gospel to the poor—and he entered into
874: his rest eight years ago. I came to know more about him years after,
875: but I was a foolish thoughtless child then, and I remembered only one
876: thing he told us in his sermon. He told us as ‘Gospel’ meant ‘good
877: news.’ The Gospel, you know, is what the Bible tells us about God.
878: 
879: “Think of that now! Jesus Christ did really come down from heaven, as
880: I, like a silly child, thought Mr. Wesley did; and what he came down
881: for was to tell good news about God to the poor. Why, you and me, dear
882: friends, are poor. We have been brought up in poor cottages and have
883: been reared on oat-cake, and lived coarse; and we haven’t been to
884: school much, nor read books, and we don’t know much about anything but
885: what happens just round us. We are just the sort of people that want to
886: hear good news. For when anybody’s well off, they don’t much mind about
887: hearing news from distant parts; but if a poor man or woman’s in
888: trouble and has hard work to make out a living, they like to have a
889: letter to tell ’em they’ve got a friend as will help ’em. To be sure,
890: we can’t help knowing something about God, even if we’ve never heard
891: the Gospel, the good news that our Saviour brought us. For we know
892: everything comes from God: don’t you say almost every day, ‘This and
893: that will happen, please God,’ and ‘We shall begin to cut the grass
894: soon, please God to send us a little more sunshine’? We know very well
895: we are altogether in the hands of God. We didn’t bring ourselves into
896: the world, we can’t keep ourselves alive while we’re sleeping; the
897: daylight, and the wind, and the corn, and the cows to give us
898: milk—everything we have comes from God. And he gave us our souls and
899: put love between parents and children, and husband and wife. But is
900: that as much as we want to know about God? We see he is great and
901: mighty, and can do what he will: we are lost, as if we was struggling
902: in great waters, when we try to think of him.
903: 
904: “But perhaps doubts come into your mind like this: Can God take much
905: notice of us poor people? Perhaps he only made the world for the great
906: and the wise and the rich. It doesn’t cost him much to give us our
907: little handful of victual and bit of clothing; but how do we know he
908: cares for us any more than we care for the worms and things in the
909: garden, so as we rear our carrots and onions? Will God take care of us
910: when we die? And has he any comfort for us when we are lame and sick
911: and helpless? Perhaps, too, he is angry with us; else why does the
912: blight come, and the bad harvests, and the fever, and all sorts of pain
913: and trouble? For our life is full of trouble, and if God sends us good,
914: he seems to send bad too. How is it? How is it?
915: 
916: “Ah, dear friends, we are in sad want of good news about God; and what
917: does other good news signify if we haven’t that? For everything else
918: comes to an end, and when we die we leave it all. But God lasts when
919: everything else is gone. What shall we do if he is not our friend?”
920: 
921: Then Dinah told how the good news had been brought, and how the mind of
922: God towards the poor had been made manifest in the life of Jesus,
923: dwelling on its lowliness and its acts of mercy.
924: 
925: “So you see, dear friends,” she went on, “Jesus spent his time almost
926: all in doing good to poor people; he preached out of doors to them, and
927: he made friends of poor workmen, and taught them and took pains with
928: them. Not but what he did good to the rich too, for he was full of love
929: to all men, only he saw as the poor were more in want of his help. So
930: he cured the lame and the sick and the blind, and he worked miracles to
931: feed the hungry because, he said, he was sorry for them; and he was
932: very kind to the little children and comforted those who had lost their
933: friends; and he spoke very tenderly to poor sinners that were sorry for
934: their sins.
935: 
936: “Ah, wouldn’t you love such a man if you saw him—if he were here in
937: this village? What a kind heart he must have! What a friend he would be
938: to go to in trouble! How pleasant it must be to be taught by him.
939: 
940: “Well, dear friends, who _was_ this man? Was he only a good man—a very
941: good man, and no more—like our dear Mr. Wesley, who has been taken from
942: us?... He was the Son of God—‘in the image of the Father,’ the Bible
943: says; that means, just like God, who is the beginning and end of all
944: things—the God we want to know about. So then, all the love that Jesus
945: showed to the poor is the same love that God has for us. We can
946: understand what Jesus felt, because he came in a body like ours and
947: spoke words such as we speak to each other. We were afraid to think
948: what God was before—the God who made the world and the sky and the
949: thunder and lightning. We could never see him; we could only see the
950: things he had made; and some of these things was very terrible, so as
951: we might well tremble when we thought of him. But our blessed Saviour
952: has showed us what God is in a way us poor ignorant people can
953: understand; he has showed us what God’s heart is, what are his feelings
954: towards us.
955: 
956: “But let us see a little more about what Jesus came on earth for.
957: Another time he said, ‘I came to seek and to save that which was lost’;
958: and another time, ‘I came not to call the righteous but sinners to
959: repentance.’
960: 
961: “The _lost!... Sinners!_... Ah, dear friends, does that mean you and
962: me?”
963: 
964: Hitherto the traveller had been chained to the spot against his will by
965: the charm of Dinah’s mellow treble tones, which had a variety of
966: modulation like that of a fine instrument touched with the unconscious
967: skill of musical instinct. The simple things she said seemed like
968: novelties, as a melody strikes us with a new feeling when we hear it
969: sung by the pure voice of a boyish chorister; the quiet depth of
970: conviction with which she spoke seemed in itself an evidence for the
971: truth of her message. He saw that she had thoroughly arrested her
972: hearers. The villagers had pressed nearer to her, and there was no
973: longer anything but grave attention on all faces. She spoke slowly,
974: though quite fluently, often pausing after a question, or before any
975: transition of ideas. There was no change of attitude, no gesture; the
976: effect of her speech was produced entirely by the inflections of her
977: voice, and when she came to the question, “Will God take care of us
978: when we die?” she uttered it in such a tone of plaintive appeal that
979: the tears came into some of the hardest eyes. The stranger had ceased
980: to doubt, as he had done at the first glance, that she could fix the
981: attention of her rougher hearers, but still he wondered whether she
982: could have that power of rousing their more violent emotions, which
983: must surely be a necessary seal of her vocation as a Methodist
984: preacher, until she came to the words, “Lost!—Sinners!” when there was
985: a great change in her voice and manner. She had made a long pause
986: before the exclamation, and the pause seemed to be filled by agitating
987: thoughts that showed themselves in her features. Her pale face became
988: paler; the circles under her eyes deepened, as they did when tears
989: half-gather without falling; and the mild loving eyes took an
990: expression of appalled pity, as if she had suddenly discerned a
991: destroying angel hovering over the heads of the people. Her voice
992: became deep and muffled, but there was still no gesture. Nothing could
993: be less like the ordinary type of the Ranter than Dinah. She was not
994: preaching as she heard others preach, but speaking directly from her
995: own emotions and under the inspiration of her own simple faith.
996: 
997: But now she had entered into a new current of feeling. Her manner
998: became less calm, her utterance more rapid and agitated, as she tried
999: to bring home to the people their guilt, their wilful darkness, their
1000: state of disobedience to God—as she dwelt on the hatefulness of sin,
1001: the Divine holiness, and the sufferings of the Saviour, by which a way
1002: had been opened for their salvation. At last it seemed as if, in her
1003: yearning desire to reclaim the lost sheep, she could not be satisfied
1004: by addressing her hearers as a body. She appealed first to one and then
1005: to another, beseeching them with tears to turn to God while there was
1006: yet time; painting to them the desolation of their souls, lost in sin,
1007: feeding on the husks of this miserable world, far away from God their
1008: Father; and then the love of the Saviour, who was waiting and watching
1009: for their return.
1010: 
1011: There was many a responsive sigh and groan from her fellow-Methodists,
1012: but the village mind does not easily take fire, and a little
1013: smouldering vague anxiety that might easily die out again was the
1014: utmost effect Dinah’s preaching had wrought in them at present. Yet no
1015: one had retired, except the children and “old Feyther Taft,” who being
1016: too deaf to catch many words, had some time ago gone back to his
1017: inglenook. Wiry Ben was feeling very uncomfortable, and almost wishing
1018: he had not come to hear Dinah; he thought what she said would haunt him
1019: somehow. Yet he couldn’t help liking to look at her and listen to her,
1020: though he dreaded every moment that she would fix her eyes on him and
1021: address him in particular. She had already addressed Sandy Jim, who was
1022: now holding the baby to relieve his wife, and the big soft-hearted man
1023: had rubbed away some tears with his fist, with a confused intention of
1024: being a better fellow, going less to the Holly Bush down by the
1025: Stone-pits, and cleaning himself more regularly of a Sunday.
1026: 
1027: In front of Sandy Jim stood Chad’s Bess, who had shown an unwonted
1028: quietude and fixity of attention ever since Dinah had begun to speak.
1029: Not that the matter of the discourse had arrested her at once, for she
1030: was lost in a puzzling speculation as to what pleasure and satisfaction
1031: there could be in life to a young woman who wore a cap like Dinah’s.
1032: Giving up this inquiry in despair, she took to studying Dinah’s nose,
1033: eyes, mouth, and hair, and wondering whether it was better to have such
1034: a sort of pale face as that, or fat red cheeks and round black eyes
1035: like her own. But gradually the influence of the general gravity told
1036: upon her, and she became conscious of what Dinah was saying. The gentle
1037: tones, the loving persuasion, did not touch her, but when the more
1038: severe appeals came she began to be frightened. Poor Bessy had always
1039: been considered a naughty girl; she was conscious of it; if it was
1040: necessary to be very good, it was clear she must be in a bad way. She
1041: couldn’t find her places at church as Sally Rann could, she had often
1042: been tittering when she “curcheyed” to Mr. Irwine; and these religious
1043: deficiencies were accompanied by a corresponding slackness in the minor
1044: morals, for Bessy belonged unquestionably to that unsoaped lazy class
1045: of feminine characters with whom you may venture to “eat an egg, an
1046: apple, or a nut.” All this she was generally conscious of, and hitherto
1047: had not been greatly ashamed of it. But now she began to feel very much
1048: as if the constable had come to take her up and carry her before the
1049: justice for some undefined offence. She had a terrified sense that God,
1050: whom she had always thought of as very far off, was very near to her,
1051: and that Jesus was close by looking at her, though she could not see
1052: him. For Dinah had that belief in visible manifestations of Jesus,
1053: which is common among the Methodists, and she communicated it
1054: irresistibly to her hearers: she made them feel that he was among them
1055: bodily, and might at any moment show himself to them in some way that
1056: would strike anguish and penitence into their hearts.
1057: 
1058: “See!” she exclaimed, turning to the left, with her eyes fixed on a
1059: point above the heads of the people. “See where our blessed Lord stands
1060: and weeps and stretches out his arms towards you. Hear what he says:
1061: ‘How often would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens
1062: under her wings, and ye would not!’... and ye would not,” she repeated,
1063: in a tone of pleading reproach, turning her eyes on the people again.
1064: “See the print of the nails on his dear hands and feet. It is your sins
1065: that made them! Ah! How pale and worn he looks! He has gone through all
1066: that great agony in the garden, when his soul was exceeding sorrowful
1067: even unto death, and the great drops of sweat fell like blood to the
1068: ground. They spat upon him and buffeted him, they scourged him, they
1069: mocked him, they laid the heavy cross on his bruised shoulders. Then
1070: they nailed him up. Ah, what pain! His lips are parched with thirst,
1071: and they mock him still in this great agony; yet with those parched
1072: lips he prays for them, ‘Father, forgive them, for they know not what
1073: they do.’ Then a horror of great darkness fell upon him, and he felt
1074: what sinners feel when they are for ever shut out from God. That was
1075: the last drop in the cup of bitterness. ‘My God, my God!’ he cries,
1076: ‘why hast Thou forsaken me?’
1077: 
1078: “All this he bore for you! For you—and you never think of him; for
1079: you—and you turn your backs on him; you don’t care what he has gone
1080: through for you. Yet he is not weary of toiling for you: he has risen
1081: from the dead, he is praying for you at the right hand of God—‘Father,
1082: forgive them, for they know not what they do.’ And he is upon this
1083: earth too; he is among us; he is there close to you now; I see his
1084: wounded body and his look of love.”
1085: 
1086: Here Dinah turned to Bessy Cranage, whose bonny youth and evident
1087: vanity had touched her with pity.
1088: 
1089: “Poor child! Poor child! He is beseeching you, and you don’t listen to
1090: him. You think of ear-rings and fine gowns and caps, and you never
1091: think of the Saviour who died to save your precious soul. Your cheeks
1092: will be shrivelled one day, your hair will be grey, your poor body will
1093: be thin and tottering! Then you will begin to feel that your soul is
1094: not saved; then you will have to stand before God dressed in your sins,
1095: in your evil tempers and vain thoughts. And Jesus, who stands ready to
1096: help you now, won’t help you then; because you won’t have him to be
1097: your Saviour, he will be your judge. Now he looks at you with love and
1098: mercy and says, ‘Come to me that you may have life’; then he will turn
1099: away from you, and say, ‘Depart from me into ever-lasting fire!’”
1100: 
1101: Poor Bessy’s wide-open black eyes began to fill with tears, her great
1102: red cheeks and lips became quite pale, and her face was distorted like
1103: a little child’s before a burst of crying.
1104: 
1105: “Ah, poor blind child!” Dinah went on, “think if it should happen to
1106: you as it once happened to a servant of God in the days of her vanity.
1107: _She_ thought of her lace caps and saved all her money to buy ’em; she
1108: thought nothing about how she might get a clean heart and a right
1109: spirit—she only wanted to have better lace than other girls. And one
1110: day when she put her new cap on and looked in the glass, she saw a
1111: bleeding Face crowned with thorns. That face is looking at you
1112: now”—here Dinah pointed to a spot close in front of Bessy—“Ah, tear off
1113: those follies! Cast them away from you, as if they were stinging
1114: adders. They _are_ stinging you—they are poisoning your soul—they are
1115: dragging you down into a dark bottomless pit, where you will sink for
1116: ever, and for ever, and for ever, further away from light and God.”
1117: 
1118: Bessy could bear it no longer: a great terror was upon her, and
1119: wrenching her ear-rings from her ears, she threw them down before her,
1120: sobbing aloud. Her father, Chad, frightened lest he should be “laid
1121: hold on” too, this impression on the rebellious Bess striking him as
1122: nothing less than a miracle, walked hastily away and began to work at
1123: his anvil by way of reassuring himself. “Folks mun ha’ hoss-shoes,
1124: praichin’ or no praichin’: the divil canna lay hould o’ me for that,”
1125: he muttered to himself.
1126: 
1127: But now Dinah began to tell of the joys that were in store for the
1128: penitent, and to describe in her simple way the divine peace and love
1129: with which the soul of the believer is filled—how the sense of God’s
1130: love turns poverty into riches and satisfies the soul so that no uneasy
1131: desire vexes it, no fear alarms it: how, at last, the very temptation
1132: to sin is extinguished, and heaven is begun upon earth, because no
1133: cloud passes between the soul and God, who is its eternal sun.
1134: 
1135: “Dear friends,” she said at last, “brothers and sisters, whom I love as
1136: those for whom my Lord has died, believe me, I know what this great
1137: blessedness is; and because I know it, I want you to have it too. I am
1138: poor, like you: I have to get my living with my hands; but no lord nor
1139: lady can be so happy as me, if they haven’t got the love of God in
1140: their souls. Think what it is—not to hate anything but sin; to be full
1141: of love to every creature; to be frightened at nothing; to be sure that
1142: all things will turn to good; not to mind pain, because it is our
1143: Father’s will; to know that nothing—no, not if the earth was to be
1144: burnt up, or the waters come and drown us—nothing could part us from
1145: God who loves us, and who fills our souls with peace and joy, because
1146: we are sure that whatever he wills is holy, just, and good.
1147: 
1148: “Dear friends, come and take this blessedness; it is offered to you; it
1149: is the good news that Jesus came to preach to the poor. It is not like
1150: the riches of this world, so that the more one gets the less the rest
1151: can have. God is without end; his love is without end—”
1152: 
1153: Its streams the whole creation reach,
1154:     So plenteous is the store;
1155: Enough for all, enough for each,
1156:     Enough for evermore.
1157: 
1158: 
1159: Dinah had been speaking at least an hour, and the reddening light of
1160: the parting day seemed to give a solemn emphasis to her closing words.
1161: The stranger, who had been interested in the course of her sermon as if
1162: it had been the development of a drama—for there is this sort of
1163: fascination in all sincere unpremeditated eloquence, which opens to one
1164: the inward drama of the speaker’s emotions—now turned his horse aside
1165: and pursued his way, while Dinah said, “Let us sing a little, dear
1166: friends”; and as he was still winding down the slope, the voices of the
1167: Methodists reached him, rising and falling in that strange blending of
1168: exultation and sadness which belongs to the cadence of a hymn.
1169: 
1170: 
1171: 
1172: 
1173: Chapter III
1174: After the Preaching
1175: 
1176: 
1177: In less than an hour from that time, Seth Bede was walking by Dinah’s
1178: side along the hedgerow-path that skirted the pastures and green
1179: corn-fields which lay between the village and the Hall Farm. Dinah had
1180: taken off her little Quaker bonnet again, and was holding it in her
1181: hands that she might have a freer enjoyment of the cool evening
1182: twilight, and Seth could see the expression of her face quite clearly
1183: as he walked by her side, timidly revolving something he wanted to say
1184: to her. It was an expression of unconscious placid gravity—of
1185: absorption in thoughts that had no connection with the present moment
1186: or with her own personality—an expression that is most of all
1187: discouraging to a lover. Her very walk was discouraging: it had that
1188: quiet elasticity that asks for no support. Seth felt this dimly; he
1189: said to himself, “She’s too good and holy for any man, let alone me,”
1190: and the words he had been summoning rushed back again before they had
1191: reached his lips. But another thought gave him courage: “There’s no man
1192: could love her better and leave her freer to follow the Lord’s work.”
1193: They had been silent for many minutes now, since they had done talking
1194: about Bessy Cranage; Dinah seemed almost to have forgotten Seth’s
1195: presence, and her pace was becoming so much quicker that the sense of
1196: their being only a few minutes’ walk from the yard-gates of the Hall
1197: Farm at last gave Seth courage to speak.
1198: 
1199: “You’ve quite made up your mind to go back to Snowfield o’ Saturday,
1200: Dinah?”
1201: 
1202: “Yes,” said Dinah, quietly. “I’m called there. It was borne in upon my
1203: mind while I was meditating on Sunday night, as Sister Allen, who’s in
1204: a decline, is in need of me. I saw her as plain as we see that bit of
1205: thin white cloud, lifting up her poor thin hand and beckoning to me.
1206: And this morning when I opened the Bible for direction, the first words
1207: my eyes fell on were, ‘And after we had seen the vision, immediately we
1208: endeavoured to go into Macedonia.’ If it wasn’t for that clear showing
1209: of the Lord’s will, I should be loath to go, for my heart yearns over
1210: my aunt and her little ones, and that poor wandering lamb Hetty Sorrel.
1211: I’ve been much drawn out in prayer for her of late, and I look on it as
1212: a token that there may be mercy in store for her.”
1213: 
1214: “God grant it,” said Seth. “For I doubt Adam’s heart is so set on her,
1215: he’ll never turn to anybody else; and yet it ’ud go to my heart if he
1216: was to marry her, for I canna think as she’d make him happy. It’s a
1217: deep mystery—the way the heart of man turns to one woman out of all the
1218: rest he’s seen i’ the world, and makes it easier for him to work seven
1219: year for _her_, like Jacob did for Rachel, sooner than have any other
1220: woman for th’ asking. I often think of them words, ‘And Jacob served
1221: seven years for Rachel; and they seemed to him but a few days for the
1222: love he had to her.’ I know those words ’ud come true with me, Dinah,
1223: if so be you’d give me hope as I might win you after seven years was
1224: over. I know you think a husband ’ud be taking up too much o’ your
1225: thoughts, because St. Paul says, ‘She that’s married careth for the
1226: things of the world how she may please her husband’; and may happen
1227: you’ll think me overbold to speak to you about it again, after what you
1228: told me o’ your mind last Saturday. But I’ve been thinking it over
1229: again by night and by day, and I’ve prayed not to be blinded by my own
1230: desires, to think what’s only good for me must be good for you too. And
1231: it seems to me there’s more texts for your marrying than ever you can
1232: find against it. For St. Paul says as plain as can be in another place,
1233: ‘I will that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house,
1234: give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully’; and then
1235: ‘two are better than one’; and that holds good with marriage as well as
1236: with other things. For we should be o’ one heart and o’ one mind,
1237: Dinah. We both serve the same Master, and are striving after the same
1238: gifts; and I’d never be the husband to make a claim on you as could
1239: interfere with your doing the work God has fitted you for. I’d make a
1240: shift, and fend indoor and out, to give you more liberty—more than you
1241: can have now, for you’ve got to get your own living now, and I’m strong
1242: enough to work for us both.”
1243: 
1244: When Seth had once begun to urge his suit, he went on earnestly and
1245: almost hurriedly, lest Dinah should speak some decisive word before he
1246: had poured forth all the arguments he had prepared. His cheeks became
1247: flushed as he went on, his mild grey eyes filled with tears, and his
1248: voice trembled as he spoke the last sentence. They had reached one of
1249: those very narrow passes between two tall stones, which performed the
1250: office of a stile in Loamshire, and Dinah paused as she turned towards
1251: Seth and said, in her tender but calm treble notes, “Seth Bede, I thank
1252: you for your love towards me, and if I could think of any man as more
1253: than a Christian brother, I think it would be you. But my heart is not
1254: free to marry. That is good for other women, and it is a great and a
1255: blessed thing to be a wife and mother; but ‘as God has distributed to
1256: every man, as the Lord hath called every man, so let him walk.’ God has
1257: called me to minister to others, not to have any joys or sorrows of my
1258: own, but to rejoice with them that do rejoice, and to weep with those
1259: that weep. He has called me to speak his word, and he has greatly owned
1260: my work. It could only be on a very clear showing that I could leave
1261: the brethren and sisters at Snowfield, who are favoured with very
1262: little of this world’s good; where the trees are few, so that a child
1263: might count them, and there’s very hard living for the poor in the
1264: winter. It has been given me to help, to comfort, and strengthen the
1265: little flock there and to call in many wanderers; and my soul is filled
1266: with these things from my rising up till my lying down. My life is too
1267: short, and God’s work is too great for me to think of making a home for
1268: myself in this world. I’ve not turned a deaf ear to your words, Seth,
1269: for when I saw as your love was given to me, I thought it might be a
1270: leading of Providence for me to change my way of life, and that we
1271: should be fellow-helpers; and I spread the matter before the Lord. But
1272: whenever I tried to fix my mind on marriage, and our living together,
1273: other thoughts always came in—the times when I’ve prayed by the sick
1274: and dying, and the happy hours I’ve had preaching, when my heart was
1275: filled with love, and the Word was given to me abundantly. And when
1276: I’ve opened the Bible for direction, I’ve always lighted on some clear
1277: word to tell me where my work lay. I believe what you say, Seth, that
1278: you would try to be a help and not a hindrance to my work; but I see
1279: that our marriage is not God’s will—He draws my heart another way. I
1280: desire to live and die without husband or children. I seem to have no
1281: room in my soul for wants and fears of my own, it has pleased God to
1282: fill my heart so full with the wants and sufferings of his poor
1283: people.”
1284: 
1285: Seth was unable to reply, and they walked on in silence. At last, as
1286: they were nearly at the yard-gate, he said, “Well, Dinah, I must seek
1287: for strength to bear it, and to endure as seeing Him who is invisible.
1288: But I feel now how weak my faith is. It seems as if, when you are gone,
1289: I could never joy in anything any more. I think it’s something passing
1290: the love of women as I feel for you, for I could be content without
1291: your marrying me if I could go and live at Snowfield and be near you. I
1292: trusted as the strong love God has given me towards you was a leading
1293: for us both; but it seems it was only meant for my trial. Perhaps I
1294: feel more for you than I ought to feel for any creature, for I often
1295: can’t help saying of you what the hymn says—
1296: 
1297: In darkest shades if she appear,
1298:     My dawning is begun;
1299: She is my soul’s bright morning-star,
1300:     And she my rising sun.
1301: 
1302: 
1303: That may be wrong, and I am to be taught better. But you wouldn’t be
1304: displeased with me if things turned out so as I could leave this
1305: country and go to live at Snowfield?”
1306: 
1307: “No, Seth; but I counsel you to wait patiently, and not lightly to
1308: leave your own country and kindred. Do nothing without the Lord’s clear
1309: bidding. It’s a bleak and barren country there, not like this land of
1310: Goshen you’ve been used to. We mustn’t be in a hurry to fix and choose
1311: our own lot; we must wait to be guided.”
1312: 
1313: “But you’d let me write you a letter, Dinah, if there was anything I
1314: wanted to tell you?”
1315: 
1316: “Yes, sure; let me know if you’re in any trouble. You’ll be continually
1317: in my prayers.”
1318: 
1319: They had now reached the yard-gate, and Seth said, “I won’t go in,
1320: Dinah, so farewell.” He paused and hesitated after she had given him
1321: her hand, and then said, “There’s no knowing but what you may see
1322: things different after a while. There may be a new leading.”
1323: 
1324: “Let us leave that, Seth. It’s good to live only a moment at a time, as
1325: I’ve read in one of Mr. Wesley’s books. It isn’t for you and me to lay
1326: plans; we’ve nothing to do but to obey and to trust. Farewell.”
1327: 
1328: Dinah pressed his hand with rather a sad look in her loving eyes, and
1329: then passed through the gate, while Seth turned away to walk
1330: lingeringly home. But instead of taking the direct road, he chose to
1331: turn back along the fields through which he and Dinah had already
1332: passed; and I think his blue linen handkerchief was very wet with tears
1333: long before he had made up his mind that it was time for him to set his
1334: face steadily homewards. He was but three-and-twenty, and had only just
1335: learned what it is to love—to love with that adoration which a young
1336: man gives to a woman whom he feels to be greater and better than
1337: himself. Love of this sort is hardly distinguishable from religious
1338: feeling. What deep and worthy love is so, whether of woman or child, or
1339: art or music. Our caresses, our tender words, our still rapture under
1340: the influence of autumn sunsets, or pillared vistas, or calm majestic
1341: statues, or Beethoven symphonies all bring with them the consciousness
1342: that they are mere waves and ripples in an unfathomable ocean of love
1343: and beauty; our emotion in its keenest moment passes from expression
1344: into silence, our love at its highest flood rushes beyond its object
1345: and loses itself in the sense of divine mystery. And this blessed gift
1346: of venerating love has been given to too many humble craftsmen since
1347: the world began for us to feel any surprise that it should have existed
1348: in the soul of a Methodist carpenter half a century ago, while there
1349: was yet a lingering after-glow from the time when Wesley and his
1350: fellow-labourer fed on the hips and haws of the Cornwall hedges, after
1351: exhausting limbs and lungs in carrying a divine message to the poor.
1352: 
1353: That afterglow has long faded away; and the picture we are apt to make
1354: of Methodism in our imagination is not an amphitheatre of green hills,
1355: or the deep shade of broad-leaved sycamores, where a crowd of rough men
1356: and weary-hearted women drank in a faith which was a rudimentary
1357: culture, which linked their thoughts with the past, lifted their
1358: imagination above the sordid details of their own narrow lives, and
1359: suffused their souls with the sense of a pitying, loving, infinite
1360: Presence, sweet as summer to the houseless needy. It is too possible
1361: that to some of my readers Methodism may mean nothing more than
1362: low-pitched gables up dingy streets, sleek grocers, sponging preachers,
1363: and hypocritical jargon—elements which are regarded as an exhaustive
1364: analysis of Methodism in many fashionable quarters.
1365: 
1366: That would be a pity; for I cannot pretend that Seth and Dinah were
1367: anything else than Methodists—not indeed of that modern type which
1368: reads quarterly reviews and attends in chapels with pillared porticoes,
1369: but of a very old-fashioned kind. They believed in present miracles, in
1370: instantaneous conversions, in revelations by dreams and visions; they
1371: drew lots, and sought for Divine guidance by opening the Bible at
1372: hazard; having a literal way of interpreting the Scriptures, which is
1373: not at all sanctioned by approved commentators; and it is impossible
1374: for me to represent their diction as correct, or their instruction as
1375: liberal. Still—if I have read religious history aright—faith, hope, and
1376: charity have not always been found in a direct ratio with a sensibility
1377: to the three concords, and it is possible—thank Heaven!—to have very
1378: erroneous theories and very sublime feelings. The raw bacon which
1379: clumsy Molly spares from her own scanty store that she may carry it to
1380: her neighbour’s child to “stop the fits,” may be a piteously
1381: inefficacious remedy; but the generous stirring of neighbourly kindness
1382: that prompted the deed has a beneficent radiation that is not lost.
1383: 
1384: Considering these things, we can hardly think Dinah and Seth beneath
1385: our sympathy, accustomed as we may be to weep over the loftier sorrows
1386: of heroines in satin boots and crinoline, and of heroes riding fiery
1387: horses, themselves ridden by still more fiery passions.
1388: 
1389: Poor Seth! He was never on horseback in his life except once, when he
1390: was a little lad, and Mr. Jonathan Burge took him up behind, telling
1391: him to “hold on tight”; and instead of bursting out into wild accusing
1392: apostrophes to God and destiny, he is resolving, as he now walks
1393: homewards under the solemn starlight, to repress his sadness, to be
1394: less bent on having his own will, and to live more for others, as Dinah
1395: does.
1396: 
1397: 
1398: 
1399: 
1400: Chapter IV
1401: Home and Its Sorrows
1402: 
1403: 
1404: A green valley with a brook running through it, full almost to
1405: overflowing with the late rains, overhung by low stooping willows.
1406: Across this brook a plank is thrown, and over this plank Adam Bede is
1407: passing with his undoubting step, followed close by Gyp with the
1408: basket; evidently making his way to the thatched house, with a stack of
1409: timber by the side of it, about twenty yards up the opposite slope.
1410: 
1411: The door of the house is open, and an elderly woman is looking out; but
1412: she is not placidly contemplating the evening sunshine; she has been
1413: watching with dim eyes the gradually enlarging speck which for the last
1414: few minutes she has been quite sure is her darling son Adam. Lisbeth
1415: Bede loves her son with the love of a woman to whom her first-born has
1416: come late in life. She is an anxious, spare, yet vigorous old woman,
1417: clean as a snowdrop. Her grey hair is turned neatly back under a pure
1418: linen cap with a black band round it; her broad chest is covered with a
1419: buff neckerchief, and below this you see a sort of short bedgown made
1420: of blue-checkered linen, tied round the waist and descending to the
1421: hips, from whence there is a considerable length of linsey-woolsey
1422: petticoat. For Lisbeth is tall, and in other points too there is a
1423: strong likeness between her and her son Adam. Her dark eyes are
1424: somewhat dim now—perhaps from too much crying—but her broadly marked
1425: eyebrows are still black, her teeth are sound, and as she stands
1426: knitting rapidly and unconsciously with her work-hardened hands, she
1427: has as firmly upright an attitude as when she is carrying a pail of
1428: water on her head from the spring. There is the same type of frame and
1429: the same keen activity of temperament in mother and son, but it was not
1430: from her that Adam got his well-filled brow and his expression of
1431: large-hearted intelligence.
1432: 
1433: Family likeness has often a deep sadness in it. Nature, that great
1434: tragic dramatist, knits us together by bone and muscle, and divides us
1435: by the subtler web of our brains; blends yearning and repulsion; and
1436: ties us by our heart-strings to the beings that jar us at every
1437: movement. We hear a voice with the very cadence of our own uttering the
1438: thoughts we despise; we see eyes—ah, so like our mother’s!—averted from
1439: us in cold alienation; and our last darling child startles us with the
1440: air and gestures of the sister we parted from in bitterness long years
1441: ago. The father to whom we owe our best heritage—the mechanical
1442: instinct, the keen sensibility to harmony, the unconscious skill of the
1443: modelling hand—galls us and puts us to shame by his daily errors; the
1444: long-lost mother, whose face we begin to see in the glass as our own
1445: wrinkles come, once fretted our young souls with her anxious humours
1446: and irrational persistence.
1447: 
1448: It is such a fond anxious mother’s voice that you hear, as Lisbeth
1449: says, “Well, my lad, it’s gone seven by th’ clock. Thee’t allays stay
1450: till the last child’s born. Thee wants thy supper, I’ll warrand.
1451: Where’s Seth? Gone arter some o’s chapellin’, I reckon?”
1452: 
1453: “Aye, aye, Seth’s at no harm, mother, thee mayst be sure. But where’s
1454: father?” said Adam quickly, as he entered the house and glanced into
1455: the room on the left hand, which was used as a workshop. “Hasn’t he
1456: done the coffin for Tholer? There’s the stuff standing just as I left
1457: it this morning.”
1458: 
1459: “Done the coffin?” said Lisbeth, following him, and knitting
1460: uninterruptedly, though she looked at her son very anxiously. “Eh, my
1461: lad, he went aff to Treddles’on this forenoon, an’s niver come back. I
1462: doubt he’s got to th’ ‘Waggin Overthrow’ again.”
1463: 
1464: A deep flush of anger passed rapidly over Adam’s face. He said nothing,
1465: but threw off his jacket and began to roll up his shirt-sleeves again.
1466: 
1467: “What art goin’ to do, Adam?” said the mother, with a tone and look of
1468: alarm. “Thee wouldstna go to work again, wi’out ha’in thy bit o’
1469: supper?”
1470: 
1471: Adam, too angry to speak, walked into the workshop. But his mother
1472: threw down her knitting, and, hurrying after him, took hold of his arm,
1473: and said, in a tone of plaintive remonstrance, “Nay, my lad, my lad,
1474: thee munna go wi’out thy supper; there’s the taters wi’ the gravy in
1475: ’em, just as thee lik’st ’em. I saved ’em o’ purpose for thee. Come an’
1476: ha’ thy supper, come.”
1477: 
1478: “Let be!” said Adam impetuously, shaking her off and seizing one of the
1479: planks that stood against the wall. “It’s fine talking about having
1480: supper when here’s a coffin promised to be ready at Brox’on by seven
1481: o’clock to-morrow morning, and ought to ha’ been there now, and not a
1482: nail struck yet. My throat’s too full to swallow victuals.”
1483: 
1484: “Why, thee canstna get the coffin ready,” said Lisbeth. “Thee’t work
1485: thyself to death. It ’ud take thee all night to do’t.”
1486: 
1487: “What signifies how long it takes me? Isn’t the coffin promised? Can
1488: they bury the man without a coffin? I’d work my right hand off sooner
1489: than deceive people with lies i’ that way. It makes me mad to think
1490: on’t. I shall overrun these doings before long. I’ve stood enough of
1491: ’em.”
1492: 
1493: Poor Lisbeth did not hear this threat for the first time, and if she
1494: had been wise she would have gone away quietly and said nothing for the
1495: next hour. But one of the lessons a woman most rarely learns is never
1496: to talk to an angry or a drunken man. Lisbeth sat down on the chopping
1497: bench and began to cry, and by the time she had cried enough to make
1498: her voice very piteous, she burst out into words.
1499: 
1500: “Nay, my lad, my lad, thee wouldstna go away an’ break thy mother’s
1501: heart, an’ leave thy feyther to ruin. Thee wouldstna ha’ ’em carry me
1502: to th’ churchyard, an’ thee not to follow me. I shanna rest i’ my grave
1503: if I donna see thee at th’ last; an’ how’s they to let thee know as I’m
1504: a-dyin’, if thee’t gone a-workin’ i’ distant parts, an’ Seth belike
1505: gone arter thee, and thy feyther not able to hold a pen for’s hand
1506: shakin’, besides not knowin’ where thee art? Thee mun forgie thy
1507: feyther—thee munna be so bitter again’ him. He war a good feyther to
1508: thee afore he took to th’ drink. He’s a clever workman, an’ taught thee
1509: thy trade, remember, an’s niver gen me a blow nor so much as an ill
1510: word—no, not even in ’s drink. Thee wouldstna ha’ ’m go to the
1511: workhus—thy own feyther—an’ him as was a fine-growed man an’ handy at
1512: everythin’ amost as thee art thysen, five-an’-twenty ’ear ago, when
1513: thee wast a baby at the breast.”
1514: 
1515: Lisbeth’s voice became louder, and choked with sobs—a sort of wail, the
1516: most irritating of all sounds where real sorrows are to be borne and
1517: real work to be done. Adam broke in impatiently.
1518: 
1519: “Now, Mother, don’t cry and talk so. Haven’t I got enough to vex me
1520: without that? What’s th’ use o’ telling me things as I only think too
1521: much on every day? If I didna think on ’em, why should I do as I do,
1522: for the sake o’ keeping things together here? But I hate to be talking
1523: where it’s no use: I like to keep my breath for doing i’stead o’
1524: talking.”
1525: 
1526: “I know thee dost things as nobody else ’ud do, my lad. But thee’t
1527: allays so hard upo’ thy feyther, Adam. Thee think’st nothing too much
1528: to do for Seth: thee snapp’st me up if iver I find faut wi’ th’ lad.
1529: But thee’t so angered wi’ thy feyther, more nor wi’ anybody else.”
1530: 
1531: “That’s better than speaking soft and letting things go the wrong way,
1532: I reckon, isn’t it? If I wasn’t sharp with him he’d sell every bit o’
1533: stuff i’ th’ yard and spend it on drink. I know there’s a duty to be
1534: done by my father, but it isn’t my duty to encourage him in running
1535: headlong to ruin. And what has Seth got to do with it? The lad does no
1536: harm as I know of. But leave me alone, Mother, and let me get on with
1537: the work.”
1538: 
1539: Lisbeth dared not say any more; but she got up and called Gyp, thinking
1540: to console herself somewhat for Adam’s refusal of the supper she had
1541: spread out in the loving expectation of looking at him while he ate it,
1542: by feeding Adam’s dog with extra liberality. But Gyp was watching his
1543: master with wrinkled brow and ears erect, puzzled at this unusual
1544: course of things; and though he glanced at Lisbeth when she called him,
1545: and moved his fore-paws uneasily, well knowing that she was inviting
1546: him to supper, he was in a divided state of mind, and remained seated
1547: on his haunches, again fixing his eyes anxiously on his master. Adam
1548: noticed Gyp’s mental conflict, and though his anger had made him less
1549: tender than usual to his mother, it did not prevent him from caring as
1550: much as usual for his dog. We are apt to be kinder to the brutes that
1551: love us than to the women that love us. Is it because the brutes are
1552: dumb?
1553: 
1554: “Go, Gyp; go, lad!” Adam said, in a tone of encouraging command; and
1555: Gyp, apparently satisfied that duty and pleasure were one, followed
1556: Lisbeth into the house-place.
1557: 
1558: But no sooner had he licked up his supper than he went back to his
1559: master, while Lisbeth sat down alone to cry over her knitting. Women
1560: who are never bitter and resentful are often the most querulous; and if
1561: Solomon was as wise as he is reputed to be, I feel sure that when he
1562: compared a contentious woman to a continual dropping on a very rainy
1563: day, he had not a vixen in his eye—a fury with long nails, acrid and
1564: selfish. Depend upon it, he meant a good creature, who had no joy but
1565: in the happiness of the loved ones whom she contributed to make
1566: uncomfortable, putting by all the tid-bits for them and spending
1567: nothing on herself. Such a woman as Lisbeth, for example—at once
1568: patient and complaining, self-renouncing and exacting, brooding the
1569: livelong day over what happened yesterday and what is likely to happen
1570: to-morrow, and crying very readily both at the good and the evil. But a
1571: certain awe mingled itself with her idolatrous love of Adam, and when
1572: he said, “Leave me alone,” she was always silenced.
1573: 
1574: So the hours passed, to the loud ticking of the old day-clock and the
1575: sound of Adam’s tools. At last he called for a light and a draught of
1576: water (beer was a thing only to be drunk on holidays), and Lisbeth
1577: ventured to say as she took it in, “Thy supper stan’s ready for thee,
1578: when thee lik’st.”
1579: 
1580: “Donna thee sit up, mother,” said Adam, in a gentle tone. He had worked
1581: off his anger now, and whenever he wished to be especially kind to his
1582: mother, he fell into his strongest native accent and dialect, with
1583: which at other times his speech was less deeply tinged. “I’ll see to
1584: Father when he comes home; maybe he wonna come at all to-night. I shall
1585: be easier if thee’t i’ bed.”
1586: 
1587: “Nay, I’ll bide till Seth comes. He wonna be long now, I reckon.”
1588: 
1589: It was then past nine by the clock, which was always in advance of the
1590: days, and before it had struck ten the latch was lifted and Seth
1591: entered. He had heard the sound of the tools as he was approaching.
1592: 
1593: “Why, Mother,” he said, “how is it as Father’s working so late?”
1594: 
1595: “It’s none o’ thy feyther as is a-workin’—thee might know that well
1596: anoof if thy head warna full o’ chapellin’—it’s thy brother as does
1597: iverything, for there’s niver nobody else i’ th’ way to do nothin’.”
1598: 
1599: Lisbeth was going on, for she was not at all afraid of Seth, and
1600: usually poured into his ears all the querulousness which was repressed
1601: by her awe of Adam. Seth had never in his life spoken a harsh word to
1602: his mother, and timid people always wreak their peevishness on the
1603: gentle. But Seth, with an anxious look, had passed into the workshop
1604: and said, “Addy, how’s this? What! Father’s forgot the coffin?”
1605: 
1606: “Aye, lad, th’ old tale; but I shall get it done,” said Adam, looking
1607: up and casting one of his bright keen glances at his brother. “Why,
1608: what’s the matter with thee? Thee’t in trouble.”
1609: 
1610: Seth’s eyes were red, and there was a look of deep depression on his
1611: mild face.
1612: 
1613: “Yes, Addy, but it’s what must be borne, and can’t be helped. Why,
1614: thee’st never been to the school, then?”
1615: 
1616: “School? No, that screw can wait,” said Adam, hammering away again.
1617: 
1618: “Let me take my turn now, and do thee go to bed,” said Seth.
1619: 
1620: “No, lad, I’d rather go on, now I’m in harness. Thee’t help me to carry
1621: it to Brox’on when it’s done. I’ll call thee up at sunrise. Go and eat
1622: thy supper, and shut the door so as I mayn’t hear Mother’s talk.”
1623: 
1624: Seth knew that Adam always meant what he said, and was not to be
1625: persuaded into meaning anything else. So he turned, with rather a heavy
1626: heart, into the house-place.
1627: 
1628: “Adam’s niver touched a bit o’ victual sin’ home he’s come,” said
1629: Lisbeth. “I reckon thee’st hed thy supper at some o’ thy Methody
1630: folks.”
1631: 
1632: “Nay, Mother,” said Seth, “I’ve had no supper yet.”
1633: 
1634: “Come, then,” said Lisbeth, “but donna thee ate the taters, for Adam
1635: ’ull happen ate ’em if I leave ’em stannin’. He loves a bit o’ taters
1636: an’ gravy. But he’s been so sore an’ angered, he wouldn’t ate ’em, for
1637: all I’d putten ’em by o’ purpose for him. An’ he’s been a-threatenin’
1638: to go away again,” she went on, whimpering, “an’ I’m fast sure he’ll go
1639: some dawnin’ afore I’m up, an’ niver let me know aforehand, an’ he’ll
1640: niver come back again when once he’s gone. An’ I’d better niver ha’ had
1641: a son, as is like no other body’s son for the deftness an’ th’
1642: handiness, an’ so looked on by th’ grit folks, an’ tall an’ upright
1643: like a poplar-tree, an’ me to be parted from him an’ niver see ’m no
1644: more.”
1645: 
1646: “Come, Mother, donna grieve thyself in vain,” said Seth, in a soothing
1647: voice. “Thee’st not half so good reason to think as Adam ’ull go away
1648: as to think he’ll stay with thee. He may say such a thing when he’s in
1649: wrath—and he’s got excuse for being wrathful sometimes—but his heart
1650: ’ud never let him go. Think how he’s stood by us all when it’s been
1651: none so easy—paying his savings to free me from going for a soldier,
1652: an’ turnin’ his earnin’s into wood for father, when he’s got plenty o’
1653: uses for his money, and many a young man like him ’ud ha’ been married
1654: and settled before now. He’ll never turn round and knock down his own
1655: work, and forsake them as it’s been the labour of his life to stand
1656: by.”
1657: 
1658: “Donna talk to me about’s marr’in’,” said Lisbeth, crying afresh. “He’s
1659: set’s heart on that Hetty Sorrel, as ’ull niver save a penny, an’ ’ull
1660: toss up her head at’s old mother. An’ to think as he might ha’ Mary
1661: Burge, an’ be took partners, an’ be a big man wi’ workmen under him,
1662: like Mester Burge—Dolly’s told me so o’er and o’er again—if it warna as
1663: he’s set’s heart on that bit of a wench, as is o’ no more use nor the
1664: gillyflower on the wall. An’ he so wise at bookin’ an’ figurin’, an’
1665: not to know no better nor that!”
1666: 
1667: “But, Mother, thee know’st we canna love just where other folks ’ud
1668: have us. There’s nobody but God can control the heart of man. I could
1669: ha’ wished myself as Adam could ha’ made another choice, but I wouldn’t
1670: reproach him for what he can’t help. And I’m not sure but what he tries
1671: to o’ercome it. But it’s a matter as he doesn’t like to be spoke to
1672: about, and I can only pray to the Lord to bless and direct him.”
1673: 
1674: “Aye, thee’t allays ready enough at prayin’, but I donna see as thee
1675: gets much wi’ thy prayin’. Thee wotna get double earnin’s o’ this side
1676: Yule. Th’ Methodies ’ll niver make thee half the man thy brother is,
1677: for all they’re a-makin’ a preacher on thee.”
1678: 
1679: “It’s partly truth thee speak’st there, Mother,” said Seth, mildly;
1680: “Adam’s far before me, an’s done more for me than I can ever do for
1681: him. God distributes talents to every man according as He sees good.
1682: But thee mustna undervally prayer. Prayer mayna bring money, but it
1683: brings us what no money can buy—a power to keep from sin and be content
1684: with God’s will, whatever He may please to send. If thee wouldst pray
1685: to God to help thee, and trust in His goodness, thee wouldstna be so
1686: uneasy about things.”
1687: 
1688: “Unaisy? I’m i’ th’ right on’t to be unaisy. It’s well seen on _thee_
1689: what it is niver to be unaisy. Thee’t gi’ away all thy earnin’s, an’
1690: niver be unaisy as thee’st nothin’ laid up again’ a rainy day. If Adam
1691: had been as aisy as thee, he’d niver ha’ had no money to pay for thee.
1692: Take no thought for the morrow—take no thought—that’s what thee’t
1693: allays sayin’; an’ what comes on’t? Why, as Adam has to take thought
1694: for thee.”
1695: 
1696: “Those are the words o’ the Bible, Mother,” said Seth. “They don’t mean
1697: as we should be idle. They mean we shouldn’t be overanxious and
1698: worreting ourselves about what’ll happen to-morrow, but do our duty and
1699: leave the rest to God’s will.”
1700: 
1701: “Aye, aye, that’s the way wi’ thee: thee allays makes a peck o’ thy own
1702: words out o’ a pint o’ the Bible’s. I donna see how thee’t to know as
1703: ‘take no thought for the morrow’ means all that. An’ when the Bible’s
1704: such a big book, an’ thee canst read all thro’t, an’ ha’ the pick o’
1705: the texes, I canna think why thee dostna pick better words as donna
1706: mean so much more nor they say. Adam doesna pick a that’n; I can
1707: understan’ the tex as he’s allays a-sayin’, ‘God helps them as helps
1708: theirsens.’”
1709: 
1710: “Nay, Mother,” said Seth, “that’s no text o’ the Bible. It comes out of
1711: a book as Adam picked up at the stall at Treddles’on. It was wrote by a
1712: knowing man, but overworldly, I doubt. However, that saying’s partly
1713: true; for the Bible tells us we must be workers together with God.”
1714: 
1715: “Well, how’m I to know? It sounds like a tex. But what’s th’ matter wi’
1716: th’ lad? Thee’t hardly atin’ a bit o’ supper. Dostna mean to ha’ no
1717: more nor that bit o’ oat-cake? An’ thee lookst as white as a flick o’
1718: new bacon. What’s th’ matter wi’ thee?”
1719: 
1720: “Nothing to mind about, Mother; I’m not hungry. I’ll just look in at
1721: Adam again, and see if he’ll let me go on with the coffin.”
1722: 
1723: “Ha’ a drop o’ warm broth?” said Lisbeth, whose motherly feeling now
1724: got the better of her “nattering” habit. “I’ll set two-three sticks
1725: a-light in a minute.”
1726: 
1727: “Nay, Mother, thank thee; thee’t very good,” said Seth, gratefully; and
1728: encouraged by this touch of tenderness, he went on: “Let me pray a bit
1729: with thee for Father, and Adam, and all of us—it’ll comfort thee,
1730: happen, more than thee thinkst.”
1731: 
1732: “Well, I’ve nothin’ to say again’ it.”
1733: 
1734: Lisbeth, though disposed always to take the negative side in her
1735: conversations with Seth, had a vague sense that there was some comfort
1736: and safety in the fact of his piety, and that it somehow relieved her
1737: from the trouble of any spiritual transactions on her own behalf.
1738: 
1739: So the mother and son knelt down together, and Seth prayed for the poor
1740: wandering father and for those who were sorrowing for him at home. And
1741: when he came to the petition that Adam might never be called to set up
1742: his tent in a far country, but that his mother might be cheered and
1743: comforted by his presence all the days of her pilgrimage, Lisbeth’s
1744: ready tears flowed again, and she wept aloud.
1745: 
1746: When they rose from their knees, Seth went to Adam again and said,
1747: “Wilt only lie down for an hour or two, and let me go on the while?”
1748: 
1749: “No, Seth, no. Make Mother go to bed, and go thyself.”
1750: 
1751: Meantime Lisbeth had dried her eyes, and now followed Seth, holding
1752: something in her hands. It was the brown-and-yellow platter containing
1753: the baked potatoes with the gravy in them and bits of meat which she
1754: had cut and mixed among them. Those were dear times, when wheaten bread
1755: and fresh meat were delicacies to working people. She set the dish down
1756: rather timidly on the bench by Adam’s side and said, “Thee canst pick a
1757: bit while thee’t workin’. I’ll bring thee another drop o’ water.”
1758: 
1759: “Aye, Mother, do,” said Adam, kindly; “I’m getting very thirsty.”
1760: 
1761: In half an hour all was quiet; no sound was to be heard in the house
1762: but the loud ticking of the old day-clock and the ringing of Adam’s
1763: tools. The night was very still: when Adam opened the door to look out
1764: at twelve o’clock, the only motion seemed to be in the glowing,
1765: twinkling stars; every blade of grass was asleep.
1766: 
1767: Bodily haste and exertion usually leave our thoughts very much at the
1768: mercy of our feelings and imagination; and it was so to-night with
1769: Adam. While his muscles were working lustily, his mind seemed as
1770: passive as a spectator at a diorama: scenes of the sad past, and
1771: probably sad future, floating before him and giving place one to the
1772: other in swift succession.
1773: 
1774: He saw how it would be to-morrow morning, when he had carried the
1775: coffin to Broxton and was at home again, having his breakfast: his
1776: father perhaps would come in ashamed to meet his son’s glance—would sit
1777: down, looking older and more tottering than he had done the morning
1778: before, and hang down his head, examining the floor-quarries; while
1779: Lisbeth would ask him how he supposed the coffin had been got ready,
1780: that he had slinked off and left undone—for Lisbeth was always the
1781: first to utter the word of reproach, although she cried at Adam’s
1782: severity towards his father.
1783: 
1784: “So it will go on, worsening and worsening,” thought Adam; “there’s no
1785: slipping uphill again, and no standing still when once you ’ve begun to
1786: slip down.” And then the day came back to him when he was a little
1787: fellow and used to run by his father’s side, proud to be taken out to
1788: work, and prouder still to hear his father boasting to his
1789: fellow-workmen how “the little chap had an uncommon notion o’
1790: carpentering.” What a fine active fellow his father was then! When
1791: people asked Adam whose little lad he was, he had a sense of
1792: distinction as he answered, “I’m Thias Bede’s lad.” He was quite sure
1793: everybody knew Thias Bede—didn’t he make the wonderful pigeon-house at
1794: Broxton parsonage? Those were happy days, especially when Seth, who was
1795: three years the younger, began to go out working too, and Adam began to
1796: be a teacher as well as a learner. But then came the days of sadness,
1797: when Adam was someway on in his teens, and Thias began to loiter at the
1798: public-houses, and Lisbeth began to cry at home, and to pour forth her
1799: plaints in the hearing of her sons. Adam remembered well the night of
1800: shame and anguish when he first saw his father quite wild and foolish,
1801: shouting a song out fitfully among his drunken companions at the
1802: “Waggon Overthrown.” He had run away once when he was only eighteen,
1803: making his escape in the morning twilight with a little blue bundle
1804: over his shoulder, and his “mensuration book” in his pocket, and saying
1805: to himself very decidedly that he could bear the vexations of home no
1806: longer—he would go and seek his fortune, setting up his stick at the
1807: crossways and bending his steps the way it fell. But by the time he got
1808: to Stoniton, the thought of his mother and Seth, left behind to endure
1809: everything without him, became too importunate, and his resolution
1810: failed him. He came back the next day, but the misery and terror his
1811: mother had gone through in those two days had haunted her ever since.
1812: 
1813: “No!” Adam said to himself to-night, “that must never happen again. It
1814: ’ud make a poor balance when my doings are cast up at the last, if my
1815: poor old mother stood o’ the wrong side. My back’s broad enough and
1816: strong enough; I should be no better than a coward to go away and leave
1817: the troubles to be borne by them as aren’t half so able. ‘They that are
1818: strong ought to bear the infirmities of those that are weak, and not to
1819: please themselves.’ There’s a text wants no candle to show’t; it shines
1820: by its own light. It’s plain enough you get into the wrong road i’ this
1821: life if you run after this and that only for the sake o’ making things
1822: easy and pleasant to yourself. A pig may poke his nose into the trough
1823: and think o’ nothing outside it; but if you’ve got a man’s heart and
1824: soul in you, you can’t be easy a-making your own bed an’ leaving the
1825: rest to lie on the stones. Nay, nay, I’ll never slip my neck out o’ the
1826: yoke, and leave the load to be drawn by the weak uns. Father’s a sore
1827: cross to me, an’s likely to be for many a long year to come. What then?
1828: I’ve got th’ health, and the limbs, and the sperrit to bear it.”
1829: 
1830: At this moment a smart rap, as if with a willow wand, was given at the
1831: house door, and Gyp, instead of barking, as might have been expected,
1832: gave a loud howl. Adam, very much startled, went at once to the door
1833: and opened it. Nothing was there; all was still, as when he opened it
1834: an hour before; the leaves were motionless, and the light of the stars
1835: showed the placid fields on both sides of the brook quite empty of
1836: visible life. Adam walked round the house, and still saw nothing except
1837: a rat which darted into the woodshed as he passed. He went in again,
1838: wondering; the sound was so peculiar that the moment he heard it it
1839: called up the image of the willow wand striking the door. He could not
1840: help a little shudder, as he remembered how often his mother had told
1841: him of just such a sound coming as a sign when some one was dying. Adam
1842: was not a man to be gratuitously superstitious, but he had the blood of
1843: the peasant in him as well as of the artisan, and a peasant can no more
1844: help believing in a traditional superstition than a horse can help
1845: trembling when he sees a camel. Besides, he had that mental combination
1846: which is at once humble in the region of mystery and keen in the region
1847: of knowledge: it was the depth of his reverence quite as much as his
1848: hard common sense which gave him his disinclination to doctrinal
1849: religion, and he often checked Seth’s argumentative spiritualism by
1850: saying, “Eh, it’s a big mystery; thee know’st but little about it.” And
1851: so it happened that Adam was at once penetrating and credulous. If a
1852: new building had fallen down and he had been told that this was a
1853: divine judgment, he would have said, “May be; but the bearing o’ the
1854: roof and walls wasn’t right, else it wouldn’t ha’ come down”; yet he
1855: believed in dreams and prognostics, and to his dying day he bated his
1856: breath a little when he told the story of the stroke with the willow
1857: wand. I tell it as he told it, not attempting to reduce it to its
1858: natural elements—in our eagerness to explain impressions, we often lose
1859: our hold of the sympathy that comprehends them.
1860: 
1861: But he had the best antidote against imaginative dread in the necessity
1862: for getting on with the coffin, and for the next ten minutes his hammer
1863: was ringing so uninterruptedly, that other sounds, if there were any,
1864: might well be overpowered. A pause came, however, when he had to take
1865: up his ruler, and now again came the strange rap, and again Gyp howled.
1866: Adam was at the door without the loss of a moment; but again all was
1867: still, and the starlight showed there was nothing but the dew-laden
1868: grass in front of the cottage.
1869: 
1870: Adam for a moment thought uncomfortably about his father; but of late
1871: years he had never come home at dark hours from Treddleston, and there
1872: was every reason for believing that he was then sleeping off his
1873: drunkenness at the “Waggon Overthrown.” Besides, to Adam, the
1874: conception of the future was so inseparable from the painful image of
1875: his father that the fear of any fatal accident to him was excluded by
1876: the deeply infixed fear of his continual degradation. The next thought
1877: that occurred to him was one that made him slip off his shoes and tread
1878: lightly upstairs, to listen at the bedroom doors. But both Seth and his
1879: mother were breathing regularly.
1880: 
1881: Adam came down and set to work again, saying to himself, “I won’t open
1882: the door again. It’s no use staring about to catch sight of a sound.
1883: Maybe there’s a world about us as we can’t see, but th’ ear’s quicker
1884: than the eye and catches a sound from’t now and then. Some people think
1885: they get a sight on’t too, but they’re mostly folks whose eyes are not
1886: much use to ’em at anything else. For my part, I think it’s better to
1887: see when your perpendicular’s true than to see a ghost.”
1888: 
1889: Such thoughts as these are apt to grow stronger and stronger as
1890: daylight quenches the candles and the birds begin to sing. By the time
1891: the red sunlight shone on the brass nails that formed the initials on
1892: the lid of the coffin, any lingering foreboding from the sound of the
1893: willow wand was merged in satisfaction that the work was done and the
1894: promise redeemed. There was no need to call Seth, for he was already
1895: moving overhead, and presently came downstairs.
1896: 
1897: “Now, lad,” said Adam, as Seth made his appearance, “the coffin’s done,
1898: and we can take it over to Brox’on, and be back again before half after
1899: six. I’ll take a mouthful o’ oat-cake, and then we’ll be off.”
1900: 
1901: The coffin was soon propped on the tall shoulders of the two brothers,
1902: and they were making their way, followed close by Gyp, out of the
1903: little woodyard into the lane at the back of the house. It was but
1904: about a mile and a half to Broxton over the opposite slope, and their
1905: road wound very pleasantly along lanes and across fields, where the
1906: pale woodbines and the dog-roses were scenting the hedgerows, and the
1907: birds were twittering and trilling in the tall leafy boughs of oak and
1908: elm. It was a strangely mingled picture—the fresh youth of the summer
1909: morning, with its Edenlike peace and loveliness, the stalwart strength
1910: of the two brothers in their rusty working clothes, and the long coffin
1911: on their shoulders. They paused for the last time before a small
1912: farmhouse outside the village of Broxton. By six o’clock the task was
1913: done, the coffin nailed down, and Adam and Seth were on their way home.
1914: They chose a shorter way homewards, which would take them across the
1915: fields and the brook in front of the house. Adam had not mentioned to
1916: Seth what had happened in the night, but he still retained sufficient
1917: impression from it himself to say, “Seth, lad, if Father isn’t come
1918: home by the time we’ve had our breakfast, I think it’ll be as well for
1919: thee to go over to Treddles’on and look after him, and thee canst get
1920: me the brass wire I want. Never mind about losing an hour at thy work;
1921: we can make that up. What dost say?”
1922: 
1923: “I’m willing,” said Seth. “But see what clouds have gathered since we
1924: set out. I’m thinking we shall have more rain. It’ll be a sore time for
1925: th’ haymaking if the meadows are flooded again. The brook’s fine and
1926: full now: another day’s rain ’ud cover the plank, and we should have to
1927: go round by the road.”
1928: 
1929: They were coming across the valley now, and had entered the pasture
1930: through which the brook ran.
1931: 
1932: “Why, what’s that sticking against the willow?” continued Seth,
1933: beginning to walk faster. Adam’s heart rose to his mouth: the vague
1934: anxiety about his father was changed into a great dread. He made no
1935: answer to Seth, but ran forward preceded by Gyp, who began to bark
1936: uneasily; and in two moments he was at the bridge.
1937: 
1938: This was what the omen meant, then! And the grey-haired father, of whom
1939: he had thought with a sort of hardness a few hours ago, as certain to
1940: live to be a thorn in his side was perhaps even then struggling with
1941: that watery death! This was the first thought that flashed through
1942: Adam’s conscience, before he had time to seize the coat and drag out
1943: the tall heavy body. Seth was already by his side, helping him, and
1944: when they had it on the bank, the two sons in the first moment knelt
1945: and looked with mute awe at the glazed eyes, forgetting that there was
1946: need for action—forgetting everything but that their father lay dead
1947: before them. Adam was the first to speak.
1948: 
1949: “I’ll run to Mother,” he said, in a loud whisper. “I’ll be back to thee
1950: in a minute.”
1951: 
1952: Poor Lisbeth was busy preparing her sons’ breakfast, and their porridge
1953: was already steaming on the fire. Her kitchen always looked the pink of
1954: cleanliness, but this morning she was more than usually bent on making
1955: her hearth and breakfast-table look comfortable and inviting.
1956: 
1957: “The lads ’ull be fine an’ hungry,” she said, half-aloud, as she
1958: stirred the porridge. “It’s a good step to Brox’on, an’ it’s hungry air
1959: o’er the hill—wi’ that heavy coffin too. Eh! It’s heavier now, wi’ poor
1960: Bob Tholer in’t. Howiver, I’ve made a drap more porridge nor common
1961: this mornin’. The feyther ’ull happen come in arter a bit. Not as he’ll
1962: ate much porridge. He swallers sixpenn’orth o’ ale, an’ saves a
1963: hap’orth o’ por-ridge—that’s his way o’ layin’ by money, as I’ve told
1964: him many a time, an’ am likely to tell him again afore the day’s out.
1965: Eh, poor mon, he takes it quiet enough; there’s no denyin’ that.”
1966: 
1967: But now Lisbeth heard the heavy “thud” of a running footstep on the
1968: turf, and, turning quickly towards the door, she saw Adam enter,
1969: looking so pale and overwhelmed that she screamed aloud and rushed
1970: towards him before he had time to speak.
1971: 
1972: “Hush, Mother,” Adam said, rather hoarsely, “don’t be frightened.
1973: Father’s tumbled into the water. Belike we may bring him round again.
1974: Seth and me are going to carry him in. Get a blanket and make it hot as
1975: the fire.”
1976: 
1977: In reality Adam was convinced that his father was dead but he knew
1978: there was no other way of repressing his mother’s impetuous wailing
1979: grief than by occupying her with some active task which had hope in it.
1980: 
1981: He ran back to Seth, and the two sons lifted the sad burden in
1982: heart-stricken silence. The wide-open glazed eyes were grey, like
1983: Seth’s, and had once looked with mild pride on the boys before whom
1984: Thias had lived to hang his head in shame. Seth’s chief feeling was awe
1985: and distress at this sudden snatching away of his father’s soul; but
1986: Adam’s mind rushed back over the past in a flood of relenting and pity.
1987: When death, the great Reconciler, has come, it is never our tenderness
1988: that we repent of, but our severity.

1992: 
1993: Chapter V
1994: The Rector
1995: 
1996: 
1997: Before twelve o’clock there had been some heavy storms of rain, and the
1998: water lay in deep gutters on the sides of the gravel walks in the
1999: garden of Broxton Parsonage; the great Provence roses had been cruelly
2000: tossed by the wind and beaten by the rain, and all the delicate-stemmed
2001: border flowers had been dashed down and stained with the wet soil. A
2002: melancholy morning—because it was nearly time hay-harvest should begin,
2003: and instead of that the meadows were likely to be flooded.
2004: 
2005: But people who have pleasant homes get indoor enjoyments that they
2006: would never think of but for the rain. If it had not been a wet
2007: morning, Mr. Irwine would not have been in the dining-room playing at
2008: chess with his mother, and he loves both his mother and chess quite
2009: well enough to pass some cloudy hours very easily by their help. Let me
2010: take you into that dining-room and show you the Rev. Adolphus Irwine,
2011: Rector of Broxton, Vicar of Hayslope, and Vicar of Blythe, a pluralist
2012: at whom the severest Church reformer would have found it difficult to
2013: look sour. We will enter very softly and stand still in the open
2014: doorway, without awaking the glossy-brown setter who is stretched
2015: across the hearth, with her two puppies beside her; or the pug, who is
2016: dozing, with his black muzzle aloft, like a sleepy president.
2017: 
2018: The room is a large and lofty one, with an ample mullioned oriel window
2019: at one end; the walls, you see, are new, and not yet painted; but the
2020: furniture, though originally of an expensive sort, is old and scanty,
2021: and there is no drapery about the window. The crimson cloth over the
2022: large dining-table is very threadbare, though it contrasts pleasantly
2023: enough with the dead hue of the plaster on the walls; but on this cloth
2024: there is a massive silver waiter with a decanter of water on it, of the
2025: same pattern as two larger ones that are propped up on the sideboard
2026: with a coat of arms conspicuous in their centre. You suspect at once
2027: that the inhabitants of this room have inherited more blood than
2028: wealth, and would not be surprised to find that Mr. Irwine had a finely
2029: cut nostril and upper lip; but at present we can only see that he has a
2030: broad flat back and an abundance of powdered hair, all thrown backward
2031: and tied behind with a black ribbon—a bit of conservatism in costume
2032: which tells you that he is not a young man. He will perhaps turn round
2033: by and by, and in the meantime we can look at that stately old lady,
2034: his mother, a beautiful aged brunette, whose rich-toned complexion is
2035: well set off by the complex wrappings of pure white cambric and lace
2036: about her head and neck. She is as erect in her comely embonpoint as a
2037: statue of Ceres; and her dark face, with its delicate aquiline nose,
2038: firm proud mouth, and small, intense, black eye, is so keen and
2039: sarcastic in its expression that you instinctively substitute a pack of
2040: cards for the chess-men and imagine her telling your fortune. The small
2041: brown hand with which she is lifting her queen is laden with pearls,
2042: diamonds, and turquoises; and a large black veil is very carefully
2043: adjusted over the crown of her cap, and falls in sharp contrast on the
2044: white folds about her neck. It must take a long time to dress that old
2045: lady in the morning! But it seems a law of nature that she should be
2046: dressed so: she is clearly one of those children of royalty who have
2047: never doubted their right divine and never met with any one so absurd
2048: as to question it.
2049: 
2050: “There, Dauphin, tell me what that is!” says this magnificent old lady,
2051: as she deposits her queen very quietly and folds her arms. “I should be
2052: sorry to utter a word disagreeable to your feelings.”
2053: 
2054: “Ah, you witch-mother, you sorceress! How is a Christian man to win a
2055: game off you? I should have sprinkled the board with holy water before
2056: we began. You’ve not won that game by fair means, now, so don’t pretend
2057: it.”
2058: 
2059: “Yes, yes, that’s what the beaten have always said of great conquerors.
2060: But see, there’s the sunshine falling on the board, to show you more
2061: clearly what a foolish move you made with that pawn. Come, shall I give
2062: you another chance?”
2063: 
2064: “No, Mother, I shall leave you to your own conscience, now it’s
2065: clearing up. We must go and plash up the mud a little, mus’n’t we,
2066: Juno?” This was addressed to the brown setter, who had jumped up at the
2067: sound of the voices and laid her nose in an insinuating way on her
2068: master’s leg. “But I must go upstairs first and see Anne. I was called
2069: away to Tholer’s funeral just when I was going before.”
2070: 
2071: “It’s of no use, child; she can’t speak to you. Kate says she has one
2072: of her worst headaches this morning.”
2073: 
2074: “Oh, she likes me to go and see her just the same; she’s never too ill
2075: to care about that.”
2076: 
2077: If you know how much of human speech is mere purposeless impulse or
2078: habit, you will not wonder when I tell you that this identical
2079: objection had been made, and had received the same kind of answer, many
2080: hundred times in the course of the fifteen years that Mr. Irwine’s
2081: sister Anne had been an invalid. Splendid old ladies, who take a long
2082: time to dress in the morning, have often slight sympathy with sickly
2083: daughters.
2084: 
2085: But while Mr. Irwine was still seated, leaning back in his chair and
2086: stroking Juno’s head, the servant came to the door and said, “If you
2087: please, sir, Joshua Rann wishes to speak with you, if you are at
2088: liberty.”
2089: 
2090: “Let him be shown in here,” said Mrs. Irwine, taking up her knitting.
2091: “I always like to hear what Mr. Rann has got to say. His shoes will be
2092: dirty, but see that he wipes them Carroll.”
2093: 
2094: In two minutes Mr. Rann appeared at the door with very deferential
2095: bows, which, however, were far from conciliating Pug, who gave a sharp
2096: bark and ran across the room to reconnoitre the stranger’s legs; while
2097: the two puppies, regarding Mr. Rann’s prominent calf and ribbed worsted
2098: stockings from a more sensuous point of view, plunged and growled over
2099: them in great enjoyment. Meantime, Mr. Irwine turned round his chair
2100: and said, “Well, Joshua, anything the matter at Hayslope, that you’ve
2101: come over this damp morning? Sit down, sit down. Never mind the dogs;
2102: give them a friendly kick. Here, Pug, you rascal!”
2103: 
2104: It is very pleasant to see some men turn round; pleasant as a sudden
2105: rush of warm air in winter, or the flash of firelight in the chill
2106: dusk. Mr. Irwine was one of those men. He bore the same sort of
2107: resemblance to his mother that our loving memory of a friend’s face
2108: often bears to the face itself: the lines were all more generous, the
2109: smile brighter, the expression heartier. If the outline had been less
2110: finely cut, his face might have been called jolly; but that was not the
2111: right word for its mixture of bonhomie and distinction.
2112: 
2113: “Thank Your Reverence,” answered Mr. Rann, endeavouring to look
2114: unconcerned about his legs, but shaking them alternately to keep off
2115: the puppies; “I’ll stand, if you please, as more becoming. I hope I see
2116: you an’ Mrs. Irwine well, an’ Miss Irwine—an’ Miss Anne, I hope’s as
2117: well as usual.”
2118: 
2119: “Yes, Joshua, thank you. You see how blooming my mother looks. She
2120: beats us younger people hollow. But what’s the matter?”
2121: 
2122: “Why, sir, I had to come to Brox’on to deliver some work, and I thought
2123: it but right to call and let you know the goins-on as there’s been i’
2124: the village, such as I hanna seen i’ my time, and I’ve lived in it man
2125: and boy sixty year come St. Thomas, and collected th’ Easter dues for
2126: Mr. Blick before Your Reverence come into the parish, and been at the
2127: ringin’ o’ every bell, and the diggin’ o’ every grave, and sung i’ the
2128: choir long afore Bartle Massey come from nobody knows where, wi’ his
2129: counter-singin’ and fine anthems, as puts everybody out but himself—one
2130: takin’ it up after another like sheep a-bleatin’ i’ th’ fold. I know
2131: what belongs to bein’ a parish clerk, and I know as I should be wantin’
2132: i’ respect to Your Reverence, an’ church, an’ king, if I was t’ allow
2133: such goins-on wi’out speakin’. I was took by surprise, an’ knowed
2134: nothin’ on it beforehand, an’ I was so flustered, I was clean as if I’d
2135: lost my tools. I hanna slep’ more nor four hour this night as is past
2136: an’ gone; an’ then it was nothin’ but nightmare, as tired me worse nor
2137: wakin’.”
2138: 
2139: “Why, what in the world is the matter, Joshua? Have the thieves been at
2140: the church lead again?”
2141: 
2142: “Thieves! No, sir—an’ yet, as I may say, it _is_ thieves, an’
2143: a-thievin’ the church, too. It’s the Methodisses as is like to get th’
2144: upper hand i’ th’ parish, if Your Reverence an’ His Honour, Squire
2145: Donnithorne, doesna think well to say the word an’ forbid it. Not as
2146: I’m a-dictatin’ to you, sir; I’m not forgettin’ myself so far as to be
2147: wise above my betters. Howiver, whether I’m wise or no, that’s neither
2148: here nor there, but what I’ve got to say I say—as the young Methodis
2149: woman as is at Mester Poyser’s was a-preachin’ an’ a-prayin’ on the
2150: Green last night, as sure as I’m a-stannin’ afore Your Reverence now.”
2151: 
2152: “Preaching on the Green!” said Mr. Irwine, looking surprised but quite
2153: serene. “What, that pale pretty young woman I’ve seen at Poyser’s? I
2154: saw she was a Methodist, or Quaker, or something of that sort, by her
2155: dress, but I didn’t know she was a preacher.”
2156: 
2157: “It’s a true word as I say, sir,” rejoined Mr. Rann, compressing his
2158: mouth into a semicircular form and pausing long enough to indicate
2159: three notes of exclamation. “She preached on the Green last night; an’
2160: she’s laid hold of Chad’s Bess, as the girl’s been i’ fits welly iver
2161: sin’.”
2162: 
2163: “Well, Bessy Cranage is a hearty-looking lass; I daresay she’ll come
2164: round again, Joshua. Did anybody else go into fits?”
2165: 
2166: “No, sir, I canna say as they did. But there’s no knowin’ what’ll come,
2167: if we’re t’ have such preachin’s as that a-goin’ on ivery week—there’ll
2168: be no livin’ i’ th’ village. For them Methodisses make folks believe as
2169: if they take a mug o’ drink extry, an’ make theirselves a bit
2170: comfortable, they’ll have to go to hell for’t as sure as they’re born.
2171: I’m not a tipplin’ man nor a drunkard—nobody can say it on me—but I
2172: like a extry quart at Easter or Christmas time, as is nat’ral when
2173: we’re goin’ the rounds a-singin’, an’ folks offer’t you for nothin’; or
2174: when I’m a-collectin’ the dues; an’ I like a pint wi’ my pipe, an’ a
2175: neighbourly chat at Mester Casson’s now an’ then, for I was brought up
2176: i’ the Church, thank God, an’ ha’ been a parish clerk this
2177: two-an’-thirty year: I should know what the church religion is.”
2178: 
2179: “Well, what’s your advice, Joshua? What do you think should be done?”
2180: 
2181: “Well, Your Reverence, I’m not for takin’ any measures again’ the young
2182: woman. She’s well enough if she’d let alone preachin’; an’ I hear as
2183: she’s a-goin’ away back to her own country soon. She’s Mr. Poyser’s own
2184: niece, an’ I donna wish to say what’s anyways disrespectful o’ th’
2185: family at th’ Hall Farm, as I’ve measured for shoes, little an’ big,
2186: welly iver sin’ I’ve been a shoemaker. But there’s that Will Maskery,
2187: sir as is the rampageousest Methodis as can be, an’ I make no doubt it
2188: was him as stirred up th’ young woman to preach last night, an’ he’ll
2189: be a-bringin’ other folks to preach from Treddles’on, if his comb isn’t
2190: cut a bit; an’ I think as he should be let know as he isna t’ have the
2191: makin’ an’ mendin’ o’ church carts an’ implemen’s, let alone stayin’ i’
2192: that house an’ yard as is Squire Donnithorne’s.”
2193: 
2194: “Well, but you say yourself, Joshua, that you never knew any one come
2195: to preach on the Green before; why should you think they’ll come again?
2196: The Methodists don’t come to preach in little villages like Hayslope,
2197: where there’s only a handful of labourers, too tired to listen to them.
2198: They might almost as well go and preach on the Binton Hills. Will
2199: Maskery is no preacher himself, I think.”
2200: 
2201: “Nay, sir, he’s no gift at stringin’ the words together wi’out book;
2202: he’d be stuck fast like a cow i’ wet clay. But he’s got tongue enough
2203: to speak disrespectful about’s neebors, for he said as I was a blind
2204: Pharisee—a-usin’ the Bible i’ that way to find nick-names for folks as
2205: are his elders an’ betters!—and what’s worse, he’s been heard to say
2206: very unbecomin’ words about Your Reverence; for I could bring them as
2207: ’ud swear as he called you a ‘dumb dog,’ an’ a ‘idle shepherd.’ You’ll
2208: forgi’e me for sayin’ such things over again.”
2209: 
2210: “Better not, better not, Joshua. Let evil words die as soon as they’re
2211: spoken. Will Maskery might be a great deal worse fellow than he is. He
2212: used to be a wild drunken rascal, neglecting his work and beating his
2213: wife, they told me; now he’s thrifty and decent, and he and his wife
2214: look comfortable together. If you can bring me any proof that he
2215: interferes with his neighbours and creates any disturbance, I shall
2216: think it my duty as a clergyman and a magistrate to interfere. But it
2217: wouldn’t become wise people like you and me to be making a fuss about
2218: trifles, as if we thought the Church was in danger because Will Maskery
2219: lets his tongue wag rather foolishly, or a young woman talks in a
2220: serious way to a handful of people on the Green. We must ‘live and let
2221: live,’ Joshua, in religion as well as in other things. You go on doing
2222: your duty, as parish clerk and sexton, as well as you’ve always done
2223: it, and making those capital thick boots for your neighbours, and
2224: things won’t go far wrong in Hayslope, depend upon it.”
2225: 
2226: “Your Reverence is very good to say so; an’ I’m sensable as, you not
2227: livin’ i’ the parish, there’s more upo’ my shoulders.”
2228: 
2229: “To be sure; and you must mind and not lower the Church in people’s
2230: eyes by seeming to be frightened about it for a little thing, Joshua. I
2231: shall trust to your good sense, now to take no notice at all of what
2232: Will Maskery says, either about you or me. You and your neighbours can
2233: go on taking your pot of beer soberly, when you’ve done your day’s
2234: work, like good churchmen; and if Will Maskery doesn’t like to join
2235: you, but to go to a prayer-meeting at Treddleston instead, let him;
2236: that’s no business of yours, so long as he doesn’t hinder you from
2237: doing what you like. And as to people saying a few idle words about us,
2238: we must not mind that, any more than the old church-steeple minds the
2239: rooks cawing about it. Will Maskery comes to church every Sunday
2240: afternoon, and does his wheelwright’s business steadily in the
2241: weekdays, and as long as he does that he must be let alone.”
2242: 
2243: “Ah, sir, but when he comes to church, he sits an’ shakes his head, an’
2244: looks as sour an’ as coxy when we’re a-singin’ as I should like to
2245: fetch him a rap across the jowl—God forgi’e me—an’ Mrs. Irwine, an’
2246: Your Reverence too, for speakin’ so afore you. An’ he said as our
2247: Christmas singin’ was no better nor the cracklin’ o’ thorns under a
2248: pot.”
2249: 
2250: “Well, he’s got a bad ear for music, Joshua. When people have wooden
2251: heads, you know, it can’t be helped. He won’t bring the other people in
2252: Hayslope round to his opinion, while you go on singing as well as you
2253: do.”
2254: 
2255: “Yes, sir, but it turns a man’s stomach t’ hear the Scripture misused
2256: i’ that way. I know as much o’ the words o’ the Bible as he does, an’
2257: could say the Psalms right through i’ my sleep if you was to pinch me;
2258: but I know better nor to take ’em to say my own say wi’. I might as
2259: well take the Sacriment-cup home and use it at meals.”
2260: 
2261: “That’s a very sensible remark of yours, Joshua; but, as I said
2262: before——”
2263: 
2264: While Mr. Irwine was speaking, the sound of a booted step and the clink
2265: of a spur were heard on the stone floor of the entrance-hall, and
2266: Joshua Rann moved hastily aside from the doorway to make room for some
2267: one who paused there, and said, in a ringing tenor voice,
2268: 
2269: “Godson Arthur—may he come in?”
2270: 
2271: “Come in, come in, godson!” Mrs. Irwine answered, in the deep
2272: half-masculine tone which belongs to the vigorous old woman, and there
2273: entered a young gentleman in a riding-dress, with his right arm in a
2274: sling; whereupon followed that pleasant confusion of laughing
2275: interjections, and hand-shakings, and “How are you’s?” mingled with
2276: joyous short barks and wagging of tails on the part of the canine
2277: members of the family, which tells that the visitor is on the best
2278: terms with the visited. The young gentleman was Arthur Donnithorne,
2279: known in Hayslope, variously, as “the young squire,” “the heir,” and
2280: “the captain.” He was only a captain in the Loamshire Militia, but to
2281: the Hayslope tenants he was more intensely a captain than all the young
2282: gentlemen of the same rank in his Majesty’s regulars—he outshone them
2283: as the planet Jupiter outshines the Milky Way. If you want to know more
2284: particularly how he looked, call to your remembrance some
2285: tawny-whiskered, brown-locked, clear-complexioned young Englishman whom
2286: you have met with in a foreign town, and been proud of as a
2287: fellow-countryman—well-washed, high-bred, white-handed, yet looking as
2288: if he could deliver well from ‘the left shoulder and floor his man: I
2289: will not be so much of a tailor as to trouble your imagination with the
2290: difference of costume, and insist on the striped waistcoat, long-tailed
2291: coat, and low top-boots.
2292: 
2293: Turning round to take a chair, Captain Donnithorne said, “But don’t let
2294: me interrupt Joshua’s business—he has something to say.”
2295: 
2296: “Humbly begging Your Honour’s pardon,” said Joshua, bowing low, “there
2297: was one thing I had to say to His Reverence as other things had drove
2298: out o’ my head.”
2299: 
2300: “Out with it, Joshua, quickly!” said Mr. Irwine.
2301: 
2302: “Belike, sir, you havena heared as Thias Bede’s dead—drownded this
2303: morning, or more like overnight, i’ the Willow Brook, again’ the bridge
2304: right i’ front o’ the house.”
2305: 
2306: “Ah!” exclaimed both the gentlemen at once, as if they were a good deal
2307: interested in the information.
2308: 
2309: “An’ Seth Bede’s been to me this morning to say he wished me to tell
2310: Your Reverence as his brother Adam begged of you particular t’ allow
2311: his father’s grave to be dug by the White Thorn, because his mother’s
2312: set her heart on it, on account of a dream as she had; an’ they’d ha’
2313: come theirselves to ask you, but they’ve so much to see after with the
2314: crowner, an’ that; an’ their mother’s took on so, an’ wants ’em to make
2315: sure o’ the spot for fear somebody else should take it. An’ if Your
2316: Reverence sees well and good, I’ll send my boy to tell ’em as soon as I
2317: get home; an’ that’s why I make bold to trouble you wi’ it, His Honour
2318: being present.”
2319: 
2320: “To be sure, Joshua, to be sure, they shall have it. I’ll ride round to
2321: Adam myself, and see him. Send your boy, however, to say they shall
2322: have the grave, lest anything should happen to detain me. And now, good
2323: morning, Joshua; go into the kitchen and have some ale.”
2324: 
2325: “Poor old Thias!” said Mr. Irwine, when Joshua was gone. “I’m afraid
2326: the drink helped the brook to drown him. I should have been glad for
2327: the load to have been taken off my friend Adam’s shoulders in a less
2328: painful way. That fine fellow has been propping up his father from ruin
2329: for the last five or six years.”
2330: 
2331: “He’s a regular trump, is Adam,” said Captain Donnithorne. “When I was
2332: a little fellow, and Adam was a strapping lad of fifteen, and taught me
2333: carpentering, I used to think if ever I was a rich sultan, I would make
2334: Adam my grand-vizier. And I believe now he would bear the exaltation as
2335: well as any poor wise man in an Eastern story. If ever I live to be a
2336: large-acred man instead of a poor devil with a mortgaged allowance of
2337: pocket-money, I’ll have Adam for my right hand. He shall manage my
2338: woods for me, for he seems to have a better notion of those things than
2339: any man I ever met with; and I know he would make twice the money of
2340: them that my grandfather does, with that miserable old Satchell to
2341: manage, who understands no more about timber than an old carp. I’ve
2342: mentioned the subject to my grandfather once or twice, but for some
2343: reason or other he has a dislike to Adam, and _I_ can do nothing. But
2344: come, Your Reverence, are you for a ride with me? It’s splendid out of
2345: doors now. We can go to Adam’s together, if you like; but I want to
2346: call at the Hall Farm on my way, to look at the whelps Poyser is
2347: keeping for me.”
2348: 
2349: “You must stay and have lunch first, Arthur,” said Mrs. Irwine. “It’s
2350: nearly two. Carroll will bring it in directly.”
2351: 
2352: “I want to go to the Hall Farm too,” said Mr. Irwine, “to have another
2353: look at the little Methodist who is staying there. Joshua tells me she
2354: was preaching on the Green last night.”
2355: 
2356: “Oh, by Jove!” said Captain Donnithorne, laughing. “Why, she looks as
2357: quiet as a mouse. There’s something rather striking about her, though.
2358: I positively felt quite bashful the first time I saw her—she was
2359: sitting stooping over her sewing in the sunshine outside the house,
2360: when I rode up and called out, without noticing that she was a
2361: stranger, ‘Is Martin Poyser at home?’ I declare, when she got up and
2362: looked at me and just said, ‘He’s in the house, I believe: I’ll go and
2363: call him,’ I felt quite ashamed of having spoken so abruptly to her.
2364: She looked like St. Catherine in a Quaker dress. It’s a type of face
2365: one rarely sees among our common people.”
2366: 
2367: “I should like to see the young woman, Dauphin,” said Mrs. Irwine.
2368: “Make her come here on some pretext or other.”
2369: 
2370: “I don’t know how I can manage that, Mother; it will hardly do for me
2371: to patronize a Methodist preacher, even if she would consent to be
2372: patronized by an idle shepherd, as Will Maskery calls me. You should
2373: have come in a little sooner, Arthur, to hear Joshua’s denunciation of
2374: his neighbour Will Maskery. The old fellow wants me to excommunicate
2375: the wheelwright, and then deliver him over to the civil arm—that is to
2376: say, to your grandfather—to be turned out of house and yard. If I chose
2377: to interfere in this business, now, I might get up as pretty a story of
2378: hatred and persecution as the Methodists need desire to publish in the
2379: next number of their magazine. It wouldn’t take me much trouble to
2380: persuade Chad Cranage and half a dozen other bull-headed fellows that
2381: they would be doing an acceptable service to the Church by hunting Will
2382: Maskery out of the village with rope-ends and pitchforks; and then,
2383: when I had furnished them with half a sovereign to get gloriously drunk
2384: after their exertions, I should have put the climax to as pretty a
2385: farce as any of my brother clergy have set going in their parishes for
2386: the last thirty years.”
2387: 
2388: “It is really insolent of the man, though, to call you an ‘idle
2389: shepherd’ and a ‘dumb dog,’” said Mrs. Irwine. “I should be inclined to
2390: check him a little there. You are too easy-tempered, Dauphin.”
2391: 
2392: “Why, Mother, you don’t think it would be a good way of sustaining my
2393: dignity to set about vindicating myself from the aspersions of Will
2394: Maskery? Besides, I’m not so sure that they _are_ aspersions. I _am_ a
2395: lazy fellow, and get terribly heavy in my saddle; not to mention that
2396: I’m always spending more than I can afford in bricks and mortar, so
2397: that I get savage at a lame beggar when he asks me for sixpence. Those
2398: poor lean cobblers, who think they can help to regenerate mankind by
2399: setting out to preach in the morning twilight before they begin their
2400: day’s work, may well have a poor opinion of me. But come, let us have
2401: our luncheon. Isn’t Kate coming to lunch?”
2402: 
2403: “Miss Irwine told Bridget to take her lunch upstairs,” said Carroll;
2404: “she can’t leave Miss Anne.”
2405: 
2406: “Oh, very well. Tell Bridget to say I’ll go up and see Miss Anne
2407: presently. You can use your right arm quite well now, Arthur,” Mr.
2408: Irwine continued, observing that Captain Donnithorne had taken his arm
2409: out of the sling.
2410: 
2411: “Yes, pretty well; but Godwin insists on my keeping it up constantly
2412: for some time to come. I hope I shall be able to get away to the
2413: regiment, though, in the beginning of August. It’s a desperately dull
2414: business being shut up at the Chase in the summer months, when one can
2415: neither hunt nor shoot, so as to make one’s self pleasantly sleepy in
2416: the evening. However, we are to astonish the echoes on the 30th of
2417: July. My grandfather has given me _carte blanche_ for once, and I
2418: promise you the entertainment shall be worthy of the occasion. The
2419: world will not see the grand epoch of my majority twice. I think I
2420: shall have a lofty throne for you, Godmamma, or rather two, one on the
2421: lawn and another in the ballroom, that you may sit and look down upon
2422: us like an Olympian goddess.”
2423: 
2424: “I mean to bring out my best brocade, that I wore at your christening
2425: twenty years ago,” said Mrs. Irwine. “Ah, I think I shall see your poor
2426: mother flitting about in her white dress, which looked to me almost
2427: like a shroud that very day; and it _was_ her shroud only three months
2428: after; and your little cap and christening dress were buried with her
2429: too. She had set her heart on that, sweet soul! Thank God you take
2430: after your mother’s family, Arthur. If you had been a puny, wiry,
2431: yellow baby, I wouldn’t have stood godmother to you. I should have been
2432: sure you would turn out a Donnithorne. But you were such a broad-faced,
2433: broad-chested, loud-screaming rascal, I knew you were every inch of you
2434: a Tradgett.”
2435: 
2436: “But you might have been a little too hasty there, Mother,” said Mr.
2437: Irwine, smiling. “Don’t you remember how it was with Juno’s last pups?
2438: One of them was the very image of its mother, but it had two or three
2439: of its father’s tricks notwithstanding. Nature is clever enough to
2440: cheat even you, Mother.”
2441: 
2442: “Nonsense, child! Nature never makes a ferret in the shape of a
2443: mastiff. You’ll never persuade me that I can’t tell what men are by
2444: their outsides. If I don’t like a man’s looks, depend upon it I shall
2445: never like _him_. I don’t want to know people that look ugly and
2446: disagreeable, any more than I want to taste dishes that look
2447: disagreeable. If they make me shudder at the first glance, I say, take
2448: them away. An ugly, piggish, or fishy eye, now, makes me feel quite
2449: ill; it’s like a bad smell.”
2450: 
2451: “Talking of eyes,” said Captain Donnithorne, “that reminds me that I’ve
2452: got a book I meant to bring you, Godmamma. It came down in a parcel
2453: from London the other day. I know you are fond of queer, wizardlike
2454: stories. It’s a volume of poems, ‘Lyrical Ballads.’ Most of them seem
2455: to be twaddling stuff, but the first is in a different style—‘The
2456: Ancient Mariner’ is the title. I can hardly make head or tail of it as
2457: a story, but it’s a strange, striking thing. I’ll send it over to you;
2458: and there are some other books that _you_ may like to see,
2459: Irwine—pamphlets about Antinomianism and Evangelicalism, whatever they
2460: may be. I can’t think what the fellow means by sending such things to
2461: me. I’ve written to him to desire that from henceforth he will send me
2462: no book or pamphlet on anything that ends in _ism_.”
2463: 
2464: “Well, I don’t know that I’m very fond of _isms_ myself; but I may as
2465: well look at the pamphlets; they let one see what is going on. I’ve a
2466: little matter to attend to, Arthur,” continued Mr. Irwine, rising to
2467: leave the room, “and then I shall be ready to set out with you.”
2468: 
2469: The little matter that Mr. Irwine had to attend to took him up the old
2470: stone staircase (part of the house was very old) and made him pause
2471: before a door at which he knocked gently. “Come in,” said a woman’s
2472: voice, and he entered a room so darkened by blinds and curtains that
2473: Miss Kate, the thin middle-aged lady standing by the bedside, would not
2474: have had light enough for any other sort of work than the knitting
2475: which lay on the little table near her. But at present she was doing
2476: what required only the dimmest light—sponging the aching head that lay
2477: on the pillow with fresh vinegar. It was a small face, that of the poor
2478: sufferer; perhaps it had once been pretty, but now it was worn and
2479: sallow. Miss Kate came towards her brother and whispered, “Don’t speak
2480: to her; she can’t bear to be spoken to to-day.” Anne’s eyes were
2481: closed, and her brow contracted as if from intense pain. Mr. Irwine
2482: went to the bedside and took up one of the delicate hands and kissed
2483: it, a slight pressure from the small fingers told him that it was
2484: worth-while to have come upstairs for the sake of doing that. He
2485: lingered a moment, looking at her, and then turned away and left the
2486: room, treading very gently—he had taken off his boots and put on
2487: slippers before he came upstairs. Whoever remembers how many things he
2488: has declined to do even for himself, rather than have the trouble of
2489: putting on or taking off his boots, will not think this last detail
2490: insignificant.
2491: 
2492: And Mr. Irwine’s sisters, as any person of family within ten miles of
2493: Broxton could have testified, were such stupid, uninteresting women! It
2494: was quite a pity handsome, clever Mrs. Irwine should have had such
2495: commonplace daughters. That fine old lady herself was worth driving ten
2496: miles to see, any day; her beauty, her well-preserved faculties, and
2497: her old-fashioned dignity made her a graceful subject for conversation
2498: in turn with the King’s health, the sweet new patterns in cotton
2499: dresses, the news from Egypt, and Lord Dacey’s lawsuit, which was
2500: fretting poor Lady Dacey to death. But no one ever thought of
2501: mentioning the Miss Irwines, except the poor people in Broxton village,
2502: who regarded them as deep in the science of medicine, and spoke of them
2503: vaguely as “the gentlefolks.” If any one had asked old Job Dummilow who
2504: gave him his flannel jacket, he would have answered, “the gentlefolks,
2505: last winter”; and widow Steene dwelt much on the virtues of the “stuff”
2506: the gentlefolks gave her for her cough. Under this name too, they were
2507: used with great effect as a means of taming refractory children, so
2508: that at the sight of poor Miss Anne’s sallow face, several small
2509: urchins had a terrified sense that she was cognizant of all their worst
2510: misdemeanours, and knew the precise number of stones with which they
2511: had intended to hit Farmer Britton’s ducks. But for all who saw them
2512: through a less mythical medium, the Miss Irwines were quite superfluous
2513: existences—inartistic figures crowding the canvas of life without
2514: adequate effect. Miss Anne, indeed, if her chronic headaches could have
2515: been accounted for by a pathetic story of disappointed love, might have
2516: had some romantic interest attached to her: but no such story had
2517: either been known or invented concerning her, and the general
2518: impression was quite in accordance with the fact, that both the sisters
2519: were old maids for the prosaic reason that they had never received an
2520: eligible offer.
2521: 
2522: Nevertheless, to speak paradoxically, the existence of insignificant
2523: people has very important consequences in the world. It can be shown to
2524: affect the price of bread and the rate of wages, to call forth many
2525: evil tempers from the selfish and many heroisms from the sympathetic,
2526: and, in other ways, to play no small part in the tragedy of life. And
2527: if that handsome, generous-blooded clergyman, the Rev. Adolphus Irwine,
2528: had not had these two hopelessly maiden sisters, his lot would have
2529: been shaped quite differently: he would very likely have taken a comely
2530: wife in his youth, and now, when his hair was getting grey under the
2531: powder, would have had tall sons and blooming daughters—such
2532: possessions, in short, as men commonly think will repay them for all
2533: the labour they take under the sun. As it was—having with all his three
2534: livings no more than seven hundred a-year, and seeing no way of keeping
2535: his splendid mother and his sickly sister, not to reckon a second
2536: sister, who was usually spoken of without any adjective, in such
2537: ladylike ease as became their birth and habits, and at the same time
2538: providing for a family of his own—he remained, you see, at the age of
2539: eight-and-forty, a bachelor, not making any merit of that renunciation,
2540: but saying laughingly, if any one alluded to it, that he made it an
2541: excuse for many indulgences which a wife would never have allowed him.
2542: And perhaps he was the only person in the world who did not think his
2543: sisters uninteresting and superfluous; for his was one of those
2544: large-hearted, sweet-blooded natures that never know a narrow or a
2545: grudging thought; Epicurean, if you will, with no enthusiasm, no
2546: self-scourging sense of duty; but yet, as you have seen, of a
2547: sufficiently subtle moral fibre to have an unwearying tenderness for
2548: obscure and monotonous suffering. It was his large-hearted indulgence
2549: that made him ignore his mother’s hardness towards her daughters, which
2550: was the more striking from its contrast with her doting fondness
2551: towards himself; he held it no virtue to frown at irremediable faults.
2552: 
2553: See the difference between the impression a man makes on you when you
2554: walk by his side in familiar talk, or look at him in his home, and the
2555: figure he makes when seen from a lofty historical level, or even in the
2556: eyes of a critical neighbour who thinks of him as an embodied system or
2557: opinion rather than as a man. Mr. Roe, the “travelling preacher”
2558: stationed at Treddleston, had included Mr. Irwine in a general
2559: statement concerning the Church clergy in the surrounding district,
2560: whom he described as men given up to the lusts of the flesh and the
2561: pride of life; hunting and shooting, and adorning their own houses;
2562: asking what shall we eat, and what shall we drink, and wherewithal
2563: shall we be clothed?—careless of dispensing the bread of life to their
2564: flocks, preaching at best but a carnal and soul-benumbing morality, and
2565: trafficking in the souls of men by receiving money for discharging the
2566: pastoral office in parishes where they did not so much as look on the
2567: faces of the people more than once a-year. The ecclesiastical
2568: historian, too, looking into parliamentary reports of that period,
2569: finds honourable members zealous for the Church, and untainted with any
2570: sympathy for the “tribe of canting Methodists,” making statements
2571: scarcely less melancholy than that of Mr. Roe. And it is impossible for
2572: me to say that Mr. Irwine was altogether belied by the generic
2573: classification assigned him. He really had no very lofty aims, no
2574: theological enthusiasm: if I were closely questioned, I should be
2575: obliged to confess that he felt no serious alarms about the souls of
2576: his parishioners, and would have thought it a mere loss of time to talk
2577: in a doctrinal and awakening manner to old “Feyther Taft,” or even to
2578: Chad Cranage the blacksmith. If he had been in the habit of speaking
2579: theoretically, he would perhaps have said that the only healthy form
2580: religion could take in such minds was that of certain dim but strong
2581: emotions, suffusing themselves as a hallowing influence over the family
2582: affections and neighbourly duties. He thought the custom of baptism
2583: more important than its doctrine, and that the religious benefits the
2584: peasant drew from the church where his fathers worshipped and the
2585: sacred piece of turf where they lay buried were but slightly dependent
2586: on a clear understanding of the Liturgy or the sermon. Clearly the
2587: rector was not what is called in these days an “earnest” man: he was
2588: fonder of church history than of divinity, and had much more insight
2589: into men’s characters than interest in their opinions; he was neither
2590: laborious, nor obviously self-denying, nor very copious in alms-giving,
2591: and his theology, you perceive, was lax. His mental palate, indeed, was
2592: rather pagan, and found a savouriness in a quotation from Sophocles or
2593: Theocritus that was quite absent from any text in Isaiah or Amos. But
2594: if you feed your young setter on raw flesh, how can you wonder at its
2595: retaining a relish for uncooked partridge in after-life? And Mr.
2596: Irwine’s recollections of young enthusiasm and ambition were all
2597: associated with poetry and ethics that lay aloof from the Bible.
2598: 
2599: On the other hand, I must plead, for I have an affectionate partiality
2600: towards the rector’s memory, that he was not vindictive—and some
2601: philanthropists have been so; that he was not intolerant—and there is a
2602: rumour that some zealous theologians have not been altogether free from
2603: that blemish; that although he would probably have declined to give his
2604: body to be burned in any public cause, and was far from bestowing all
2605: his goods to feed the poor, he had that charity which has sometimes
2606: been lacking to very illustrious virtue—he was tender to other men’s
2607: failings, and unwilling to impute evil. He was one of those men, and
2608: they are not the commonest, of whom we can know the best only by
2609: following them away from the marketplace, the platform, and the pulpit,
2610: entering with them into their own homes, hearing the voice with which
2611: they speak to the young and aged about their own hearthstone, and
2612: witnessing their thoughtful care for the everyday wants of everyday
2613: companions, who take all their kindness as a matter of course, and not
2614: as a subject for panegyric.
2615: 
2616: Such men, happily, have lived in times when great abuses flourished,
2617: and have sometimes even been the living representatives of the abuses.
2618: That is a thought which might comfort us a little under the opposite
2619: fact—that it is better sometimes _not_ to follow great reformers of
2620: abuses beyond the threshold of their homes.
2621: 
2622: But whatever you may think of Mr. Irwine now, if you had met him that
2623: June afternoon riding on his grey cob, with his dogs running beside
2624: him—portly, upright, manly, with a good-natured smile on his finely
2625: turned lips as he talked to his dashing young companion on the bay
2626: mare, you must have felt that, however ill he harmonized with sound
2627: theories of the clerical office, he somehow harmonized extremely well
2628: with that peaceful landscape.
2629: 
2630: See them in the bright sunlight, interrupted every now and then by
2631: rolling masses of cloud, ascending the slope from the Broxton side,
2632: where the tall gables and elms of the rectory predominate over the tiny
2633: whitewashed church. They will soon be in the parish of Hayslope; the
2634: grey church-tower and village roofs lie before them to the left, and
2635: farther on, to the right, they can just see the chimneys of the Hall
2636: Farm.
2637: 
2638: 
2639: 
2640: 
2641: Chapter VI
2642: The Hall Farm
2643: 
2644: 
2645: Evidently that gate is never opened, for the long grass and the great
2646: hemlocks grow close against it, and if it were opened, it is so rusty
2647: that the force necessary to turn it on its hinges would be likely to
2648: pull down the square stone-built pillars, to the detriment of the two
2649: stone lionesses which grin with a doubtful carnivorous affability above
2650: a coat of arms surmounting each of the pillars. It would be easy
2651: enough, by the aid of the nicks in the stone pillars, to climb over the
2652: brick wall with its smooth stone coping; but by putting our eyes close
2653: to the rusty bars of the gate, we can see the house well enough, and
2654: all but the very corners of the grassy enclosure.
2655: 
2656: It is a very fine old place, of red brick, softened by a pale powdery
2657: lichen, which has dispersed itself with happy irregularity, so as to
2658: bring the red brick into terms of friendly companionship with the
2659: limestone ornaments surrounding the three gables, the windows, and the
2660: door-place. But the windows are patched with wooden panes, and the
2661: door, I think, is like the gate—it is never opened. How it would groan
2662: and grate against the stone floor if it were! For it is a solid, heavy,
2663: handsome door, and must once have been in the habit of shutting with a
2664: sonorous bang behind a liveried lackey, who had just seen his master
2665: and mistress off the grounds in a carriage and pair.
2666: 
2667: But at present one might fancy the house in the early stage of a
2668: chancery suit, and that the fruit from that grand double row of
2669: walnut-trees on the right hand of the enclosure would fall and rot
2670: among the grass, if it were not that we heard the booming bark of dogs
2671: echoing from great buildings at the back. And now the half-weaned
2672: calves that have been sheltering themselves in a gorse-built hovel
2673: against the left-hand wall come out and set up a silly answer to that
2674: terrible bark, doubtless supposing that it has reference to buckets of
2675: milk.
2676: 
2677: Yes, the house must be inhabited, and we will see by whom; for
2678: imagination is a licensed trespasser: it has no fear of dogs, but may
2679: climb over walls and peep in at windows with impunity. Put your face to
2680: one of the glass panes in the right-hand window: what do you see? A
2681: large open fireplace, with rusty dogs in it, and a bare boarded floor;
2682: at the far end, fleeces of wool stacked up; in the middle of the floor,
2683: some empty corn-bags. That is the furniture of the dining-room. And
2684: what through the left-hand window? Several clothes-horses, a pillion, a
2685: spinning-wheel, and an old box wide open and stuffed full of coloured
2686: rags. At the edge of this box there lies a great wooden doll, which, so
2687: far as mutilation is concerned, bears a strong resemblance to the
2688: finest Greek sculpture, and especially in the total loss of its nose.
2689: Near it there is a little chair, and the butt end of a boy’s leather
2690: long-lashed whip.
2691: 
2692: The history of the house is plain now. It was once the residence of a
2693: country squire, whose family, probably dwindling down to mere
2694: spinsterhood, got merged in the more territorial name of Donnithorne.
2695: It was once the Hall; it is now the Hall Farm. Like the life in some
2696: coast town that was once a watering-place, and is now a port, where the
2697: genteel streets are silent and grass-grown, and the docks and
2698: warehouses busy and resonant, the life at the Hall has changed its
2699: focus, and no longer radiates from the parlour, but from the kitchen
2700: and the farmyard.
2701: 
2702: Plenty of life there, though this is the drowsiest time of the year,
2703: just before hay-harvest; and it is the drowsiest time of the day too,
2704: for it is close upon three by the sun, and it is half-past three by
2705: Mrs. Poyser’s handsome eight-day clock. But there is always a stronger
2706: sense of life when the sun is brilliant after rain; and now he is
2707: pouring down his beams, and making sparkles among the wet straw, and
2708: lighting up every patch of vivid green moss on the red tiles of the
2709: cow-shed, and turning even the muddy water that is hurrying along the
2710: channel to the drain into a mirror for the yellow-billed ducks, who are
2711: seizing the opportunity of getting a drink with as much body in it as
2712: possible. There is quite a concert of noises; the great bull-dog,
2713: chained against the stables, is thrown into furious exasperation by the
2714: unwary approach of a cock too near the mouth of his kennel, and sends
2715: forth a thundering bark, which is answered by two fox-hounds shut up in
2716: the opposite cow-house; the old top-knotted hens, scratching with their
2717: chicks among the straw, set up a sympathetic croaking as the
2718: discomfited cock joins them; a sow with her brood, all very muddy as to
2719: the legs, and curled as to the tail, throws in some deep staccato
2720: notes; our friends the calves are bleating from the home croft; and,
2721: under all, a fine ear discerns the continuous hum of human voices.
2722: 
2723: For the great barn-doors are thrown wide open, and men are busy there
2724: mending the harness, under the superintendence of Mr. Goby, the
2725: “whittaw,” otherwise saddler, who entertains them with the latest
2726: Treddleston gossip. It is certainly rather an unfortunate day that
2727: Alick, the shepherd, has chosen for having the whittaws, since the
2728: morning turned out so wet; and Mrs. Poyser has spoken her mind pretty
2729: strongly as to the dirt which the extra number of men’s shoes brought
2730: into the house at dinnertime. Indeed, she has not yet recovered her
2731: equanimity on the subject, though it is now nearly three hours since
2732: dinner, and the house-floor is perfectly clean again; as clean as
2733: everything else in that wonderful house-place, where the only chance of
2734: collecting a few grains of dust would be to climb on the salt-coffer,
2735: and put your finger on the high mantel-shelf on which the glittering
2736: brass candlesticks are enjoying their summer sinecure; for at this time
2737: of year, of course, every one goes to bed while it is yet light, or at
2738: least light enough to discern the outline of objects after you have
2739: bruised your shins against them. Surely nowhere else could an oak
2740: clock-case and an oak table have got to such a polish by the hand:
2741: genuine “elbow polish,” as Mrs. Poyser called it, for she thanked God
2742: she never had any of your varnished rubbish in her house. Hetty Sorrel
2743: often took the opportunity, when her aunt’s back was turned, of looking
2744: at the pleasing reflection of herself in those polished surfaces, for
2745: the oak table was usually turned up like a screen, and was more for
2746: ornament than for use; and she could see herself sometimes in the great
2747: round pewter dishes that were ranged on the shelves above the long deal
2748: dinner-table, or in the hobs of the grate, which always shone like
2749: jasper.
2750: 
2751: Everything was looking at its brightest at this moment, for the sun
2752: shone right on the pewter dishes, and from their reflecting surfaces
2753: pleasant jets of light were thrown on mellow oak and bright brass—and
2754: on a still pleasanter object than these, for some of the rays fell on
2755: Dinah’s finely moulded cheek, and lit up her pale red hair to auburn,
2756: as she bent over the heavy household linen which she was mending for
2757: her aunt. No scene could have been more peaceful, if Mrs. Poyser, who
2758: was ironing a few things that still remained from the Monday’s wash,
2759: had not been making a frequent clinking with her iron and moving to and
2760: fro whenever she wanted it to cool; carrying the keen glance of her
2761: blue-grey eye from the kitchen to the dairy, where Hetty was making up
2762: the butter, and from the dairy to the back kitchen, where Nancy was
2763: taking the pies out of the oven. Do not suppose, however, that Mrs.
2764: Poyser was elderly or shrewish in her appearance; she was a
2765: good-looking woman, not more than eight-and-thirty, of fair complexion
2766: and sandy hair, well-shapen, light-footed. The most conspicuous article
2767: in her attire was an ample checkered linen apron, which almost covered
2768: her skirt; and nothing could be plainer or less noticeable than her cap
2769: and gown, for there was no weakness of which she was less tolerant than
2770: feminine vanity, and the preference of ornament to utility. The family
2771: likeness between her and her niece Dinah Morris, with the contrast
2772: between her keenness and Dinah’s seraphic gentleness of expression,
2773: might have served a painter as an excellent suggestion for a Martha and
2774: Mary. Their eyes were just of the same colour, but a striking test of
2775: the difference in their operation was seen in the demeanour of Trip,
2776: the black-and-tan terrier, whenever that much-suspected dog unwarily
2777: exposed himself to the freezing arctic ray of Mrs. Poyser’s glance. Her
2778: tongue was not less keen than her eye, and, whenever a damsel came
2779: within earshot, seemed to take up an unfinished lecture, as a
2780: barrel-organ takes up a tune, precisely at the point where it had left
2781: off.
2782: 
2783: The fact that it was churning day was another reason why it was
2784: inconvenient to have the whittaws, and why, consequently, Mrs. Poyser
2785: should scold Molly the housemaid with unusual severity. To all
2786: appearance Molly had got through her after-dinner work in an exemplary
2787: manner, had “cleaned herself” with great dispatch, and now came to ask,
2788: submissively, if she should sit down to her spinning till milking time.
2789: But this blameless conduct, according to Mrs. Poyser, shrouded a secret
2790: indulgence of unbecoming wishes, which she now dragged forth and held
2791: up to Molly’s view with cutting eloquence.
2792: 
2793: “Spinning, indeed! It isn’t spinning as you’d be at, I’ll be bound, and
2794: let you have your own way. I never knew your equals for gallowsness. To
2795: think of a gell o’ your age wanting to go and sit with half-a-dozen
2796: men! I’d ha’ been ashamed to let the words pass over my lips if I’d
2797: been you. And you, as have been here ever since last Michaelmas, and I
2798: hired you at Treddles’on stattits, without a bit o’ character—as I say,
2799: you might be grateful to be hired in that way to a respectable place;
2800: and you knew no more o’ what belongs to work when you come here than
2801: the mawkin i’ the field. As poor a two-fisted thing as ever I saw, you
2802: know you was. Who taught you to scrub a floor, I should like to know?
2803: Why, you’d leave the dirt in heaps i’ the corners—anybody ’ud think
2804: you’d never been brought up among Christians. And as for spinning, why,
2805: you’ve wasted as much as your wage i’ the flax you’ve spoiled learning
2806: to spin. And you’ve a right to feel that, and not to go about as gaping
2807: and as thoughtless as if you was beholding to nobody. Comb the wool for
2808: the whittaws, indeed! That’s what you’d like to be doing, is it? That’s
2809: the way with you—that’s the road you’d all like to go, headlongs to
2810: ruin. You’re never easy till you’ve got some sweetheart as is as big a
2811: fool as yourself: you think you’ll be finely off when you’re married, I
2812: daresay, and have got a three-legged stool to sit on, and never a
2813: blanket to cover you, and a bit o’ oat-cake for your dinner, as three
2814: children are a-snatching at.”
2815: 
2816: “I’m sure I donna want t’ go wi’ the whittaws,” said Molly, whimpering,
2817: and quite overcome by this Dantean picture of her future, “on’y we
2818: allays used to comb the wool for ’n at Mester Ottley’s; an’ so I just
2819: axed ye. I donna want to set eyes on the whittaws again; I wish I may
2820: never stir if I do.”
2821: 
2822: “Mr. Ottley’s, indeed! It’s fine talking o’ what you did at Mr.
2823: Ottley’s. Your missis there might like her floors dirted wi’ whittaws
2824: for what I know. There’s no knowing what people _wonna_ like—such ways
2825: as I’ve heard of! I never had a gell come into my house as seemed to
2826: know what cleaning was; I think people live like pigs, for my part. And
2827: as to that Betty as was dairymaid at Trent’s before she come to me,
2828: she’d ha’ left the cheeses without turning from week’s end to week’s
2829: end, and the dairy thralls, I might ha’ wrote my name on ’em, when I
2830: come downstairs after my illness, as the doctor said it was
2831: inflammation—it was a mercy I got well of it. And to think o’ your
2832: knowing no better, Molly, and been here a-going i’ nine months, and not
2833: for want o’ talking to, neither—and what are you stanning there for,
2834: like a jack as is run down, instead o’ getting your wheel out? You’re a
2835: rare un for sitting down to your work a little while after it’s time to
2836: put by.”
2837: 
2838: “Munny, my iron’s twite told; pease put it down to warm.”
2839: 
2840: The small chirruping voice that uttered this request came from a little
2841: sunny-haired girl between three and four, who, seated on a high chair
2842: at the end of the ironing table, was arduously clutching the handle of
2843: a miniature iron with her tiny fat fist, and ironing rags with an
2844: assiduity that required her to put her little red tongue out as far as
2845: anatomy would allow.
2846: 
2847: “Cold, is it, my darling? Bless your sweet face!” said Mrs. Poyser, who
2848: was remarkable for the facility with which she could relapse from her
2849: official objurgatory to one of fondness or of friendly converse. “Never
2850: mind! Mother’s done her ironing now. She’s going to put the ironing
2851: things away.”
2852: 
2853: “Munny, I tould ’ike to do into de barn to Tommy, to see de whittawd.”
2854: 
2855: “No, no, no; Totty ’ud get her feet wet,” said Mrs. Poyser, carrying
2856: away her iron. “Run into the dairy and see cousin Hetty make the
2857: butter.”
2858: 
2859: “I tould ’ike a bit o’ pum-take,” rejoined Totty, who seemed to be
2860: provided with several relays of requests; at the same time, taking the
2861: opportunity of her momentary leisure to put her fingers into a bowl of
2862: starch, and drag it down so as to empty the contents with tolerable
2863: completeness on to the ironing sheet.
2864: 
2865: “Did ever anybody see the like?” screamed Mrs. Poyser, running towards
2866: the table when her eye had fallen on the blue stream. “The child’s
2867: allays i’ mischief if your back’s turned a minute. What shall I do to
2868: you, you naughty, naughty gell?”
2869: 
2870: Totty, however, had descended from her chair with great swiftness, and
2871: was already in retreat towards the dairy with a sort of waddling run,
2872: and an amount of fat on the nape of her neck which made her look like
2873: the metamorphosis of a white suckling pig.
2874: 
2875: The starch having been wiped up by Molly’s help, and the ironing
2876: apparatus put by, Mrs. Poyser took up her knitting which always lay
2877: ready at hand, and was the work she liked best, because she could carry
2878: it on automatically as she walked to and fro. But now she came and sat
2879: down opposite Dinah, whom she looked at in a meditative way, as she
2880: knitted her grey worsted stocking.
2881: 
2882: “You look th’ image o’ your Aunt Judith, Dinah, when you sit a-sewing.
2883: I could almost fancy it was thirty years back, and I was a little gell
2884: at home, looking at Judith as she sat at her work, after she’d done the
2885: house up; only it was a little cottage, Father’s was, and not a big
2886: rambling house as gets dirty i’ one corner as fast as you clean it in
2887: another—but for all that, I could fancy you was your Aunt Judith, only
2888: her hair was a deal darker than yours, and she was stouter and broader
2889: i’ the shoulders. Judith and me allays hung together, though she had
2890: such queer ways, but your mother and her never could agree. Ah, your
2891: mother little thought as she’d have a daughter just cut out after the
2892: very pattern o’ Judith, and leave her an orphan, too, for Judith to
2893: take care on, and bring up with a spoon when _she_ was in the graveyard
2894: at Stoniton. I allays said that o’ Judith, as she’d bear a pound weight
2895: any day to save anybody else carrying a ounce. And she was just the
2896: same from the first o’ my remembering her; it made no difference in
2897: her, as I could see, when she took to the Methodists, only she talked a
2898: bit different and wore a different sort o’ cap; but she’d never in her
2899: life spent a penny on herself more than keeping herself decent.”
2900: 
2901: “She was a blessed woman,” said Dinah; “God had given her a loving,
2902: self-forgetting nature, and He perfected it by grace. And she was very
2903: fond of you too, Aunt Rachel. I often heard her talk of you in the same
2904: sort of way. When she had that bad illness, and I was only eleven years
2905: old, she used to say, ‘You’ll have a friend on earth in your Aunt
2906: Rachel, if I’m taken from you, for she has a kind heart,’ and I’m sure
2907: I’ve found it so.”
2908: 
2909: “I don’t know how, child; anybody ’ud be cunning to do anything for
2910: you, I think; you’re like the birds o’ th’ air, and live nobody knows
2911: how. I’d ha’ been glad to behave to you like a mother’s sister, if
2912: you’d come and live i’ this country where there’s some shelter and
2913: victual for man and beast, and folks don’t live on the naked hills,
2914: like poultry a-scratching on a gravel bank. And then you might get
2915: married to some decent man, and there’d be plenty ready to have you, if
2916: you’d only leave off that preaching, as is ten times worse than
2917: anything your Aunt Judith ever did. And even if you’d marry Seth Bede,
2918: as is a poor wool-gathering Methodist and’s never like to have a penny
2919: beforehand, I know your uncle ’ud help you with a pig, and very like a
2920: cow, for he’s allays been good-natur’d to my kin, for all they’re poor,
2921: and made ’em welcome to the house; and ’ud do for you, I’ll be bound,
2922: as much as ever he’d do for Hetty, though she’s his own niece. And
2923: there’s linen in the house as I could well spare you, for I’ve got lots
2924: o’ sheeting and table-clothing, and towelling, as isn’t made up.
2925: There’s a piece o’ sheeting I could give you as that squinting Kitty
2926: spun—she was a rare girl to spin, for all she squinted, and the
2927: children couldn’t abide her; and, you know, the spinning’s going on
2928: constant, and there’s new linen wove twice as fast as the old wears
2929: out. But where’s the use o’ talking, if ye wonna be persuaded, and
2930: settle down like any other woman in her senses, i’stead o’ wearing
2931: yourself out with walking and preaching, and giving away every penny
2932: you get, so as you’ve nothing saved against sickness; and all the
2933: things you’ve got i’ the world, I verily believe, ’ud go into a bundle
2934: no bigger nor a double cheese. And all because you’ve got notions i’
2935: your head about religion more nor what’s i’ the Catechism and the
2936: Prayer-book.”
2937: 
2938: “But not more than what’s in the Bible, Aunt,” said Dinah.
2939: 
2940: “Yes, and the Bible too, for that matter,” Mrs. Poyser rejoined, rather
2941: sharply; “else why shouldn’t them as know best what’s in the Bible—the
2942: parsons and people as have got nothing to do but learn it—do the same
2943: as you do? But, for the matter o’ that, if everybody was to do like
2944: you, the world must come to a standstill; for if everybody tried to do
2945: without house and home, and with poor eating and drinking, and was
2946: allays talking as we must despise the things o’ the world as you say, I
2947: should like to know where the pick o’ the stock, and the corn, and the
2948: best new-milk cheeses ’ud have to go. Everybody ’ud be wanting bread
2949: made o’ tail ends and everybody ’ud be running after everybody else to
2950: preach to ’em, istead o’ bringing up their families, and laying by
2951: against a bad harvest. It stands to sense as that can’t be the right
2952: religion.”
2953: 
2954: “Nay, dear aunt, you never heard me say that all people are called to
2955: forsake their work and their families. It’s quite right the land should
2956: be ploughed and sowed, and the precious corn stored, and the things of
2957: this life cared for, and right that people should rejoice in their
2958: families, and provide for them, so that this is done in the fear of the
2959: Lord, and that they are not unmindful of the soul’s wants while they
2960: are caring for the body. We can all be servants of God wherever our lot
2961: is cast, but He gives us different sorts of work, according as He fits
2962: us for it and calls us to it. I can no more help spending my life in
2963: trying to do what I can for the souls of others, than you could help
2964: running if you heard little Totty crying at the other end of the house;
2965: the voice would go to your heart, you would think the dear child was in
2966: trouble or in danger, and you couldn’t rest without running to help her
2967: and comfort her.”
2968: 
2969: “Ah,” said Mrs. Poyser, rising and walking towards the door, “I know it
2970: ’ud be just the same if I was to talk to you for hours. You’d make me
2971: the same answer, at th’ end. I might as well talk to the running brook
2972: and tell it to stan’ still.”
2973: 
2974: The causeway outside the kitchen door was dry enough now for Mrs.
2975: Poyser to stand there quite pleasantly and see what was going on in the
2976: yard, the grey worsted stocking making a steady progress in her hands
2977: all the while. But she had not been standing there more than five
2978: minutes before she came in again, and said to Dinah, in rather a
2979: flurried, awe-stricken tone, “If there isn’t Captain Donnithorne and
2980: Mr. Irwine a-coming into the yard! I’ll lay my life they’re come to
2981: speak about your preaching on the Green, Dinah; it’s you must answer
2982: ’em, for I’m dumb. I’ve said enough a’ready about your bringing such
2983: disgrace upo’ your uncle’s family. I wouldn’t ha’ minded if you’d been
2984: Mr. Poyser’s own niece—folks must put up wi’ their own kin, as they put
2985: up wi’ their own noses—it’s their own flesh and blood. But to think of
2986: a niece o’ mine being cause o’ my husband’s being turned out of his
2987: farm, and me brought him no fortin but my savin’s——”
2988: 
2989: “Nay, dear Aunt Rachel,” said Dinah gently, “you’ve no cause for such
2990: fears. I’ve strong assurance that no evil will happen to you and my
2991: uncle and the children from anything I’ve done. I didn’t preach without
2992: direction.”
2993: 
2994: “Direction! I know very well what you mean by direction,” said Mrs.
2995: Poyser, knitting in a rapid and agitated manner. “When there’s a bigger
2996: maggot than usual in your head you call it ‘direction’; and then
2997: nothing can stir you—you look like the statty o’ the outside o’
2998: Treddles’on church, a-starin’ and a-smilin’ whether it’s fair weather
2999: or foul. I hanna common patience with you.”
3000: 
3001: By this time the two gentlemen had reached the palings and had got down
3002: from their horses: it was plain they meant to come in. Mrs. Poyser
3003: advanced to the door to meet them, curtsying low and trembling between
3004: anger with Dinah and anxiety to conduct herself with perfect propriety
3005: on the occasion. For in those days the keenest of bucolic minds felt a
3006: whispering awe at the sight of the gentry, such as of old men felt when
3007: they stood on tiptoe to watch the gods passing by in tall human shape.
3008: 
3009: “Well, Mrs. Poyser, how are you after this stormy morning?” said Mr.
3010: Irwine, with his stately cordiality. “Our feet are quite dry; we shall
3011: not soil your beautiful floor.”
3012: 
3013: “Oh, sir, don’t mention it,” said Mrs. Poyser. “Will you and the
3014: captain please to walk into the parlour?”
3015: 
3016: “No, indeed, thank you, Mrs. Poyser,” said the captain, looking eagerly
3017: round the kitchen, as if his eye were seeking something it could not
3018: find. “I delight in your kitchen. I think it is the most charming room
3019: I know. I should like every farmer’s wife to come and look at it for a
3020: pattern.”
3021: 
3022: “Oh, you’re pleased to say so, sir. Pray take a seat,” said Mrs.
3023: Poyser, relieved a little by this compliment and the captain’s evident
3024: good-humour, but still glancing anxiously at Mr. Irwine, who, she saw,
3025: was looking at Dinah and advancing towards her.
3026: 
3027: “Poyser is not at home, is he?” said Captain Donnithorne, seating
3028: himself where he could see along the short passage to the open
3029: dairy-door.
3030: 
3031: “No, sir, he isn’t; he’s gone to Rosseter to see Mr. West, the factor,
3032: about the wool. But there’s Father i’ the barn, sir, if he’d be of any
3033: use.”
3034: 
3035: “No, thank you; I’ll just look at the whelps and leave a message about
3036: them with your shepherd. I must come another day and see your husband;
3037: I want to have a consultation with him about horses. Do you know when
3038: he’s likely to be at liberty?”
3039: 
3040: “Why, sir, you can hardly miss him, except it’s o’ Treddles’on
3041: market-day—that’s of a Friday, you know. For if he’s anywhere on the
3042: farm we can send for him in a minute. If we’d got rid o’ the
3043: Scantlands, we should have no outlying fields; and I should be glad of
3044: it, for if ever anything happens, he’s sure to be gone to the
3045: Scantlands. Things allays happen so contrairy, if they’ve a chance; and
3046: it’s an unnat’ral thing to have one bit o’ your farm in one county and
3047: all the rest in another.”
3048: 
3049: “Ah, the Scantlands would go much better with Choyce’s farm, especially
3050: as he wants dairyland and you’ve got plenty. I think yours is the
3051: prettiest farm on the estate, though; and do you know, Mrs. Poyser, if
3052: I were going to marry and settle, I should be tempted to turn you out,
3053: and do up this fine old house, and turn farmer myself.”
3054: 
3055: “Oh, sir,” said Mrs. Poyser, rather alarmed, “you wouldn’t like it at
3056: all. As for farming, it’s putting money into your pocket wi’ your right
3057: hand and fetching it out wi’ your left. As fur as I can see, it’s
3058: raising victual for other folks and just getting a mouthful for
3059: yourself and your children as you go along. Not as you’d be like a poor
3060: man as wants to get his bread—you could afford to lose as much money as
3061: you liked i’ farming—but it’s poor fun losing money, I should think,
3062: though I understan’ it’s what the great folks i’ London play at more
3063: than anything. For my husband heard at market as Lord Dacey’s eldest
3064: son had lost thousands upo’ thousands to the Prince o’ Wales, and they
3065: said my lady was going to pawn her jewels to pay for him. But you know
3066: more about that than I do, sir. But, as for farming, sir, I canna think
3067: as you’d like it; and this house—the draughts in it are enough to cut
3068: you through, and it’s my opinion the floors upstairs are very rotten,
3069: and the rats i’ the cellar are beyond anything.”
3070: 
3071: “Why, that’s a terrible picture, Mrs. Poyser. I think I should be doing
3072: you a service to turn you out of such a place. But there’s no chance of
3073: that. I’m not likely to settle for the next twenty years, till I’m a
3074: stout gentleman of forty; and my grandfather would never consent to
3075: part with such good tenants as you.”
3076: 
3077: “Well, sir, if he thinks so well o’ Mr. Poyser for a tenant I wish you
3078: could put in a word for him to allow us some new gates for the Five
3079: closes, for my husband’s been asking and asking till he’s tired, and to
3080: think o’ what he’s done for the farm, and’s never had a penny allowed
3081: him, be the times bad or good. And as I’ve said to my husband often and
3082: often, I’m sure if the captain had anything to do with it, it wouldn’t
3083: be so. Not as I wish to speak disrespectful o’ them as have got the
3084: power i’ their hands, but it’s more than flesh and blood ’ull bear
3085: sometimes, to be toiling and striving, and up early and down late, and
3086: hardly sleeping a wink when you lie down for thinking as the cheese may
3087: swell, or the cows may slip their calf, or the wheat may grow green
3088: again i’ the sheaf—and after all, at th’ end o’ the year, it’s like as
3089: if you’d been cooking a feast and had got the smell of it for your
3090: pains.”
3091: 
3092: Mrs. Poyser, once launched into conversation, always sailed along
3093: without any check from her preliminary awe of the gentry. The
3094: confidence she felt in her own powers of exposition was a motive force
3095: that overcame all resistance.
3096: 
3097: “I’m afraid I should only do harm instead of good, if I were to speak
3098: about the gates, Mrs. Poyser,” said the captain, “though I assure you
3099: there’s no man on the estate I would sooner say a word for than your
3100: husband. I know his farm is in better order than any other within ten
3101: miles of us; and as for the kitchen,” he added, smiling, “I don’t
3102: believe there’s one in the kingdom to beat it. By the by, I’ve never
3103: seen your dairy: I must see your dairy, Mrs. Poyser.”
3104: 
3105: “Indeed, sir, it’s not fit for you to go in, for Hetty’s in the middle
3106: o’ making the butter, for the churning was thrown late, and I’m quite
3107: ashamed.” This Mrs. Poyser said blushing, and believing that the
3108: captain was really interested in her milk-pans, and would adjust his
3109: opinion of her to the appearance of her dairy.
3110: 
3111: “Oh, I’ve no doubt it’s in capital order. Take me in,” said the
3112: captain, himself leading the way, while Mrs. Poyser followed.
3113:

3115: 
3116: 
3117: Chapter VII
3118: The Dairy
3119: 
3120: 
3121: The dairy was certainly worth looking at: it was a scene to sicken for
3122: with a sort of calenture in hot and dusty streets—such coolness, such
3123: purity, such fresh fragrance of new-pressed cheese, of firm butter, of
3124: wooden vessels perpetually bathed in pure water; such soft colouring of
3125: red earthenware and creamy surfaces, brown wood and polished tin, grey
3126: limestone and rich orange-red rust on the iron weights and hooks and
3127: hinges. But one gets only a confused notion of these details when they
3128: surround a distractingly pretty girl of seventeen, standing on little
3129: pattens and rounding her dimpled arm to lift a pound of butter out of
3130: the scale.
3131: 
3132: Hetty blushed a deep rose-colour when Captain Donnithorne entered the
3133: dairy and spoke to her; but it was not at all a distressed blush, for
3134: it was inwreathed with smiles and dimples, and with sparkles from under
3135: long, curled, dark eyelashes; and while her aunt was discoursing to him
3136: about the limited amount of milk that was to be spared for butter and
3137: cheese so long as the calves were not all weaned, and a large quantity
3138: but inferior quality of milk yielded by the shorthorn, which had been
3139: bought on experiment, together with other matters which must be
3140: interesting to a young gentleman who would one day be a landlord, Hetty
3141: tossed and patted her pound of butter with quite a self-possessed,
3142: coquettish air, slyly conscious that no turn of her head was lost.
3143: 
3144: There are various orders of beauty, causing men to make fools of
3145: themselves in various styles, from the desperate to the sheepish; but
3146: there is one order of beauty which seems made to turn the heads not
3147: only of men, but of all intelligent mammals, even of women. It is a
3148: beauty like that of kittens, or very small downy ducks making gentle
3149: rippling noises with their soft bills, or babies just beginning to
3150: toddle and to engage in conscious mischief—a beauty with which you can
3151: never be angry, but that you feel ready to crush for inability to
3152: comprehend the state of mind into which it throws you. Hetty Sorrel’s
3153: was that sort of beauty. Her aunt, Mrs. Poyser, who professed to
3154: despise all personal attractions and intended to be the severest of
3155: mentors, continually gazed at Hetty’s charms by the sly, fascinated in
3156: spite of herself; and after administering such a scolding as naturally
3157: flowed from her anxiety to do well by her husband’s niece—who had no
3158: mother of her own to scold her, poor thing!—she would often confess to
3159: her husband, when they were safe out of hearing, that she firmly
3160: believed, “the naughtier the little huzzy behaved, the prettier she
3161: looked.”
3162: 
3163: It is of little use for me to tell you that Hetty’s cheek was like a
3164: rose-petal, that dimples played about her pouting lips, that her large
3165: dark eyes hid a soft roguishness under their long lashes, and that her
3166: curly hair, though all pushed back under her round cap while she was at
3167: work, stole back in dark delicate rings on her forehead, and about her
3168: white shell-like ears; it is of little use for me to say how lovely was
3169: the contour of her pink-and-white neckerchief, tucked into her low
3170: plum-coloured stuff bodice, or how the linen butter-making apron, with
3171: its bib, seemed a thing to be imitated in silk by duchesses, since it
3172: fell in such charming lines, or how her brown stockings and thick-soled
3173: buckled shoes lost all that clumsiness which they must certainly have
3174: had when empty of her foot and ankle—of little use, unless you have
3175: seen a woman who affected you as Hetty affected her beholders, for
3176: otherwise, though you might conjure up the image of a lovely woman, she
3177: would not in the least resemble that distracting kittenlike maiden. I
3178: might mention all the divine charms of a bright spring day, but if you
3179: had never in your life utterly forgotten yourself in straining your
3180: eyes after the mounting lark, or in wandering through the still lanes
3181: when the fresh-opened blossoms fill them with a sacred silent beauty
3182: like that of fretted aisles, where would be the use of my descriptive
3183: catalogue? I could never make you know what I meant by a bright spring
3184: day. Hetty’s was a spring-tide beauty; it was the beauty of young
3185: frisking things, round-limbed, gambolling, circumventing you by a false
3186: air of innocence—the innocence of a young star-browed calf, for
3187: example, that, being inclined for a promenade out of bounds, leads you
3188: a severe steeplechase over hedge and ditch, and only comes to a stand
3189: in the middle of a bog.
3190: 
3191: And they are the prettiest attitudes and movements into which a pretty
3192: girl is thrown in making up butter—tossing movements that give a
3193: charming curve to the arm, and a sideward inclination of the round
3194: white neck; little patting and rolling movements with the palm of the
3195: hand, and nice adaptations and finishings which cannot at all be
3196: effected without a great play of the pouting mouth and the dark eyes.
3197: And then the butter itself seems to communicate a fresh charm—it is so
3198: pure, so sweet-scented; it is turned off the mould with such a
3199: beautiful firm surface, like marble in a pale yellow light! Moreover,
3200: Hetty was particularly clever at making up the butter; it was the one
3201: performance of hers that her aunt allowed to pass without severe
3202: criticism; so she handled it with all the grace that belongs to
3203: mastery.
3204: 
3205: “I hope you will be ready for a great holiday on the thirtieth of July,
3206: Mrs. Poyser,” said Captain Donnithorne, when he had sufficiently
3207: admired the dairy and given several improvised opinions on Swede
3208: turnips and shorthorns. “You know what is to happen then, and I shall
3209: expect you to be one of the guests who come earliest and leave latest.
3210: Will you promise me your hand for two dances, Miss Hetty? If I don’t
3211: get your promise now, I know I shall hardly have a chance, for all the
3212: smart young farmers will take care to secure you.”
3213: 
3214: Hetty smiled and blushed, but before she could answer, Mrs. Poyser
3215: interposed, scandalized at the mere suggestion that the young squire
3216: could be excluded by any meaner partners.
3217: 
3218: “Indeed, sir, you are very kind to take that notice of her. And I’m
3219: sure, whenever you’re pleased to dance with her, she’ll be proud and
3220: thankful, if she stood still all the rest o’ th’ evening.”
3221: 
3222: “Oh no, no, that would be too cruel to all the other young fellows who
3223: can dance. But you will promise me two dances, won’t you?” the captain
3224: continued, determined to make Hetty look at him and speak to him.
3225: 
3226: Hetty dropped the prettiest little curtsy, and stole a half-shy,
3227: half-coquettish glance at him as she said, “Yes, thank you, sir.”
3228: 
3229: “And you must bring all your children, you know, Mrs. Poyser; your
3230: little Totty, as well as the boys. I want all the youngest children on
3231: the estate to be there—all those who will be fine young men and women
3232: when I’m a bald old fellow.”
3233: 
3234: “Oh dear, sir, that ’ull be a long time first,” said Mrs. Poyser, quite
3235: overcome at the young squire’s speaking so lightly of himself, and
3236: thinking how her husband would be interested in hearing her recount
3237: this remarkable specimen of high-born humour. The captain was thought
3238: to be “very full of his jokes,” and was a great favourite throughout
3239: the estate on account of his free manners. Every tenant was quite sure
3240: things would be different when the reins got into his hands—there was
3241: to be a millennial abundance of new gates, allowances of lime, and
3242: returns of ten per cent.
3243: 
3244: “But where _is_ Totty to-day?” he said. “I want to see her.”
3245: 
3246: “Where is the little un, Hetty?” said Mrs. Poyser. “She came in here
3247: not long ago.”
3248: 
3249: “I don’t know. She went into the brewhouse to Nancy, I think.”
3250: 
3251: The proud mother, unable to resist the temptation to show her Totty,
3252: passed at once into the back kitchen, in search of her, not, however,
3253: without misgivings lest something should have happened to render her
3254: person and attire unfit for presentation.
3255: 
3256: “And do you carry the butter to market when you’ve made it?” said the
3257: Captain to Hetty, meanwhile.
3258: 
3259: “Oh no, sir; not when it’s so heavy. I’m not strong enough to carry it.
3260: Alick takes it on horseback.”
3261: 
3262: “No, I’m sure your pretty arms were never meant for such heavy weights.
3263: But you go out a walk sometimes these pleasant evenings, don’t you? Why
3264: don’t you have a walk in the Chase sometimes, now it’s so green and
3265: pleasant? I hardly ever see you anywhere except at home and at church.”
3266: 
3267: “Aunt doesn’t like me to go a-walking only when I’m going somewhere,”
3268: said Hetty. “But I go through the Chase sometimes.”
3269: 
3270: “And don’t you ever go to see Mrs. Best, the housekeeper? I think I saw
3271: you once in the housekeeper’s room.”
3272: 
3273: “It isn’t Mrs. Best, it’s Mrs. Pomfret, the lady’s maid, as I go to
3274: see. She’s teaching me tent-stitch and the lace-mending. I’m going to
3275: tea with her to-morrow afternoon.”
3276: 
3277: The reason why there had been space for this _tête-à-tête_ can only be
3278: known by looking into the back kitchen, where Totty had been discovered
3279: rubbing a stray blue-bag against her nose, and in the same moment
3280: allowing some liberal indigo drops to fall on her afternoon pinafore.
3281: But now she appeared holding her mother’s hand—the end of her round
3282: nose rather shiny from a recent and hurried application of soap and
3283: water.
3284: 
3285: “Here she is!” said the captain, lifting her up and setting her on the
3286: low stone shelf. “Here’s Totty! By the by, what’s her other name? She
3287: wasn’t christened Totty.”
3288: 
3289: “Oh, sir, we call her sadly out of her name. Charlotte’s her christened
3290: name. It’s a name i’ Mr. Poyser’s family: his grandmother was named
3291: Charlotte. But we began with calling her Lotty, and now it’s got to
3292: Totty. To be sure it’s more like a name for a dog than a Christian
3293: child.”
3294: 
3295: “Totty’s a capital name. Why, she looks like a Totty. Has she got a
3296: pocket on?” said the captain, feeling in his own waistcoat pockets.
3297: 
3298: Totty immediately with great gravity lifted up her frock, and showed a
3299: tiny pink pocket at present in a state of collapse.
3300: 
3301: “It dot notin’ in it,” she said, as she looked down at it very
3302: earnestly.
3303: 
3304: “No! What a pity! Such a pretty pocket. Well, I think I’ve got some
3305: things in mine that will make a pretty jingle in it. Yes! I declare
3306: I’ve got five little round silver things, and hear what a pretty noise
3307: they make in Totty’s pink pocket.” Here he shook the pocket with the
3308: five sixpences in it, and Totty showed her teeth and wrinkled her nose
3309: in great glee; but, divining that there was nothing more to be got by
3310: staying, she jumped off the shelf and ran away to jingle her pocket in
3311: the hearing of Nancy, while her mother called after her, “Oh for shame,
3312: you naughty gell! Not to thank the captain for what he’s given you I’m
3313: sure, sir, it’s very kind of you; but she’s spoiled shameful; her
3314: father won’t have her said nay in anything, and there’s no managing
3315: her. It’s being the youngest, and th’ only gell.”
3316: 
3317: “Oh, she’s a funny little fatty; I wouldn’t have her different. But I
3318: must be going now, for I suppose the rector is waiting for me.”
3319: 
3320: With a “good-bye,” a bright glance, and a bow to Hetty Arthur left the
3321: dairy. But he was mistaken in imagining himself waited for. The rector
3322: had been so much interested in his conversation with Dinah that he
3323: would not have chosen to close it earlier; and you shall hear now what
3324: they had been saying to each other.

3327: 
3328: 
3329: Chapter VIII
3330: A Vocation
3331: 
3332: 
3333: Dinah, who had risen when the gentlemen came in, but still kept hold of
3334: the sheet she was mending, curtsied respectfully when she saw Mr.
3335: Irwine looking at her and advancing towards her. He had never yet
3336: spoken to her, or stood face to face with her, and her first thought,
3337: as her eyes met his, was, “What a well-favoured countenance! Oh that
3338: the good seed might fall on that soil, for it would surely flourish.”
3339: The agreeable impression must have been mutual, for Mr. Irwine bowed to
3340: her with a benignant deference, which would have been equally in place
3341: if she had been the most dignified lady of his acquaintance.
3342: 
3343: “You are only a visitor in this neighbourhood, I think?” were his first
3344: words, as he seated himself opposite to her.
3345: 
3346: “No, sir, I come from Snowfield, in Stonyshire. But my aunt was very
3347: kind, wanting me to have rest from my work there, because I’d been ill,
3348: and she invited me to come and stay with her for a while.”
3349: 
3350: “Ah, I remember Snowfield very well; I once had occasion to go there.
3351: It’s a dreary bleak place. They were building a cotton-mill there; but
3352: that’s many years ago now. I suppose the place is a good deal changed
3353: by the employment that mill must have brought.”
3354: 
3355: “It _is_ changed so far as the mill has brought people there, who get a
3356: livelihood for themselves by working in it, and make it better for the
3357: tradesfolks. I work in it myself, and have reason to be grateful, for
3358: thereby I have enough and to spare. But it’s still a bleak place, as
3359: you say, sir—very different from this country.”
3360: 
3361: “You have relations living there, probably, so that you are attached to
3362: the place as your home?”
3363: 
3364: “I had an aunt there once; she brought me up, for I was an orphan. But
3365: she was taken away seven years ago, and I have no other kindred that I
3366: know of, besides my Aunt Poyser, who is very good to me, and would have
3367: me come and live in this country, which to be sure is a good land,
3368: wherein they eat bread without scarceness. But I’m not free to leave
3369: Snowfield, where I was first planted, and have grown deep into it, like
3370: the small grass on the hill-top.”
3371: 
3372: “Ah, I daresay you have many religious friends and companions there;
3373: you are a Methodist—a Wesleyan, I think?”
3374: 
3375: “Yes, my aunt at Snowfield belonged to the Society, and I have cause to
3376: be thankful for the privileges I have had thereby from my earliest
3377: childhood.”
3378: 
3379: “And have you been long in the habit of preaching? For I understand you
3380: preached at Hayslope last night.”
3381: 
3382: “I first took to the work four years since, when I was twenty-one.”
3383: 
3384: “Your Society sanctions women’s preaching, then?”
3385: 
3386: “It doesn’t forbid them, sir, when they’ve a clear call to the work,
3387: and when their ministry is owned by the conversion of sinners and the
3388: strengthening of God’s people. Mrs. Fletcher, as you may have heard
3389: about, was the first woman to preach in the Society, I believe, before
3390: she was married, when she was Miss Bosanquet; and Mr. Wesley approved
3391: of her undertaking the work. She had a great gift, and there are many
3392: others now living who are precious fellow-helpers in the work of the
3393: ministry. I understand there’s been voices raised against it in the
3394: Society of late, but I cannot but think their counsel will come to
3395: nought. It isn’t for men to make channels for God’s Spirit, as they
3396: make channels for the watercourses, and say, ‘Flow here, but flow not
3397: there.’”
3398: 
3399: “But don’t you find some danger among your people—I don’t mean to say
3400: that it is so with you, far from it—but don’t you find sometimes that
3401: both men and women fancy themselves channels for God’s Spirit, and are
3402: quite mistaken, so that they set about a work for which they are unfit
3403: and bring holy things into contempt?”
3404: 
3405: “Doubtless it is so sometimes; for there have been evil-doers among us
3406: who have sought to deceive the brethren, and some there are who deceive
3407: their own selves. But we are not without discipline and correction to
3408: put a check upon these things. There’s a very strict order kept among
3409: us, and the brethren and sisters watch for each other’s souls as they
3410: that must give account. They don’t go every one his own way and say,
3411: ‘Am I my brother’s keeper?’”
3412: 
3413: “But tell me—if I may ask, and I am really interested in knowing it—how
3414: you first came to think of preaching?”
3415: 
3416: “Indeed, sir, I didn’t think of it at all—I’d been used from the time I
3417: was sixteen to talk to the little children, and teach them, and
3418: sometimes I had had my heart enlarged to speak in class, and was much
3419: drawn out in prayer with the sick. But I had felt no call to preach,
3420: for when I’m not greatly wrought upon, I’m too much given to sit still
3421: and keep by myself. It seems as if I could sit silent all day long with
3422: the thought of God overflowing my soul—as the pebbles lie bathed in the
3423: Willow Brook. For thoughts are so great—aren’t they, sir? They seem to
3424: lie upon us like a deep flood; and it’s my besetment to forget where I
3425: am and everything about me, and lose myself in thoughts that I could
3426: give no account of, for I could neither make a beginning nor ending of
3427: them in words. That was my way as long as I can remember; but sometimes
3428: it seemed as if speech came to me without any will of my own, and words
3429: were given to me that came out as the tears come, because our hearts
3430: are full and we can’t help it. And those were always times of great
3431: blessing, though I had never thought it could be so with me before a
3432: congregation of people. But, sir, we are led on, like the little
3433: children, by a way that we know not. I was called to preach quite
3434: suddenly, and since then I have never been left in doubt about the work
3435: that was laid upon me.”
3436: 
3437: “But tell me the circumstances—just how it was, the very day you began
3438: to preach.”
3439: 
3440: “It was one Sunday I walked with brother Marlowe, who was an aged man,
3441: one of the local preachers, all the way to Hetton-Deeps—that’s a
3442: village where the people get their living by working in the lead-mines,
3443: and where there’s no church nor preacher, but they live like sheep
3444: without a shepherd. It’s better than twelve miles from Snowfield, so we
3445: set out early in the morning, for it was summertime; and I had a
3446: wonderful sense of the Divine love as we walked over the hills, where
3447: there’s no trees, you know, sir, as there is here, to make the sky look
3448: smaller, but you see the heavens stretched out like a tent, and you
3449: feel the everlasting arms around you. But before we got to Hetton,
3450: brother Marlowe was seized with a dizziness that made him afraid of
3451: falling, for he overworked himself sadly, at his years, in watching and
3452: praying, and walking so many miles to speak the Word, as well as
3453: carrying on his trade of linen-weaving. And when we got to the village,
3454: the people were expecting him, for he’d appointed the time and the
3455: place when he was there before, and such of them as cared to hear the
3456: Word of Life were assembled on a spot where the cottages was thickest,
3457: so as others might be drawn to come. But he felt as he couldn’t stand
3458: up to preach, and he was forced to lie down in the first of the
3459: cottages we came to. So I went to tell the people, thinking we’d go
3460: into one of the houses, and I would read and pray with them. But as I
3461: passed along by the cottages and saw the aged and trembling women at
3462: the doors, and the hard looks of the men, who seemed to have their eyes
3463: no more filled with the sight of the Sabbath morning than if they had
3464: been dumb oxen that never looked up to the sky, I felt a great movement
3465: in my soul, and I trembled as if I was shaken by a strong spirit
3466: entering into my weak body. And I went to where the little flock of
3467: people was gathered together, and stepped on the low wall that was
3468: built against the green hillside, and I spoke the words that were given
3469: to me abundantly. And they all came round me out of all the cottages,
3470: and many wept over their sins, and have since been joined to the Lord.
3471: That was the beginning of my preaching, sir, and I’ve preached ever
3472: since.”
3473: 
3474: Dinah had let her work fall during this narrative, which she uttered in
3475: her usual simple way, but with that sincere articulate, thrilling
3476: treble by which she always mastered her audience. She stooped now to
3477: gather up her sewing, and then went on with it as before. Mr. Irwine
3478: was deeply interested. He said to himself, “He must be a miserable prig
3479: who would act the pedagogue here: one might as well go and lecture the
3480: trees for growing in their own shape.”
3481: 
3482: “And you never feel any embarrassment from the sense of your youth—that
3483: you are a lovely young woman on whom men’s eyes are fixed?” he said
3484: aloud.
3485: 
3486: “No, I’ve no room for such feelings, and I don’t believe the people
3487: ever take notice about that. I think, sir, when God makes His presence
3488: felt through us, we are like the burning bush: Moses never took any
3489: heed what sort of bush it was—he only saw the brightness of the Lord.
3490: I’ve preached to as rough ignorant people as can be in the villages
3491: about Snowfield—men that looked very hard and wild—but they never said
3492: an uncivil word to me, and often thanked me kindly as they made way for
3493: me to pass through the midst of them.”
3494: 
3495: “_That_ I can believe—that I can well believe,” said Mr. Irwine,
3496: emphatically. “And what did you think of your hearers last night, now?
3497: Did you find them quiet and attentive?”
3498: 
3499: “Very quiet, sir, but I saw no signs of any great work upon them,
3500: except in a young girl named Bessy Cranage, towards whom my heart
3501: yearned greatly, when my eyes first fell on her blooming youth, given
3502: up to folly and vanity. I had some private talk and prayer with her
3503: afterwards, and I trust her heart is touched. But I’ve noticed that in
3504: these villages where the people lead a quiet life among the green
3505: pastures and the still waters, tilling the ground and tending the
3506: cattle, there’s a strange deadness to the Word, as different as can be
3507: from the great towns, like Leeds, where I once went to visit a holy
3508: woman who preaches there. It’s wonderful how rich is the harvest of
3509: souls up those high-walled streets, where you seemed to walk as in a
3510: prison-yard, and the ear is deafened with the sounds of worldly toil. I
3511: think maybe it is because the promise is sweeter when this life is so
3512: dark and weary, and the soul gets more hungry when the body is ill at
3513: ease.”
3514: 
3515: “Why, yes, our farm-labourers are not easily roused. They take life
3516: almost as slowly as the sheep and cows. But we have some intelligent
3517: workmen about here. I daresay you know the Bedes; Seth Bede, by the by,
3518: is a Methodist.”
3519: 
3520: “Yes, I know Seth well, and his brother Adam a little. Seth is a
3521: gracious young man—sincere and without offence; and Adam is like the
3522: patriarch Joseph, for his great skill and knowledge and the kindness he
3523: shows to his brother and his parents.”
3524: 
3525: “Perhaps you don’t know the trouble that has just happened to them?
3526: Their father, Matthias Bede, was drowned in the Willow Brook last
3527: night, not far from his own door. I’m going now to see Adam.”
3528: 
3529: “Ah, their poor aged mother!” said Dinah, dropping her hands and
3530: looking before her with pitying eyes, as if she saw the object of her
3531: sympathy. “She will mourn heavily, for Seth has told me she’s of an
3532: anxious, troubled heart. I must go and see if I can give her any help.”
3533: 
3534: As she rose and was beginning to fold up her work, Captain Donnithorne,
3535: having exhausted all plausible pretexts for remaining among the
3536: milk-pans, came out of the dairy, followed by Mrs. Poyser. Mr. Irwine
3537: now rose also, and, advancing towards Dinah, held out his hand, and
3538: said, “Good-bye. I hear you are going away soon; but this will not be
3539: the last visit you will pay your aunt—so we shall meet again, I hope.”
3540: 
3541: His cordiality towards Dinah set all Mrs. Poyser’s anxieties at rest,
3542: and her face was brighter than usual, as she said, “I’ve never asked
3543: after Mrs. Irwine and the Miss Irwines, sir; I hope they’re as well as
3544: usual.”
3545: 
3546: “Yes, thank you, Mrs. Poyser, except that Miss Anne has one of her bad
3547: headaches to-day. By the by, we all liked that nice cream-cheese you
3548: sent us—my mother especially.”
3549: 
3550: “I’m very glad, indeed, sir. It is but seldom I make one, but I
3551: remembered Mrs. Irwine was fond of ’em. Please to give my duty to her,
3552: and to Miss Kate and Miss Anne. They’ve never been to look at my
3553: poultry this long while, and I’ve got some beautiful speckled chickens,
3554: black and white, as Miss Kate might like to have some of amongst hers.”
3555: 
3556: “Well, I’ll tell her; she must come and see them. Good-bye,” said the
3557: rector, mounting his horse.
3558: 
3559: “Just ride slowly on, Irwine,” said Captain Donnithorne, mounting also.
3560: “I’ll overtake you in three minutes. I’m only going to speak to the
3561: shepherd about the whelps. Good-bye, Mrs. Poyser; tell your husband I
3562: shall come and have a long talk with him soon.”
3563: 
3564: Mrs. Poyser curtsied duly, and watched the two horses until they had
3565: disappeared from the yard, amidst great excitement on the part of the
3566: pigs and the poultry, and under the furious indignation of the
3567: bull-dog, who performed a Pyrrhic dance, that every moment seemed to
3568: threaten the breaking of his chain. Mrs. Poyser delighted in this noisy
3569: exit; it was a fresh assurance to her that the farm-yard was well
3570: guarded, and that no loiterers could enter unobserved; and it was not
3571: until the gate had closed behind the captain that she turned into the
3572: kitchen again, where Dinah stood with her bonnet in her hand, waiting
3573: to speak to her aunt, before she set out for Lisbeth Bede’s cottage.
3574: 
3575: Mrs. Poyser, however, though she noticed the bonnet, deferred remarking
3576: on it until she had disburdened herself of her surprise at Mr. Irwine’s
3577: behaviour.
3578: 
3579: “Why, Mr. Irwine wasn’t angry, then? What did he say to you, Dinah?
3580: Didn’t he scold you for preaching?”
3581: 
3582: “No, he was not at all angry; he was very friendly to me. I was quite
3583: drawn out to speak to him; I hardly know how, for I had always thought
3584: of him as a worldly Sadducee. But his countenance is as pleasant as the
3585: morning sunshine.”
3586: 
3587: “Pleasant! and what else did y’ expect to find him but pleasant?” said
3588: Mrs. Poyser impatiently, resuming her knitting. “I should think his
3589: countenance _is_ pleasant indeed! And him a gentleman born, and’s got a
3590: mother like a picter. You may go the country round and not find such
3591: another woman turned sixty-six. It’s summat-like to see such a man as
3592: that i’ the desk of a Sunday! As I say to Poyser, it’s like looking at
3593: a full crop o’ wheat, or a pasture with a fine dairy o’ cows in it; it
3594: makes you think the world’s comfortable-like. But as for such creaturs
3595: as you Methodisses run after, I’d as soon go to look at a lot o’
3596: bare-ribbed runts on a common. Fine folks they are to tell you what’s
3597: right, as look as if they’d never tasted nothing better than
3598: bacon-sword and sour-cake i’ their lives. But what did Mr. Irwine say
3599: to you about that fool’s trick o’ preaching on the Green?”
3600: 
3601: “He only said he’d heard of it; he didn’t seem to feel any displeasure
3602: about it. But, dear aunt, don’t think any more about that. He told me
3603: something that I’m sure will cause you sorrow, as it does me. Thias
3604: Bede was drowned last night in the Willow Brook, and I’m thinking that
3605: the aged mother will be greatly in need of comfort. Perhaps I can be of
3606: use to her, so I have fetched my bonnet and am going to set out.”
3607: 
3608: “Dear heart, dear heart! But you must have a cup o’ tea first, child,”
3609: said Mrs. Poyser, falling at once from the key of B with five sharps to
3610: the frank and genial C. “The kettle’s boiling—we’ll have it ready in a
3611: minute; and the young uns ’ull be in and wanting theirs directly. I’m
3612: quite willing you should go and see th’ old woman, for you’re one as is
3613: allays welcome in trouble, Methodist or no Methodist; but, for the
3614: matter o’ that, it’s the flesh and blood folks are made on as makes the
3615: difference. Some cheeses are made o’ skimmed milk and some o’ new milk,
3616: and it’s no matter what you call ’em, you may tell which is which by
3617: the look and the smell. But as to Thias Bede, he’s better out o’ the
3618: way nor in—God forgi’ me for saying so—for he’s done little this ten
3619: year but make trouble for them as belonged to him; and I think it ’ud
3620: be well for you to take a little bottle o’ rum for th’ old woman, for I
3621: daresay she’s got never a drop o’ nothing to comfort her inside. Sit
3622: down, child, and be easy, for you shan’t stir out till you’ve had a cup
3623: o’ tea, and so I tell you.”
3624: 
3625: During the latter part of this speech, Mrs. Poyser had been reaching
3626: down the tea-things from the shelves, and was on her way towards the
3627: pantry for the loaf (followed close by Totty, who had made her
3628: appearance on the rattling of the tea-cups), when Hetty came out of the
3629: dairy relieving her tired arms by lifting them up, and clasping her
3630: hands at the back of her head.
3631: 
3632: “Molly,” she said, rather languidly, “just run out and get me a bunch
3633: of dock-leaves: the butter’s ready to pack up now.”
3634: 
3635: “D’ you hear what’s happened, Hetty?” said her aunt.
3636: 
3637: “No; how should I hear anything?” was the answer, in a pettish tone.
3638: 
3639: “Not as you’d care much, I daresay, if you did hear; for you’re too
3640: feather-headed to mind if everybody was dead, so as you could stay
3641: upstairs a-dressing yourself for two hours by the clock. But anybody
3642: besides yourself ’ud mind about such things happening to them as think
3643: a deal more of you than you deserve. But Adam Bede and all his kin
3644: might be drownded for what you’d care—you’d be perking at the glass the
3645: next minute.”
3646: 
3647: “Adam Bede—drowned?” said Hetty, letting her arms fall and looking
3648: rather bewildered, but suspecting that her aunt was as usual
3649: exaggerating with a didactic purpose.
3650: 
3651: “No, my dear, no,” said Dinah kindly, for Mrs. Poyser had passed on to
3652: the pantry without deigning more precise information. “Not Adam. Adam’s
3653: father, the old man, is drowned. He was drowned last night in the
3654: Willow Brook. Mr. Irwine has just told me about it.”
3655: 
3656: “Oh, how dreadful!” said Hetty, looking serious, but not deeply
3657: affected; and as Molly now entered with the dock-leaves, she took them
3658: silently and returned to the dairy without asking further questions.
3659: 
3660: 
3661: 
3662: 
3663: Chapter IX
3664: Hetty’s World
3665: 
3666: 
3667: While she adjusted the broad leaves that set off the pale fragrant
3668: butter as the primrose is set off by its nest of green I am afraid
3669: Hetty was thinking a great deal more of the looks Captain Donnithorne
3670: had cast at her than of Adam and his troubles. Bright, admiring glances
3671: from a handsome young gentleman with white hands, a gold chain,
3672: occasional regimentals, and wealth and grandeur immeasurable—those were
3673: the warm rays that set poor Hetty’s heart vibrating and playing its
3674: little foolish tunes over and over again. We do not hear that Memnon’s
3675: statue gave forth its melody at all under the rushing of the mightiest
3676: wind, or in response to any other influence divine or human than
3677: certain short-lived sunbeams of morning; and we must learn to
3678: accommodate ourselves to the discovery that some of those cunningly
3679: fashioned instruments called human souls have only a very limited range
3680: of music, and will not vibrate in the least under a touch that fills
3681: others with tremulous rapture or quivering agony.
3682: 
3683: Hetty was quite used to the thought that people liked to look at her.
3684: She was not blind to the fact that young Luke Britton of Broxton came
3685: to Hayslope Church on a Sunday afternoon on purpose that he might see
3686: her; and that he would have made much more decided advances if her
3687: uncle Poyser, thinking but lightly of a young man whose father’s land
3688: was so foul as old Luke Britton’s, had not forbidden her aunt to
3689: encourage him by any civilities. She was aware, too, that Mr. Craig,
3690: the gardener at the Chase, was over head and ears in love with her, and
3691: had lately made unmistakable avowals in luscious strawberries and
3692: hyperbolical peas. She knew still better, that Adam Bede—tall, upright,
3693: clever, brave Adam Bede—who carried such authority with all the people
3694: round about, and whom her uncle was always delighted to see of an
3695: evening, saying that “Adam knew a fine sight more o’ the natur o’
3696: things than those as thought themselves his betters”—she knew that this
3697: Adam, who was often rather stern to other people and not much given to
3698: run after the lasses, could be made to turn pale or red any day by a
3699: word or a look from her. Hetty’s sphere of comparison was not large,
3700: but she couldn’t help perceiving that Adam was “something like” a man;
3701: always knew what to say about things, could tell her uncle how to prop
3702: the hovel, and had mended the churn in no time; knew, with only looking
3703: at it, the value of the chestnut-tree that was blown down, and why the
3704: damp came in the walls, and what they must do to stop the rats; and
3705: wrote a beautiful hand that you could read off, and could do figures in
3706: his head—a degree of accomplishment totally unknown among the richest
3707: farmers of that countryside. Not at all like that slouching Luke
3708: Britton, who, when she once walked with him all the way from Broxton to
3709: Hayslope, had only broken silence to remark that the grey goose had
3710: begun to lay. And as for Mr. Craig, the gardener, he was a sensible man
3711: enough, to be sure, but he was knock-kneed, and had a queer sort of
3712: sing-song in his talk; moreover, on the most charitable supposition, he
3713: must be far on the way to forty.
3714: 
3715: Hetty was quite certain her uncle wanted her to encourage Adam, and
3716: would be pleased for her to marry him. For those were times when there
3717: was no rigid demarcation of rank between the farmer and the respectable
3718: artisan, and on the home hearth, as well as in the public house, they
3719: might be seen taking their jug of ale together; the farmer having a
3720: latent sense of capital, and of weight in parish affairs, which
3721: sustained him under his conspicuous inferiority in conversation. Martin
3722: Poyser was not a frequenter of public houses, but he liked a friendly
3723: chat over his own home-brewed; and though it was pleasant to lay down
3724: the law to a stupid neighbour who had no notion how to make the best of
3725: his farm, it was also an agreeable variety to learn something from a
3726: clever fellow like Adam Bede. Accordingly, for the last three
3727: years—ever since he had superintended the building of the new barn—Adam
3728: had always been made welcome at the Hall Farm, especially of a winter
3729: evening, when the whole family, in patriarchal fashion, master and
3730: mistress, children and servants, were assembled in that glorious
3731: kitchen, at well-graduated distances from the blazing fire. And for the
3732: last two years, at least, Hetty had been in the habit of hearing her
3733: uncle say, “Adam Bede may be working for wage now, but he’ll be a
3734: master-man some day, as sure as I sit in this chair. Mester Burge is in
3735: the right on’t to want him to go partners and marry his daughter, if
3736: it’s true what they say; the woman as marries him ’ull have a good
3737: take, be’t Lady day or Michaelmas,” a remark which Mrs. Poyser always
3738: followed up with her cordial assent. “Ah,” she would say, “it’s all
3739: very fine having a ready-made rich man, but mayhappen he’ll be a
3740: ready-made fool; and it’s no use filling your pocket full o’ money if
3741: you’ve got a hole in the corner. It’ll do you no good to sit in a
3742: spring-cart o’ your own, if you’ve got a soft to drive you: he’ll soon
3743: turn you over into the ditch. I allays said I’d never marry a man as
3744: had got no brains; for where’s the use of a woman having brains of her
3745: own if she’s tackled to a geck as everybody’s a-laughing at? She might
3746: as well dress herself fine to sit back’ards on a donkey.”
3747: 
3748: These expressions, though figurative, sufficiently indicated the bent
3749: of Mrs. Poyser’s mind with regard to Adam; and though she and her
3750: husband might have viewed the subject differently if Hetty had been a
3751: daughter of their own, it was clear that they would have welcomed the
3752: match with Adam for a penniless niece. For what could Hetty have been
3753: but a servant elsewhere, if her uncle had not taken her in and brought
3754: her up as a domestic help to her aunt, whose health since the birth of
3755: Totty had not been equal to more positive labour than the
3756: superintendence of servants and children? But Hetty had never given
3757: Adam any steady encouragement. Even in the moments when she was most
3758: thoroughly conscious of his superiority to her other admirers, she had
3759: never brought herself to think of accepting him. She liked to feel that
3760: this strong, skilful, keen-eyed man was in her power, and would have
3761: been indignant if he had shown the least sign of slipping from under
3762: the yoke of her coquettish tyranny and attaching himself to the gentle
3763: Mary Burge, who would have been grateful enough for the most trifling
3764: notice from him. “Mary Burge, indeed! Such a sallow-faced girl: if she
3765: put on a bit of pink ribbon, she looked as yellow as a crow-flower and
3766: her hair was as straight as a hank of cotton.” And always when Adam
3767: stayed away for several weeks from the Hall Farm, and otherwise made
3768: some show of resistance to his passion as a foolish one, Hetty took
3769: care to entice him back into the net by little airs of meekness and
3770: timidity, as if she were in trouble at his neglect. But as to marrying
3771: Adam, that was a very different affair! There was nothing in the world
3772: to tempt her to do that. Her cheeks never grew a shade deeper when his
3773: name was mentioned; she felt no thrill when she saw him passing along
3774: the causeway by the window, or advancing towards her unexpectedly in
3775: the footpath across the meadow; she felt nothing, when his eyes rested
3776: on her, but the cold triumph of knowing that he loved her and would not
3777: care to look at Mary Burge. He could no more stir in her the emotions
3778: that make the sweet intoxication of young love than the mere picture of
3779: a sun can stir the spring sap in the subtle fibres of the plant. She
3780: saw him as he was—a poor man with old parents to keep, who would not be
3781: able, for a long while to come, to give her even such luxuries as she
3782: shared in her uncle’s house. And Hetty’s dreams were all of luxuries:
3783: to sit in a carpeted parlour, and always wear white stockings; to have
3784: some large beautiful ear-rings, such as were all the fashion; to have
3785: Nottingham lace round the top of her gown, and something to make her
3786: handkerchief smell nice, like Miss Lydia Donnithorne’s when she drew it
3787: out at church; and not to be obliged to get up early or be scolded by
3788: anybody. She thought, if Adam had been rich and could have given her
3789: these things, she loved him well enough to marry him.
3790: 
3791: But for the last few weeks a new influence had come over Hetty—vague,
3792: atmospheric, shaping itself into no self-confessed hopes or prospects,
3793: but producing a pleasant narcotic effect, making her tread the ground
3794: and go about her work in a sort of dream, unconscious of weight or
3795: effort, and showing her all things through a soft, liquid veil, as if
3796: she were living not in this solid world of brick and stone, but in a
3797: beatified world, such as the sun lights up for us in the waters. Hetty
3798: had become aware that Mr. Arthur Donnithorne would take a good deal of
3799: trouble for the chance of seeing her; that he always placed himself at
3800: church so as to have the fullest view of her both sitting and standing;
3801: that he was constantly finding reason for calling at the Hall Farm, and
3802: always would contrive to say something for the sake of making her speak
3803: to him and look at him. The poor child no more conceived at present the
3804: idea that the young squire could ever be her lover than a baker’s
3805: pretty daughter in the crowd, whom a young emperor distinguishes by an
3806: imperial but admiring smile, conceives that she shall be made empress.
3807: But the baker’s daughter goes home and dreams of the handsome young
3808: emperor, and perhaps weighs the flour amiss while she is thinking what
3809: a heavenly lot it must be to have him for a husband. And so, poor Hetty
3810: had got a face and a presence haunting her waking and sleeping dreams;
3811: bright, soft glances had penetrated her, and suffused her life with a
3812: strange, happy languor. The eyes that shed those glances were really
3813: not half so fine as Adam’s, which sometimes looked at her with a sad,
3814: beseeching tenderness, but they had found a ready medium in Hetty’s
3815: little silly imagination, whereas Adam’s could get no entrance through
3816: that atmosphere. For three weeks, at least, her inward life had
3817: consisted of little else than living through in memory the looks and
3818: words Arthur had directed towards her—of little else than recalling the
3819: sensations with which she heard his voice outside the house, and saw
3820: him enter, and became conscious that his eyes were fixed on her, and
3821: then became conscious that a tall figure, looking down on her with eyes
3822: that seemed to touch her, was coming nearer in clothes of beautiful
3823: texture with an odour like that of a flower-garden borne on the evening
3824: breeze. Foolish thoughts! But all this happened, you must remember,
3825: nearly sixty years ago, and Hetty was quite uneducated—a simple
3826: farmer’s girl, to whom a gentleman with a white hand was dazzling as an
3827: Olympian god. Until to-day, she had never looked farther into the
3828: future than to the next time Captain Donnithorne would come to the
3829: Farm, or the next Sunday when she should see him at church; but now she
3830: thought, perhaps he would try to meet her when she went to the Chase
3831: to-morrow—and if he should speak to her, and walk a little way, when
3832: nobody was by! That had never happened yet; and now her imagination,
3833: instead of retracing the past, was busy fashioning what would happen
3834: to-morrow—whereabout in the Chase she should see him coming towards
3835: her, how she should put her new rose-coloured ribbon on, which he had
3836: never seen, and what he would say to her to make her return his
3837: glance—a glance which she would be living through in her memory, over
3838: and over again, all the rest of the day.
3839: 
3840: In this state of mind, how could Hetty give any feeling to Adam’s
3841: troubles, or think much about poor old Thias being drowned? Young
3842: souls, in such pleasant delirium as hers are as unsympathetic as
3843: butterflies sipping nectar; they are isolated from all appeals by a
3844: barrier of dreams—by invisible looks and impalpable arms.
3845: 
3846: While Hetty’s hands were busy packing up the butter, and her head
3847: filled with these pictures of the morrow, Arthur Donnithorne, riding by
3848: Mr. Irwine’s side towards the valley of the Willow Brook, had also
3849: certain indistinct anticipations, running as an undercurrent in his
3850: mind while he was listening to Mr. Irwine’s account of
3851: Dinah—indistinct, yet strong enough to make him feel rather conscious
3852: when Mr. Irwine suddenly said, “What fascinated you so in Mrs. Poyser’s
3853: dairy, Arthur? Have you become an amateur of damp quarries and skimming
3854: dishes?”
3855: 
3856: Arthur knew the rector too well to suppose that a clever invention
3857: would be of any use, so he said, with his accustomed frankness, “No, I
3858: went to look at the pretty butter-maker Hetty Sorrel. She’s a perfect
3859: Hebe; and if I were an artist, I would paint her. It’s amazing what
3860: pretty girls one sees among the farmers’ daughters, when the men are
3861: such clowns. That common, round, red face one sees sometimes in the
3862: men—all cheek and no features, like Martin Poyser’s—comes out in the
3863: women of the family as the most charming phiz imaginable.”
3864: 
3865: “Well, I have no objection to your contemplating Hetty in an artistic
3866: light, but I must not have you feeding her vanity and filling her
3867: little noddle with the notion that she’s a great beauty, attractive to
3868: fine gentlemen, or you will spoil her for a poor man’s wife—honest
3869: Craig’s, for example, whom I have seen bestowing soft glances on her.
3870: The little puss seems already to have airs enough to make a husband as
3871: miserable as it’s a law of nature for a quiet man to be when he marries
3872: a beauty. Apropos of marrying, I hope our friend Adam will get settled,
3873: now the poor old man’s gone. He will only have his mother to keep in
3874: future, and I’ve a notion that there’s a kindness between him and that
3875: nice modest girl, Mary Burge, from something that fell from old
3876: Jonathan one day when I was talking to him. But when I mentioned the
3877: subject to Adam he looked uneasy and turned the conversation. I suppose
3878: the love-making doesn’t run smooth, or perhaps Adam hangs back till
3879: he’s in a better position. He has independence of spirit enough for two
3880: men—rather an excess of pride, if anything.”
3881: 
3882: “That would be a capital match for Adam. He would slip into old Burge’s
3883: shoes and make a fine thing of that building business, I’ll answer for
3884: him. I should like to see him well settled in this parish; he would be
3885: ready then to act as my grand-vizier when I wanted one. We could plan
3886: no end of repairs and improvements together. I’ve never seen the girl,
3887: though, I think—at least I’ve never looked at her.”
3888: 
3889: “Look at her next Sunday at church—she sits with her father on the left
3890: of the reading-desk. You needn’t look quite so much at Hetty Sorrel
3891: then. When I’ve made up my mind that I can’t afford to buy a tempting
3892: dog, I take no notice of him, because if he took a strong fancy to me
3893: and looked lovingly at me, the struggle between arithmetic and
3894: inclination might become unpleasantly severe. I pique myself on my
3895: wisdom there, Arthur, and as an old fellow to whom wisdom had become
3896: cheap, I bestow it upon you.”
3897: 
3898: “Thank you. It may stand me in good stead some day though I don’t know
3899: that I have any present use for it. Bless me! How the brook has
3900: overflowed. Suppose we have a canter, now we’re at the bottom of the
3901: hill.”
3902: 
3903: That is the great advantage of dialogue on horseback; it can be merged
3904: any minute into a trot or a canter, and one might have escaped from
3905: Socrates himself in the saddle. The two friends were free from the
3906: necessity of further conversation till they pulled up in the lane
3907: behind Adam’s cottage.
3908: 
3909: 
3910: 
3911: 
3912: Chapter X
3913: Dinah Visits Lisbeth
3914: 
3915: 
3916: At five o’clock Lisbeth came downstairs with a large key in her hand:
3917: it was the key of the chamber where her husband lay dead. Throughout
3918: the day, except in her occasional outbursts of wailing grief, she had
3919: been in incessant movement, performing the initial duties to her dead
3920: with the awe and exactitude that belong to religious rites. She had
3921: brought out her little store of bleached linen, which she had for long
3922: years kept in reserve for this supreme use. It seemed but
3923: yesterday—that time so many midsummers ago, when she had told Thias
3924: where this linen lay, that he might be sure and reach it out for her
3925: when _she_ died, for she was the elder of the two. Then there had been
3926: the work of cleansing to the strictest purity every object in the
3927: sacred chamber, and of removing from it every trace of common daily
3928: occupation. The small window, which had hitherto freely let in the
3929: frosty moonlight or the warm summer sunrise on the working man’s
3930: slumber, must now be darkened with a fair white sheet, for this was the
3931: sleep which is as sacred under the bare rafters as in ceiled houses.
3932: Lisbeth had even mended a long-neglected and unnoticeable rent in the
3933: checkered bit of bed-curtain; for the moments were few and precious now
3934: in which she would be able to do the smallest office of respect or love
3935: for the still corpse, to which in all her thoughts she attributed some
3936: consciousness. Our dead are never dead to us until we have forgotten
3937: them: they can be injured by us, they can be wounded; they know all our
3938: penitence, all our aching sense that their place is empty, all the
3939: kisses we bestow on the smallest relic of their presence. And the aged
3940: peasant woman most of all believes that her dead are conscious. Decent
3941: burial was what Lisbeth had been thinking of for herself through years
3942: of thrift, with an indistinct expectation that she should know when she
3943: was being carried to the churchyard, followed by her husband and her
3944: sons; and now she felt as if the greatest work of her life were to be
3945: done in seeing that Thias was buried decently before her—under the
3946: white thorn, where once, in a dream, she had thought she lay in the
3947: coffin, yet all the while saw the sunshine above and smelt the white
3948: blossoms that were so thick upon the thorn the Sunday she went to be
3949: churched after Adam was born.
3950: 
3951: But now she had done everything that could be done to-day in the
3952: chamber of death—had done it all herself, with some aid from her sons
3953: in lifting, for she would let no one be fetched to help her from the
3954: village, not being fond of female neighbours generally; and her
3955: favourite Dolly, the old housekeeper at Mr. Burge’s, who had come to
3956: condole with her in the morning as soon as she heard of Thias’s death,
3957: was too dim-sighted to be of much use. She had locked the door, and now
3958: held the key in her hand, as she threw herself wearily into a chair
3959: that stood out of its place in the middle of the house floor, where in
3960: ordinary times she would never have consented to sit. The kitchen had
3961: had none of her attention that day; it was soiled with the tread of
3962: muddy shoes and untidy with clothes and other objects out of place. But
3963: what at another time would have been intolerable to Lisbeth’s habits of
3964: order and cleanliness seemed to her now just what should be: it was
3965: right that things should look strange and disordered and wretched, now
3966: the old man had come to his end in that sad way; the kitchen ought not
3967: to look as if nothing had happened. Adam, overcome with the agitations
3968: and exertions of the day after his night of hard work, had fallen
3969: asleep on a bench in the workshop; and Seth was in the back kitchen
3970: making a fire of sticks that he might get the kettle to boil, and
3971: persuade his mother to have a cup of tea, an indulgence which she
3972: rarely allowed herself.
3973: 
3974: There was no one in the kitchen when Lisbeth entered and threw herself
3975: into the chair. She looked round with blank eyes at the dirt and
3976: confusion on which the bright afternoon’s sun shone dismally; it was
3977: all of a piece with the sad confusion of her mind—that confusion which
3978: belongs to the first hours of a sudden sorrow, when the poor human soul
3979: is like one who has been deposited sleeping among the ruins of a vast
3980: city, and wakes up in dreary amazement, not knowing whether it is the
3981: growing or the dying day—not knowing why and whence came this
3982: illimitable scene of desolation, or why he too finds himself desolate
3983: in the midst of it.
3984: 
3985: At another time Lisbeth’s first thought would have been, “Where is
3986: Adam?” but the sudden death of her husband had restored him in these
3987: hours to that first place in her affections which he had held
3988: six-and-twenty years ago. She had forgotten his faults as we forget the
3989: sorrows of our departed childhood, and thought of nothing but the young
3990: husband’s kindness and the old man’s patience. Her eyes continued to
3991: wander blankly until Seth came in and began to remove some of the
3992: scattered things, and clear the small round deal table that he might
3993: set out his mother’s tea upon it.
3994: 
3995: “What art goin’ to do?” she said, rather peevishly.
3996: 
3997: “I want thee to have a cup of tea, Mother,” answered Seth, tenderly.
3998: “It’ll do thee good; and I’ll put two or three of these things away,
3999: and make the house look more comfortable.”
4000: 
4001: “Comfortable! How canst talk o’ ma’in’ things comfortable? Let a-be,
4002: let a-be. There’s no comfort for me no more,” she went on, the tears
4003: coming when she began to speak, “now thy poor feyther’s gone, as I’n
4004: washed for and mended, an’ got’s victual for him for thirty ’ear, an’
4005: him allays so pleased wi’ iverything I done for him, an’ used to be so
4006: handy an’ do the jobs for me when I war ill an’ cumbered wi’ th’ babby,
4007: an’ made me the posset an’ brought it upstairs as proud as could be,
4008: an’ carried the lad as war as heavy as two children for five mile an’
4009: ne’er grumbled, all the way to Warson Wake, ’cause I wanted to go an’
4010: see my sister, as war dead an’ gone the very next Christmas as e’er
4011: come. An’ him to be drownded in the brook as we passed o’er the day we
4012: war married an’ come home together, an’ he’d made them lots o’ shelves
4013: for me to put my plates an’ things on, an’ showed ’em me as proud as
4014: could be, ’cause he know’d I should be pleased. An’ he war to die an’
4015: me not to know, but to be a-sleepin’ i’ my bed, as if I caredna nought
4016: about it. Eh! An’ me to live to see that! An’ us as war young folks
4017: once, an’ thought we should do rarely when we war married. Let a-be,
4018: lad, let a-be! I wonna ha’ no tay. I carena if I ne’er ate nor drink no
4019: more. When one end o’ th’ bridge tumbles down, where’s th’ use o’ th’
4020: other stannin’? I may’s well die, an’ foller my old man. There’s no
4021: knowin’ but he’ll want me.”
4022: 
4023: Here Lisbeth broke from words into moans, swaying herself backwards and
4024: forwards on her chair. Seth, always timid in his behaviour towards his
4025: mother, from the sense that he had no influence over her, felt it was
4026: useless to attempt to persuade or soothe her till this passion was
4027: past; so he contented himself with tending the back kitchen fire and
4028: folding up his father’s clothes, which had been hanging out to dry
4029: since morning—afraid to move about in the room where his mother was,
4030: lest he should irritate her further.
4031: 
4032: But after Lisbeth had been rocking herself and moaning for some
4033: minutes, she suddenly paused and said aloud to herself, “I’ll go an’
4034: see arter Adam, for I canna think where he’s gotten; an’ I want him to
4035: go upstairs wi’ me afore it’s dark, for the minutes to look at the
4036: corpse is like the meltin’ snow.”
4037: 
4038: Seth overheard this, and coming into the kitchen again, as his mother
4039: rose from her chair, he said, “Adam’s asleep in the workshop, mother.
4040: Thee’dst better not wake him. He was o’erwrought with work and
4041: trouble.”
4042: 
4043: “Wake him? Who’s a-goin’ to wake him? I shanna wake him wi’ lookin’ at
4044: him. I hanna seen the lad this two hour—I’d welly forgot as he’d e’er
4045: growed up from a babby when’s feyther carried him.”
4046: 
4047: Adam was seated on a rough bench, his head supported by his arm, which
4048: rested from the shoulder to the elbow on the long planing-table in the
4049: middle of the workshop. It seemed as if he had sat down for a few
4050: minutes’ rest and had fallen asleep without slipping from his first
4051: attitude of sad, fatigued thought. His face, unwashed since yesterday,
4052: looked pallid and clammy; his hair was tossed shaggily about his
4053: forehead, and his closed eyes had the sunken look which follows upon
4054: watching and sorrow. His brow was knit, and his whole face had an
4055: expression of weariness and pain. Gyp was evidently uneasy, for he sat
4056: on his haunches, resting his nose on his master’s stretched-out leg,
4057: and dividing the time between licking the hand that hung listlessly
4058: down and glancing with a listening air towards the door. The poor dog
4059: was hungry and restless, but would not leave his master, and was
4060: waiting impatiently for some change in the scene. It was owing to this
4061: feeling on Gyp’s part that, when Lisbeth came into the workshop and
4062: advanced towards Adam as noiselessly as she could, her intention not to
4063: awaken him was immediately defeated; for Gyp’s excitement was too great
4064: to find vent in anything short of a sharp bark, and in a moment Adam
4065: opened his eyes and saw his mother standing before him. It was not very
4066: unlike his dream, for his sleep had been little more than living
4067: through again, in a fevered delirious way, all that had happened since
4068: daybreak, and his mother with her fretful grief was present to him
4069: through it all. The chief difference between the reality and the vision
4070: was that in his dream Hetty was continually coming before him in bodily
4071: presence—strangely mingling herself as an actor in scenes with which
4072: she had nothing to do. She was even by the Willow Brook; she made his
4073: mother angry by coming into the house; and he met her with her smart
4074: clothes quite wet through, as he walked in the rain to Treddleston, to
4075: tell the coroner. But wherever Hetty came, his mother was sure to
4076: follow soon; and when he opened his eyes, it was not at all startling
4077: to see her standing near him.
4078: 
4079: “Eh, my lad, my lad!” Lisbeth burst out immediately, her wailing
4080: impulse returning, for grief in its freshness feels the need of
4081: associating its loss and its lament with every change of scene and
4082: incident, “thee’st got nobody now but thy old mother to torment thee
4083: and be a burden to thee. Thy poor feyther ’ull ne’er anger thee no
4084: more; an’ thy mother may’s well go arter him—the sooner the better—for
4085: I’m no good to nobody now. One old coat ’ull do to patch another, but
4086: it’s good for nought else. Thee’dst like to ha’ a wife to mend thy
4087: clothes an’ get thy victual, better nor thy old mother. An’ I shall be
4088: nought but cumber, a-sittin’ i’ th’ chimney-corner. (Adam winced and
4089: moved uneasily; he dreaded, of all things, to hear his mother speak of
4090: Hetty.) But if thy feyther had lived, he’d ne’er ha’ wanted me to go to
4091: make room for another, for he could no more ha’ done wi’out me nor one
4092: side o’ the scissars can do wi’out th’ other. Eh, we should ha’ been
4093: both flung away together, an’ then I shouldna ha’ seen this day, an’
4094: one buryin’ ’ud ha’ done for us both.”
4095: 
4096: Here Lisbeth paused, but Adam sat in pained silence—he could not speak
4097: otherwise than tenderly to his mother to-day, but he could not help
4098: being irritated by this plaint. It was not possible for poor Lisbeth to
4099: know how it affected Adam any more than it is possible for a wounded
4100: dog to know how his moans affect the nerves of his master. Like all
4101: complaining women, she complained in the expectation of being soothed,
4102: and when Adam said nothing, she was only prompted to complain more
4103: bitterly.
4104: 
4105: “I know thee couldst do better wi’out me, for thee couldst go where
4106: thee likedst an’ marry them as thee likedst. But I donna want to say
4107: thee nay, let thee bring home who thee wut; I’d ne’er open my lips to
4108: find faut, for when folks is old an’ o’ no use, they may think
4109: theirsens well off to get the bit an’ the sup, though they’n to swallow
4110: ill words wi’t. An’ if thee’st set thy heart on a lass as’ll bring thee
4111: nought and waste all, when thee mightst ha’ them as ’ud make a man on
4112: thee, I’ll say nought, now thy feyther’s dead an’ drownded, for I’m no
4113: better nor an old haft when the blade’s gone.”
4114: 
4115: Adam, unable to bear this any longer, rose silently from the bench and
4116: walked out of the workshop into the kitchen. But Lisbeth followed him.
4117: 
4118: “Thee wutna go upstairs an’ see thy feyther then? I’n done everythin’
4119: now, an’ he’d like thee to go an’ look at him, for he war allays so
4120: pleased when thee wast mild to him.”
4121: 
4122: Adam turned round at once and said, “Yes, mother; let us go upstairs.
4123: Come, Seth, let us go together.”
4124: 
4125: They went upstairs, and for five minutes all was silence. Then the key
4126: was turned again, and there was a sound of footsteps on the stairs. But
4127: Adam did not come down again; he was too weary and worn-out to
4128: encounter more of his mother’s querulous grief, and he went to rest on
4129: his bed. Lisbeth no sooner entered the kitchen and sat down than she
4130: threw her apron over her head, and began to cry and moan and rock
4131: herself as before. Seth thought, “She will be quieter by and by, now we
4132: have been upstairs”; and he went into the back kitchen again, to tend
4133: his little fire, hoping that he should presently induce her to have
4134: some tea.
4135: 
4136: Lisbeth had been rocking herself in this way for more than five
4137: minutes, giving a low moan with every forward movement of her body,
4138: when she suddenly felt a hand placed gently on hers, and a sweet treble
4139: voice said to her, “Dear sister, the Lord has sent me to see if I can
4140: be a comfort to you.”
4141: 
4142: Lisbeth paused, in a listening attitude, without removing her apron
4143: from her face. The voice was strange to her. Could it be her sister’s
4144: spirit come back to her from the dead after all those years? She
4145: trembled and dared not look.
4146: 
4147: Dinah, believing that this pause of wonder was in itself a relief for
4148: the sorrowing woman, said no more just yet, but quietly took off her
4149: bonnet, and then, motioning silence to Seth, who, on hearing her voice,
4150: had come in with a beating heart, laid one hand on the back of
4151: Lisbeth’s chair and leaned over her, that she might be aware of a
4152: friendly presence.
4153: 
4154: Slowly Lisbeth drew down her apron, and timidly she opened her dim dark
4155: eyes. She saw nothing at first but a face—a pure, pale face, with
4156: loving grey eyes, and it was quite unknown to her. Her wonder
4157: increased; perhaps it _was_ an angel. But in the same instant Dinah had
4158: laid her hand on Lisbeth’s again, and the old woman looked down at it.
4159: It was a much smaller hand than her own, but it was not white and
4160: delicate, for Dinah had never worn a glove in her life, and her hand
4161: bore the traces of labour from her childhood upwards. Lisbeth looked
4162: earnestly at the hand for a moment, and then, fixing her eyes again on
4163: Dinah’s face, said, with something of restored courage, but in a tone
4164: of surprise, “Why, ye’re a workin’ woman!”
4165: 
4166: “Yes, I am Dinah Morris, and I work in the cotton-mill when I am at
4167: home.”
4168: 
4169: “Ah!” said Lisbeth slowly, still wondering; “ye comed in so light, like
4170: the shadow on the wall, an’ spoke i’ my ear, as I thought ye might be a
4171: sperrit. Ye’ve got a’most the face o’ one as is a-sittin’ on the grave
4172: i’ Adam’s new Bible.”
4173: 
4174: “I come from the Hall Farm now. You know Mrs. Poyser—she’s my aunt, and
4175: she has heard of your great affliction, and is very sorry; and I’m come
4176: to see if I can be any help to you in your trouble; for I know your
4177: sons Adam and Seth, and I know you have no daughter; and when the
4178: clergyman told me how the hand of God was heavy upon you, my heart went
4179: out towards you, and I felt a command to come and be to you in the
4180: place of a daughter in this grief, if you will let me.”
4181: 
4182: “Ah! I know who y’ are now; y’ are a Methody, like Seth; he’s tould me
4183: on you,” said Lisbeth fretfully, her overpowering sense of pain
4184: returning, now her wonder was gone. “Ye’ll make it out as trouble’s a
4185: good thing, like _he_ allays does. But where’s the use o’ talkin’ to me
4186: a-that’n? Ye canna make the smart less wi’ talkin’. Ye’ll ne’er make me
4187: believe as it’s better for me not to ha’ my old man die in’s bed, if he
4188: must die, an’ ha’ the parson to pray by him, an’ me to sit by him, an’
4189: tell him ne’er to mind th’ ill words I’ve gi’en him sometimes when I
4190: war angered, an’ to gi’ him a bit an’ a sup, as long as a bit an’ a sup
4191: he’d swallow. But eh! To die i’ the cold water, an’ us close to him,
4192: an’ ne’er to know; an’ me a-sleepin’, as if I ne’er belonged to him no
4193: more nor if he’d been a journeyman tramp from nobody knows where!”
4194: 
4195: Here Lisbeth began to cry and rock herself again; and Dinah said, “Yes,
4196: dear friend, your affliction is great. It would be hardness of heart to
4197: say that your trouble was not heavy to bear. God didn’t send me to you
4198: to make light of your sorrow, but to mourn with you, if you will let
4199: me. If you had a table spread for a feast, and was making merry with
4200: your friends, you would think it was kind to let me come and sit down
4201: and rejoice with you, because you’d think I should like to share those
4202: good things; but I should like better to share in your trouble and your
4203: labour, and it would seem harder to me if you denied me that. You won’t
4204: send me away? You’re not angry with me for coming?”
4205: 
4206: “Nay, nay; angered! who said I war angered? It war good on you to come.
4207: An’ Seth, why donna ye get her some tay? Ye war in a hurry to get some
4208: for me, as had no need, but ye donna think o’ gettin’ ’t for them as
4209: wants it. Sit ye down; sit ye down. I thank you kindly for comin’, for
4210: it’s little wage ye get by walkin’ through the wet fields to see an old
4211: woman like me.... Nay, I’n got no daughter o’ my own—ne’er had one—an’
4212: I warna sorry, for they’re poor queechy things, gells is; I allays
4213: wanted to ha’ lads, as could fend for theirsens. An’ the lads ’ull be
4214: marryin’—I shall ha’ daughters eno’, an’ too many. But now, do ye make
4215: the tay as ye like it, for I’n got no taste i’ my mouth this day—it’s
4216: all one what I swaller—it’s all got the taste o’ sorrow wi’t.”
4217: 
4218: Dinah took care not to betray that she had had her tea, and accepted
4219: Lisbeth’s invitation very readily, for the sake of persuading the old
4220: woman herself to take the food and drink she so much needed after a day
4221: of hard work and fasting.
4222: 
4223: Seth was so happy now Dinah was in the house that he could not help
4224: thinking her presence was worth purchasing with a life in which grief
4225: incessantly followed upon grief; but the next moment he reproached
4226: himself—it was almost as if he were rejoicing in his father’s sad
4227: death. Nevertheless the joy of being with Dinah _would_ triumph—it was
4228: like the influence of climate, which no resistance can overcome. And
4229: the feeling even suffused itself over his face so as to attract his
4230: mother’s notice, while she was drinking her tea.
4231: 
4232: “Thee may’st well talk o’ trouble bein’ a good thing, Seth, for thee
4233: thriv’st on’t. Thee look’st as if thee know’dst no more o’ care an’
4234: cumber nor when thee wast a babby a-lyin’ awake i’ th’ cradle. For
4235: thee’dst allays lie still wi’ thy eyes open, an’ Adam ne’er ’ud lie
4236: still a minute when he wakened. Thee wast allays like a bag o’ meal as
4237: can ne’er be bruised—though, for the matter o’ that, thy poor feyther
4238: war just such another. But _ye_’ve got the same look too” (here Lisbeth
4239: turned to Dinah). “I reckon it’s wi’ bein’ a Methody. Not as I’m
4240: a-findin’ faut wi’ ye for’t, for ye’ve no call to be frettin’, an’
4241: somehow ye looken sorry too. Eh! Well, if the Methodies are fond o’
4242: trouble, they’re like to thrive: it’s a pity they canna ha’t all, an’
4243: take it away from them as donna like it. I could ha’ gi’en ’em plenty;
4244: for when I’d gotten my old man I war worreted from morn till night; and
4245: now he’s gone, I’d be glad for the worst o’er again.”
4246: 
4247: “Yes,” said Dinah, careful not to oppose any feeling of Lisbeth’s, for
4248: her reliance, in her smallest words and deeds, on a divine guidance,
4249: always issued in that finest woman’s tact which proceeds from acute and
4250: ready sympathy; “yes, I remember too, when my dear aunt died, I longed
4251: for the sound of her bad cough in the nights, instead of the silence
4252: that came when she was gone. But now, dear friend, drink this other cup
4253: of tea and eat a little more.”
4254: 
4255: “What!” said Lisbeth, taking the cup and speaking in a less querulous
4256: tone, “had ye got no feyther and mother, then, as ye war so sorry about
4257: your aunt?”
4258: 
4259: “No, I never knew a father or mother; my aunt brought me up from a
4260: baby. She had no children, for she was never married and she brought me
4261: up as tenderly as if I’d been her own child.”
4262: 
4263: “Eh, she’d fine work wi’ ye, I’ll warrant, bringin’ ye up from a babby,
4264: an’ her a lone woman—it’s ill bringin’ up a cade lamb. But I daresay ye
4265: warna franzy, for ye look as if ye’d ne’er been angered i’ your life.
4266: But what did ye do when your aunt died, an’ why didna ye come to live
4267: in this country, bein’ as Mrs. Poyser’s your aunt too?”
4268: 
4269: Dinah, seeing that Lisbeth’s attention was attracted, told her the
4270: story of her early life—how she had been brought up to work hard, and
4271: what sort of place Snowfield was, and how many people had a hard life
4272: there—all the details that she thought likely to interest Lisbeth. The
4273: old woman listened, and forgot to be fretful, unconsciously subject to
4274: the soothing influence of Dinah’s face and voice. After a while she was
4275: persuaded to let the kitchen be made tidy; for Dinah was bent on this,
4276: believing that the sense of order and quietude around her would help in
4277: disposing Lisbeth to join in the prayer she longed to pour forth at her
4278: side. Seth, meanwhile, went out to chop wood, for he surmised that
4279: Dinah would like to be left alone with his mother.
4280: 
4281: Lisbeth sat watching her as she moved about in her still quick way, and
4282: said at last, “Ye’ve got a notion o’ cleanin’ up. I wouldna mind ha’in
4283: ye for a daughter, for ye wouldna spend the lad’s wage i’ fine clothes
4284: an’ waste. Ye’re not like the lasses o’ this countryside. I reckon
4285: folks is different at Snowfield from what they are here.”
4286: 
4287: “They have a different sort of life, many of ’em,” said Dinah; “they
4288: work at different things—some in the mill, and many in the mines, in
4289: the villages round about. But the heart of man is the same everywhere,
4290: and there are the children of this world and the children of light
4291: there as well as elsewhere. But we’ve many more Methodists there than
4292: in this country.”
4293: 
4294: “Well, I didna know as the Methody women war like ye, for there’s Will
4295: Maskery’s wife, as they say’s a big Methody, isna pleasant to look at,
4296: at all. I’d as lief look at a tooad. An’ I’m thinkin’ I wouldna mind if
4297: ye’d stay an’ sleep here, for I should like to see ye i’ th’ house i’
4298: th’ mornin’. But mayhappen they’ll be lookin for ye at Mester
4299: Poyser’s.”
4300: 
4301: “No,” said Dinah, “they don’t expect me, and I should like to stay, if
4302: you’ll let me.”
4303: 
4304: “Well, there’s room; I’n got my bed laid i’ th’ little room o’er the
4305: back kitchen, an’ ye can lie beside me. I’d be glad to ha’ ye wi’ me to
4306: speak to i’ th’ night, for ye’ve got a nice way o’ talkin’. It puts me
4307: i’ mind o’ the swallows as was under the thack last ’ear when they fust
4308: begun to sing low an’ soft-like i’ th’ mornin’. Eh, but my old man war
4309: fond o’ them birds! An’ so war Adam, but they’n ne’er comed again this
4310: ’ear. Happen they’re dead too.”
4311: 
4312: “There,” said Dinah, “now the kitchen looks tidy, and now, dear
4313: Mother—for I’m your daughter to-night, you know—I should like you to
4314: wash your face and have a clean cap on. Do you remember what David did,
4315: when God took away his child from him? While the child was yet alive he
4316: fasted and prayed to God to spare it, and he would neither eat nor
4317: drink, but lay on the ground all night, beseeching God for the child.
4318: But when he knew it was dead, he rose up from the ground and washed and
4319: anointed himself, and changed his clothes, and ate and drank; and when
4320: they asked him how it was that he seemed to have left off grieving now
4321: the child was dead, he said, ‘While the child was yet alive, I fasted
4322: and wept; for I said, Who can tell whether God will be gracious to me,
4323: that the child may live? But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast?
4324: Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return
4325: to me.’”
4326: 
4327: “Eh, that’s a true word,” said Lisbeth. “Yea, my old man wonna come
4328: back to me, but I shall go to him—the sooner the better. Well, ye may
4329: do as ye like wi’ me: there’s a clean cap i’ that drawer, an’ I’ll go
4330: i’ the back kitchen an’ wash my face. An’ Seth, thee may’st reach down
4331: Adam’s new Bible wi’ th’ picters in, an’ she shall read us a chapter.
4332: Eh, I like them words—‘I shall go to him, but he wonna come back to
4333: me.’”
4334: 
4335: Dinah and Seth were both inwardly offering thanks for the greater
4336: quietness of spirit that had come over Lisbeth. This was what Dinah had
4337: been trying to bring about, through all her still sympathy and absence
4338: from exhortation. From her girlhood upwards she had had experience
4339: among the sick and the mourning, among minds hardened and shrivelled
4340: through poverty and ignorance, and had gained the subtlest perception
4341: of the mode in which they could best be touched and softened into
4342: willingness to receive words of spiritual consolation or warning. As
4343: Dinah expressed it, “she was never left to herself; but it was always
4344: given her when to keep silence and when to speak.” And do we not all
4345: agree to call rapid thought and noble impulse by the name of
4346: inspiration? After our subtlest analysis of the mental process, we must
4347: still say, as Dinah did, that our highest thoughts and our best deeds
4348: are all given to us.
4349: 
4350: And so there was earnest prayer—there was faith, love, and hope pouring
4351: forth that evening in the little kitchen. And poor, aged, fretful
4352: Lisbeth, without grasping any distinct idea, without going through any
4353: course of religious emotions, felt a vague sense of goodness and love,
4354: and of something right lying underneath and beyond all this sorrowing
4355: life. She couldn’t understand the sorrow; but, for these moments, under
4356: the subduing influence of Dinah’s spirit, she felt that she must be
4357: patient and still.
4358: 
4359: 
4360: 
4361: 
4362: Chapter XI
4363: In the Cottage
4364: 
4365: 
4366: It was but half-past four the next morning when Dinah, tired of lying
4367: awake listening to the birds and watching the growing light through the
4368: little window in the garret roof, rose and began to dress herself very
4369: quietly, lest she should disturb Lisbeth. But already some one else was
4370: astir in the house, and had gone downstairs, preceded by Gyp. The dog’s
4371: pattering step was a sure sign that it was Adam who went down; but
4372: Dinah was not aware of this, and she thought it was more likely to be
4373: Seth, for he had told her how Adam had stayed up working the night
4374: before. Seth, however, had only just awakened at the sound of the
4375: opening door. The exciting influence of the previous day, heightened at
4376: last by Dinah’s unexpected presence, had not been counteracted by any
4377: bodily weariness, for he had not done his ordinary amount of hard work;
4378: and so when he went to bed; it was not till he had tired himself with
4379: hours of tossing wakefulness that drowsiness came, and led on a heavier
4380: morning sleep than was usual with him.
4381: 
4382: But Adam had been refreshed by his long rest, and with his habitual
4383: impatience of mere passivity, he was eager to begin the new day and
4384: subdue sadness by his strong will and strong arm. The white mist lay in
4385: the valley; it was going to be a bright warm day, and he would start to
4386: work again when he had had his breakfast.
4387: 
4388: “There’s nothing but what’s bearable as long as a man can work,” he
4389: said to himself; “the natur o’ things doesn’t change, though it seems
4390: as if one’s own life was nothing but change. The square o’ four is
4391: sixteen, and you must lengthen your lever in proportion to your weight,
4392: is as true when a man’s miserable as when he’s happy; and the best o’
4393: working is, it gives you a grip hold o’ things outside your own lot.”
4394: 
4395: As he dashed the cold water over his head and face, he felt completely
4396: himself again, and with his black eyes as keen as ever and his thick
4397: black hair all glistening with the fresh moisture, he went into the
4398: workshop to look out the wood for his father’s coffin, intending that
4399: he and Seth should carry it with them to Jonathan Burge’s and have the
4400: coffin made by one of the workmen there, so that his mother might not
4401: see and hear the sad task going forward at home.
4402: 
4403: He had just gone into the workshop when his quick ear detected a light
4404: rapid foot on the stairs—certainly not his mother’s. He had been in bed
4405: and asleep when Dinah had come in, in the evening, and now he wondered
4406: whose step this could be. A foolish thought came, and moved him
4407: strangely. As if it could be Hetty! She was the last person likely to
4408: be in the house. And yet he felt reluctant to go and look and have the
4409: clear proof that it was some one else. He stood leaning on a plank he
4410: had taken hold of, listening to sounds which his imagination
4411: interpreted for him so pleasantly that the keen strong face became
4412: suffused with a timid tenderness. The light footstep moved about the
4413: kitchen, followed by the sound of the sweeping brush, hardly making so
4414: much noise as the lightest breeze that chases the autumn leaves along
4415: the dusty path; and Adam’s imagination saw a dimpled face, with dark
4416: bright eyes and roguish smiles looking backward at this brush, and a
4417: rounded figure just leaning a little to clasp the handle. A very
4418: foolish thought—it could not be Hetty; but the only way of dismissing
4419: such nonsense from his head was to go and see _who_ it was, for his
4420: fancy only got nearer and nearer to belief while he stood there
4421: listening. He loosed the plank and went to the kitchen door.
4422: 
4423: “How do you do, Adam Bede?” said Dinah, in her calm treble, pausing
4424: from her sweeping and fixing her mild grave eyes upon him. “I trust you
4425: feel rested and strengthened again to bear the burden and heat of the
4426: day.”
4427: 
4428: It was like dreaming of the sunshine and awaking in the moonlight. Adam
4429: had seen Dinah several times, but always at the Hall Farm, where he was
4430: not very vividly conscious of any woman’s presence except Hetty’s, and
4431: he had only in the last day or two begun to suspect that Seth was in
4432: love with her, so that his attention had not hitherto been drawn
4433: towards her for his brother’s sake. But now her slim figure, her plain
4434: black gown, and her pale serene face impressed him with all the force
4435: that belongs to a reality contrasted with a preoccupying fancy. For the
4436: first moment or two he made no answer, but looked at her with the
4437: concentrated, examining glance which a man gives to an object in which
4438: he has suddenly begun to be interested. Dinah, for the first time in
4439: her life, felt a painful self-consciousness; there was something in the
4440: dark penetrating glance of this strong man so different from the
4441: mildness and timidity of his brother Seth. A faint blush came, which
4442: deepened as she wondered at it. This blush recalled Adam from his
4443: forgetfulness.
4444: 
4445: “I was quite taken by surprise; it was very good of you to come and see
4446: my mother in her trouble,” he said, in a gentle grateful tone, for his
4447: quick mind told him at once how she came to be there. “I hope my mother
4448: was thankful to have you,” he added, wondering rather anxiously what
4449: had been Dinah’s reception.
4450: 
4451: “Yes,” said Dinah, resuming her work, “she seemed greatly comforted
4452: after a while, and she’s had a good deal of rest in the night, by
4453: times. She was fast asleep when I left her.”
4454: 
4455: “Who was it took the news to the Hall Farm?” said Adam, his thoughts
4456: reverting to some one there; he wondered whether _she_ had felt
4457: anything about it.
4458: 
4459: “It was Mr. Irwine, the clergyman, told me, and my aunt was grieved for
4460: your mother when she heard it, and wanted me to come; and so is my
4461: uncle, I’m sure, now he’s heard it, but he was gone out to Rosseter all
4462: yesterday. They’ll look for you there as soon as you’ve got time to go,
4463: for there’s nobody round that hearth but what’s glad to see you.”
4464: 
4465: Dinah, with her sympathetic divination, knew quite well that Adam was
4466: longing to hear if Hetty had said anything about their trouble; she was
4467: too rigorously truthful for benevolent invention, but she had contrived
4468: to say something in which Hetty was tacitly included. Love has a way of
4469: cheating itself consciously, like a child who plays at solitary
4470: hide-and-seek; it is pleased with assurances that it all the while
4471: disbelieves. Adam liked what Dinah had said so much that his mind was
4472: directly full of the next visit he should pay to the Hall Farm, when
4473: Hetty would perhaps behave more kindly to him than she had ever done
4474: before.
4475: 
4476: “But you won’t be there yourself any longer?” he said to Dinah.
4477: 
4478: “No, I go back to Snowfield on Saturday, and I shall have to set out to
4479: Treddleston early, to be in time for the Oakbourne carrier. So I must
4480: go back to the farm to-night, that I may have the last day with my aunt
4481: and her children. But I can stay here all to-day, if your mother would
4482: like me; and her heart seemed inclined towards me last night.”
4483: 
4484: “Ah, then, she’s sure to want you to-day. If mother takes to people at
4485: the beginning, she’s sure to get fond of ’em; but she’s a strange way
4486: of not liking young women. Though, to be sure,” Adam went on, smiling,
4487: “her not liking other young women is no reason why she shouldn’t like
4488: you.”
4489: 
4490: Hitherto Gyp had been assisting at this conversation in motionless
4491: silence, seated on his haunches, and alternately looking up in his
4492: master’s face to watch its expression and observing Dinah’s movements
4493: about the kitchen. The kind smile with which Adam uttered the last
4494: words was apparently decisive with Gyp of the light in which the
4495: stranger was to be regarded, and as she turned round after putting
4496: aside her sweeping-brush, he trotted towards her and put up his muzzle
4497: against her hand in a friendly way.
4498: 
4499: “You see Gyp bids you welcome,” said Adam, “and he’s very slow to
4500: welcome strangers.”
4501: 
4502: “Poor dog!” said Dinah, patting the rough grey coat, “I’ve a strange
4503: feeling about the dumb things as if they wanted to speak, and it was a
4504: trouble to ’em because they couldn’t. I can’t help being sorry for the
4505: dogs always, though perhaps there’s no need. But they may well have
4506: more in them than they know how to make us understand, for we can’t say
4507: half what we feel, with all our words.”
4508: 
4509: Seth came down now, and was pleased to find Adam talking with Dinah; he
4510: wanted Adam to know how much better she was than all other women. But
4511: after a few words of greeting, Adam drew him into the workshop to
4512: consult about the coffin, and Dinah went on with her cleaning.
4513: 
4514: By six o’clock they were all at breakfast with Lisbeth in a kitchen as
4515: clean as she could have made it herself. The window and door were open,
4516: and the morning air brought with it a mingled scent of southernwood,
4517: thyme, and sweet-briar from the patch of garden by the side of the
4518: cottage. Dinah did not sit down at first, but moved about, serving the
4519: others with the warm porridge and the toasted oat-cake, which she had
4520: got ready in the usual way, for she had asked Seth to tell her just
4521: what his mother gave them for breakfast. Lisbeth had been unusually
4522: silent since she came downstairs, apparently requiring some time to
4523: adjust her ideas to a state of things in which she came down like a
4524: lady to find all the work done, and sat still to be waited on. Her new
4525: sensations seemed to exclude the remembrance of her grief. At last,
4526: after tasting the porridge, she broke silence:
4527: 
4528: “Ye might ha’ made the parridge worse,” she said to Dinah; “I can ate
4529: it wi’out its turnin’ my stomach. It might ha’ been a trifle thicker
4530: an’ no harm, an’ I allays putten a sprig o’ mint in mysen; but how’s ye
4531: t’ know that? The lads arena like to get folks as ’ll make their
4532: parridge as I’n made it for ’em; it’s well if they get onybody as ’ll
4533: make parridge at all. But ye might do, wi’ a bit o’ showin’; for ye’re
4534: a stirrin’ body in a mornin’, an’ ye’ve a light heel, an’ ye’ve cleaned
4535: th’ house well enough for a ma’shift.”
4536: 
4537: “Makeshift, mother?” said Adam. “Why, I think the house looks
4538: beautiful. I don’t know how it could look better.”
4539: 
4540: “Thee dostna know? Nay; how’s thee to know? Th’ men ne’er know whether
4541: the floor’s cleaned or cat-licked. But thee’lt know when thee gets thy
4542: parridge burnt, as it’s like enough to be when I’n gi’en o’er makin’
4543: it. Thee’lt think thy mother war good for summat then.”
4544: 
4545: “Dinah,” said Seth, “do come and sit down now and have your breakfast.
4546: We’re all served now.”
4547: 
4548: “Aye, come an’ sit ye down—do,” said Lisbeth, “an’ ate a morsel; ye’d
4549: need, arter bein’ upo’ your legs this hour an’ half a’ready. Come,
4550: then,” she added, in a tone of complaining affection, as Dinah sat down
4551: by her side, “I’ll be loath for ye t’ go, but ye canna stay much
4552: longer, I doubt. I could put up wi’ ye i’ th’ house better nor wi’ most
4553: folks.”
4554: 
4555: “I’ll stay till to-night if you’re willing,” said Dinah. “I’d stay
4556: longer, only I’m going back to Snowfield on Saturday, and I must be
4557: with my aunt to-morrow.”
4558: 
4559: “Eh, I’d ne’er go back to that country. My old man come from that
4560: Stonyshire side, but he left it when he war a young un, an’ i’ the
4561: right on’t too; for he said as there war no wood there, an’ it ’ud ha’
4562: been a bad country for a carpenter.”
4563: 
4564: “Ah,” said Adam, “I remember father telling me when I was a little lad
4565: that he made up his mind if ever he moved it should be south’ard. But
4566: I’m not so sure about it. Bartle Massey says—and he knows the South—as
4567: the northern men are a finer breed than the southern, harder-headed and
4568: stronger-bodied, and a deal taller. And then he says in some o’ those
4569: counties it’s as flat as the back o’ your hand, and you can see nothing
4570: of a distance without climbing up the highest trees. I couldn’t abide
4571: that. I like to go to work by a road that’ll take me up a bit of a
4572: hill, and see the fields for miles round me, and a bridge, or a town,
4573: or a bit of a steeple here and there. It makes you feel the world’s a
4574: big place, and there’s other men working in it with their heads and
4575: hands besides yourself.”
4576: 
4577: “I like th’ hills best,” said Seth, “when the clouds are over your head
4578: and you see the sun shining ever so far off, over the Loamford way, as
4579: I’ve often done o’ late, on the stormy days. It seems to me as if that
4580: was heaven where there’s always joy and sunshine, though this life’s
4581: dark and cloudy.”
4582: 
4583: “Oh, I love the Stonyshire side,” said Dinah; “I shouldn’t like to set
4584: my face towards the countries where they’re rich in corn and cattle,
4585: and the ground so level and easy to tread; and to turn my back on the
4586: hills where the poor people have to live such a hard life and the men
4587: spend their days in the mines away from the sunlight. It’s very blessed
4588: on a bleak cold day, when the sky is hanging dark over the hill, to
4589: feel the love of God in one’s soul, and carry it to the lonely, bare,
4590: stone houses, where there’s nothing else to give comfort.”
4591: 
4592: “Eh!” said Lisbeth, “that’s very well for ye to talk, as looks welly
4593: like the snowdrop-flowers as ha’ lived for days an’ days when I’n
4594: gethered ’em, wi’ nothin’ but a drop o’ water an’ a peep o’ daylight;
4595: but th’ hungry foulks had better leave th’ hungry country. It makes
4596: less mouths for the scant cake. But,” she went on, looking at Adam,
4597: “donna thee talk o’ goin’ south’ard or north’ard, an’ leavin’ thy
4598: feyther and mother i’ the churchyard, an’ goin’ to a country as they
4599: know nothin’ on. I’ll ne’er rest i’ my grave if I donna see thee i’ the
4600: churchyard of a Sunday.”
4601: 
4602: “Donna fear, mother,” said Adam. “If I hadna made up my mind not to go,
4603: I should ha’ been gone before now.”
4604: 
4605: He had finished his breakfast now, and rose as he was speaking.
4606: 
4607: “What art goin’ to do?” asked Lisbeth. “Set about thy feyther’s
4608: coffin?”
4609: 
4610: “No, mother,” said Adam; “we’re going to take the wood to the village
4611: and have it made there.”
4612: 
4613: “Nay, my lad, nay,” Lisbeth burst out in an eager, wailing tone; “thee
4614: wotna let nobody make thy feyther’s coffin but thysen? Who’d make it so
4615: well? An’ him as know’d what good work war, an’s got a son as is the
4616: head o’ the village an’ all Treddles’on too, for cleverness.”
4617: 
4618: “Very well, mother, if that’s thy wish, I’ll make the coffin at home;
4619: but I thought thee wouldstna like to hear the work going on.”
4620: 
4621: “An’ why shouldna I like ’t? It’s the right thing to be done. An’
4622: what’s liking got to do wi’t? It’s choice o’ mislikings is all I’n got
4623: i’ this world. One morsel’s as good as another when your mouth’s out o’
4624: taste. Thee mun set about it now this mornin’ fust thing. I wonna ha’
4625: nobody to touch the coffin but thee.”
4626: 
4627: Adam’s eyes met Seth’s, which looked from Dinah to him rather
4628: wistfully.
4629: 
4630: “No, Mother,” he said, “I’ll not consent but Seth shall have a hand in
4631: it too, if it’s to be done at home. I’ll go to the village this
4632: forenoon, because Mr. Burge ’ull want to see me, and Seth shall stay at
4633: home and begin the coffin. I can come back at noon, and then he can
4634: go.”
4635: 
4636: “Nay, nay,” persisted Lisbeth, beginning to cry, “I’n set my heart on’t
4637: as thee shalt ma’ thy feyther’s coffin. Thee’t so stiff an’ masterful,
4638: thee’t ne’er do as thy mother wants thee. Thee wast often angered wi’
4639: thy feyther when he war alive; thee must be the better to him now he’s
4640: gone. He’d ha’ thought nothin’ on’t for Seth to ma’s coffin.”
4641: 
4642: “Say no more, Adam, say no more,” said Seth, gently, though his voice
4643: told that he spoke with some effort; “Mother’s in the right. I’ll go to
4644: work, and do thee stay at home.”
4645: 
4646: He passed into the workshop immediately, followed by Adam; while
4647: Lisbeth, automatically obeying her old habits, began to put away the
4648: breakfast things, as if she did not mean Dinah to take her place any
4649: longer. Dinah said nothing, but presently used the opportunity of
4650: quietly joining the brothers in the workshop.
4651: 
4652: They had already got on their aprons and paper caps, and Adam was
4653: standing with his left hand on Seth’s shoulder, while he pointed with
4654: the hammer in his right to some boards which they were looking at.
4655: Their backs were turned towards the door by which Dinah entered, and
4656: she came in so gently that they were not aware of her presence till
4657: they heard her voice saying, “Seth Bede!” Seth started, and they both
4658: turned round. Dinah looked as if she did not see Adam, and fixed her
4659: eyes on Seth’s face, saying with calm kindness, “I won’t say farewell.
4660: I shall see you again when you come from work. So as I’m at the farm
4661: before dark, it will be quite soon enough.”
4662: 
4663: “Thank you, Dinah; I should like to walk home with you once more. It’ll
4664: perhaps be the last time.”
4665: 
4666: There was a little tremor in Seth’s voice. Dinah put out her hand and
4667: said, “You’ll have sweet peace in your mind to-day, Seth, for your
4668: tenderness and long-suffering towards your aged mother.”
4669: 
4670: She turned round and left the workshop as quickly and quietly as she
4671: had entered it. Adam had been observing her closely all the while, but
4672: she had not looked at him. As soon as she was gone, he said, “I don’t
4673: wonder at thee for loving her, Seth. She’s got a face like a lily.”
4674: 
4675: Seth’s soul rushed to his eyes and lips: he had never yet confessed his
4676: secret to Adam, but now he felt a delicious sense of disburdenment, as
4677: he answered, “Aye, Addy, I do love her—too much, I doubt. But she
4678: doesna love me, lad, only as one child o’ God loves another. She’ll
4679: never love any man as a husband—that’s my belief.”
4680: 
4681: “Nay, lad, there’s no telling; thee mustna lose heart. She’s made out
4682: o’ stuff with a finer grain than most o’ the women; I can see that
4683: clear enough. But if she’s better than they are in other things, I
4684: canna think she’ll fall short of ’em in loving.”
4685: 
4686: No more was said. Seth set out to the village, and Adam began his work
4687: on the coffin.
4688: 
4689: “God help the lad, and me too,” he thought, as he lifted the board.
4690: “We’re like enough to find life a tough job—hard work inside and out.
4691: It’s a strange thing to think of a man as can lift a chair with his
4692: teeth and walk fifty mile on end, trembling and turning hot and cold at
4693: only a look from one woman out of all the rest i’ the world. It’s a
4694: mystery we can give no account of; but no more we can of the sprouting
4695: o’ the seed, for that matter.”
4696: 
4697: 
4698: 
4699: 
4700: Chapter XII
4701: In the Wood
4702: 
4703: 
4704: That same Thursday morning, as Arthur Donnithorne was moving about in
4705: his dressing-room seeing his well-looking British person reflected in
4706: the old-fashioned mirrors, and stared at, from a dingy olive-green
4707: piece of tapestry, by Pharaoh’s daughter and her maidens, who ought to
4708: have been minding the infant Moses, he was holding a discussion with
4709: himself, which, by the time his valet was tying the black silk sling
4710: over his shoulder, had issued in a distinct practical resolution.
4711: 
4712: “I mean to go to Eagledale and fish for a week or so,” he said aloud.
4713: “I shall take you with me, Pym, and set off this morning; so be ready
4714: by half-past eleven.”
4715: 
4716: The low whistle, which had assisted him in arriving at this resolution,
4717: here broke out into his loudest ringing tenor, and the corridor, as he
4718: hurried along it, echoed to his favourite song from the Beggar’s Opera,
4719: “When the heart of a man is oppressed with care.” Not an heroic strain;
4720: nevertheless Arthur felt himself very heroic as he strode towards the
4721: stables to give his orders about the horses. His own approbation was
4722: necessary to him, and it was not an approbation to be enjoyed quite
4723: gratuitously; it must be won by a fair amount of merit. He had never
4724: yet forfeited that approbation, and he had considerable reliance on his
4725: own virtues. No young man could confess his faults more candidly;
4726: candour was one of his favourite virtues; and how can a man’s candour
4727: be seen in all its lustre unless he has a few failings to talk of? But
4728: he had an agreeable confidence that his faults were all of a generous
4729: kind—impetuous, warm-blooded, leonine; never crawling, crafty,
4730: reptilian. It was not possible for Arthur Donnithorne to do anything
4731: mean, dastardly, or cruel. “No! I’m a devil of a fellow for getting
4732: myself into a hobble, but I always take care the load shall fall on my
4733: own shoulders.” Unhappily, there is no inherent poetical justice in
4734: hobbles, and they will sometimes obstinately refuse to inflict their
4735: worst consequences on the prime offender, in spite of his loudly
4736: expressed wish. It was entirely owing to this deficiency in the scheme
4737: of things that Arthur had ever brought any one into trouble besides
4738: himself. He was nothing if not good-natured; and all his pictures of
4739: the future, when he should come into the estate, were made up of a
4740: prosperous, contented tenantry, adoring their landlord, who would be
4741: the model of an English gentleman—mansion in first-rate order, all
4742: elegance and high taste—jolly housekeeping, finest stud in
4743: Loamshire—purse open to all public objects—in short, everything as
4744: different as possible from what was now associated with the name of
4745: Donnithorne. And one of the first good actions he would perform in that
4746: future should be to increase Irwine’s income for the vicarage of
4747: Hayslope, so that he might keep a carriage for his mother and sisters.
4748: His hearty affection for the rector dated from the age of frocks and
4749: trousers. It was an affection partly filial, partly fraternal—fraternal
4750: enough to make him like Irwine’s company better than that of most
4751: younger men, and filial enough to make him shrink strongly from
4752: incurring Irwine’s disapprobation.
4753: 
4754: You perceive that Arthur Donnithorne was “a good fellow”—all his
4755: college friends thought him such. He couldn’t bear to see any one
4756: uncomfortable; he would have been sorry even in his angriest moods for
4757: any harm to happen to his grandfather; and his Aunt Lydia herself had
4758: the benefit of that soft-heartedness which he bore towards the whole
4759: sex. Whether he would have self-mastery enough to be always as harmless
4760: and purely beneficent as his good-nature led him to desire, was a
4761: question that no one had yet decided against him; he was but
4762: twenty-one, you remember, and we don’t inquire too closely into
4763: character in the case of a handsome generous young fellow, who will
4764: have property enough to support numerous peccadilloes—who, if he should
4765: unfortunately break a man’s legs in his rash driving, will be able to
4766: pension him handsomely; or if he should happen to spoil a woman’s
4767: existence for her, will make it up to her with expensive _bon-bons_,
4768: packed up and directed by his own hand. It would be ridiculous to be
4769: prying and analytic in such cases, as if one were inquiring into the
4770: character of a confidential clerk. We use round, general, gentlemanly
4771: epithets about a young man of birth and fortune; and ladies, with that
4772: fine intuition which is the distinguishing attribute of their sex, see
4773: at once that he is “nice.” The chances are that he will go through life
4774: without scandalizing any one; a seaworthy vessel that no one would
4775: refuse to insure. Ships, certainly, are liable to casualties, which
4776: sometimes make terribly evident some flaw in their construction that
4777: would never have been discoverable in smooth water; and many a “good
4778: fellow,” through a disastrous combination of circumstances, has
4779: undergone a like betrayal.
4780: 
4781: But we have no fair ground for entertaining unfavourable auguries
4782: concerning Arthur Donnithorne, who this morning proves himself capable
4783: of a prudent resolution founded on conscience. One thing is clear:
4784: Nature has taken care that he shall never go far astray with perfect
4785: comfort and satisfaction to himself; he will never get beyond that
4786: border-land of sin, where he will be perpetually harassed by assaults
4787: from the other side of the boundary. He will never be a courtier of
4788: Vice, and wear her orders in his button-hole.
4789: 
4790: It was about ten o’clock, and the sun was shining brilliantly;
4791: everything was looking lovelier for the yesterday’s rain. It is a
4792: pleasant thing on such a morning to walk along the well-rolled gravel
4793: on one’s way to the stables, meditating an excursion. But the scent of
4794: the stables, which, in a natural state of things, ought to be among the
4795: soothing influences of a man’s life, always brought with it some
4796: irritation to Arthur. There was no having his own way in the stables;
4797: everything was managed in the stingiest fashion. His grandfather
4798: persisted in retaining as head groom an old dolt whom no sort of lever
4799: could move out of his old habits, and who was allowed to hire a
4800: succession of raw Loamshire lads as his subordinates, one of whom had
4801: lately tested a new pair of shears by clipping an oblong patch on
4802: Arthur’s bay mare. This state of things is naturally embittering; one
4803: can put up with annoyances in the house, but to have the stable made a
4804: scene of vexation and disgust is a point beyond what human flesh and
4805: blood can be expected to endure long together without danger of
4806: misanthropy.
4807: 
4808: Old John’s wooden, deep-wrinkled face was the first object that met
4809: Arthur’s eyes as he entered the stable-yard, and it quite poisoned for
4810: him the bark of the two bloodhounds that kept watch there. He could
4811: never speak quite patiently to the old blockhead.
4812: 
4813: “You must have Meg saddled for me and brought to the door at half-past
4814: eleven, and I shall want Rattler saddled for Pym at the same time. Do
4815: you hear?”
4816: 
4817: “Yes, I hear, I hear, Cap’n,” said old John very deliberately,
4818: following the young master into the stable. John considered a young
4819: master as the natural enemy of an old servant, and young people in
4820: general as a poor contrivance for carrying on the world.
4821: 
4822: Arthur went in for the sake of patting Meg, declining as far as
4823: possible to see anything in the stables, lest he should lose his temper
4824: before breakfast. The pretty creature was in one of the inner stables,
4825: and turned her mild head as her master came beside her. Little Trot, a
4826: tiny spaniel, her inseparable companion in the stable, was comfortably
4827: curled up on her back.
4828: 
4829: “Well, Meg, my pretty girl,” said Arthur, patting her neck, “we’ll have
4830: a glorious canter this morning.”
4831: 
4832: “Nay, your honour, I donna see as that can be,” said John.
4833: 
4834: “Not be? Why not?”
4835: 
4836: “Why, she’s got lamed.”
4837: 
4838: “Lamed, confound you! What do you mean?”
4839: 
4840: “Why, th’ lad took her too close to Dalton’s hosses, an’ one on ’em
4841: flung out at her, an’ she’s got her shank bruised o’ the near foreleg.”
4842: 
4843: The judicious historian abstains from narrating precisely what ensued.
4844: You understand that there was a great deal of strong language, mingled
4845: with soothing “who-ho’s” while the leg was examined; that John stood by
4846: with quite as much emotion as if he had been a cunningly carved
4847: crab-tree walking-stick, and that Arthur Donnithorne presently repassed
4848: the iron gates of the pleasure-ground without singing as he went.
4849: 
4850: He considered himself thoroughly disappointed and annoyed. There was
4851: not another mount in the stable for himself and his servant besides Meg
4852: and Rattler. It was vexatious; just when he wanted to get out of the
4853: way for a week or two. It seemed culpable in Providence to allow such a
4854: combination of circumstances. To be shut up at the Chase with a broken
4855: arm when every other fellow in his regiment was enjoying himself at
4856: Windsor—shut up with his grandfather, who had the same sort of
4857: affection for him as for his parchment deeds! And to be disgusted at
4858: every turn with the management of the house and the estate! In such
4859: circumstances a man necessarily gets in an ill humour, and works off
4860: the irritation by some excess or other. “Salkeld would have drunk a
4861: bottle of port every day,” he muttered to himself, “but I’m not well
4862: seasoned enough for that. Well, since I can’t go to Eagledale, I’ll
4863: have a gallop on Rattler to Norburne this morning, and lunch with
4864: Gawaine.”
4865: 
4866: Behind this explicit resolution there lay an implicit one. If he
4867: lunched with Gawaine and lingered chatting, he should not reach the
4868: Chase again till nearly five, when Hetty would be safe out of his sight
4869: in the housekeeper’s room; and when she set out to go home, it would be
4870: his lazy time after dinner, so he should keep out of her way
4871: altogether. There really would have been no harm in being kind to the
4872: little thing, and it was worth dancing with a dozen ballroom belles
4873: only to look at Hetty for half an hour. But perhaps he had better not
4874: take any more notice of her; it might put notions into her head, as
4875: Irwine had hinted; though Arthur, for his part, thought girls were not
4876: by any means so soft and easily bruised; indeed, he had generally found
4877: them twice as cool and cunning as he was himself. As for any real harm
4878: in Hetty’s case, it was out of the question: Arthur Donnithorne
4879: accepted his own bond for himself with perfect confidence.
4880: 
4881: So the twelve o’clock sun saw him galloping towards Norburne; and by
4882: good fortune Halsell Common lay in his road and gave him some fine
4883: leaps for Rattler. Nothing like “taking” a few bushes and ditches for
4884: exorcising a demon; and it is really astonishing that the Centaurs,
4885: with their immense advantages in this way, have left so bad a
4886: reputation in history.
4887: 
4888: After this, you will perhaps be surprised to hear that although Gawaine
4889: was at home, the hand of the dial in the courtyard had scarcely cleared
4890: the last stroke of three when Arthur returned through the
4891: entrance-gates, got down from the panting Rattler, and went into the
4892: house to take a hasty luncheon. But I believe there have been men since
4893: his day who have ridden a long way to avoid a rencontre, and then
4894: galloped hastily back lest they should miss it. It is the favourite
4895: stratagem of our passions to sham a retreat, and to turn sharp round
4896: upon us at the moment we have made up our minds that the day is our
4897: own.
4898: 
4899: “The cap’n’s been ridin’ the devil’s own pace,” said Dalton the
4900: coachman, whose person stood out in high relief as he smoked his pipe
4901: against the stable wall, when John brought up Rattler.
4902: 
4903: “An’ I wish he’d get the devil to do’s grooming for’n,” growled John.
4904: 
4905: “Aye; he’d hev a deal haimabler groom nor what he has now,” observed
4906: Dalton—and the joke appeared to him so good that, being left alone upon
4907: the scene, he continued at intervals to take his pipe from his mouth in
4908: order to wink at an imaginary audience and shake luxuriously with a
4909: silent, ventral laughter, mentally rehearsing the dialogue from the
4910: beginning, that he might recite it with effect in the servants’ hall.
4911: 
4912: When Arthur went up to his dressing-room again after luncheon, it was
4913: inevitable that the debate he had had with himself there earlier in the
4914: day should flash across his mind; but it was impossible for him now to
4915: dwell on the remembrance—impossible to recall the feelings and
4916: reflections which had been decisive with him then, any more than to
4917: recall the peculiar scent of the air that had freshened him when he
4918: first opened his window. The desire to see Hetty had rushed back like
4919: an ill-stemmed current; he was amazed himself at the force with which
4920: this trivial fancy seemed to grasp him: he was even rather tremulous as
4921: he brushed his hair—pooh! it was riding in that break-neck way. It was
4922: because he had made a serious affair of an idle matter, by thinking of
4923: it as if it were of any consequence. He would amuse himself by seeing
4924: Hetty to-day, and get rid of the whole thing from his mind. It was all
4925: Irwine’s fault. “If Irwine had said nothing, I shouldn’t have thought
4926: half so much of Hetty as of Meg’s lameness.” However, it was just the
4927: sort of day for lolling in the Hermitage, and he would go and finish
4928: Dr. Moore’s _Zeluco_ there before dinner. The Hermitage stood in
4929: Fir-tree Grove—the way Hetty was sure to come in walking from the Hall
4930: Farm. So nothing could be simpler and more natural: meeting Hetty was a
4931: mere circumstance of his walk, not its object.
4932: 
4933: Arthur’s shadow flitted rather faster among the sturdy oaks of the
4934: Chase than might have been expected from the shadow of a tired man on a
4935: warm afternoon, and it was still scarcely four o’clock when he stood
4936: before the tall narrow gate leading into the delicious labyrinthine
4937: wood which skirted one side of the Chase, and which was called Fir-tree
4938: Grove, not because the firs were many, but because they were few. It
4939: was a wood of beeches and limes, with here and there a light
4940: silver-stemmed birch—just the sort of wood most haunted by the nymphs:
4941: you see their white sunlit limbs gleaming athwart the boughs, or
4942: peeping from behind the smooth-sweeping outline of a tall lime; you
4943: hear their soft liquid laughter—but if you look with a too curious
4944: sacrilegious eye, they vanish behind the silvery beeches, they make you
4945: believe that their voice was only a running brooklet, perhaps they
4946: metamorphose themselves into a tawny squirrel that scampers away and
4947: mocks you from the topmost bough. It was not a grove with measured
4948: grass or rolled gravel for you to tread upon, but with narrow,
4949: hollow-shaped, earthy paths, edged with faint dashes of delicate
4950: moss—paths which look as if they were made by the free will of the
4951: trees and underwood, moving reverently aside to look at the tall queen
4952: of the white-footed nymphs.
4953: 
4954: It was along the broadest of these paths that Arthur Donnithorne
4955: passed, under an avenue of limes and beeches. It was a still
4956: afternoon—the golden light was lingering languidly among the upper
4957: boughs, only glancing down here and there on the purple pathway and its
4958: edge of faintly sprinkled moss: an afternoon in which destiny disguises
4959: her cold awful face behind a hazy radiant veil, encloses us in warm
4960: downy wings, and poisons us with violet-scented breath. Arthur strolled
4961: along carelessly, with a book under his arm, but not looking on the
4962: ground as meditative men are apt to do; his eyes _would_ fix themselves
4963: on the distant bend in the road round which a little figure must surely
4964: appear before long. Ah! There she comes. First a bright patch of
4965: colour, like a tropic bird among the boughs; then a tripping figure,
4966: with a round hat on, and a small basket under her arm; then a
4967: deep-blushing, almost frightened, but bright-smiling girl, making her
4968: curtsy with a fluttered yet happy glance, as Arthur came up to her. If
4969: Arthur had had time to think at all, he would have thought it strange
4970: that he should feel fluttered too, be conscious of blushing too—in
4971: fact, look and feel as foolish as if he had been taken by surprise
4972: instead of meeting just what he expected. Poor things! It was a pity
4973: they were not in that golden age of childhood when they would have
4974: stood face to face, eyeing each other with timid liking, then given
4975: each other a little butterfly kiss, and toddled off to play together.
4976: Arthur would have gone home to his silk-curtained cot, and Hetty to her
4977: home-spun pillow, and both would have slept without dreams, and
4978: to-morrow would have been a life hardly conscious of a yesterday.
4979: 
4980: Arthur turned round and walked by Hetty’s side without giving a reason.
4981: They were alone together for the first time. What an overpowering
4982: presence that first privacy is! He actually dared not look at this
4983: little butter-maker for the first minute or two. As for Hetty, her feet
4984: rested on a cloud, and she was borne along by warm zephyrs; she had
4985: forgotten her rose-coloured ribbons; she was no more conscious of her
4986: limbs than if her childish soul had passed into a water-lily, resting
4987: on a liquid bed and warmed by the midsummer sun-beams. It may seem a
4988: contradiction, but Arthur gathered a certain carelessness and
4989: confidence from his timidity: it was an entirely different state of
4990: mind from what he had expected in such a meeting with Hetty; and full
4991: as he was of vague feeling, there was room, in those moments of
4992: silence, for the thought that his previous debates and scruples were
4993: needless.
4994: 
4995: “You are quite right to choose this way of coming to the Chase,” he
4996: said at last, looking down at Hetty; “it is so much prettier as well as
4997: shorter than coming by either of the lodges.”
4998: 
4999: “Yes, sir,” Hetty answered, with a tremulous, almost whispering voice.
5000: She didn’t know one bit how to speak to a gentleman like Mr. Arthur,
5001: and her very vanity made her more coy of speech.
5002: 
5003: “Do you come every week to see Mrs. Pomfret?”
5004: 
5005: “Yes, sir, every Thursday, only when she’s got to go out with Miss
5006: Donnithorne.”
5007: 
5008: “And she’s teaching you something, is she?”
5009: 
5010: “Yes, sir, the lace-mending as she learnt abroad, and the
5011: stocking-mending—it looks just like the stocking, you can’t tell it’s
5012: been mended; and she teaches me cutting-out too.”
5013: 
5014: “What! are _you_ going to be a lady’s maid?”
5015: 
5016: “I should like to be one very much indeed.” Hetty spoke more audibly
5017: now, but still rather tremulously; she thought, perhaps she seemed as
5018: stupid to Captain Donnithorne as Luke Britton did to her.
5019: 
5020: “I suppose Mrs. Pomfret always expects you at this time?”
5021: 
5022: “She expects me at four o’clock. I’m rather late to-day, because my
5023: aunt couldn’t spare me; but the regular time is four, because that
5024: gives us time before Miss Donnithorne’s bell rings.”
5025: 
5026: “Ah, then, I must not keep you now, else I should like to show you the
5027: Hermitage. Did you ever see it?”
5028: 
5029: “No, sir.”
5030: 
5031: “This is the walk where we turn up to it. But we must not go now. I’ll
5032: show it you some other time, if you’d like to see it.”
5033: 
5034: “Yes, please, sir.”
5035: 
5036: “Do you always come back this way in the evening, or are you afraid to
5037: come so lonely a road?”
5038: 
5039: “Oh no, sir, it’s never late; I always set out by eight o’clock, and
5040: it’s so light now in the evening. My aunt would be angry with me if I
5041: didn’t get home before nine.”
5042: 
5043: “Perhaps Craig, the gardener, comes to take care of you?”
5044: 
5045: A deep blush overspread Hetty’s face and neck. “I’m sure he doesn’t;
5046: I’m sure he never did; I wouldn’t let him; I don’t like him,” she said
5047: hastily, and the tears of vexation had come so fast that before she had
5048: done speaking a bright drop rolled down her hot cheek. Then she felt
5049: ashamed to death that she was crying, and for one long instant her
5050: happiness was all gone. But in the next she felt an arm steal round
5051: her, and a gentle voice said, “Why, Hetty, what makes you cry? I didn’t
5052: mean to vex you. I wouldn’t vex you for the world, you little blossom.
5053: Come, don’t cry; look at me, else I shall think you won’t forgive me.”
5054: 
5055: Arthur had laid his hand on the soft arm that was nearest to him, and
5056: was stooping towards Hetty with a look of coaxing entreaty. Hetty
5057: lifted her long dewy lashes, and met the eyes that were bent towards
5058: her with a sweet, timid, beseeching look. What a space of time those
5059: three moments were while their eyes met and his arms touched her! Love
5060: is such a simple thing when we have only one-and-twenty summers and a
5061: sweet girl of seventeen trembles under our glance, as if she were a bud
5062: first opening her heart with wondering rapture to the morning. Such
5063: young unfurrowed souls roll to meet each other like two velvet peaches
5064: that touch softly and are at rest; they mingle as easily as two
5065: brooklets that ask for nothing but to entwine themselves and ripple
5066: with ever-interlacing curves in the leafiest hiding-places. While
5067: Arthur gazed into Hetty’s dark beseeching eyes, it made no difference
5068: to him what sort of English she spoke; and even if hoops and powder had
5069: been in fashion, he would very likely not have been sensible just then
5070: that Hetty wanted those signs of high breeding.
5071: 
5072: But they started asunder with beating hearts: something had fallen on
5073: the ground with a rattling noise; it was Hetty’s basket; all her little
5074: workwoman’s matters were scattered on the path, some of them showing a
5075: capability of rolling to great lengths. There was much to be done in
5076: picking up, and not a word was spoken; but when Arthur hung the basket
5077: over her arm again, the poor child felt a strange difference in his
5078: look and manner. He just pressed her hand, and said, with a look and
5079: tone that were almost chilling to her, “I have been hindering you; I
5080: must not keep you any longer now. You will be expected at the house.
5081: Good-bye.”
5082: 
5083: Without waiting for her to speak, he turned away from her and hurried
5084: back towards the road that led to the Hermitage, leaving Hetty to
5085: pursue her way in a strange dream that seemed to have begun in
5086: bewildering delight and was now passing into contrarieties and sadness.
5087: Would he meet her again as she came home? Why had he spoken almost as
5088: if he were displeased with her? And then run away so suddenly? She
5089: cried, hardly knowing why.
5090: 
5091: Arthur too was very uneasy, but his feelings were lit up for him by a
5092: more distinct consciousness. He hurried to the Hermitage, which stood
5093: in the heart of the wood, unlocked the door with a hasty wrench,
5094: slammed it after him, pitched _Zeluco_ into the most distant corner,
5095: and thrusting his right hand into his pocket, first walked four or five
5096: times up and down the scanty length of the little room, and then seated
5097: himself on the ottoman in an uncomfortable stiff way, as we often do
5098: when we wish not to abandon ourselves to feeling.
5099: 
5100: He was getting in love with Hetty—that was quite plain. He was ready to
5101: pitch everything else—no matter where—for the sake of surrendering
5102: himself to this delicious feeling which had just disclosed itself. It
5103: was no use blinking the fact now—they would get too fond of each other,
5104: if he went on taking notice of her—and what would come of it? He should
5105: have to go away in a few weeks, and the poor little thing would be
5106: miserable. He _must not_ see her alone again; he must keep out of her
5107: way. What a fool he was for coming back from Gawaine’s!
5108: 
5109: He got up and threw open the windows, to let in the soft breath of the
5110: afternoon, and the healthy scent of the firs that made a belt round the
5111: Hermitage. The soft air did not help his resolution, as he leaned out
5112: and looked into the leafy distance. But he considered his resolution
5113: sufficiently fixed: there was no need to debate with himself any
5114: longer. He had made up his mind not to meet Hetty again; and now he
5115: might give himself up to thinking how immensely agreeable it would be
5116: if circumstances were different—how pleasant it would have been to meet
5117: her this evening as she came back, and put his arm round her again and
5118: look into her sweet face. He wondered if the dear little thing were
5119: thinking of him too—twenty to one she was. How beautiful her eyes were
5120: with the tear on their lashes! He would like to satisfy his soul for a
5121: day with looking at them, and he _must_ see her again—he must see her,
5122: simply to remove any false impression from her mind about his manner to
5123: her just now. He would behave in a quiet, kind way to her—just to
5124: prevent her from going home with her head full of wrong fancies. Yes,
5125: that would be the best thing to do after all.
5126: 
5127: It was a long while—more than an hour before Arthur had brought his
5128: meditations to this point; but once arrived there, he could stay no
5129: longer at the Hermitage. The time must be filled up with movement until
5130: he should see Hetty again. And it was already late enough to go and
5131: dress for dinner, for his grandfather’s dinner-hour was six.
5132: 
5133: 
5134: 
5135: 
5136: Chapter XIII
5137: Evening in the Wood
5138: 
5139: 
5140: It happened that Mrs. Pomfret had had a slight quarrel with Mrs. Best,
5141: the housekeeper, on this Thursday morning—a fact which had two
5142: consequences highly convenient to Hetty. It caused Mrs. Pomfret to have
5143: tea sent up to her own room, and it inspired that exemplary lady’s maid
5144: with so lively a recollection of former passages in Mrs. Best’s
5145: conduct, and of dialogues in which Mrs. Best had decidedly the
5146: inferiority as an interlocutor with Mrs. Pomfret, that Hetty required
5147: no more presence of mind than was demanded for using her needle, and
5148: throwing in an occasional “yes” or “no.” She would have wanted to put
5149: on her hat earlier than usual; only she had told Captain Donnithorne
5150: that she usually set out about eight o’clock, and if he _should_ go to
5151: the Grove again expecting to see her, and she should be gone! Would he
5152: come? Her little butterfly soul fluttered incessantly between memory
5153: and dubious expectation. At last the minute-hand of the old-fashioned
5154: brazen-faced timepiece was on the last quarter to eight, and there was
5155: every reason for its being time to get ready for departure. Even Mrs.
5156: Pomfret’s preoccupied mind did not prevent her from noticing what
5157: looked like a new flush of beauty in the little thing as she tied on
5158: her hat before the looking-glass.
5159: 
5160: “That child gets prettier and prettier every day, I do believe,” was
5161: her inward comment. “The more’s the pity. She’ll get neither a place
5162: nor a husband any the sooner for it. Sober well-to-do men don’t like
5163: such pretty wives. When I was a girl, I was more admired than if I had
5164: been so very pretty. However, she’s reason to be grateful to me for
5165: teaching her something to get her bread with, better than farm-house
5166: work. They always told me I was good-natured—and that’s the truth, and
5167: to my hurt too, else there’s them in this house that wouldn’t be here
5168: now to lord it over me in the housekeeper’s room.”
5169: 
5170: Hetty walked hastily across the short space of pleasure-ground which
5171: she had to traverse, dreading to meet Mr. Craig, to whom she could
5172: hardly have spoken civilly. How relieved she was when she had got
5173: safely under the oaks and among the fern of the Chase! Even then she
5174: was as ready to be startled as the deer that leaped away at her
5175: approach. She thought nothing of the evening light that lay gently in
5176: the grassy alleys between the fern, and made the beauty of their living
5177: green more visible than it had been in the overpowering flood of noon:
5178: she thought of nothing that was present. She only saw something that
5179: was possible: Mr. Arthur Donnithorne coming to meet her again along the
5180: Fir-tree Grove. That was the foreground of Hetty’s picture; behind it
5181: lay a bright hazy something—days that were not to be as the other days
5182: of her life had been. It was as if she had been wooed by a river-god,
5183: who might any time take her to his wondrous halls below a watery
5184: heaven. There was no knowing what would come, since this strange
5185: entrancing delight had come. If a chest full of lace and satin and
5186: jewels had been sent her from some unknown source, how could she but
5187: have thought that her whole lot was going to change, and that to-morrow
5188: some still more bewildering joy would befall her? Hetty had never read
5189: a novel; if she had ever seen one, I think the words would have been
5190: too hard for her; how then could she find a shape for her expectations?
5191: They were as formless as the sweet languid odours of the garden at the
5192: Chase, which had floated past her as she walked by the gate.
5193: 
5194: She is at another gate now—that leading into Fir-tree Grove. She enters
5195: the wood, where it is already twilight, and at every step she takes,
5196: the fear at her heart becomes colder. If he should not come! Oh, how
5197: dreary it was—the thought of going out at the other end of the wood,
5198: into the unsheltered road, without having seen him. She reaches the
5199: first turning towards the Hermitage, walking slowly—he is not there.
5200: She hates the leveret that runs across the path; she hates everything
5201: that is not what she longs for. She walks on, happy whenever she is
5202: coming to a bend in the road, for perhaps he is behind it. No. She is
5203: beginning to cry: her heart has swelled so, the tears stand in her
5204: eyes; she gives one great sob, while the corners of her mouth quiver,
5205: and the tears roll down.
5206: 
5207: She doesn’t know that there is another turning to the Hermitage, that
5208: she is close against it, and that Arthur Donnithorne is only a few
5209: yards from her, full of one thought, and a thought of which she only is
5210: the object. He is going to see Hetty again: that is the longing which
5211: has been growing through the last three hours to a feverish thirst.
5212: Not, of course, to speak in the caressing way into which he had
5213: unguardedly fallen before dinner, but to set things right with her by a
5214: kindness which would have the air of friendly civility, and prevent her
5215: from running away with wrong notions about their mutual relation.
5216: 
5217: If Hetty had known he was there, she would not have cried; and it would
5218: have been better, for then Arthur would perhaps have behaved as wisely
5219: as he had intended. As it was, she started when he appeared at the end
5220: of the side-alley, and looked up at him with two great drops rolling
5221: down her cheeks. What else could he do but speak to her in a soft,
5222: soothing tone, as if she were a bright-eyed spaniel with a thorn in her
5223: foot?
5224: 
5225: “Has something frightened you, Hetty? Have you seen anything in the
5226: wood? Don’t be frightened—I’ll take care of you now.”
5227: 
5228: Hetty was blushing so, she didn’t know whether she was happy or
5229: miserable. To be crying again—what did gentlemen think of girls who
5230: cried in that way? She felt unable even to say “no,” but could only
5231: look away from him and wipe the tears from her cheek. Not before a
5232: great drop had fallen on her rose-coloured strings—she knew that quite
5233: well.
5234: 
5235: “Come, be cheerful again. Smile at me, and tell me what’s the matter.
5236: Come, tell me.”
5237: 
5238: Hetty turned her head towards him, whispered, “I thought you wouldn’t
5239: come,” and slowly got courage to lift her eyes to him. That look was
5240: too much: he must have had eyes of Egyptian granite not to look too
5241: lovingly in return.
5242: 
5243: “You little frightened bird! Little tearful rose! Silly pet! You won’t
5244: cry again, now I’m with you, will you?”
5245: 
5246: Ah, he doesn’t know in the least what he is saying. This is not what he
5247: meant to say. His arm is stealing round the waist again; it is
5248: tightening its clasp; he is bending his face nearer and nearer to the
5249: round cheek; his lips are meeting those pouting child-lips, and for a
5250: long moment time has vanished. He may be a shepherd in Arcadia for
5251: aught he knows, he may be the first youth kissing the first maiden, he
5252: may be Eros himself, sipping the lips of Psyche—it is all one.
5253: 
5254: There was no speaking for minutes after. They walked along with beating
5255: hearts till they came within sight of the gate at the end of the wood.
5256: Then they looked at each other, not quite as they had looked before,
5257: for in their eyes there was the memory of a kiss.
5258: 
5259: But already something bitter had begun to mingle itself with the
5260: fountain of sweets: already Arthur was uncomfortable. He took his arm
5261: from Hetty’s waist, and said, “Here we are, almost at the end of the
5262: Grove. I wonder how late it is,” he added, pulling out his watch.
5263: “Twenty minutes past eight—but my watch is too fast. However, I’d
5264: better not go any further now. Trot along quickly with your little
5265: feet, and get home safely. Good-bye.”
5266: 
5267: He took her hand, and looked at her half-sadly, half with a constrained
5268: smile. Hetty’s eyes seemed to beseech him not to go away yet; but he
5269: patted her cheek and said “Good-bye” again. She was obliged to turn
5270: away from him and go on.
5271: 
5272: As for Arthur, he rushed back through the wood, as if he wanted to put
5273: a wide space between himself and Hetty. He would not go to the
5274: Hermitage again; he remembered how he had debated with himself there
5275: before dinner, and it had all come to nothing—worse than nothing. He
5276: walked right on into the Chase, glad to get out of the Grove, which
5277: surely was haunted by his evil genius. Those beeches and smooth
5278: limes—there was something enervating in the very sight of them; but the
5279: strong knotted old oaks had no bending languor in them—the sight of
5280: them would give a man some energy. Arthur lost himself among the narrow
5281: openings in the fern, winding about without seeking any issue, till the
5282: twilight deepened almost to night under the great boughs, and the hare
5283: looked black as it darted across his path.
5284: 
5285: He was feeling much more strongly than he had done in the morning: it
5286: was as if his horse had wheeled round from a leap and dared to dispute
5287: his mastery. He was dissatisfied with himself, irritated, mortified. He
5288: no sooner fixed his mind on the probable consequences of giving way to
5289: the emotions which had stolen over him to-day—of continuing to notice
5290: Hetty, of allowing himself any opportunity for such slight caresses as
5291: he had been betrayed into already—than he refused to believe such a
5292: future possible for himself. To flirt with Hetty was a very different
5293: affair from flirting with a pretty girl of his own station: that was
5294: understood to be an amusement on both sides, or, if it became serious,
5295: there was no obstacle to marriage. But this little thing would be
5296: spoken ill of directly, if she happened to be seen walking with him;
5297: and then those excellent people, the Poysers, to whom a good name was
5298: as precious as if they had the best blood in the land in their veins—he
5299: should hate himself if he made a scandal of that sort, on the estate
5300: that was to be his own some day, and among tenants by whom he liked,
5301: above all, to be respected. He could no more believe that he should so
5302: fall in his own esteem than that he should break both his legs and go
5303: on crutches all the rest of his life. He couldn’t imagine himself in
5304: that position; it was too odious, too unlike him.
5305: 
5306: And even if no one knew anything about it, they might get too fond of
5307: each other, and then there could be nothing but the misery of parting,
5308: after all. No gentleman, out of a ballad, could marry a farmer’s niece.
5309: There must be an end to the whole thing at once. It was too foolish.
5310: 
5311: And yet he had been so determined this morning, before he went to
5312: Gawaine’s; and while he was there something had taken hold of him and
5313: made him gallop back. It seemed he couldn’t quite depend on his own
5314: resolution, as he had thought he could; he almost wished his arm would
5315: get painful again, and then he should think of nothing but the comfort
5316: it would be to get rid of the pain. There was no knowing what impulse
5317: might seize him to-morrow, in this confounded place, where there was
5318: nothing to occupy him imperiously through the livelong day. What could
5319: he do to secure himself from any more of this folly?
5320: 
5321: There was but one resource. He would go and tell Irwine—tell him
5322: everything. The mere act of telling it would make it seem trivial; the
5323: temptation would vanish, as the charm of fond words vanishes when one
5324: repeats them to the indifferent. In every way it would help him to tell
5325: Irwine. He would ride to Broxton Rectory the first thing after
5326: breakfast to-morrow.
5327: 
5328: Arthur had no sooner come to this determination than he began to think
5329: which of the paths would lead him home, and made as short a walk
5330: thither as he could. He felt sure he should sleep now: he had had
5331: enough to tire him, and there was no more need for him to think.

5336: Chapter XIV
5337: The Return Home
5338: 
5339: 
5340: While that parting in the wood was happening, there was a parting in
5341: the cottage too, and Lisbeth had stood with Adam at the door, straining
5342: her aged eyes to get the last glimpse of Seth and Dinah, as they
5343: mounted the opposite slope.
5344: 
5345: “Eh, I’m loath to see the last on her,” she said to Adam, as they
5346: turned into the house again. “I’d ha’ been willin’ t’ ha’ her about me
5347: till I died and went to lie by my old man. She’d make it easier
5348: dyin’—she spakes so gentle an’ moves about so still. I could be fast
5349: sure that pictur’ was drawed for her i’ thy new Bible—th’ angel
5350: a-sittin’ on the big stone by the grave. Eh, I wouldna mind ha’in a
5351: daughter like that; but nobody ne’er marries them as is good for
5352: aught.”
5353: 
5354: “Well, Mother, I hope thee wilt have her for a daughter; for Seth’s got
5355: a liking for her, and I hope she’ll get a liking for Seth in time.”
5356: 
5357: “Where’s th’ use o’ talkin’ a-that’n? She caresna for Seth. She’s goin’
5358: away twenty mile aff. How’s she to get a likin’ for him, I’d like to
5359: know? No more nor the cake ’ull come wi’out the leaven. Thy figurin’
5360: books might ha’ tould thee better nor that, I should think, else thee
5361: mightst as well read the commin print, as Seth allays does.”
5362: 
5363: “Nay, Mother,” said Adam, laughing, “the figures tell us a fine deal,
5364: and we couldn’t go far without ’em, but they don’t tell us about
5365: folks’s feelings. It’s a nicer job to calculate _them_. But Seth’s as
5366: good-hearted a lad as ever handled a tool, and plenty o’ sense, and
5367: good-looking too; and he’s got the same way o’ thinking as Dinah. He
5368: deserves to win her, though there’s no denying she’s a rare bit o’
5369: workmanship. You don’t see such women turned off the wheel every day.”
5370: 
5371: “Eh, thee’t allays stick up for thy brother. Thee’st been just the
5372: same, e’er sin’ ye war little uns together. Thee wart allays for
5373: halving iverything wi’ him. But what’s Seth got to do with marryin’, as
5374: is on’y three-an’-twenty? He’d more need to learn an’ lay by sixpence.
5375: An’ as for his desarving her—she’s two ’ear older nor Seth: she’s
5376: pretty near as old as thee. But that’s the way; folks mun allays choose
5377: by contrairies, as if they must be sorted like the pork—a bit o’ good
5378: meat wi’ a bit o’ offal.”
5379: 
5380: To the feminine mind in some of its moods, all things that might be
5381: receive a temporary charm from comparison with what is; and since Adam
5382: did not want to marry Dinah himself, Lisbeth felt rather peevish on
5383: that score—as peevish as she would have been if he _had_ wanted to
5384: marry her, and so shut himself out from Mary Burge and the partnership
5385: as effectually as by marrying Hetty.
5386: 
5387: It was more than half-past eight when Adam and his mother were talking
5388: in this way, so that when, about ten minutes later, Hetty reached the
5389: turning of the lane that led to the farmyard gate, she saw Dinah and
5390: Seth approaching it from the opposite direction, and waited for them to
5391: come up to her. They, too, like Hetty, had lingered a little in their
5392: walk, for Dinah was trying to speak words of comfort and strength to
5393: Seth in these parting moments. But when they saw Hetty, they paused and
5394: shook hands; Seth turned homewards, and Dinah came on alone.
5395: 
5396: “Seth Bede would have come and spoken to you, my dear,” she said, as
5397: she reached Hetty, “but he’s very full of trouble to-night.”
5398: 
5399: Hetty answered with a dimpled smile, as if she did not quite know what
5400: had been said; and it made a strange contrast to see that sparkling
5401: self-engrossed loveliness looked at by Dinah’s calm pitying face, with
5402: its open glance which told that her heart lived in no cherished secrets
5403: of its own, but in feelings which it longed to share with all the
5404: world. Hetty liked Dinah as well as she had ever liked any woman; how
5405: was it possible to feel otherwise towards one who always put in a kind
5406: word for her when her aunt was finding fault, and who was always ready
5407: to take Totty off her hands—little tiresome Totty, that was made such a
5408: pet of by every one, and that Hetty could see no interest in at all?
5409: Dinah had never said anything disapproving or reproachful to Hetty
5410: during her whole visit to the Hall Farm; she had talked to her a great
5411: deal in a serious way, but Hetty didn’t mind that much, for she never
5412: listened: whatever Dinah might say, she almost always stroked Hetty’s
5413: cheek after it, and wanted to do some mending for her. Dinah was a
5414: riddle to her; Hetty looked at her much in the same way as one might
5415: imagine a little perching bird that could only flutter from bough to
5416: bough, to look at the swoop of the swallow or the mounting of the lark;
5417: but she did not care to solve such riddles, any more than she cared to
5418: know what was meant by the pictures in the Pilgrim’s Progress, or in
5419: the old folio Bible that Marty and Tommy always plagued her about on a
5420: Sunday.
5421: 
5422: Dinah took her hand now and drew it under her own arm.
5423: 
5424: “You look very happy to-night, dear child,” she said. “I shall think of
5425: you often when I’m at Snowfield, and see your face before me as it is
5426: now. It’s a strange thing—sometimes when I’m quite alone, sitting in my
5427: room with my eyes closed, or walking over the hills, the people I’ve
5428: seen and known, if it’s only been for a few days, are brought before
5429: me, and I hear their voices and see them look and move almost plainer
5430: than I ever did when they were really with me so as I could touch them.
5431: And then my heart is drawn out towards them, and I feel their lot as if
5432: it was my own, and I take comfort in spreading it before the Lord and
5433: resting in His love, on their behalf as well as my own. And so I feel
5434: sure you will come before me.”
5435: 
5436: She paused a moment, but Hetty said nothing.
5437: 
5438: “It has been a very precious time to me,” Dinah went on, “last night
5439: and to-day—seeing two such good sons as Adam and Seth Bede. They are so
5440: tender and thoughtful for their aged mother. And she has been telling
5441: me what Adam has done, for these many years, to help his father and his
5442: brother; it’s wonderful what a spirit of wisdom and knowledge he has,
5443: and how he’s ready to use it all in behalf of them that are feeble. And
5444: I’m sure he has a loving spirit too. I’ve noticed it often among my own
5445: people round Snowfield, that the strong, skilful men are often the
5446: gentlest to the women and children; and it’s pretty to see ’em carrying
5447: the little babies as if they were no heavier than little birds. And the
5448: babies always seem to like the strong arm best. I feel sure it would be
5449: so with Adam Bede. Don’t you think so, Hetty?”
5450: 
5451: “Yes,” said Hetty abstractedly, for her mind had been all the while in
5452: the wood, and she would have found it difficult to say what she was
5453: assenting to. Dinah saw she was not inclined to talk, but there would
5454: not have been time to say much more, for they were now at the
5455: yard-gate.
5456: 
5457: The still twilight, with its dying western red and its few faint
5458: struggling stars, rested on the farm-yard, where there was not a sound
5459: to be heard but the stamping of the cart-horses in the stable. It was
5460: about twenty minutes after sunset. The fowls were all gone to roost,
5461: and the bull-dog lay stretched on the straw outside his kennel, with
5462: the black-and-tan terrier by his side, when the falling-to of the gate
5463: disturbed them and set them barking, like good officials, before they
5464: had any distinct knowledge of the reason.
5465: 
5466: The barking had its effect in the house, for, as Dinah and Hetty
5467: approached, the doorway was filled by a portly figure, with a ruddy
5468: black-eyed face which bore in it the possibility of looking extremely
5469: acute, and occasionally contemptuous, on market-days, but had now a
5470: predominant after-supper expression of hearty good-nature. It is well
5471: known that great scholars who have shown the most pitiless acerbity in
5472: their criticism of other men’s scholarship have yet been of a relenting
5473: and indulgent temper in private life; and I have heard of a learned man
5474: meekly rocking the twins in the cradle with his left hand, while with
5475: his right he inflicted the most lacerating sarcasms on an opponent who
5476: had betrayed a brutal ignorance of Hebrew. Weaknesses and errors must
5477: be forgiven—alas! they are not alien to us—but the man who takes the
5478: wrong side on the momentous subject of the Hebrew points must be
5479: treated as the enemy of his race. There was the same sort of antithetic
5480: mixture in Martin Poyser: he was of so excellent a disposition that he
5481: had been kinder and more respectful than ever to his old father since
5482: he had made a deed of gift of all his property, and no man judged his
5483: neighbours more charitably on all personal matters; but for a farmer,
5484: like Luke Britton, for example, whose fallows were not well cleaned,
5485: who didn’t know the rudiments of hedging and ditching, and showed but a
5486: small share of judgment in the purchase of winter stock, Martin Poyser
5487: was as hard and implacable as the north-east wind. Luke Britton could
5488: not make a remark, even on the weather, but Martin Poyser detected in
5489: it a taint of that unsoundness and general ignorance which was palpable
5490: in all his farming operations. He hated to see the fellow lift the
5491: pewter pint to his mouth in the bar of the Royal George on market-day,
5492: and the mere sight of him on the other side of the road brought a
5493: severe and critical expression into his black eyes, as different as
5494: possible from the fatherly glance he bent on his two nieces as they
5495: approached the door. Mr. Poyser had smoked his evening pipe, and now
5496: held his hands in his pockets, as the only resource of a man who
5497: continues to sit up after the day’s business is done.
5498: 
5499: “Why, lasses, ye’re rather late to-night,” he said, when they reached
5500: the little gate leading into the causeway. “The mother’s begun to
5501: fidget about you, an’ she’s got the little un ill. An’ how did you
5502: leave the old woman Bede, Dinah? Is she much down about the old man?
5503: He’d been but a poor bargain to her this five year.”
5504: 
5505: “She’s been greatly distressed for the loss of him,” said Dinah, “but
5506: she’s seemed more comforted to-day. Her son Adam’s been at home all
5507: day, working at his father’s coffin, and she loves to have him at home.
5508: She’s been talking about him to me almost all the day. She has a loving
5509: heart, though she’s sorely given to fret and be fearful. I wish she had
5510: a surer trust to comfort her in her old age.”
5511: 
5512: “Adam’s sure enough,” said Mr. Poyser, misunderstanding Dinah’s wish.
5513: “There’s no fear but he’ll yield well i’ the threshing. He’s not one o’
5514: them as is all straw and no grain. I’ll be bond for him any day, as
5515: he’ll be a good son to the last. Did he say he’d be coming to see us
5516: soon? But come in, come in,” he added, making way for them; “I hadn’t
5517: need keep y’ out any longer.”
5518: 
5519: The tall buildings round the yard shut out a good deal of the sky, but
5520: the large window let in abundant light to show every corner of the
5521: house-place.
5522: 
5523: Mrs. Poyser, seated in the rocking-chair, which had been brought out of
5524: the “right-hand parlour,” was trying to soothe Totty to sleep. But
5525: Totty was not disposed to sleep; and when her cousins entered, she
5526: raised herself up and showed a pair of flushed cheeks, which looked
5527: fatter than ever now they were defined by the edge of her linen
5528: night-cap.
5529: 
5530: In the large wicker-bottomed arm-chair in the left-hand chimney-nook
5531: sat old Martin Poyser, a hale but shrunken and bleached image of his
5532: portly black-haired son—his head hanging forward a little, and his
5533: elbows pushed backwards so as to allow the whole of his forearm to rest
5534: on the arm of the chair. His blue handkerchief was spread over his
5535: knees, as was usual indoors, when it was not hanging over his head; and
5536: he sat watching what went forward with the quiet _outward_ glance of
5537: healthy old age, which, disengaged from any interest in an inward
5538: drama, spies out pins upon the floor, follows one’s minutest motions
5539: with an unexpectant purposeless tenacity, watches the flickering of the
5540: flame or the sun-gleams on the wall, counts the quarries on the floor,
5541: watches even the hand of the clock, and pleases itself with detecting a
5542: rhythm in the tick.
5543: 
5544: “What a time o’ night this is to come home, Hetty!” said Mrs. Poyser.
5545: “Look at the clock, do; why, it’s going on for half-past nine, and I’ve
5546: sent the gells to bed this half-hour, and late enough too; when they’ve
5547: got to get up at half after four, and the mowers’ bottles to fill, and
5548: the baking; and here’s this blessed child wi’ the fever for what I
5549: know, and as wakeful as if it was dinner-time, and nobody to help me to
5550: give her the physic but your uncle, and fine work there’s been, and
5551: half of it spilt on her night-gown—it’s well if she’s swallowed more
5552: nor ’ull make her worse i’stead o’ better. But folks as have no mind to
5553: be o’ use have allays the luck to be out o’ the road when there’s
5554: anything to be done.”
5555: 
5556: “I did set out before eight, aunt,” said Hetty, in a pettish tone, with
5557: a slight toss of her head. “But this clock’s so much before the clock
5558: at the Chase, there’s no telling what time it’ll be when I get here.”
5559: 
5560: “What! You’d be wanting the clock set by gentlefolks’s time, would you?
5561: An’ sit up burnin’ candle, an’ lie a-bed wi’ the sun a-bakin’ you like
5562: a cowcumber i’ the frame? The clock hasn’t been put forrard for the
5563: first time to-day, I reckon.”
5564: 
5565: The fact was, Hetty had really forgotten the difference of the clocks
5566: when she told Captain Donnithorne that she set out at eight, and this,
5567: with her lingering pace, had made her nearly half an hour later than
5568: usual. But here her aunt’s attention was diverted from this tender
5569: subject by Totty, who, perceiving at length that the arrival of her
5570: cousins was not likely to bring anything satisfactory to her in
5571: particular, began to cry, “Munny, munny,” in an explosive manner.
5572: 
5573: “Well, then, my pet, Mother’s got her, Mother won’t leave her; Totty be
5574: a good dilling, and go to sleep now,” said Mrs. Poyser, leaning back
5575: and rocking the chair, while she tried to make Totty nestle against
5576: her. But Totty only cried louder, and said, “Don’t yock!” So the
5577: mother, with that wondrous patience which love gives to the quickest
5578: temperament, sat up again, and pressed her cheek against the linen
5579: night-cap and kissed it, and forgot to scold Hetty any longer.
5580: 
5581: “Come, Hetty,” said Martin Poyser, in a conciliatory tone, “go and get
5582: your supper i’ the pantry, as the things are all put away; an’ then you
5583: can come and take the little un while your aunt undresses herself, for
5584: she won’t lie down in bed without her mother. An’ I reckon _you_ could
5585: eat a bit, Dinah, for they don’t keep much of a house down there.”
5586: 
5587: “No, thank you, Uncle,” said Dinah; “I ate a good meal before I came
5588: away, for Mrs. Bede would make a kettle-cake for me.”
5589: 
5590: “I don’t want any supper,” said Hetty, taking off her hat. “I can hold
5591: Totty now, if Aunt wants me.”
5592: 
5593: “Why, what nonsense that is to talk!” said Mrs. Poyser. “Do you think
5594: you can live wi’out eatin’, an’ nourish your inside wi’ stickin’ red
5595: ribbons on your head? Go an’ get your supper this minute, child;
5596: there’s a nice bit o’ cold pudding i’ the safe—just what you’re fond
5597: of.”
5598: 
5599: Hetty complied silently by going towards the pantry, and Mrs. Poyser
5600: went on speaking to Dinah.
5601: 
5602: “Sit down, my dear, an’ look as if you knowed what it was to make
5603: yourself a bit comfortable i’ the world. I warrant the old woman was
5604: glad to see you, since you stayed so long.”
5605: 
5606: “She seemed to like having me there at last; but her sons say she
5607: doesn’t like young women about her commonly; and I thought just at
5608: first she was almost angry with me for going.”
5609: 
5610: “Eh, it’s a poor look-out when th’ ould folks doesna like the young
5611: uns,” said old Martin, bending his head down lower, and seeming to
5612: trace the pattern of the quarries with his eye.
5613: 
5614: “Aye, it’s ill livin’ in a hen-roost for them as doesn’t like fleas,”
5615: said Mrs. Poyser. “We’ve all had our turn at bein’ young, I reckon,
5616: be’t good luck or ill.”
5617: 
5618: “But she must learn to ’commodate herself to young women,” said Mr.
5619: Poyser, “for it isn’t to be counted on as Adam and Seth ’ull keep
5620: bachelors for the next ten year to please their mother. That ’ud be
5621: unreasonable. It isn’t right for old nor young nayther to make a
5622: bargain all o’ their own side. What’s good for one’s good all round i’
5623: the long run. I’m no friend to young fellows a-marrying afore they know
5624: the difference atween a crab an’ a apple; but they may wait o’er long.”
5625: 
5626: “To be sure,” said Mrs. Poyser; “if you go past your dinner-time,
5627: there’ll be little relish o’ your meat. You turn it o’er an’ o’er wi’
5628: your fork, an’ don’t eat it after all. You find faut wi’ your meat, an’
5629: the faut’s all i’ your own stomach.”
5630: 
5631: Hetty now came back from the pantry and said, “I can take Totty now,
5632: Aunt, if you like.”
5633: 
5634: “Come, Rachel,” said Mr. Poyser, as his wife seemed to hesitate, seeing
5635: that Totty was at last nestling quietly, “thee’dst better let Hetty
5636: carry her upstairs, while thee tak’st thy things off. Thee’t tired.
5637: It’s time thee wast in bed. Thee’t bring on the pain in thy side
5638: again.”
5639: 
5640: “Well, she may hold her if the child ’ull go to her,” said Mrs. Poyser.
5641: 
5642: Hetty went close to the rocking-chair, and stood without her usual
5643: smile, and without any attempt to entice Totty, simply waiting for her
5644: aunt to give the child into her hands.
5645: 
5646: “Wilt go to Cousin Hetty, my dilling, while mother gets ready to go to
5647: bed? Then Totty shall go into Mother’s bed, and sleep there all night.”
5648: 
5649: Before her mother had done speaking, Totty had given her answer in an
5650: unmistakable manner, by knitting her brow, setting her tiny teeth
5651: against her underlip, and leaning forward to slap Hetty on the arm with
5652: her utmost force. Then, without speaking, she nestled to her mother
5653: again.
5654: 
5655: “Hey, hey,” said Mr. Poyser, while Hetty stood without moving, “not go
5656: to Cousin Hetty? That’s like a babby. Totty’s a little woman, an’ not a
5657: babby.”
5658: 
5659: “It’s no use trying to persuade her,” said Mrs. Poyser. “She allays
5660: takes against Hetty when she isn’t well. Happen she’ll go to Dinah.”
5661: 
5662: Dinah, having taken off her bonnet and shawl, had hitherto kept quietly
5663: seated in the background, not liking to thrust herself between Hetty
5664: and what was considered Hetty’s proper work. But now she came forward,
5665: and, putting out her arms, said, “Come Totty, come and let Dinah carry
5666: her upstairs along with Mother: poor, poor Mother! she’s so tired—she
5667: wants to go to bed.”
5668: 
5669: Totty turned her face towards Dinah, and looked at her an instant, then
5670: lifted herself up, put out her little arms, and let Dinah lift her from
5671: her mother’s lap. Hetty turned away without any sign of ill humour,
5672: and, taking her hat from the table, stood waiting with an air of
5673: indifference, to see if she should be told to do anything else.
5674: 
5675: “You may make the door fast now, Poyser; Alick’s been come in this long
5676: while,” said Mrs. Poyser, rising with an appearance of relief from her
5677: low chair. “Get me the matches down, Hetty, for I must have the
5678: rushlight burning i’ my room. Come, Father.”
5679: 
5680: The heavy wooden bolts began to roll in the house doors, and old Martin
5681: prepared to move, by gathering up his blue handkerchief, and reaching
5682: his bright knobbed walnut-tree stick from the corner. Mrs. Poyser then
5683: led the way out of the kitchen, followed by the grandfather, and Dinah
5684: with Totty in her arms—all going to bed by twilight, like the birds.
5685: Mrs. Poyser, on her way, peeped into the room where her two boys lay;
5686: just to see their ruddy round cheeks on the pillow, and to hear for a
5687: moment their light regular breathing.
5688: 
5689: “Come, Hetty, get to bed,” said Mr. Poyser, in a soothing tone, as he
5690: himself turned to go upstairs. “You didna mean to be late, I’ll be
5691: bound, but your aunt’s been worrited to-day. Good-night, my wench,
5692: good-night.”
5693: 
5694: 
5695: 
5696: 
5697: Chapter XV
5698: The Two Bed-Chambers
5699: 
5700: 
5701: Hetty and Dinah both slept in the second story, in rooms adjoining each
5702: other, meagrely furnished rooms, with no blinds to shut out the light,
5703: which was now beginning to gather new strength from the rising of the
5704: moon—more than enough strength to enable Hetty to move about and
5705: undress with perfect comfort. She could see quite well the pegs in the
5706: old painted linen-press on which she hung her hat and gown; she could
5707: see the head of every pin on her red cloth pin-cushion; she could see a
5708: reflection of herself in the old-fashioned looking-glass, quite as
5709: distinct as was needful, considering that she had only to brush her
5710: hair and put on her night-cap. A queer old looking-glass! Hetty got
5711: into an ill temper with it almost every time she dressed. It had been
5712: considered a handsome glass in its day, and had probably been bought
5713: into the Poyser family a quarter of a century before, at a sale of
5714: genteel household furniture. Even now an auctioneer could say something
5715: for it: it had a great deal of tarnished gilding about it; it had a
5716: firm mahogany base, well supplied with drawers, which opened with a
5717: decided jerk and sent the contents leaping out from the farthest
5718: corners, without giving you the trouble of reaching them; above all, it
5719: had a brass candle-socket on each side, which would give it an
5720: aristocratic air to the very last. But Hetty objected to it because it
5721: had numerous dim blotches sprinkled over the mirror, which no rubbing
5722: would remove, and because, instead of swinging backwards and forwards,
5723: it was fixed in an upright position, so that she could only get one
5724: good view of her head and neck, and that was to be had only by sitting
5725: down on a low chair before her dressing-table. And the dressing-table
5726: was no dressing-table at all, but a small old chest of drawers, the
5727: most awkward thing in the world to sit down before, for the big brass
5728: handles quite hurt her knees, and she couldn’t get near the glass at
5729: all comfortably. But devout worshippers never allow inconveniences to
5730: prevent them from performing their religious rites, and Hetty this
5731: evening was more bent on her peculiar form of worship than usual.
5732: 
5733: Having taken off her gown and white kerchief, she drew a key from the
5734: large pocket that hung outside her petticoat, and, unlocking one of the
5735: lower drawers in the chest, reached from it two short bits of wax
5736: candle—secretly bought at Treddleston—and stuck them in the two brass
5737: sockets. Then she drew forth a bundle of matches and lighted the
5738: candles; and last of all, a small red-framed shilling looking-glass,
5739: without blotches. It was into this small glass that she chose to look
5740: first after seating herself. She looked into it, smiling and turning
5741: her head on one side, for a minute, then laid it down and took out her
5742: brush and comb from an upper drawer. She was going to let down her
5743: hair, and make herself look like that picture of a lady in Miss Lydia
5744: Donnithorne’s dressing-room. It was soon done, and the dark hyacinthine
5745: curves fell on her neck. It was not heavy, massive, merely rippling
5746: hair, but soft and silken, running at every opportunity into delicate
5747: rings. But she pushed it all backward to look like the picture, and
5748: form a dark curtain, throwing into relief her round white neck. Then
5749: she put down her brush and comb and looked at herself, folding her arms
5750: before her, still like the picture. Even the old mottled glass couldn’t
5751: help sending back a lovely image, none the less lovely because Hetty’s
5752: stays were not of white satin—such as I feel sure heroines must
5753: generally wear—but of a dark greenish cotton texture.
5754: 
5755: Oh yes! She was very pretty. Captain Donnithorne thought so. Prettier
5756: than anybody about Hayslope—prettier than any of the ladies she had
5757: ever seen visiting at the Chase—indeed it seemed fine ladies were
5758: rather old and ugly—and prettier than Miss Bacon, the miller’s
5759: daughter, who was called the beauty of Treddleston. And Hetty looked at
5760: herself to-night with quite a different sensation from what she had
5761: ever felt before; there was an invisible spectator whose eye rested on
5762: her like morning on the flowers. His soft voice was saying over and
5763: over again those pretty things she had heard in the wood; his arm was
5764: round her, and the delicate rose-scent of his hair was with her still.
5765: The vainest woman is never thoroughly conscious of her own beauty till
5766: she is loved by the man who sets her own passion vibrating in return.
5767: 
5768: But Hetty seemed to have made up her mind that something was wanting,
5769: for she got up and reached an old black lace scarf out of the
5770: linen-press, and a pair of large ear-rings out of the sacred drawer
5771: from which she had taken her candles. It was an old old scarf, full of
5772: rents, but it would make a becoming border round her shoulders, and set
5773: off the whiteness of her upper arm. And she would take out the little
5774: ear-rings she had in her ears—oh, how her aunt had scolded her for
5775: having her ears bored!—and put in those large ones. They were but
5776: coloured glass and gilding, but if you didn’t know what they were made
5777: of, they looked just as well as what the ladies wore. And so she sat
5778: down again, with the large ear-rings in her ears, and the black lace
5779: scarf adjusted round her shoulders. She looked down at her arms: no
5780: arms could be prettier down to a little way below the elbow—they were
5781: white and plump, and dimpled to match her cheeks; but towards the
5782: wrist, she thought with vexation that they were coarsened by
5783: butter-making and other work that ladies never did.
5784: 
5785: Captain Donnithorne couldn’t like her to go on doing work: he would
5786: like to see her in nice clothes, and thin shoes, and white stockings,
5787: perhaps with silk clocks to them; for he must love her very much—no one
5788: else had ever put his arm round her and kissed her in that way. He
5789: would want to marry her and make a lady of her; she could hardly dare
5790: to shape the thought—yet how else could it be? Marry her quite
5791: secretly, as Mr. James, the doctor’s assistant, married the doctor’s
5792: niece, and nobody ever found it out for a long while after, and then it
5793: was of no use to be angry. The doctor had told her aunt all about it in
5794: Hetty’s hearing. She didn’t know how it would be, but it was quite
5795: plain the old Squire could never be told anything about it, for Hetty
5796: was ready to faint with awe and fright if she came across him at the
5797: Chase. He might have been earth-born, for what she knew. It had never
5798: entered her mind that he had been young like other men; he had always
5799: been the old Squire at whom everybody was frightened. Oh, it was
5800: impossible to think how it would be! But Captain Donnithorne would
5801: know; he was a great gentleman, and could have his way in everything,
5802: and could buy everything he liked. And nothing could be as it had been
5803: again: perhaps some day she should be a grand lady, and ride in her
5804: coach, and dress for dinner in a brocaded silk, with feathers in her
5805: hair, and her dress sweeping the ground, like Miss Lydia and Lady
5806: Dacey, when she saw them going into the dining-room one evening as she
5807: peeped through the little round window in the lobby; only she should
5808: not be old and ugly like Miss Lydia, or all the same thickness like
5809: Lady Dacey, but very pretty, with her hair done in a great many
5810: different ways, and sometimes in a pink dress, and sometimes in a white
5811: one—she didn’t know which she liked best; and Mary Burge and everybody
5812: would perhaps see her going out in her carriage—or rather, they would
5813: _hear_ of it: it was impossible to imagine these things happening at
5814: Hayslope in sight of her aunt. At the thought of all this splendour,
5815: Hetty got up from her chair, and in doing so caught the little
5816: red-framed glass with the edge of her scarf, so that it fell with a
5817: bang on the floor; but she was too eagerly occupied with her vision to
5818: care about picking it up; and after a momentary start, began to pace
5819: with a pigeon-like stateliness backwards and forwards along her room,
5820: in her coloured stays and coloured skirt, and the old black lace scarf
5821: round her shoulders, and the great glass ear-rings in her ears.
5822: 
5823: How pretty the little puss looks in that odd dress! It would be the
5824: easiest folly in the world to fall in love with her: there is such a
5825: sweet babylike roundness about her face and figure; the delicate dark
5826: rings of hair lie so charmingly about her ears and neck; her great dark
5827: eyes with their long eye-lashes touch one so strangely, as if an
5828: imprisoned frisky sprite looked out of them.
5829: 
5830: Ah, what a prize the man gets who wins a sweet bride like Hetty! How
5831: the men envy him who come to the wedding breakfast, and see her hanging
5832: on his arm in her white lace and orange blossoms. The dear, young,
5833: round, soft, flexible thing! Her heart must be just as soft, her temper
5834: just as free from angles, her character just as pliant. If anything
5835: ever goes wrong, it must be the husband’s fault there: he can make her
5836: what he likes—that is plain. And the lover himself thinks so too: the
5837: little darling is so fond of him, her little vanities are so
5838: bewitching, he wouldn’t consent to her being a bit wiser; those
5839: kittenlike glances and movements are just what one wants to make one’s
5840: hearth a paradise. Every man under such circumstances is conscious of
5841: being a great physiognomist. Nature, he knows, has a language of her
5842: own, which she uses with strict veracity, and he considers himself an
5843: adept in the language. Nature has written out his bride’s character for
5844: him in those exquisite lines of cheek and lip and chin, in those
5845: eyelids delicate as petals, in those long lashes curled like the stamen
5846: of a flower, in the dark liquid depths of those wonderful eyes. How she
5847: will dote on her children! She is almost a child herself, and the
5848: little pink round things will hang about her like florets round the
5849: central flower; and the husband will look on, smiling benignly, able,
5850: whenever he chooses, to withdraw into the sanctuary of his wisdom,
5851: towards which his sweet wife will look reverently, and never lift the
5852: curtain. It is a marriage such as they made in the golden age, when the
5853: men were all wise and majestic and the women all lovely and loving.
5854: 
5855: It was very much in this way that our friend Adam Bede thought about
5856: Hetty; only he put his thoughts into different words. If ever she
5857: behaved with cold vanity towards him, he said to himself it is only
5858: because she doesn’t love me well enough; and he was sure that her love,
5859: whenever she gave it, would be the most precious thing a man could
5860: possess on earth. Before you despise Adam as deficient in penetration,
5861: pray ask yourself if you were ever predisposed to believe evil of any
5862: pretty woman—if you ever _could_, without hard head-breaking
5863: demonstration, believe evil of the _one_ supremely pretty woman who has
5864: bewitched you. No: people who love downy peaches are apt not to think
5865: of the stone, and sometimes jar their teeth terribly against it.
5866: 
5867: Arthur Donnithorne, too, had the same sort of notion about Hetty, so
5868: far as he had thought of her nature of all. He felt sure she was a
5869: dear, affectionate, good little thing. The man who awakes the wondering
5870: tremulous passion of a young girl always thinks her affectionate; and
5871: if he chances to look forward to future years, probably imagines
5872: himself being virtuously tender to her, because the poor thing is so
5873: clingingly fond of him. God made these dear women so—and it is a
5874: convenient arrangement in case of sickness.
5875: 
5876: After all, I believe the wisest of us must be beguiled in this way
5877: sometimes, and must think both better and worse of people than they
5878: deserve. Nature has her language, and she is not unveracious; but we
5879: don’t know all the intricacies of her syntax just yet, and in a hasty
5880: reading we may happen to extract the very opposite of her real meaning.
5881: Long dark eyelashes, now—what can be more exquisite? I find it
5882: impossible not to expect some depth of soul behind a deep grey eye with
5883: a long dark eyelash, in spite of an experience which has shown me that
5884: they may go along with deceit, peculation, and stupidity. But if, in
5885: the reaction of disgust, I have betaken myself to a fishy eye, there
5886: has been a surprising similarity of result. One begins to suspect at
5887: length that there is no direct correlation between eyelashes and
5888: morals; or else, that the eyelashes express the disposition of the fair
5889: one’s grandmother, which is on the whole less important to us.
5890: 
5891: No eyelashes could be more beautiful than Hetty’s; and now, while she
5892: walks with her pigeon-like stateliness along the room and looks down on
5893: her shoulders bordered by the old black lace, the dark fringe shows to
5894: perfection on her pink cheek. They are but dim ill-defined pictures
5895: that her narrow bit of an imagination can make of the future; but of
5896: every picture she is the central figure in fine clothes; Captain
5897: Donnithorne is very close to her, putting his arm round her, perhaps
5898: kissing her, and everybody else is admiring and envying her—especially
5899: Mary Burge, whose new print dress looks very contemptible by the side
5900: of Hetty’s resplendent toilette. Does any sweet or sad memory mingle
5901: with this dream of the future—any loving thought of her second
5902: parents—of the children she had helped to tend—of any youthful
5903: companion, any pet animal, any relic of her own childhood even? Not
5904: one. There are some plants that have hardly any roots: you may tear
5905: them from their native nook of rock or wall, and just lay them over
5906: your ornamental flower-pot, and they blossom none the worse. Hetty
5907: could have cast all her past life behind her and never cared to be
5908: reminded of it again. I think she had no feeling at all towards the old
5909: house, and did not like the Jacobb’s Ladder and the long row of
5910: hollyhocks in the garden better than other flowers—perhaps not so well.
5911: It was wonderful how little she seemed to care about waiting on her
5912: uncle, who had been a good father to her—she hardly ever remembered to
5913: reach him his pipe at the right time without being told, unless a
5914: visitor happened to be there, who would have a better opportunity of
5915: seeing her as she walked across the hearth. Hetty did not understand
5916: how anybody could be very fond of middle-aged people. And as for those
5917: tiresome children, Marty and Tommy and Totty, they had been the very
5918: nuisance of her life—as bad as buzzing insects that will come teasing
5919: you on a hot day when you want to be quiet. Marty, the eldest, was a
5920: baby when she first came to the farm, for the children born before him
5921: had died, and so Hetty had had them all three, one after the other,
5922: toddling by her side in the meadow, or playing about her on wet days in
5923: the half-empty rooms of the large old house. The boys were out of hand
5924: now, but Totty was still a day-long plague, worse than either of the
5925: others had been, because there was more fuss made about her. And there
5926: was no end to the making and mending of clothes. Hetty would have been
5927: glad to hear that she should never see a child again; they were worse
5928: than the nasty little lambs that the shepherd was always bringing in to
5929: be taken special care of in lambing time; for the lambs _were_ got rid
5930: of sooner or later. As for the young chickens and turkeys, Hetty would
5931: have hated the very word “hatching,” if her aunt had not bribed her to
5932: attend to the young poultry by promising her the proceeds of one out of
5933: every brood. The round downy chicks peeping out from under their
5934: mother’s wing never touched Hetty with any pleasure; that was not the
5935: sort of prettiness she cared about, but she did care about the
5936: prettiness of the new things she would buy for herself at Treddleston
5937: Fair with the money they fetched. And yet she looked so dimpled, so
5938: charming, as she stooped down to put the soaked bread under the
5939: hen-coop, that you must have been a very acute personage indeed to
5940: suspect her of that hardness. Molly, the housemaid, with a turn-up nose
5941: and a protuberant jaw, was really a tender-hearted girl, and, as Mrs.
5942: Poyser said, a jewel to look after the poultry; but her stolid face
5943: showed nothing of this maternal delight, any more than a brown
5944: earthenware pitcher will show the light of the lamp within it.
5945: 
5946: It is generally a feminine eye that first detects the moral
5947: deficiencies hidden under the “dear deceit” of beauty, so it is not
5948: surprising that Mrs. Poyser, with her keenness and abundant opportunity
5949: for observation, should have formed a tolerably fair estimate of what
5950: might be expected from Hetty in the way of feeling, and in moments of
5951: indignation she had sometimes spoken with great openness on the subject
5952: to her husband.
5953: 
5954: “She’s no better than a peacock, as ’ud strut about on the wall and
5955: spread its tail when the sun shone if all the folks i’ the parish was
5956: dying: there’s nothing seems to give her a turn i’ th’ inside, not even
5957: when we thought Totty had tumbled into the pit. To think o’ that dear
5958: cherub! And we found her wi’ her little shoes stuck i’ the mud an’
5959: crying fit to break her heart by the far horse-pit. But Hetty never
5960: minded it, I could see, though she’s been at the nussin’ o’ the child
5961: ever since it was a babby. It’s my belief her heart’s as hard as a
5962: pebble.”
5963: 
5964: “Nay, nay,” said Mr. Poyser, “thee mustn’t judge Hetty too hard. Them
5965: young gells are like the unripe grain; they’ll make good meal by and
5966: by, but they’re squashy as yet. Thee’t see Hetty ’ll be all right when
5967: she’s got a good husband and children of her own.”
5968: 
5969: “_I_ don’t want to be hard upo’ the gell. She’s got cliver fingers of
5970: her own, and can be useful enough when she likes and I should miss her
5971: wi’ the butter, for she’s got a cool hand. An’ let be what may, I’d
5972: strive to do my part by a niece o’ yours—an’ that I’ve done, for I’ve
5973: taught her everything as belongs to a house, an’ I’ve told her her duty
5974: often enough, though, God knows, I’ve no breath to spare, an’ that
5975: catchin’ pain comes on dreadful by times. Wi’ them three gells in the
5976: house I’d need have twice the strength to keep ’em up to their work.
5977: It’s like having roast meat at three fires; as soon as you’ve basted
5978: one, another’s burnin’.”
5979: 
5980: Hetty stood sufficiently in awe of her aunt to be anxious to conceal
5981: from her so much of her vanity as could be hidden without too great a
5982: sacrifice. She could not resist spending her money in bits of finery
5983: which Mrs. Poyser disapproved; but she would have been ready to die
5984: with shame, vexation, and fright if her aunt had this moment opened the
5985: door, and seen her with her bits of candle lighted, and strutting about
5986: decked in her scarf and ear-rings. To prevent such a surprise, she
5987: always bolted her door, and she had not forgotten to do so to-night. It
5988: was well: for there now came a light tap, and Hetty, with a leaping
5989: heart, rushed to blow out the candles and throw them into the drawer.
5990: She dared not stay to take out her ear-rings, but she threw off her
5991: scarf, and let it fall on the floor, before the light tap came again.
5992: We shall know how it was that the light tap came, if we leave Hetty for
5993: a short time and return to Dinah, at the moment when she had delivered
5994: Totty to her mother’s arms, and was come upstairs to her bedroom,
5995: adjoining Hetty’s.
5996: 
5997: Dinah delighted in her bedroom window. Being on the second story of
5998: that tall house, it gave her a wide view over the fields. The thickness
5999: of the wall formed a broad step about a yard below the window, where
6000: she could place her chair. And now the first thing she did on entering
6001: her room was to seat herself in this chair and look out on the peaceful
6002: fields beyond which the large moon was rising, just above the hedgerow
6003: elms. She liked the pasture best where the milch cows were lying, and
6004: next to that the meadow where the grass was half-mown, and lay in
6005: silvered sweeping lines. Her heart was very full, for there was to be
6006: only one more night on which she would look out on those fields for a
6007: long time to come; but she thought little of leaving the mere scene,
6008: for, to her, bleak Snowfield had just as many charms. She thought of
6009: all the dear people whom she had learned to care for among these
6010: peaceful fields, and who would now have a place in her loving
6011: remembrance for ever. She thought of the struggles and the weariness
6012: that might lie before them in the rest of their life’s journey, when
6013: she would be away from them, and know nothing of what was befalling
6014: them; and the pressure of this thought soon became too strong for her
6015: to enjoy the unresponding stillness of the moonlit fields. She closed
6016: her eyes, that she might feel more intensely the presence of a Love and
6017: Sympathy deeper and more tender than was breathed from the earth and
6018: sky. That was often Dinah’s mode of praying in solitude. Simply to
6019: close her eyes and to feel herself enclosed by the Divine Presence;
6020: then gradually her fears, her yearning anxieties for others, melted
6021: away like ice-crystals in a warm ocean. She had sat in this way
6022: perfectly still, with her hands crossed on her lap and the pale light
6023: resting on her calm face, for at least ten minutes when she was
6024: startled by a loud sound, apparently of something falling in Hetty’s
6025: room. But like all sounds that fall on our ears in a state of
6026: abstraction, it had no distinct character, but was simply loud and
6027: startling, so that she felt uncertain whether she had interpreted it
6028: rightly. She rose and listened, but all was quiet afterwards, and she
6029: reflected that Hetty might merely have knocked something down in
6030: getting into bed. She began slowly to undress; but now, owing to the
6031: suggestions of this sound, her thoughts became concentrated on
6032: Hetty—that sweet young thing, with life and all its trials before
6033: her—the solemn daily duties of the wife and mother—and her mind so
6034: unprepared for them all, bent merely on little foolish, selfish
6035: pleasures, like a child hugging its toys in the beginning of a long
6036: toilsome journey in which it will have to bear hunger and cold and
6037: unsheltered darkness. Dinah felt a double care for Hetty, because she
6038: shared Seth’s anxious interest in his brother’s lot, and she had not
6039: come to the conclusion that Hetty did not love Adam well enough to
6040: marry him. She saw too clearly the absence of any warm, self-devoting
6041: love in Hetty’s nature to regard the coldness of her behaviour towards
6042: Adam as any indication that he was not the man she would like to have
6043: for a husband. And this blank in Hetty’s nature, instead of exciting
6044: Dinah’s dislike, only touched her with a deeper pity: the lovely face
6045: and form affected her as beauty always affects a pure and tender mind,
6046: free from selfish jealousies. It was an excellent divine gift, that
6047: gave a deeper pathos to the need, the sin, the sorrow with which it was
6048: mingled, as the canker in a lily-white bud is more grievous to behold
6049: than in a common pot-herb.
6050: 
6051: By the time Dinah had undressed and put on her night-gown, this feeling
6052: about Hetty had gathered a painful intensity; her imagination had
6053: created a thorny thicket of sin and sorrow, in which she saw the poor
6054: thing struggling torn and bleeding, looking with tears for rescue and
6055: finding none. It was in this way that Dinah’s imagination and sympathy
6056: acted and reacted habitually, each heightening the other. She felt a
6057: deep longing to go now and pour into Hetty’s ear all the words of
6058: tender warning and appeal that rushed into her mind. But perhaps Hetty
6059: was already asleep. Dinah put her ear to the partition and heard still
6060: some slight noises, which convinced her that Hetty was not yet in bed.
6061: Still she hesitated; she was not quite certain of a divine direction;
6062: the voice that told her to go to Hetty seemed no stronger than the
6063: other voice which said that Hetty was weary, and that going to her now
6064: in an unseasonable moment would only tend to close her heart more
6065: obstinately. Dinah was not satisfied without a more unmistakable
6066: guidance than those inward voices. There was light enough for her, if
6067: she opened her Bible, to discern the text sufficiently to know what it
6068: would say to her. She knew the physiognomy of every page, and could
6069: tell on what book she opened, sometimes on what chapter, without seeing
6070: title or number. It was a small thick Bible, worn quite round at the
6071: edges. Dinah laid it sideways on the window ledge, where the light was
6072: strongest, and then opened it with her forefinger. The first words she
6073: looked at were those at the top of the left-hand page: “And they all
6074: wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck and kissed him.” That was enough for
6075: Dinah; she had opened on that memorable parting at Ephesus, when Paul
6076: had felt bound to open his heart in a last exhortation and warning. She
6077: hesitated no longer, but, opening her own door gently, went and tapped
6078: on Hetty’s. We know she had to tap twice, because Hetty had to put out
6079: her candles and throw off her black lace scarf; but after the second
6080: tap the door was opened immediately. Dinah said, “Will you let me come
6081: in, Hetty?” and Hetty, without speaking, for she was confused and
6082: vexed, opened the door wider and let her in.
6083: 
6084: What a strange contrast the two figures made, visible enough in that
6085: mingled twilight and moonlight! Hetty, her cheeks flushed and her eyes
6086: glistening from her imaginary drama, her beautiful neck and arms bare,
6087: her hair hanging in a curly tangle down her back, and the baubles in
6088: her ears. Dinah, covered with her long white dress, her pale face full
6089: of subdued emotion, almost like a lovely corpse into which the soul has
6090: returned charged with sublimer secrets and a sublimer love. They were
6091: nearly of the same height; Dinah evidently a little the taller as she
6092: put her arm round Hetty’s waist and kissed her forehead.
6093: 
6094: “I knew you were not in bed, my dear,” she said, in her sweet clear
6095: voice, which was irritating to Hetty, mingling with her own peevish
6096: vexation like music with jangling chains, “for I heard you moving; and
6097: I longed to speak to you again to-night, for it is the last but one
6098: that I shall be here, and we don’t know what may happen to-morrow to
6099: keep us apart. Shall I sit down with you while you do up your hair?”
6100: 
6101: “Oh yes,” said Hetty, hastily turning round and reaching the second
6102: chair in the room, glad that Dinah looked as if she did not notice her
6103: ear-rings.
6104: 
6105: Dinah sat down, and Hetty began to brush together her hair before
6106: twisting it up, doing it with that air of excessive indifference which
6107: belongs to confused self-consciousness. But the expression of Dinah’s
6108: eyes gradually relieved her; they seemed unobservant of all details.
6109: 
6110: “Dear Hetty,” she said, “It has been borne in upon my mind to-night
6111: that you may some day be in trouble—trouble is appointed for us all
6112: here below, and there comes a time when we need more comfort and help
6113: than the things of this life can give. I want to tell you that if ever
6114: you are in trouble, and need a friend that will always feel for you and
6115: love you, you have got that friend in Dinah Morris at Snowfield, and if
6116: you come to her, or send for her, she’ll never forget this night and
6117: the words she is speaking to you now. Will you remember it, Hetty?”
6118: 
6119: “Yes,” said Hetty, rather frightened. “But why should you think I shall
6120: be in trouble? Do you know of anything?”
6121: 
6122: Hetty had seated herself as she tied on her cap, and now Dinah leaned
6123: forwards and took her hands as she answered, “Because, dear, trouble
6124: comes to us all in this life: we set our hearts on things which it
6125: isn’t God’s will for us to have, and then we go sorrowing; the people
6126: we love are taken from us, and we can joy in nothing because they are
6127: not with us; sickness comes, and we faint under the burden of our
6128: feeble bodies; we go astray and do wrong, and bring ourselves into
6129: trouble with our fellow-men. There is no man or woman born into this
6130: world to whom some of these trials do not fall, and so I feel that some
6131: of them must happen to you; and I desire for you, that while you are
6132: young you should seek for strength from your Heavenly Father, that you
6133: may have a support which will not fail you in the evil day.”
6134: 
6135: Dinah paused and released Hetty’s hands that she might not hinder her.
6136: Hetty sat quite still; she felt no response within herself to Dinah’s
6137: anxious affection; but Dinah’s words uttered with solemn pathetic
6138: distinctness, affected her with a chill fear. Her flush had died away
6139: almost to paleness; she had the timidity of a luxurious
6140: pleasure-seeking nature, which shrinks from the hint of pain. Dinah saw
6141: the effect, and her tender anxious pleading became the more earnest,
6142: till Hetty, full of a vague fear that something evil was some time to
6143: befall her, began to cry.
6144: 
6145: It is our habit to say that while the lower nature can never understand
6146: the higher, the higher nature commands a complete view of the lower.
6147: But I think the higher nature has to learn this comprehension, as we
6148: learn the art of vision, by a good deal of hard experience, often with
6149: bruises and gashes incurred in taking things up by the wrong end, and
6150: fancying our space wider than it is. Dinah had never seen Hetty
6151: affected in this way before, and, with her usual benignant hopefulness,
6152: she trusted it was the stirring of a divine impulse. She kissed the
6153: sobbing thing, and began to cry with her for grateful joy. But Hetty
6154: was simply in that excitable state of mind in which there is no
6155: calculating what turn the feelings may take from one moment to another,
6156: and for the first time she became irritated under Dinah’s caress. She
6157: pushed her away impatiently, and said, with a childish sobbing voice,
6158: “Don’t talk to me so, Dinah. Why do you come to frighten me? I’ve never
6159: done anything to you. Why can’t you let me be?”
6160: 
6161: Poor Dinah felt a pang. She was too wise to persist, and only said
6162: mildly, “Yes, my dear, you’re tired; I won’t hinder you any longer.
6163: Make haste and get into bed. Good-night.”
6164: 
6165: She went out of the room almost as quietly and quickly as if she had
6166: been a ghost; but once by the side of her own bed, she threw herself on
6167: her knees and poured out in deep silence all the passionate pity that
6168: filled her heart.
6169: 
6170: As for Hetty, she was soon in the wood again—her waking dreams being
6171: merged in a sleeping life scarcely more fragmentary and confused.

6176: Chapter XVI
6177: Links
6178: 
6179: 
6180: Arthur Donnithorne, you remember, is under an engagement with himself
6181: to go and see Mr. Irwine this Friday morning, and he is awake and
6182: dressing so early that he determines to go before breakfast, instead of
6183: after. The rector, he knows, breakfasts alone at half-past nine, the
6184: ladies of the family having a different breakfast-hour; Arthur will
6185: have an early ride over the hill and breakfast with him. One can say
6186: everything best over a meal.
6187: 
6188: The progress of civilization has made a breakfast or a dinner an easy
6189: and cheerful substitute for more troublesome and disagreeable
6190: ceremonies. We take a less gloomy view of our errors now our father
6191: confessor listens to us over his egg and coffee. We are more distinctly
6192: conscious that rude penances are out of the question for gentlemen in
6193: an enlightened age, and that mortal sin is not incompatible with an
6194: appetite for muffins. An assault on our pockets, which in more
6195: barbarous times would have been made in the brusque form of a
6196: pistol-shot, is quite a well-bred and smiling procedure now it has
6197: become a request for a loan thrown in as an easy parenthesis between
6198: the second and third glasses of claret.
6199: 
6200: Still, there was this advantage in the old rigid forms, that they
6201: committed you to the fulfilment of a resolution by some outward deed:
6202: when you have put your mouth to one end of a hole in a stone wall and
6203: are aware that there is an expectant ear at the other end, you are more
6204: likely to say what you came out with the intention of saying than if
6205: you were seated with your legs in an easy attitude under the mahogany
6206: with a companion who will have no reason to be surprised if you have
6207: nothing particular to say.
6208: 
6209: However, Arthur Donnithorne, as he winds among the pleasant lanes on
6210: horseback in the morning sunshine, has a sincere determination to open
6211: his heart to the rector, and the swirling sound of the scythe as he
6212: passes by the meadow is all the pleasanter to him because of this
6213: honest purpose. He is glad to see the promise of settled weather now,
6214: for getting in the hay, about which the farmers have been fearful; and
6215: there is something so healthful in the sharing of a joy that is general
6216: and not merely personal, that this thought about the hay-harvest reacts
6217: on his state of mind and makes his resolution seem an easier matter. A
6218: man about town might perhaps consider that these influences were not to
6219: be felt out of a child’s story-book; but when you are among the fields
6220: and hedgerows, it is impossible to maintain a consistent superiority to
6221: simple natural pleasures.
6222: 
6223: Arthur had passed the village of Hayslope and was approaching the
6224: Broxton side of the hill, when, at a turning in the road, he saw a
6225: figure about a hundred yards before him which it was impossible to
6226: mistake for any one else than Adam Bede, even if there had been no
6227: grey, tailless shepherd-dog at his heels. He was striding along at his
6228: usual rapid pace, and Arthur pushed on his horse to overtake him, for
6229: he retained too much of his boyish feeling for Adam to miss an
6230: opportunity of chatting with him. I will not say that his love for that
6231: good fellow did not owe some of its force to the love of patronage: our
6232: friend Arthur liked to do everything that was handsome, and to have his
6233: handsome deeds recognized.
6234: 
6235: Adam looked round as he heard the quickening clatter of the horse’s
6236: heels, and waited for the horseman, lifting his paper cap from his head
6237: with a bright smile of recognition. Next to his own brother Seth, Adam
6238: would have done more for Arthur Donnithorne than for any other young
6239: man in the world. There was hardly anything he would not rather have
6240: lost than the two-feet ruler which he always carried in his pocket; it
6241: was Arthur’s present, bought with his pocket-money when he was a
6242: fair-haired lad of eleven, and when he had profited so well by Adam’s
6243: lessons in carpentering and turning as to embarrass every female in the
6244: house with gifts of superfluous thread-reels and round boxes. Adam had
6245: quite a pride in the little squire in those early days, and the feeling
6246: had only become slightly modified as the fair-haired lad had grown into
6247: the whiskered young man. Adam, I confess, was very susceptible to the
6248: influence of rank, and quite ready to give an extra amount of respect
6249: to every one who had more advantages than himself, not being a
6250: philosopher or a proletaire with democratic ideas, but simply a
6251: stout-limbed clever carpenter with a large fund of reverence in his
6252: nature, which inclined him to admit all established claims unless he
6253: saw very clear grounds for questioning them. He had no theories about
6254: setting the world to rights, but he saw there was a great deal of
6255: damage done by building with ill-seasoned timber—by ignorant men in
6256: fine clothes making plans for outhouses and workshops and the like
6257: without knowing the bearings of things—by slovenly joiners’ work, and
6258: by hasty contracts that could never be fulfilled without ruining
6259: somebody; and he resolved, for his part, to set his face against such
6260: doings. On these points he would have maintained his opinion against
6261: the largest landed proprietor in Loamshire or Stonyshire either; but he
6262: felt that beyond these it would be better for him to defer to people
6263: who were more knowing than himself. He saw as plainly as possible how
6264: ill the woods on the estate were managed, and the shameful state of the
6265: farm-buildings; and if old Squire Donnithorne had asked him the effect
6266: of this mismanagement, he would have spoken his opinion without
6267: flinching, but the impulse to a respectful demeanour towards a
6268: “gentleman” would have been strong within him all the while. The word
6269: “gentleman” had a spell for Adam, and, as he often said, he “couldn’t
6270: abide a fellow who thought he made himself fine by being coxy to’s
6271: betters.” I must remind you again that Adam had the blood of the
6272: peasant in his veins, and that since he was in his prime half a century
6273: ago, you must expect some of his characteristics to be obsolete.
6274: 
6275: Towards the young squire this instinctive reverence of Adam’s was
6276: assisted by boyish memories and personal regard so you may imagine that
6277: he thought far more of Arthur’s good qualities, and attached far more
6278: value to very slight actions of his, than if they had been the
6279: qualities and actions of a common workman like himself. He felt sure it
6280: would be a fine day for everybody about Hayslope when the young squire
6281: came into the estate—such a generous open-hearted disposition as he
6282: had, and an “uncommon” notion about improvements and repairs,
6283: considering he was only just coming of age. Thus there was both respect
6284: and affection in the smile with which he raised his paper cap as Arthur
6285: Donnithorne rode up.
6286: 
6287: “Well, Adam, how are you?” said Arthur, holding out his hand. He never
6288: shook hands with any of the farmers, and Adam felt the honour keenly.
6289: “I could swear to your back a long way off. It’s just the same back,
6290: only broader, as when you used to carry me on it. Do you remember?”
6291: 
6292: “Aye, sir, I remember. It ’ud be a poor look-out if folks didn’t
6293: remember what they did and said when they were lads. We should think no
6294: more about old friends than we do about new uns, then.”
6295: 
6296: “You’re going to Broxton, I suppose?” said Arthur, putting his horse on
6297: at a slow pace while Adam walked by his side. “Are you going to the
6298: rectory?”
6299: 
6300: “No, sir, I’m going to see about Bradwell’s barn. They’re afraid of the
6301: roof pushing the walls out, and I’m going to see what can be done with
6302: it before we send the stuff and the workmen.”
6303: 
6304: “Why, Burge trusts almost everything to you now, Adam, doesn’t he? I
6305: should think he will make you his partner soon. He will, if he’s wise.”
6306: 
6307: “Nay, sir, I don’t see as he’d be much the better off for that. A
6308: foreman, if he’s got a conscience and delights in his work, will do his
6309: business as well as if he was a partner. I wouldn’t give a penny for a
6310: man as ’ud drive a nail in slack because he didn’t get extra pay for
6311: it.”
6312: 
6313: “I know that, Adam; I know you work for him as well as if you were
6314: working for yourself. But you would have more power than you have now,
6315: and could turn the business to better account perhaps. The old man must
6316: give up his business sometime, and he has no son; I suppose he’ll want
6317: a son-in-law who can take to it. But he has rather grasping fingers of
6318: his own, I fancy. I daresay he wants a man who can put some money into
6319: the business. If I were not as poor as a rat, I would gladly invest
6320: some money in that way, for the sake of having you settled on the
6321: estate. I’m sure I should profit by it in the end. And perhaps I shall
6322: be better off in a year or two. I shall have a larger allowance now I’m
6323: of age; and when I’ve paid off a debt or two, I shall be able to look
6324: about me.”
6325: 
6326: “You’re very good to say so, sir, and I’m not unthankful. But”—Adam
6327: continued, in a decided tone—“I shouldn’t like to make any offers to
6328: Mr. Burge, or t’ have any made for me. I see no clear road to a
6329: partnership. If he should ever want to dispose of the business, that
6330: ’ud be a different matter. I should be glad of some money at a fair
6331: interest then, for I feel sure I could pay it off in time.”
6332: 
6333: “Very well, Adam,” said Arthur, remembering what Mr. Irwine had said
6334: about a probable hitch in the love-making between Adam and Mary Burge,
6335: “we’ll say no more about it at present. When is your father to be
6336: buried?”
6337: 
6338: “On Sunday, sir; Mr. Irwine’s coming earlier on purpose. I shall be
6339: glad when it’s over, for I think my mother ’ull perhaps get easier
6340: then. It cuts one sadly to see the grief of old people; they’ve no way
6341: o’ working it off, and the new spring brings no new shoots out on the
6342: withered tree.”
6343: 
6344: “Ah, you’ve had a good deal of trouble and vexation in your life, Adam.
6345: I don’t think you’ve ever been hare-brained and light-hearted, like
6346: other youngsters. You’ve always had some care on your mind.”
6347: 
6348: “Why, yes, sir; but that’s nothing to make a fuss about. If we’re men
6349: and have men’s feelings, I reckon we must have men’s troubles. We can’t
6350: be like the birds, as fly from their nest as soon as they’ve got their
6351: wings, and never know their kin when they see ’em, and get a fresh lot
6352: every year. I’ve had enough to be thankful for: I’ve allays had health
6353: and strength and brains to give me a delight in my work; and I count it
6354: a great thing as I’ve had Bartle Massey’s night-school to go to. He’s
6355: helped me to knowledge I could never ha’ got by myself.”
6356: 
6357: “What a rare fellow you are, Adam!” said Arthur, after a pause, in
6358: which he had looked musingly at the big fellow walking by his side. “I
6359: could hit out better than most men at Oxford, and yet I believe you
6360: would knock me into next week if I were to have a battle with you.”
6361: 
6362: “God forbid I should ever do that, sir,” said Adam, looking round at
6363: Arthur and smiling. “I used to fight for fun, but I’ve never done that
6364: since I was the cause o’ poor Gil Tranter being laid up for a
6365: fortnight. I’ll never fight any man again, only when he behaves like a
6366: scoundrel. If you get hold of a chap that’s got no shame nor conscience
6367: to stop him, you must try what you can do by bunging his eyes up.”
6368: 
6369: Arthur did not laugh, for he was preoccupied with some thought that
6370: made him say presently, “I should think now, Adam, you never have any
6371: struggles within yourself. I fancy you would master a wish that you had
6372: made up your mind it was not quite right to indulge, as easily as you
6373: would knock down a drunken fellow who was quarrelsome with you. I mean,
6374: you are never shilly-shally, first making up your mind that you won’t
6375: do a thing, and then doing it after all?”
6376: 
6377: “Well,” said Adam, slowly, after a moment’s hesitation, “no. I don’t
6378: remember ever being see-saw in that way, when I’d made my mind up, as
6379: you say, that a thing was wrong. It takes the taste out o’ my mouth for
6380: things, when I know I should have a heavy conscience after ’em. I’ve
6381: seen pretty clear, ever since I could cast up a sum, as you can never
6382: do what’s wrong without breeding sin and trouble more than you can ever
6383: see. It’s like a bit o’ bad workmanship—you never see th’ end o’ the
6384: mischief it’ll do. And it’s a poor look-out to come into the world to
6385: make your fellow-creatures worse off instead o’ better. But there’s a
6386: difference between the things folks call wrong. I’m not for making a
6387: sin of every little fool’s trick, or bit o’ nonsense anybody may be let
6388: into, like some o’ them dissenters. And a man may have two minds
6389: whether it isn’t worthwhile to get a bruise or two for the sake of a
6390: bit o’ fun. But it isn’t my way to be see-saw about anything: I think
6391: my fault lies th’ other way. When I’ve said a thing, if it’s only to
6392: myself, it’s hard for me to go back.”
6393: 
6394: “Yes, that’s just what I expected of you,” said Arthur. “You’ve got an
6395: iron will, as well as an iron arm. But however strong a man’s
6396: resolution may be, it costs him something to carry it out, now and
6397: then. We may determine not to gather any cherries and keep our hands
6398: sturdily in our pockets, but we can’t prevent our mouths from
6399: watering.”
6400: 
6401: “That’s true, sir, but there’s nothing like settling with ourselves as
6402: there’s a deal we must do without i’ this life. It’s no use looking on
6403: life as if it was Treddles’on Fair, where folks only go to see shows
6404: and get fairings. If we do, we shall find it different. But where’s the
6405: use o’ me talking to you, sir? You know better than I do.”
6406: 
6407: “I’m not so sure of that, Adam. You’ve had four or five years of
6408: experience more than I’ve had, and I think your life has been a better
6409: school to you than college has been to me.”
6410: 
6411: “Why, sir, you seem to think o’ college something like what Bartle
6412: Massey does. He says college mostly makes people like bladders—just
6413: good for nothing but t’ hold the stuff as is poured into ’em. But he’s
6414: got a tongue like a sharp blade, Bartle has—it never touches anything
6415: but it cuts. Here’s the turning, sir. I must bid you good-morning, as
6416: you’re going to the rectory.”
6417: 
6418: “Good-bye, Adam, good-bye.”
6419: 
6420: Arthur gave his horse to the groom at the rectory gate, and walked
6421: along the gravel towards the door which opened on the garden. He knew
6422: that the rector always breakfasted in his study, and the study lay on
6423: the left hand of this door, opposite the dining-room. It was a small
6424: low room, belonging to the old part of the house—dark with the sombre
6425: covers of the books that lined the walls; yet it looked very cheery
6426: this morning as Arthur reached the open window. For the morning sun
6427: fell aslant on the great glass globe with gold fish in it, which stood
6428: on a scagliola pillar in front of the ready-spread bachelor
6429: breakfast-table, and by the side of this breakfast-table was a group
6430: which would have made any room enticing. In the crimson damask
6431: easy-chair sat Mr. Irwine, with that radiant freshness which he always
6432: had when he came from his morning toilet; his finely formed plump white
6433: hand was playing along Juno’s brown curly back; and close to Juno’s
6434: tail, which was wagging with calm matronly pleasure, the two brown pups
6435: were rolling over each other in an ecstatic duet of worrying noises. On
6436: a cushion a little removed sat Pug, with the air of a maiden lady, who
6437: looked on these familiarities as animal weaknesses, which she made as
6438: little show as possible of observing. On the table, at Mr. Irwine’s
6439: elbow, lay the first volume of the Foulis Æschylus, which Arthur knew
6440: well by sight; and the silver coffee-pot, which Carroll was bringing
6441: in, sent forth a fragrant steam which completed the delights of a
6442: bachelor breakfast.
6443: 
6444: “Hallo, Arthur, that’s a good fellow! You’re just in time,” said Mr.
6445: Irwine, as Arthur paused and stepped in over the low window-sill.
6446: “Carroll, we shall want more coffee and eggs, and haven’t you got some
6447: cold fowl for us to eat with that ham? Why, this is like old days,
6448: Arthur; you haven’t been to breakfast with me these five years.”
6449: 
6450: “It was a tempting morning for a ride before breakfast,” said Arthur;
6451: “and I used to like breakfasting with you so when I was reading with
6452: you. My grandfather is always a few degrees colder at breakfast than at
6453: any other hour in the day. I think his morning bath doesn’t agree with
6454: him.”
6455: 
6456: Arthur was anxious not to imply that he came with any special purpose.
6457: He had no sooner found himself in Mr. Irwine’s presence than the
6458: confidence which he had thought quite easy before, suddenly appeared
6459: the most difficult thing in the world to him, and at the very moment of
6460: shaking hands he saw his purpose in quite a new light. How could he
6461: make Irwine understand his position unless he told him those little
6462: scenes in the wood; and how could he tell them without looking like a
6463: fool? And then his weakness in coming back from Gawaine’s, and doing
6464: the very opposite of what he intended! Irwine would think him a
6465: shilly-shally fellow ever after. However, it must come out in an
6466: unpremeditated way; the conversation might lead up to it.
6467: 
6468: “I like breakfast-time better than any other moment in the day,” said
6469: Mr. Irwine. “No dust has settled on one’s mind then, and it presents a
6470: clear mirror to the rays of things. I always have a favourite book by
6471: me at breakfast, and I enjoy the bits I pick up then so much, that
6472: regularly every morning it seems to me as if I should certainly become
6473: studious again. But presently Dent brings up a poor fellow who has
6474: killed a hare, and when I’ve got through my ‘justicing,’ as Carroll
6475: calls it, I’m inclined for a ride round the glebe, and on my way back I
6476: meet with the master of the workhouse, who has got a long story of a
6477: mutinous pauper to tell me; and so the day goes on, and I’m always the
6478: same lazy fellow before evening sets in. Besides, one wants the
6479: stimulus of sympathy, and I have never had that since poor D’Oyley left
6480: Treddleston. If you had stuck to your books well, you rascal, I should
6481: have had a pleasanter prospect before me. But scholarship doesn’t run
6482: in your family blood.”
6483: 
6484: “No indeed. It’s well if I can remember a little inapplicable Latin to
6485: adorn my maiden speech in Parliament six or seven years hence. ‘Cras
6486: ingens iterabimus aequor,’ and a few shreds of that sort, will perhaps
6487: stick to me, and I shall arrange my opinions so as to introduce them.
6488: But I don’t think a knowledge of the classics is a pressing want to a
6489: country gentleman; as far as I can see, he’d much better have a
6490: knowledge of manures. I’ve been reading your friend Arthur Young’s
6491: books lately, and there’s nothing I should like better than to carry
6492: out some of his ideas in putting the farmers on a better management of
6493: their land; and, as he says, making what was a wild country, all of the
6494: same dark hue, bright and variegated with corn and cattle. My
6495: grandfather will never let me have any power while he lives, but
6496: there’s nothing I should like better than to undertake the Stonyshire
6497: side of the estate—it’s in a dismal condition—and set improvements on
6498: foot, and gallop about from one place to another and overlook them. I
6499: should like to know all the labourers, and see them touching their hats
6500: to me with a look of goodwill.”
6501: 
6502: “Bravo, Arthur! A man who has no feeling for the classics couldn’t make
6503: a better apology for coming into the world than by increasing the
6504: quantity of food to maintain scholars—and rectors who appreciate
6505: scholars. And whenever you enter on your career of model landlord may I
6506: be there to see. You’ll want a portly rector to complete the picture,
6507: and take his tithe of all the respect and honour you get by your hard
6508: work. Only don’t set your heart too strongly on the goodwill you are to
6509: get in consequence. I’m not sure that men are the fondest of those who
6510: try to be useful to them. You know Gawaine has got the curses of the
6511: whole neighbourhood upon him about that enclosure. You must make it
6512: quite clear to your mind which you are most bent upon, old
6513: boy—popularity or usefulness—else you may happen to miss both.”
6514: 
6515: “Oh! Gawaine is harsh in his manners; he doesn’t make himself
6516: personally agreeable to his tenants. I don’t believe there’s anything
6517: you can’t prevail on people to do with kindness. For my part, I
6518: couldn’t live in a neighbourhood where I was not respected and beloved.
6519: And it’s very pleasant to go among the tenants here—they seem all so
6520: well inclined to me I suppose it seems only the other day to them since
6521: I was a little lad, riding on a pony about as big as a sheep. And if
6522: fair allowances were made to them, and their buildings attended to, one
6523: could persuade them to farm on a better plan, stupid as they are.”
6524: 
6525: “Then mind you fall in love in the right place, and don’t get a wife
6526: who will drain your purse and make you niggardly in spite of yourself.
6527: My mother and I have a little discussion about you sometimes: she says,
6528: ‘I’ll never risk a single prophecy on Arthur until I see the woman he
6529: falls in love with.’ She thinks your lady-love will rule you as the
6530: moon rules the tides. But I feel bound to stand up for you, as my pupil
6531: you know, and I maintain that you’re not of that watery quality. So
6532: mind you don’t disgrace my judgment.”
6533: 
6534: Arthur winced under this speech, for keen old Mrs. Irwine’s opinion
6535: about him had the disagreeable effect of a sinister omen. This, to be
6536: sure, was only another reason for persevering in his intention, and
6537: getting an additional security against himself. Nevertheless, at this
6538: point in the conversation, he was conscious of increased disinclination
6539: to tell his story about Hetty. He was of an impressible nature, and
6540: lived a great deal in other people’s opinions and feelings concerning
6541: himself; and the mere fact that he was in the presence of an intimate
6542: friend, who had not the slightest notion that he had had any such
6543: serious internal struggle as he came to confide, rather shook his own
6544: belief in the seriousness of the struggle. It was not, after all, a
6545: thing to make a fuss about; and what could Irwine do for him that he
6546: could not do for himself? He would go to Eagledale in spite of Meg’s
6547: lameness—go on Rattler, and let Pym follow as well as he could on the
6548: old hack. That was his thought as he sugared his coffee; but the next
6549: minute, as he was lifting the cup to his lips, he remembered how
6550: thoroughly he had made up his mind last night to tell Irwine. No! He
6551: would not be vacillating again—he _would_ do what he had meant to do,
6552: this time. So it would be well not to let the personal tone of the
6553: conversation altogether drop. If they went to quite indifferent topics,
6554: his difficulty would be heightened. It had required no noticeable pause
6555: for this rush and rebound of feeling, before he answered, “But I think
6556: it is hardly an argument against a man’s general strength of character
6557: that he should be apt to be mastered by love. A fine constitution
6558: doesn’t insure one against smallpox or any other of those inevitable
6559: diseases. A man may be very firm in other matters and yet be under a
6560: sort of witchery from a woman.”
6561: 
6562: “Yes; but there’s this difference between love and smallpox, or
6563: bewitchment either—that if you detect the disease at an early stage and
6564: try change of air, there is every chance of complete escape without any
6565: further development of symptoms. And there are certain alternative
6566: doses which a man may administer to himself by keeping unpleasant
6567: consequences before his mind: this gives you a sort of smoked glass
6568: through which you may look at the resplendent fair one and discern her
6569: true outline; though I’m afraid, by the by, the smoked glass is apt to
6570: be missing just at the moment it is most wanted. I daresay, now, even a
6571: man fortified with a knowledge of the classics might be lured into an
6572: imprudent marriage, in spite of the warning given him by the chorus in
6573: the Prometheus.”
6574: 
6575: The smile that flitted across Arthur’s face was a faint one, and
6576: instead of following Mr. Irwine’s playful lead, he said, quite
6577: seriously—“Yes, that’s the worst of it. It’s a desperately vexatious
6578: thing, that after all one’s reflections and quiet determinations, we
6579: should be ruled by moods that one can’t calculate on beforehand. I
6580: don’t think a man ought to be blamed so much if he is betrayed into
6581: doing things in that way, in spite of his resolutions.”
6582: 
6583: “Ah, but the moods lie in his nature, my boy, just as much as his
6584: reflections did, and more. A man can never do anything at variance with
6585: his own nature. He carries within him the germ of his most exceptional
6586: action; and if we wise people make eminent fools of ourselves on any
6587: particular occasion, we must endure the legitimate conclusion that we
6588: carry a few grains of folly to our ounce of wisdom.”
6589: 
6590: “Well, but one may be betrayed into doing things by a combination of
6591: circumstances, which one might never have done otherwise.”
6592: 
6593: “Why, yes, a man can’t very well steal a bank-note unless the bank-note
6594: lies within convenient reach; but he won’t make us think him an honest
6595: man because he begins to howl at the bank-note for falling in his way.”
6596: 
6597: “But surely you don’t think a man who struggles against a temptation
6598: into which he falls at last as bad as the man who never struggles at
6599: all?”
6600: 
6601: “No, certainly; I pity him in proportion to his struggles, for they
6602: foreshadow the inward suffering which is the worst form of Nemesis.
6603: Consequences are unpitying. Our deeds carry their terrible
6604: consequences, quite apart from any fluctuations that went
6605: before—consequences that are hardly ever confined to ourselves. And it
6606: is best to fix our minds on that certainty, instead of considering what
6607: may be the elements of excuse for us. But I never knew you so inclined
6608: for moral discussion, Arthur? Is it some danger of your own that you
6609: are considering in this philosophical, general way?”
6610: 
6611: In asking this question, Mr. Irwine pushed his plate away, threw
6612: himself back in his chair, and looked straight at Arthur. He really
6613: suspected that Arthur wanted to tell him something, and thought of
6614: smoothing the way for him by this direct question. But he was mistaken.
6615: Brought suddenly and involuntarily to the brink of confession, Arthur
6616: shrank back and felt less disposed towards it than ever. The
6617: conversation had taken a more serious tone than he had intended—it
6618: would quite mislead Irwine—he would imagine there was a deep passion
6619: for Hetty, while there was no such thing. He was conscious of
6620: colouring, and was annoyed at his boyishness.
6621: 
6622: “Oh no, no danger,” he said as indifferently as he could. “I don’t know
6623: that I am more liable to irresolution than other people; only there are
6624: little incidents now and then that set one speculating on what might
6625: happen in the future.”
6626: 
6627: Was there a motive at work under this strange reluctance of Arthur’s
6628: which had a sort of backstairs influence, not admitted to himself? Our
6629: mental business is carried on much in the same way as the business of
6630: the State: a great deal of hard work is done by agents who are not
6631: acknowledged. In a piece of machinery, too, I believe there is often a
6632: small unnoticeable wheel which has a great deal to do with the motion
6633: of the large obvious ones. Possibly there was some such unrecognized
6634: agent secretly busy in Arthur’s mind at this moment—possibly it was the
6635: fear lest he might hereafter find the fact of having made a confession
6636: to the rector a serious annoyance, in case he should _not_ be able
6637: quite to carry out his good resolutions? I dare not assert that it was
6638: not so. The human soul is a very complex thing.
6639: 
6640: The idea of Hetty had just crossed Mr. Irwine’s mind as he looked
6641: inquiringly at Arthur, but his disclaiming indifferent answer confirmed
6642: the thought which had quickly followed—that there could be nothing
6643: serious in that direction. There was no probability that Arthur ever
6644: saw her except at church, and at her own home under the eye of Mrs.
6645: Poyser; and the hint he had given Arthur about her the other day had no
6646: more serious meaning than to prevent him from noticing her so as to
6647: rouse the little chit’s vanity, and in this way perturb the rustic
6648: drama of her life. Arthur would soon join his regiment, and be far
6649: away: no, there could be no danger in that quarter, even if Arthur’s
6650: character had not been a strong security against it. His honest,
6651: patronizing pride in the good-will and respect of everybody about him
6652: was a safeguard even against foolish romance, still more against a
6653: lower kind of folly. If there had been anything special on Arthur’s
6654: mind in the previous conversation, it was clear he was not inclined to
6655: enter into details, and Mr. Irwine was too delicate to imply even a
6656: friendly curiosity. He perceived a change of subject would be welcome,
6657: and said, “By the way, Arthur, at your colonel’s birthday fête there
6658: were some transparencies that made a great effect in honour of
6659: Britannia, and Pitt, and the Loamshire Militia, and, above all, the
6660: ‘generous youth,’ the hero of the day. Don’t you think you should get
6661: up something of the same sort to astonish our weak minds?”
6662: 
6663: The opportunity was gone. While Arthur was hesitating, the rope to
6664: which he might have clung had drifted away—he must trust now to his own
6665: swimming.
6666: 
6667: In ten minutes from that time, Mr. Irwine was called for on business,
6668: and Arthur, bidding him good-bye, mounted his horse again with a sense
6669: of dissatisfaction, which he tried to quell by determining to set off
6670: for Eagledale without an hour’s delay.
6671: 
6672:

6674: 
6675: Book Second
6676: 
6677: 
6678: 
6679: 
6680: Chapter XVII
6681: In Which the Story Pauses a Little
6682: 
6683: 
6684: “This Rector of Broxton is little better than a pagan!” I hear one of
6685: my readers exclaim. “How much more edifying it would have been if you
6686: had made him give Arthur some truly spiritual advice! You might have
6687: put into his mouth the most beautiful things—quite as good as reading a
6688: sermon.”
6689: 
6690: Certainly I could, if I held it the highest vocation of the novelist to
6691: represent things as they never have been and never will be. Then, of
6692: course, I might refashion life and character entirely after my own
6693: liking; I might select the most unexceptionable type of clergyman and
6694: put my own admirable opinions into his mouth on all occasions. But it
6695: happens, on the contrary, that my strongest effort is to avoid any such
6696: arbitrary picture, and to give a faithful account of men and things as
6697: they have mirrored themselves in my mind. The mirror is doubtless
6698: defective, the outlines will sometimes be disturbed, the reflection
6699: faint or confused; but I feel as much bound to tell you as precisely as
6700: I can what that reflection is, as if I were in the witness-box,
6701: narrating my experience on oath.
6702: 
6703: Sixty years ago—it is a long time, so no wonder things have changed—all
6704: clergymen were not zealous; indeed, there is reason to believe that the
6705: number of zealous clergymen was small, and it is probable that if one
6706: among the small minority had owned the livings of Broxton and Hayslope
6707: in the year 1799, you would have liked him no better than you like Mr.
6708: Irwine. Ten to one, you would have thought him a tasteless, indiscreet,
6709: methodistical man. It is so very rarely that facts hit that nice medium
6710: required by our own enlightened opinions and refined taste! Perhaps you
6711: will say, “Do improve the facts a little, then; make them more
6712: accordant with those correct views which it is our privilege to
6713: possess. The world is not just what we like; do touch it up with a
6714: tasteful pencil, and make believe it is not quite such a mixed
6715: entangled affair. Let all people who hold unexceptionable opinions act
6716: unexceptionably. Let your most faulty characters always be on the wrong
6717: side, and your virtuous ones on the right. Then we shall see at a
6718: glance whom we are to condemn and whom we are to approve. Then we shall
6719: be able to admire, without the slightest disturbance of our
6720: prepossessions: we shall hate and despise with that true ruminant
6721: relish which belongs to undoubting confidence.”
6722: 
6723: But, my good friend, what will you do then with your fellow-parishioner
6724: who opposes your husband in the vestry? With your newly appointed
6725: vicar, whose style of preaching you find painfully below that of his
6726: regretted predecessor? With the honest servant who worries your soul
6727: with her one failing? With your neighbour, Mrs. Green, who was really
6728: kind to you in your last illness, but has said several ill-natured
6729: things about you since your convalescence? Nay, with your excellent
6730: husband himself, who has other irritating habits besides that of not
6731: wiping his shoes? These fellow-mortals, every one, must be accepted as
6732: they are: you can neither straighten their noses, nor brighten their
6733: wit, nor rectify their dispositions; and it is these people—amongst
6734: whom your life is passed—that it is needful you should tolerate, pity,
6735: and love: it is these more or less ugly, stupid, inconsistent people
6736: whose movements of goodness you should be able to admire—for whom you
6737: should cherish all possible hopes, all possible patience. And I would
6738: not, even if I had the choice, be the clever novelist who could create
6739: a world so much better than this, in which we get up in the morning to
6740: do our daily work, that you would be likely to turn a harder, colder
6741: eye on the dusty streets and the common green fields—on the real
6742: breathing men and women, who can be chilled by your indifference or
6743: injured by your prejudice; who can be cheered and helped onward by your
6744: fellow-feeling, your forbearance, your outspoken, brave justice.
6745: 
6746: So I am content to tell my simple story, without trying to make things
6747: seem better than they were; dreading nothing, indeed, but falsity,
6748: which, in spite of one’s best efforts, there is reason to dread.
6749: Falsehood is so easy, truth so difficult. The pencil is conscious of a
6750: delightful facility in drawing a griffin—the longer the claws, and the
6751: larger the wings, the better; but that marvellous facility which we
6752: mistook for genius is apt to forsake us when we want to draw a real
6753: unexaggerated lion. Examine your words well, and you will find that
6754: even when you have no motive to be false, it is a very hard thing to
6755: say the exact truth, even about your own immediate feelings—much harder
6756: than to say something fine about them which is _not_ the exact truth.
6757: 
6758: It is for this rare, precious quality of truthfulness that I delight in
6759: many Dutch paintings, which lofty-minded people despise. I find a
6760: source of delicious sympathy in these faithful pictures of a monotonous
6761: homely existence, which has been the fate of so many more among my
6762: fellow-mortals than a life of pomp or of absolute indigence, of tragic
6763: suffering or of world-stirring actions. I turn, without shrinking, from
6764: cloud-borne angels, from prophets, sibyls, and heroic warriors, to an
6765: old woman bending over her flower-pot, or eating her solitary dinner,
6766: while the noonday light, softened perhaps by a screen of leaves, falls
6767: on her mob-cap, and just touches the rim of her spinning-wheel, and her
6768: stone jug, and all those cheap common things which are the precious
6769: necessaries of life to her—or I turn to that village wedding, kept
6770: between four brown walls, where an awkward bridegroom opens the dance
6771: with a high-shouldered, broad-faced bride, while elderly and
6772: middle-aged friends look on, with very irregular noses and lips, and
6773: probably with quart-pots in their hands, but with an expression of
6774: unmistakable contentment and goodwill. “Foh!” says my idealistic
6775: friend, “what vulgar details! What good is there in taking all these
6776: pains to give an exact likeness of old women and clowns? What a low
6777: phase of life! What clumsy, ugly people!”
6778: 
6779: But bless us, things may be lovable that are not altogether handsome, I
6780: hope? I am not at all sure that the majority of the human race have not
6781: been ugly, and even among those “lords of their kind,” the British,
6782: squat figures, ill-shapen nostrils, and dingy complexions are not
6783: startling exceptions. Yet there is a great deal of family love amongst
6784: us. I have a friend or two whose class of features is such that the
6785: Apollo curl on the summit of their brows would be decidedly trying; yet
6786: to my certain knowledge tender hearts have beaten for them, and their
6787: miniatures—flattering, but still not lovely—are kissed in secret by
6788: motherly lips. I have seen many an excellent matron, who could have
6789: never in her best days have been handsome, and yet she had a packet of
6790: yellow love-letters in a private drawer, and sweet children showered
6791: kisses on her sallow cheeks. And I believe there have been plenty of
6792: young heroes, of middle stature and feeble beards, who have felt quite
6793: sure they could never love anything more insignificant than a Diana,
6794: and yet have found themselves in middle life happily settled with a
6795: wife who waddles. Yes! Thank God; human feeling is like the mighty
6796: rivers that bless the earth: it does not wait for beauty—it flows with
6797: resistless force and brings beauty with it.
6798: 
6799: All honour and reverence to the divine beauty of form! Let us cultivate
6800: it to the utmost in men, women, and children—in our gardens and in our
6801: houses. But let us love that other beauty too, which lies in no secret
6802: of proportion, but in the secret of deep human sympathy. Paint us an
6803: angel, if you can, with a floating violet robe, and a face paled by the
6804: celestial light; paint us yet oftener a Madonna, turning her mild face
6805: upward and opening her arms to welcome the divine glory; but do not
6806: impose on us any aesthetic rules which shall banish from the region of
6807: Art those old women scraping carrots with their work-worn hands, those
6808: heavy clowns taking holiday in a dingy pot-house, those rounded backs
6809: and stupid weather-beaten faces that have bent over the spade and done
6810: the rough work of the world—those homes with their tin pans, their
6811: brown pitchers, their rough curs, and their clusters of onions. In this
6812: world there are so many of these common coarse people, who have no
6813: picturesque sentimental wretchedness! It is so needful we should
6814: remember their existence, else we may happen to leave them quite out of
6815: our religion and philosophy and frame lofty theories which only fit a
6816: world of extremes. Therefore, let Art always remind us of them;
6817: therefore let us always have men ready to give the loving pains of a
6818: life to the faithful representing of commonplace things—men who see
6819: beauty in these commonplace things, and delight in showing how kindly
6820: the light of heaven falls on them. There are few prophets in the world;
6821: few sublimely beautiful women; few heroes. I can’t afford to give all
6822: my love and reverence to such rarities: I want a great deal of those
6823: feelings for my every-day fellow-men, especially for the few in the
6824: foreground of the great multitude, whose faces I know, whose hands I
6825: touch, for whom I have to make way with kindly courtesy. Neither are
6826: picturesque lazzaroni or romantic criminals half so frequent as your
6827: common labourer, who gets his own bread and eats it vulgarly but
6828: creditably with his own pocket-knife. It is more needful that I should
6829: have a fibre of sympathy connecting me with that vulgar citizen who
6830: weighs out my sugar in a vilely assorted cravat and waistcoat, than
6831: with the handsomest rascal in red scarf and green feathers—more needful
6832: that my heart should swell with loving admiration at some trait of
6833: gentle goodness in the faulty people who sit at the same hearth with
6834: me, or in the clergyman of my own parish, who is perhaps rather too
6835: corpulent and in other respects is not an Oberlin or a Tillotson, than
6836: at the deeds of heroes whom I shall never know except by hearsay, or at
6837: the sublimest abstract of all clerical graces that was ever conceived
6838: by an able novelist.
6839: 
6840: And so I come back to Mr. Irwine, with whom I desire you to be in
6841: perfect charity, far as he may be from satisfying your demands on the
6842: clerical character. Perhaps you think he was not—as he ought to have
6843: been—a living demonstration of the benefits attached to a national
6844: church? But I am not sure of that; at least I know that the people in
6845: Broxton and Hayslope would have been very sorry to part with their
6846: clergyman, and that most faces brightened at his approach; and until it
6847: can be proved that hatred is a better thing for the soul than love, I
6848: must believe that Mr. Irwine’s influence in his parish was a more
6849: wholesome one than that of the zealous Mr. Ryde, who came there twenty
6850: years afterwards, when Mr. Irwine had been gathered to his fathers. It
6851: is true, Mr. Ryde insisted strongly on the doctrines of the
6852: Reformation, visited his flock a great deal in their own homes, and was
6853: severe in rebuking the aberrations of the flesh—put a stop, indeed, to
6854: the Christmas rounds of the church singers, as promoting drunkenness
6855: and too light a handling of sacred things. But I gathered from Adam
6856: Bede, to whom I talked of these matters in his old age, that few
6857: clergymen could be less successful in winning the hearts of their
6858: parishioners than Mr. Ryde. They learned a great many notions about
6859: doctrine from him, so that almost every church-goer under fifty began
6860: to distinguish as well between the genuine gospel and what did not come
6861: precisely up to that standard, as if he had been born and bred a
6862: Dissenter; and for some time after his arrival there seemed to be quite
6863: a religious movement in that quiet rural district. “But,” said Adam,
6864: “I’ve seen pretty clear, ever since I was a young un, as religion’s
6865: something else besides notions. It isn’t notions sets people doing the
6866: right thing—it’s feelings. It’s the same with the notions in religion
6867: as it is with math’matics—a man may be able to work problems straight
6868: off in’s head as he sits by the fire and smokes his pipe, but if he has
6869: to make a machine or a building, he must have a will and a resolution
6870: and love something else better than his own ease. Somehow, the
6871: congregation began to fall off, and people began to speak light o’ Mr.
6872: Ryde. I believe he meant right at bottom; but, you see, he was
6873: sourish-tempered, and was for beating down prices with the people as
6874: worked for him; and his preaching wouldn’t go down well with that
6875: sauce. And he wanted to be like my lord judge i’ the parish, punishing
6876: folks for doing wrong; and he scolded ’em from the pulpit as if he’d
6877: been a Ranter, and yet he couldn’t abide the Dissenters, and was a deal
6878: more set against ’em than Mr. Irwine was. And then he didn’t keep
6879: within his income, for he seemed to think at first go-off that six
6880: hundred a-year was to make him as big a man as Mr. Donnithorne. That’s
6881: a sore mischief I’ve often seen with the poor curates jumping into a
6882: bit of a living all of a sudden. Mr. Ryde was a deal thought on at a
6883: distance, I believe, and he wrote books, but as for math’matics and the
6884: natur o’ things, he was as ignorant as a woman. He was very knowing
6885: about doctrines, and used to call ’em the bulwarks of the Reformation;
6886: but I’ve always mistrusted that sort o’ learning as leaves folks
6887: foolish and unreasonable about business. Now Mester Irwine was as
6888: different as could be: as quick!—he understood what you meant in a
6889: minute, and he knew all about building, and could see when you’d made a
6890: good job. And he behaved as much like a gentleman to the farmers, and
6891: th’ old women, and the labourers, as he did to the gentry. You never
6892: saw _him_ interfering and scolding, and trying to play th’ emperor. Ah,
6893: he was a fine man as ever you set eyes on; and so kind to’s mother and
6894: sisters. That poor sickly Miss Anne—he seemed to think more of her than
6895: of anybody else in the world. There wasn’t a soul in the parish had a
6896: word to say against him; and his servants stayed with him till they
6897: were so old and pottering, he had to hire other folks to do their
6898: work.”
6899: 
6900: “Well,” I said, “that was an excellent way of preaching in the
6901: weekdays; but I daresay, if your old friend Mr. Irwine were to come to
6902: life again, and get into the pulpit next Sunday, you would be rather
6903: ashamed that he didn’t preach better after all your praise of him.”
6904: 
6905: “Nay, nay,” said Adam, broadening his chest and throwing himself back
6906: in his chair, as if he were ready to meet all inferences, “nobody has
6907: ever heard me say Mr. Irwine was much of a preacher. He didn’t go into
6908: deep speritial experience; and I know there s a deal in a man’s inward
6909: life as you can’t measure by the square, and say, ‘Do this and that ’ll
6910: follow,’ and, ‘Do that and this ’ll follow.’ There’s things go on in
6911: the soul, and times when feelings come into you like a rushing mighty
6912: wind, as the Scripture says, and part your life in two a’most, so you
6913: look back on yourself as if you was somebody else. Those are things as
6914: you can’t bottle up in a ‘do this’ and ‘do that’; and I’ll go so far
6915: with the strongest Methodist ever you’ll find. That shows me there’s
6916: deep speritial things in religion. You can’t make much out wi’ talking
6917: about it, but you feel it. Mr. Irwine didn’t go into those things—he
6918: preached short moral sermons, and that was all. But then he acted
6919: pretty much up to what he said; he didn’t set up for being so different
6920: from other folks one day, and then be as like ’em as two peas the next.
6921: And he made folks love him and respect him, and that was better nor
6922: stirring up their gall wi’ being overbusy. Mrs. Poyser used to say—you
6923: know she would have her word about everything—she said, Mr. Irwine was
6924: like a good meal o’ victual, you were the better for him without
6925: thinking on it, and Mr. Ryde was like a dose o’ physic, he gripped you
6926: and worreted you, and after all he left you much the same.”
6927: 
6928: “But didn’t Mr. Ryde preach a great deal more about that spiritual part
6929: of religion that you talk of, Adam? Couldn’t you get more out of his
6930: sermons than out of Mr. Irwine’s?”
6931: 
6932: “Eh, I knowna. He preached a deal about doctrines. But I’ve seen pretty
6933: clear, ever since I was a young un, as religion’s something else
6934: besides doctrines and notions. I look at it as if the doctrines was
6935: like finding names for your feelings, so as you can talk of ’em when
6936: you’ve never known ’em, just as a man may talk o’ tools when he knows
6937: their names, though he’s never so much as seen ’em, still less handled
6938: ’em. I’ve heard a deal o’ doctrine i’ my time, for I used to go after
6939: the Dissenting preachers along wi’ Seth, when I was a lad o’ seventeen,
6940: and got puzzling myself a deal about th’ Arminians and the Calvinists.
6941: The Wesleyans, you know, are strong Arminians; and Seth, who could
6942: never abide anything harsh and was always for hoping the best, held
6943: fast by the Wesleyans from the very first; but I thought I could pick a
6944: hole or two in their notions, and I got disputing wi’ one o’ the class
6945: leaders down at Treddles’on, and harassed him so, first o’ this side
6946: and then o’ that, till at last he said, ‘Young man, it’s the devil
6947: making use o’ your pride and conceit as a weapon to war against the
6948: simplicity o’ the truth.’ I couldn’t help laughing then, but as I was
6949: going home, I thought the man wasn’t far wrong. I began to see as all
6950: this weighing and sifting what this text means and that text means, and
6951: whether folks are saved all by God’s grace, or whether there goes an
6952: ounce o’ their own will to’t, was no part o’ real religion at all. You
6953: may talk o’ these things for hours on end, and you’ll only be all the
6954: more coxy and conceited for’t. So I took to going nowhere but to
6955: church, and hearing nobody but Mr. Irwine, for he said nothing but what
6956: was good and what you’d be the wiser for remembering. And I found it
6957: better for my soul to be humble before the mysteries o’ God’s dealings,
6958: and not be making a clatter about what I could never understand. And
6959: they’re poor foolish questions after all; for what have we got either
6960: inside or outside of us but what comes from God? If we’ve got a
6961: resolution to do right, He gave it us, I reckon, first or last; but I
6962: see plain enough we shall never do it without a resolution, and that’s
6963: enough for me.”
6964: 
6965: Adam, you perceive, was a warm admirer, perhaps a partial judge, of Mr.
6966: Irwine, as, happily, some of us still are of the people we have known
6967: familiarly. Doubtless it will be despised as a weakness by that lofty
6968: order of minds who pant after the ideal, and are oppressed by a general
6969: sense that their emotions are of too exquisite a character to find fit
6970: objects among their everyday fellowmen. I have often been favoured with
6971: the confidence of these select natures, and find them to concur in the
6972: experience that great men are overestimated and small men are
6973: insupportable; that if you would love a woman without ever looking back
6974: on your love as a folly, she must die while you are courting her; and
6975: if you would maintain the slightest belief in human heroism, you must
6976: never make a pilgrimage to see the hero. I confess I have often meanly
6977: shrunk from confessing to these accomplished and acute gentlemen what
6978: my own experience has been. I am afraid I have often smiled with
6979: hypocritical assent, and gratified them with an epigram on the fleeting
6980: nature of our illusions, which any one moderately acquainted with
6981: French literature can command at a moment’s notice. Human converse, I
6982: think some wise man has remarked, is not rigidly sincere. But I
6983: herewith discharge my conscience, and declare that I have had quite
6984: enthusiastic movements of admiration towards old gentlemen who spoke
6985: the worst English, who were occasionally fretful in their temper, and
6986: who had never moved in a higher sphere of influence than that of parish
6987: overseer; and that the way in which I have come to the conclusion that
6988: human nature is lovable—the way I have learnt something of its deep
6989: pathos, its sublime mysteries—has been by living a great deal among
6990: people more or less commonplace and vulgar, of whom you would perhaps
6991: hear nothing very surprising if you were to inquire about them in the
6992: neighbourhoods where they dwelt. Ten to one most of the small
6993: shopkeepers in their vicinity saw nothing at all in them. For I have
6994: observed this remarkable coincidence, that the select natures who pant
6995: after the ideal, and find nothing in pantaloons or petticoats great
6996: enough to command their reverence and love, are curiously in unison
6997: with the narrowest and pettiest. For example, I have often heard Mr.
6998: Gedge, the landlord of the Royal Oak, who used to turn a bloodshot eye
6999: on his neighbours in the village of Shepperton, sum up his opinion of
7000: the people in his own parish—and they were all the people he knew—in
7001: these emphatic words: “Aye, sir, I’ve said it often, and I’ll say it
7002: again, they’re a poor lot i’ this parish—a poor lot, sir, big and
7003: little.” I think he had a dim idea that if he could migrate to a
7004: distant parish, he might find neighbours worthy of him; and indeed he
7005: did subsequently transfer himself to the Saracen’s Head, which was
7006: doing a thriving business in the back street of a neighbouring
7007: market-town. But, oddly enough, he has found the people up that back
7008: street of precisely the same stamp as the inhabitants of Shepperton—“a
7009: poor lot, sir, big and little, and them as comes for a go o’ gin are no
7010: better than them as comes for a pint o’ twopenny—a poor lot.”
7011: 
7012: 
7013: 
7014: 
7015: Chapter XVIII
7016: Church
7017: 
7018: 
7019: “Hetty, Hetty, don’t you know church begins at two, and it’s gone half
7020: after one a’ready? Have you got nothing better to think on this good
7021: Sunday as poor old Thias Bede’s to be put into the ground, and him
7022: drownded i’ th’ dead o’ the night, as it’s enough to make one’s back
7023: run cold, but you must be ’dizening yourself as if there was a wedding
7024: i’stid of a funeral?”
7025: 
7026: “Well, Aunt,” said Hetty, “I can’t be ready so soon as everybody else,
7027: when I’ve got Totty’s things to put on. And I’d ever such work to make
7028: her stand still.”
7029: 
7030: Hetty was coming downstairs, and Mrs. Poyser, in her plain bonnet and
7031: shawl, was standing below. If ever a girl looked as if she had been
7032: made of roses, that girl was Hetty in her Sunday hat and frock. For her
7033: hat was trimmed with pink, and her frock had pink spots, sprinkled on a
7034: white ground. There was nothing but pink and white about her, except in
7035: her dark hair and eyes and her little buckled shoes. Mrs. Poyser was
7036: provoked at herself, for she could hardly keep from smiling, as any
7037: mortal is inclined to do at the sight of pretty round things. So she
7038: turned without speaking, and joined the group outside the house door,
7039: followed by Hetty, whose heart was fluttering so at the thought of some
7040: one she expected to see at church that she hardly felt the ground she
7041: trod on.
7042: 
7043: And now the little procession set off. Mr. Poyser was in his Sunday
7044: suit of drab, with a red-and-green waistcoat and a green watch-ribbon
7045: having a large cornelian seal attached, pendant like a plumb-line from
7046: that promontory where his watch-pocket was situated; a silk
7047: handkerchief of a yellow tone round his neck; and excellent grey ribbed
7048: stockings, knitted by Mrs. Poyser’s own hand, setting off the
7049: proportions of his leg. Mr. Poyser had no reason to be ashamed of his
7050: leg, and suspected that the growing abuse of top-boots and other
7051: fashions tending to disguise the nether limbs had their origin in a
7052: pitiable degeneracy of the human calf. Still less had he reason to be
7053: ashamed of his round jolly face, which was good humour itself as he
7054: said, “Come, Hetty—come, little uns!” and giving his arm to his wife,
7055: led the way through the causeway gate into the yard.
7056: 
7057: The “little uns” addressed were Marty and Tommy, boys of nine and
7058: seven, in little fustian tailed coats and knee-breeches, relieved by
7059: rosy cheeks and black eyes, looking as much like their father as a very
7060: small elephant is like a very large one. Hetty walked between them, and
7061: behind came patient Molly, whose task it was to carry Totty through the
7062: yard and over all the wet places on the road; for Totty, having
7063: speedily recovered from her threatened fever, had insisted on going to
7064: church to-day, and especially on wearing her red-and-black necklace
7065: outside her tippet. And there were many wet places for her to be
7066: carried over this afternoon, for there had been heavy showers in the
7067: morning, though now the clouds had rolled off and lay in towering
7068: silvery masses on the horizon.
7069: 
7070: You might have known it was Sunday if you had only waked up in the
7071: farmyard. The cocks and hens seemed to know it, and made only crooning
7072: subdued noises; the very bull-dog looked less savage, as if he would
7073: have been satisfied with a smaller bite than usual. The sunshine seemed
7074: to call all things to rest and not to labour. It was asleep itself on
7075: the moss-grown cow-shed; on the group of white ducks nestling together
7076: with their bills tucked under their wings; on the old black sow
7077: stretched languidly on the straw, while her largest young one found an
7078: excellent spring-bed on his mother’s fat ribs; on Alick, the shepherd,
7079: in his new smock-frock, taking an uneasy siesta, half-sitting,
7080: half-standing on the granary steps. Alick was of opinion that church,
7081: like other luxuries, was not to be indulged in often by a foreman who
7082: had the weather and the ewes on his mind. “Church! Nay—I’n gotten
7083: summat else to think on,” was an answer which he often uttered in a
7084: tone of bitter significance that silenced further question. I feel sure
7085: Alick meant no irreverence; indeed, I know that his mind was not of a
7086: speculative, negative cast, and he would on no account have missed
7087: going to church on Christmas Day, Easter Sunday, and “Whissuntide.” But
7088: he had a general impression that public worship and religious
7089: ceremonies, like other non-productive employments, were intended for
7090: people who had leisure.
7091: 
7092: “There’s Father a-standing at the yard-gate,” said Martin Poyser. “I
7093: reckon he wants to watch us down the field. It’s wonderful what sight
7094: he has, and him turned seventy-five.”
7095: 
7096: “Ah, I often think it’s wi’ th’ old folks as it is wi’ the babbies,”
7097: said Mrs. Poyser; “they’re satisfied wi’ looking, no matter what
7098: they’re looking at. It’s God A’mighty’s way o’ quietening ’em, I
7099: reckon, afore they go to sleep.”
7100: 
7101: Old Martin opened the gate as he saw the family procession approaching,
7102: and held it wide open, leaning on his stick—pleased to do this bit of
7103: work; for, like all old men whose life has been spent in labour, he
7104: liked to feel that he was still useful—that there was a better crop of
7105: onions in the garden because he was by at the sowing—and that the cows
7106: would be milked the better if he stayed at home on a Sunday afternoon
7107: to look on. He always went to church on Sacrament Sundays, but not very
7108: regularly at other times; on wet Sundays, or whenever he had a touch of
7109: rheumatism, he used to read the three first chapters of Genesis
7110: instead.
7111: 
7112: “They’ll ha’ putten Thias Bede i’ the ground afore ye get to the
7113: churchyard,” he said, as his son came up. “It ’ud ha’ been better luck
7114: if they’d ha’ buried him i’ the forenoon when the rain was fallin’;
7115: there’s no likelihoods of a drop now; an’ the moon lies like a boat
7116: there, dost see? That’s a sure sign o’ fair weather—there’s a many as
7117: is false but that’s sure.”
7118: 
7119: “Aye, aye,” said the son, “I’m in hopes it’ll hold up now.”
7120: 
7121: “Mind what the parson says, mind what the parson says, my lads,” said
7122: Grandfather to the black-eyed youngsters in knee-breeches, conscious of
7123: a marble or two in their pockets which they looked forward to handling,
7124: a little, secretly, during the sermon.
7125: 
7126: “Dood-bye, Dandad,” said Totty. “Me doin’ to church. Me dot my neklace
7127: on. Dive me a peppermint.”
7128: 
7129: Grandad, shaking with laughter at this “deep little wench,” slowly
7130: transferred his stick to his left hand, which held the gate open, and
7131: slowly thrust his finger into the waistcoat pocket on which Totty had
7132: fixed her eyes with a confident look of expectation.
7133: 
7134: And when they were all gone, the old man leaned on the gate again,
7135: watching them across the lane along the Home Close, and through the far
7136: gate, till they disappeared behind a bend in the hedge. For the
7137: hedgerows in those days shut out one’s view, even on the better-managed
7138: farms; and this afternoon, the dog-roses were tossing out their pink
7139: wreaths, the nightshade was in its yellow and purple glory, the pale
7140: honeysuckle grew out of reach, peeping high up out of a holly bush, and
7141: over all an ash or a sycamore every now and then threw its shadow
7142: across the path.
7143: 
7144: There were acquaintances at other gates who had to move aside and let
7145: them pass: at the gate of the Home Close there was half the dairy of
7146: cows standing one behind the other, extremely slow to understand that
7147: their large bodies might be in the way; at the far gate there was the
7148: mare holding her head over the bars, and beside her the liver-coloured
7149: foal with its head towards its mother’s flank, apparently still much
7150: embarrassed by its own straddling existence. The way lay entirely
7151: through Mr. Poyser’s own fields till they reached the main road leading
7152: to the village, and he turned a keen eye on the stock and the crops as
7153: they went along, while Mrs. Poyser was ready to supply a running
7154: commentary on them all. The woman who manages a dairy has a large share
7155: in making the rent, so she may well be allowed to have her opinion on
7156: stock and their “keep”—an exercise which strengthens her understanding
7157: so much that she finds herself able to give her husband advice on most
7158: other subjects.
7159: 
7160: “There’s that shorthorned Sally,” she said, as they entered the Home
7161: Close, and she caught sight of the meek beast that lay chewing the cud
7162: and looking at her with a sleepy eye. “I begin to hate the sight o’ the
7163: cow; and I say now what I said three weeks ago, the sooner we get rid
7164: of her the better, for there’s that little yallow cow as doesn’t give
7165: half the milk, and yet I’ve twice as much butter from her.”
7166: 
7167: “Why, thee’t not like the women in general,” said Mr. Poyser; “they
7168: like the shorthorns, as give such a lot o’ milk. There’s Chowne’s wife
7169: wants him to buy no other sort.”
7170: 
7171: “What’s it sinnify what Chowne’s wife likes? A poor soft thing, wi’ no
7172: more head-piece nor a sparrow. She’d take a big cullender to strain her
7173: lard wi’, and then wonder as the scratchin’s run through. I’ve seen
7174: enough of her to know as I’ll niver take a servant from her house
7175: again—all hugger-mugger—and you’d niver know, when you went in, whether
7176: it was Monday or Friday, the wash draggin’ on to th’ end o’ the week;
7177: and as for her cheese, I know well enough it rose like a loaf in a tin
7178: last year. And then she talks o’ the weather bein’ i’ fault, as there’s
7179: folks ’ud stand on their heads and then say the fault was i’ their
7180: boots.”
7181: 
7182: “Well, Chowne’s been wanting to buy Sally, so we can get rid of her if
7183: thee lik’st,” said Mr. Poyser, secretly proud of his wife’s superior
7184: power of putting two and two together; indeed, on recent market-days he
7185: had more than once boasted of her discernment in this very matter of
7186: shorthorns. “Aye, them as choose a soft for a wife may’s well buy up
7187: the shorthorns, for if you get your head stuck in a bog, your legs
7188: may’s well go after it. Eh! Talk o’ legs, there’s legs for you,” Mrs.
7189: Poyser continued, as Totty, who had been set down now the road was dry,
7190: toddled on in front of her father and mother. “There’s shapes! An’
7191: she’s got such a long foot, she’ll be her father’s own child.”
7192: 
7193: “Aye, she’ll be welly such a one as Hetty i’ ten years’ time, on’y
7194: she’s got _thy_ coloured eyes. I niver remember a blue eye i’ my
7195: family; my mother had eyes as black as sloes, just like Hetty’s.”
7196: 
7197: “The child ’ull be none the worse for having summat as isn’t like
7198: Hetty. An’ I’m none for having her so overpretty. Though for the matter
7199: o’ that, there’s people wi’ light hair an’ blue eyes as pretty as them
7200: wi’ black. If Dinah had got a bit o’ colour in her cheeks, an’ didn’t
7201: stick that Methodist cap on her head, enough to frighten the cows,
7202: folks ’ud think her as pretty as Hetty.”
7203: 
7204: “Nay, nay,” said Mr. Poyser, with rather a contemptuous emphasis, “thee
7205: dostna know the pints of a woman. The men ’ud niver run after Dinah as
7206: they would after Hetty.”
7207: 
7208: “What care I what the men ’ud run after? It’s well seen what choice the
7209: most of ’em know how to make, by the poor draggle-tails o’ wives you
7210: see, like bits o’ gauze ribbin, good for nothing when the colour’s
7211: gone.”
7212: 
7213: “Well, well, thee canstna say but what I knowed how to make a choice
7214: when I married thee,” said Mr. Poyser, who usually settled little
7215: conjugal disputes by a compliment of this sort; “and thee wast twice as
7216: buxom as Dinah ten year ago.”
7217: 
7218: “I niver said as a woman had need to be ugly to make a good missis of a
7219: house. There’s Chowne’s wife ugly enough to turn the milk an’ save the
7220: rennet, but she’ll niver save nothing any other way. But as for Dinah,
7221: poor child, she’s niver likely to be buxom as long as she’ll make her
7222: dinner o’ cake and water, for the sake o’ giving to them as want. She
7223: provoked me past bearing sometimes; and, as I told her, she went clean
7224: again’ the Scriptur’, for that says, ‘Love your neighbour as yourself’;
7225: ‘but,’ I said, ‘if you loved your neighbour no better nor you do
7226: yourself, Dinah, it’s little enough you’d do for him. You’d be thinking
7227: he might do well enough on a half-empty stomach.’ Eh, I wonder where
7228: she is this blessed Sunday! Sitting by that sick woman, I daresay, as
7229: she’d set her heart on going to all of a sudden.”
7230: 
7231: “Ah, it was a pity she should take such megrims into her head, when she
7232: might ha’ stayed wi’ us all summer, and eaten twice as much as she
7233: wanted, and it ’ud niver ha’ been missed. She made no odds in th’ house
7234: at all, for she sat as still at her sewing as a bird on the nest, and
7235: was uncommon nimble at running to fetch anything. If Hetty gets
7236: married, theed’st like to ha’ Dinah wi’ thee constant.”
7237: 
7238: “It’s no use thinking o’ that,” said Mrs. Poyser. “You might as well
7239: beckon to the flying swallow as ask Dinah to come an’ live here
7240: comfortable, like other folks. If anything could turn her, _I_ should
7241: ha’ turned her, for I’ve talked to her for a hour on end, and scolded
7242: her too; for she’s my own sister’s child, and it behoves me to do what
7243: I can for her. But eh, poor thing, as soon as she’d said us ‘good-bye’
7244: an’ got into the cart, an’ looked back at me with her pale face, as is
7245: welly like her Aunt Judith come back from heaven, I begun to be
7246: frightened to think o’ the set-downs I’d given her; for it comes over
7247: you sometimes as if she’d a way o’ knowing the rights o’ things more
7248: nor other folks have. But I’ll niver give in as that’s ’cause she’s a
7249: Methodist, no more nor a white calf’s white ’cause it eats out o’ the
7250: same bucket wi’ a black un.”
7251: 
7252: “Nay,” said Mr. Poyser, with as near an approach to a snarl as his
7253: good-nature would allow; “I’m no opinion o’ the Methodists. It’s on’y
7254: tradesfolks as turn Methodists; you nuver knew a farmer bitten wi’ them
7255: maggots. There’s maybe a workman now an’ then, as isn’t overclever at’s
7256: work, takes to preachin’ an’ that, like Seth Bede. But you see Adam, as
7257: has got one o’ the best head-pieces hereabout, knows better; he’s a
7258: good Churchman, else I’d never encourage him for a sweetheart for
7259: Hetty.”
7260: 
7261: “Why, goodness me,” said Mrs. Poyser, who had looked back while her
7262: husband was speaking, “look where Molly is with them lads! They’re the
7263: field’s length behind us. How _could_ you let ’em do so, Hetty? Anybody
7264: might as well set a pictur’ to watch the children as you. Run back and
7265: tell ’em to come on.”
7266: 
7267: Mr. and Mrs. Poyser were now at the end of the second field, so they
7268: set Totty on the top of one of the large stones forming the true
7269: Loamshire stile, and awaited the loiterers; Totty observing with
7270: complacency, “Dey naughty, naughty boys—me dood.”
7271: 
7272: The fact was that this Sunday walk through the fields was fraught with
7273: great excitement to Marty and Tommy, who saw a perpetual drama going on
7274: in the hedgerows, and could no more refrain from stopping and peeping
7275: than if they had been a couple of spaniels or terriers. Marty was quite
7276: sure he saw a yellow-hammer on the boughs of the great ash, and while
7277: he was peeping, he missed the sight of a white-throated stoat, which
7278: had run across the path and was described with much fervour by the
7279: junior Tommy. Then there was a little greenfinch, just fledged,
7280: fluttering along the ground, and it seemed quite possible to catch it,
7281: till it managed to flutter under the blackberry bush. Hetty could not
7282: be got to give any heed to these things, so Molly was called on for her
7283: ready sympathy, and peeped with open mouth wherever she was told, and
7284: said “Lawks!” whenever she was expected to wonder.
7285: 
7286: Molly hastened on with some alarm when Hetty had come back and called
7287: to them that her aunt was angry; but Marty ran on first, shouting,
7288: “We’ve found the speckled turkey’s nest, Mother!” with the instinctive
7289: confidence that people who bring good news are never in fault.
7290: 
7291: “Ah,” said Mrs. Poyser, really forgetting all discipline in this
7292: pleasant surprise, “that’s a good lad; why, where is it?”
7293: 
7294: “Down in ever such a hole, under the hedge. I saw it first, looking
7295: after the greenfinch, and she sat on th’ nest.”
7296: 
7297: “You didn’t frighten her, I hope,” said the mother, “else she’ll
7298: forsake it.”
7299: 
7300: “No, I went away as still as still, and whispered to Molly—didn’t I,
7301: Molly?”
7302: 
7303: “Well, well, now come on,” said Mrs. Poyser, “and walk before Father
7304: and Mother, and take your little sister by the hand. We must go
7305: straight on now. Good boys don’t look after the birds of a Sunday.”
7306: 
7307: “But, Mother,” said Marty, “you said you’d give half-a-crown to find
7308: the speckled turkey’s nest. Mayn’t I have the half-crown put into my
7309: money-box?”
7310: 
7311: “We’ll see about that, my lad, if you walk along now, like a good boy.”
7312: 
7313: The father and mother exchanged a significant glance of amusement at
7314: their eldest-born’s acuteness; but on Tommy’s round face there was a
7315: cloud.
7316: 
7317: “Mother,” he said, half-crying, “Marty’s got ever so much more money in
7318: his box nor I’ve got in mine.”
7319: 
7320: “Munny, _me_ want half-a-toun in _my_ bots,” said Totty.
7321: 
7322: “Hush, hush, hush,” said Mrs. Poyser, “did ever anybody hear such
7323: naughty children? Nobody shall ever see their money-boxes any more, if
7324: they don’t make haste and go on to church.”
7325: 
7326: This dreadful threat had the desired effect, and through the two
7327: remaining fields the three pair of small legs trotted on without any
7328: serious interruption, notwithstanding a small pond full of tadpoles,
7329: alias “bullheads,” which the lads looked at wistfully.
7330: 
7331: The damp hay that must be scattered and turned afresh to-morrow was not
7332: a cheering sight to Mr. Poyser, who during hay and corn harvest had
7333: often some mental struggles as to the benefits of a day of rest; but no
7334: temptation would have induced him to carry on any field-work, however
7335: early in the morning, on a Sunday; for had not Michael Holdsworth had a
7336: pair of oxen “sweltered” while he was ploughing on Good Friday? That
7337: was a demonstration that work on sacred days was a wicked thing; and
7338: with wickedness of any sort Martin Poyser was quite clear that he would
7339: have nothing to do, since money got by such means would never prosper.
7340: 
7341: “It a’most makes your fingers itch to be at the hay now the sun shines
7342: so,” he observed, as they passed through the “Big Meadow.” “But it’s
7343: poor foolishness to think o’ saving by going against your conscience.
7344: There’s that Jim Wakefield, as they used to call ‘Gentleman Wakefield,’
7345: used to do the same of a Sunday as o’ weekdays, and took no heed to
7346: right or wrong, as if there was nayther God nor devil. An’ what’s he
7347: come to? Why, I saw him myself last market-day a-carrying a basket wi’
7348: oranges in’t.”
7349: 
7350: “Ah, to be sure,” said Mrs. Poyser, emphatically, “you make but a poor
7351: trap to catch luck if you go and bait it wi’ wickedness. The money as
7352: is got so’s like to burn holes i’ your pocket. I’d niver wish us to
7353: leave our lads a sixpence but what was got i’ the rightful way. And as
7354: for the weather, there’s One above makes it, and we must put up wi’t:
7355: it’s nothing of a plague to what the wenches are.”
7356: 
7357: Notwithstanding the interruption in their walk, the excellent habit
7358: which Mrs. Poyser’s clock had of taking time by the forelock had
7359: secured their arrival at the village while it was still a quarter to
7360: two, though almost every one who meant to go to church was already
7361: within the churchyard gates. Those who stayed at home were chiefly
7362: mothers, like Timothy’s Bess, who stood at her own door nursing her
7363: baby and feeling as women feel in that position—that nothing else can
7364: be expected of them.
7365: 
7366: It was not entirely to see Thias Bede’s funeral that the people were
7367: standing about the churchyard so long before service began; that was
7368: their common practice. The women, indeed, usually entered the church at
7369: once, and the farmers’ wives talked in an undertone to each other, over
7370: the tall pews, about their illnesses and the total failure of doctor’s
7371: stuff, recommending dandelion-tea, and other home-made specifics, as
7372: far preferable—about the servants, and their growing exorbitance as to
7373: wages, whereas the quality of their services declined from year to
7374: year, and there was no girl nowadays to be trusted any further than you
7375: could see her—about the bad price Mr. Dingall, the Treddleston grocer,
7376: was giving for butter, and the reasonable doubts that might be held as
7377: to his solvency, notwithstanding that Mrs. Dingall was a sensible
7378: woman, and they were all sorry for _her_, for she had very good kin.
7379: Meantime the men lingered outside, and hardly any of them except the
7380: singers, who had a humming and fragmentary rehearsal to go through,
7381: entered the church until Mr. Irwine was in the desk. They saw no reason
7382: for that premature entrance—what could they do in church if they were
7383: there before service began?—and they did not conceive that any power in
7384: the universe could take it ill of them if they stayed out and talked a
7385: little about “bus’ness.”
7386: 
7387: Chad Cranage looks like quite a new acquaintance to-day, for he has got
7388: his clean Sunday face, which always makes his little granddaughter cry
7389: at him as a stranger. But an experienced eye would have fixed on him at
7390: once as the village blacksmith, after seeing the humble deference with
7391: which the big saucy fellow took off his hat and stroked his hair to the
7392: farmers; for Chad was accustomed to say that a working-man must hold a
7393: candle to a personage understood to be as black as he was himself on
7394: weekdays; by which evil-sounding rule of conduct he meant what was,
7395: after all, rather virtuous than otherwise, namely, that men who had
7396: horses to be shod must be treated with respect. Chad and the rougher
7397: sort of workmen kept aloof from the grave under the white thorn, where
7398: the burial was going forward; but Sandy Jim, and several of the
7399: farm-labourers, made a group round it, and stood with their hats off,
7400: as fellow-mourners with the mother and sons. Others held a midway
7401: position, sometimes watching the group at the grave, sometimes
7402: listening to the conversation of the farmers, who stood in a knot near
7403: the church door, and were now joined by Martin Poyser, while his family
7404: passed into the church. On the outside of this knot stood Mr. Casson,
7405: the landlord of the Donnithorne Arms, in his most striking
7406: attitude—that is to say, with the forefinger of his right hand thrust
7407: between the buttons of his waistcoat, his left hand in his breeches
7408: pocket, and his head very much on one side; looking, on the whole, like
7409: an actor who has only a mono-syllabic part entrusted to him, but feels
7410: sure that the audience discern his fitness for the leading business;
7411: curiously in contrast with old Jonathan Burge, who held his hands
7412: behind him and leaned forward, coughing asthmatically, with an inward
7413: scorn of all knowingness that could not be turned into cash. The talk
7414: was in rather a lower tone than usual to-day, hushed a little by the
7415: sound of Mr. Irwine’s voice reading the final prayers of the
7416: burial-service. They had all had their word of pity for poor Thias, but
7417: now they had got upon the nearer subject of their own grievances
7418: against Satchell, the Squire’s bailiff, who played the part of steward
7419: so far as it was not performed by old Mr. Donnithorne himself, for that
7420: gentleman had the meanness to receive his own rents and make bargains
7421: about his own timber. This subject of conversation was an additional
7422: reason for not being loud, since Satchell himself might presently be
7423: walking up the paved road to the church door. And soon they became
7424: suddenly silent; for Mr. Irwine’s voice had ceased, and the group round
7425: the white thorn was dispersing itself towards the church.
7426: 
7427: They all moved aside, and stood with their hats off, while Mr. Irwine
7428: passed. Adam and Seth were coming next, with their mother between them;
7429: for Joshua Rann officiated as head sexton as well as clerk, and was not
7430: yet ready to follow the rector into the vestry. But there was a pause
7431: before the three mourners came on: Lisbeth had turned round to look
7432: again towards the grave! Ah! There was nothing now but the brown earth
7433: under the white thorn. Yet she cried less to-day than she had done any
7434: day since her husband’s death. Along with all her grief there was mixed
7435: an unusual sense of her own importance in having a “burial,” and in Mr.
7436: Irwine’s reading a special service for her husband; and besides, she
7437: knew the funeral psalm was going to be sung for him. She felt this
7438: counter-excitement to her sorrow still more strongly as she walked with
7439: her sons towards the church door, and saw the friendly sympathetic nods
7440: of their fellow-parishioners.
7441: 
7442: The mother and sons passed into the church, and one by one the
7443: loiterers followed, though some still lingered without; the sight of
7444: Mr. Donnithorne’s carriage, which was winding slowly up the hill,
7445: perhaps helping to make them feel that there was no need for haste.
7446: 
7447: But presently the sound of the bassoon and the key-bugles burst forth;
7448: the evening hymn, which always opened the service, had begun, and every
7449: one must now enter and take his place.
7450: 
7451: I cannot say that the interior of Hayslope Church was remarkable for
7452: anything except for the grey age of its oaken pews—great square pews
7453: mostly, ranged on each side of a narrow aisle. It was free, indeed,
7454: from the modern blemish of galleries. The choir had two narrow pews to
7455: themselves in the middle of the right-hand row, so that it was a short
7456: process for Joshua Rann to take his place among them as principal bass,
7457: and return to his desk after the singing was over. The pulpit and desk,
7458: grey and old as the pews, stood on one side of the arch leading into
7459: the chancel, which also had its grey square pews for Mr. Donnithorne’s
7460: family and servants. Yet I assure you these grey pews, with the
7461: buff-washed walls, gave a very pleasing tone to this shabby interior,
7462: and agreed extremely well with the ruddy faces and bright waistcoats.
7463: And there were liberal touches of crimson toward the chancel, for the
7464: pulpit and Mr. Donnithorne’s own pew had handsome crimson cloth
7465: cushions; and, to close the vista, there was a crimson altar-cloth,
7466: embroidered with golden rays by Miss Lydia’s own hand.
7467: 
7468: But even without the crimson cloth, the effect must have been warm and
7469: cheering when Mr. Irwine was in the desk, looking benignly round on
7470: that simple congregation—on the hardy old men, with bent knees and
7471: shoulders, perhaps, but with vigour left for much hedge-clipping and
7472: thatching; on the tall stalwart frames and roughly cut bronzed faces of
7473: the stone-cutters and carpenters; on the half-dozen well-to-do farmers,
7474: with their apple-cheeked families; and on the clean old women, mostly
7475: farm-labourers’ wives, with their bit of snow-white cap-border under
7476: their black bonnets, and with their withered arms, bare from the elbow,
7477: folded passively over their chests. For none of the old people held
7478: books—why should they? Not one of them could read. But they knew a few
7479: “good words” by heart, and their withered lips now and then moved
7480: silently, following the service without any very clear comprehension
7481: indeed, but with a simple faith in its efficacy to ward off harm and
7482: bring blessing. And now all faces were visible, for all were standing
7483: up—the little children on the seats peeping over the edge of the grey
7484: pews, while good Bishop Ken’s evening hymn was being sung to one of
7485: those lively psalm-tunes which died out with the last generation of
7486: rectors and choral parish clerks. Melodies die out, like the pipe of
7487: Pan, with the ears that love them and listen for them. Adam was not in
7488: his usual place among the singers to-day, for he sat with his mother
7489: and Seth, and he noticed with surprise that Bartle Massey was absent
7490: too—all the more agreeable for Mr. Joshua Rann, who gave out his bass
7491: notes with unusual complacency and threw an extra ray of severity into
7492: the glances he sent over his spectacles at the recusant Will Maskery.
7493: 
7494: I beseech you to imagine Mr. Irwine looking round on this scene, in his
7495: ample white surplice that became him so well, with his powdered hair
7496: thrown back, his rich brown complexion, and his finely cut nostril and
7497: upper lip; for there was a certain virtue in that benignant yet keen
7498: countenance as there is in all human faces from which a generous soul
7499: beams out. And over all streamed the delicious June sunshine through
7500: the old windows, with their desultory patches of yellow, red, and blue,
7501: that threw pleasant touches of colour on the opposite wall.
7502: 
7503: I think, as Mr. Irwine looked round to-day, his eyes rested an instant
7504: longer than usual on the square pew occupied by Martin Poyser and his
7505: family. And there was another pair of dark eyes that found it
7506: impossible not to wander thither, and rest on that round pink-and-white
7507: figure. But Hetty was at that moment quite careless of any glances—she
7508: was absorbed in the thought that Arthur Donnithorne would soon be
7509: coming into church, for the carriage must surely be at the church-gate
7510: by this time. She had never seen him since she parted with him in the
7511: wood on Thursday evening, and oh, how long the time had seemed! Things
7512: had gone on just the same as ever since that evening; the wonders that
7513: had happened then had brought no changes after them; they were already
7514: like a dream. When she heard the church door swinging, her heart beat
7515: so, she dared not look up. She felt that her aunt was curtsying; she
7516: curtsied herself. That must be old Mr. Donnithorne—he always came
7517: first, the wrinkled small old man, peering round with short-sighted
7518: glances at the bowing and curtsying congregation; then she knew Miss
7519: Lydia was passing, and though Hetty liked so much to look at her
7520: fashionable little coal-scuttle bonnet, with the wreath of small roses
7521: round it, she didn’t mind it to-day. But there were no more
7522: curtsies—no, he was not come; she felt sure there was nothing else
7523: passing the pew door but the house-keeper’s black bonnet and the lady’s
7524: maid’s beautiful straw hat that had once been Miss Lydia’s, and then
7525: the powdered heads of the butler and footman. No, he was not there; yet
7526: she would look now—she might be mistaken—for, after all, she had not
7527: looked. So she lifted up her eyelids and glanced timidly at the
7528: cushioned pew in the chancel—there was no one but old Mr. Donnithorne
7529: rubbing his spectacles with his white handkerchief, and Miss Lydia
7530: opening the large gilt-edged prayer-book. The chill disappointment was
7531: too hard to bear. She felt herself turning pale, her lips trembling;
7532: she was ready to cry. Oh, what _should_ she do? Everybody would know
7533: the reason; they would know she was crying because Arthur was not
7534: there. And Mr. Craig, with the wonderful hothouse plant in his
7535: button-hole, was staring at her, she knew. It was dreadfully long
7536: before the General Confession began, so that she could kneel down. Two
7537: great drops _would_ fall then, but no one saw them except good-natured
7538: Molly, for her aunt and uncle knelt with their backs towards her.
7539: Molly, unable to imagine any cause for tears in church except
7540: faintness, of which she had a vague traditional knowledge, drew out of
7541: her pocket a queer little flat blue smelling-bottle, and after much
7542: labour in pulling the cork out, thrust the narrow neck against Hetty’s
7543: nostrils. “It donna smell,” she whispered, thinking this was a great
7544: advantage which old salts had over fresh ones: they did you good
7545: without biting your nose. Hetty pushed it away peevishly; but this
7546: little flash of temper did what the salts could not have done—it roused
7547: her to wipe away the traces of her tears, and try with all her might
7548: not to shed any more. Hetty had a certain strength in her vain little
7549: nature: she would have borne anything rather than be laughed at, or
7550: pointed at with any other feeling than admiration; she would have
7551: pressed her own nails into her tender flesh rather than people should
7552: know a secret she did not want them to know.
7553: 
7554: What fluctuations there were in her busy thoughts and feelings, while
7555: Mr. Irwine was pronouncing the solemn “Absolution” in her deaf ears,
7556: and through all the tones of petition that followed! Anger lay very
7557: close to disappointment, and soon won the victory over the conjectures
7558: her small ingenuity could devise to account for Arthur’s absence on the
7559: supposition that he really wanted to come, really wanted to see her
7560: again. And by the time she rose from her knees mechanically, because
7561: all the rest were rising, the colour had returned to her cheeks even
7562: with a heightened glow, for she was framing little indignant speeches
7563: to herself, saying she hated Arthur for giving her this pain—she would
7564: like him to suffer too. Yet while this selfish tumult was going on in
7565: her soul, her eyes were bent down on her prayer-book, and the eyelids
7566: with their dark fringe looked as lovely as ever. Adam Bede thought so,
7567: as he glanced at her for a moment on rising from his knees.
7568: 
7569: But Adam’s thoughts of Hetty did not deafen him to the service; they
7570: rather blended with all the other deep feelings for which the church
7571: service was a channel to him this afternoon, as a certain consciousness
7572: of our entire past and our imagined future blends itself with all our
7573: moments of keen sensibility. And to Adam the church service was the
7574: best channel he could have found for his mingled regret, yearning, and
7575: resignation; its interchange of beseeching cries for help with
7576: outbursts of faith and praise, its recurrent responses and the familiar
7577: rhythm of its collects, seemed to speak for him as no other form of
7578: worship could have done; as, to those early Christians who had
7579: worshipped from their childhood upwards in catacombs, the torch-light
7580: and shadows must have seemed nearer the Divine presence than the
7581: heathenish daylight of the streets. The secret of our emotions never
7582: lies in the bare object, but in its subtle relations to our own past:
7583: no wonder the secret escapes the unsympathizing observer, who might as
7584: well put on his spectacles to discern odours.
7585: 
7586: But there was one reason why even a chance comer would have found the
7587: service in Hayslope Church more impressive than in most other village
7588: nooks in the kingdom—a reason of which I am sure you have not the
7589: slightest suspicion. It was the reading of our friend Joshua Rann.
7590: Where that good shoemaker got his notion of reading from remained a
7591: mystery even to his most intimate acquaintances. I believe, after all,
7592: he got it chiefly from Nature, who had poured some of her music into
7593: this honest conceited soul, as she had been known to do into other
7594: narrow souls before his. She had given him, at least, a fine bass voice
7595: and a musical ear; but I cannot positively say whether these alone had
7596: sufficed to inspire him with the rich chant in which he delivered the
7597: responses. The way he rolled from a rich deep forte into a melancholy
7598: cadence, subsiding, at the end of the last word, into a sort of faint
7599: resonance, like the lingering vibrations of a fine violoncello, I can
7600: compare to nothing for its strong calm melancholy but the rush and
7601: cadence of the wind among the autumn boughs. This may seem a strange
7602: mode of speaking about the reading of a parish clerk—a man in rusty
7603: spectacles, with stubbly hair, a large occiput, and a prominent crown.
7604: But that is Nature’s way: she will allow a gentleman of splendid
7605: physiognomy and poetic aspirations to sing woefully out of tune, and
7606: not give him the slightest hint of it; and takes care that some
7607: narrow-browed fellow, trolling a ballad in the corner of a pot-house,
7608: shall be as true to his intervals as a bird.
7609: 
7610: Joshua himself was less proud of his reading than of his singing, and
7611: it was always with a sense of heightened importance that he passed from
7612: the desk to the choir. Still more to-day: it was a special occasion,
7613: for an old man, familiar to all the parish, had died a sad death—not in
7614: his bed, a circumstance the most painful to the mind of the peasant—and
7615: now the funeral psalm was to be sung in memory of his sudden departure.
7616: Moreover, Bartle Massey was not at church, and Joshua’s importance in
7617: the choir suffered no eclipse. It was a solemn minor strain they sang.
7618: The old psalm-tunes have many a wail among them, and the words—
7619: 
7620: “Thou sweep’st us off as with a flood;
7621: We vanish hence like dreams”—
7622: 
7623: 
7624: seemed to have a closer application than usual in the death of poor
7625: Thias. The mother and sons listened, each with peculiar feelings.
7626: Lisbeth had a vague belief that the psalm was doing her husband good;
7627: it was part of that decent burial which she would have thought it a
7628: greater wrong to withhold from him than to have caused him many unhappy
7629: days while he was living. The more there was said about her husband,
7630: the more there was done for him, surely the safer he would be. It was
7631: poor Lisbeth’s blind way of feeling that human love and pity are a
7632: ground of faith in some other love. Seth, who was easily touched, shed
7633: tears, and tried to recall, as he had done continually since his
7634: father’s death, all that he had heard of the possibility that a single
7635: moment of consciousness at the last might be a moment of pardon and
7636: reconcilement; for was it not written in the very psalm they were
7637: singing that the Divine dealings were not measured and circumscribed by
7638: time? Adam had never been unable to join in a psalm before. He had
7639: known plenty of trouble and vexation since he had been a lad, but this
7640: was the first sorrow that had hemmed in his voice, and strangely enough
7641: it was sorrow because the chief source of his past trouble and vexation
7642: was for ever gone out of his reach. He had not been able to press his
7643: father’s hand before their parting, and say, “Father, you know it was
7644: all right between us; I never forgot what I owed you when I was a lad;
7645: you forgive me if I have been too hot and hasty now and then!” Adam
7646: thought but little to-day of the hard work and the earnings he had
7647: spent on his father: his thoughts ran constantly on what the old man’s
7648: feelings had been in moments of humiliation, when he had held down his
7649: head before the rebukes of his son. When our indignation is borne in
7650: submissive silence, we are apt to feel twinges of doubt afterwards as
7651: to our own generosity, if not justice; how much more when the object of
7652: our anger has gone into everlasting silence, and we have seen his face
7653: for the last time in the meekness of death!
7654: 
7655: “Ah! I was always too hard,” Adam said to himself. “It’s a sore fault
7656: in me as I’m so hot and out o’ patience with people when they do wrong,
7657: and my heart gets shut up against ’em, so as I can’t bring myself to
7658: forgive ’em. I see clear enough there’s more pride nor love in my soul,
7659: for I could sooner make a thousand strokes with th’ hammer for my
7660: father than bring myself to say a kind word to him. And there went
7661: plenty o’ pride and temper to the strokes, as the devil _will_ be
7662: having his finger in what we call our duties as well as our sins.
7663: Mayhap the best thing I ever did in my life was only doing what was
7664: easiest for myself. It’s allays been easier for me to work nor to sit
7665: still, but the real tough job for me ’ud be to master my own will and
7666: temper and go right against my own pride. It seems to me now, if I was
7667: to find Father at home to-night, I should behave different; but there’s
7668: no knowing—perhaps nothing ’ud be a lesson to us if it didn’t come too
7669: late. It’s well we should feel as life’s a reckoning we can’t make
7670: twice over; there’s no real making amends in this world, any more nor
7671: you can mend a wrong subtraction by doing your addition right.”
7672: 
7673: This was the key-note to which Adam’s thoughts had perpetually returned
7674: since his father’s death, and the solemn wail of the funeral psalm was
7675: only an influence that brought back the old thoughts with stronger
7676: emphasis. So was the sermon, which Mr. Irwine had chosen with reference
7677: to Thias’s funeral. It spoke briefly and simply of the words, “In the
7678: midst of life we are in death”—how the present moment is all we can
7679: call our own for works of mercy, of righteous dealing, and of family
7680: tenderness. All very old truths—but what we thought the oldest truth
7681: becomes the most startling to us in the week when we have looked on the
7682: dead face of one who has made a part of our own lives. For when men
7683: want to impress us with the effect of a new and wonderfully vivid
7684: light, do they not let it fall on the most familiar objects, that we
7685: may measure its intensity by remembering the former dimness?
7686: 
7687: Then came the moment of the final blessing, when the forever sublime
7688: words, “The peace of God, which passeth all understanding,” seemed to
7689: blend with the calm afternoon sunshine that fell on the bowed heads of
7690: the congregation; and then the quiet rising, the mothers tying on the
7691: bonnets of the little maidens who had slept through the sermon, the
7692: fathers collecting the prayer-books, until all streamed out through the
7693: old archway into the green churchyard and began their neighbourly talk,
7694: their simple civilities, and their invitations to tea; for on a Sunday
7695: every one was ready to receive a guest—it was the day when all must be
7696: in their best clothes and their best humour.
7697: 
7698: Mr. and Mrs. Poyser paused a minute at the church gate: they were
7699: waiting for Adam to come up, not being contented to go away without
7700: saying a kind word to the widow and her sons.
7701: 
7702: “Well, Mrs. Bede,” said Mrs. Poyser, as they walked on together, “you
7703: must keep up your heart; husbands and wives must be content when
7704: they’ve lived to rear their children and see one another’s hair grey.”
7705: 
7706: “Aye, aye,” said Mr. Poyser; “they wonna have long to wait for one
7707: another then, anyhow. And ye’ve got two o’ the strapping’st sons i’ th’
7708: country; and well you may, for I remember poor Thias as fine a
7709: broad-shouldered fellow as need to be; and as for you, Mrs. Bede, why
7710: you’re straighter i’ the back nor half the young women now.”
7711: 
7712: “Eh,” said Lisbeth, “it’s poor luck for the platter to wear well when
7713: it’s broke i’ two. The sooner I’m laid under the thorn the better. I’m
7714: no good to nobody now.”
7715: 
7716: Adam never took notice of his mother’s little unjust plaints; but Seth
7717: said, “Nay, Mother, thee mustna say so. Thy sons ’ull never get another
7718: mother.”
7719: 
7720: “That’s true, lad, that’s true,” said Mr. Poyser; “and it’s wrong on us
7721: to give way to grief, Mrs. Bede; for it’s like the children cryin’ when
7722: the fathers and mothers take things from ’em. There’s One above knows
7723: better nor us.”
7724: 
7725: “Ah,” said Mrs. Poyser, “an’ it’s poor work allays settin’ the dead
7726: above the livin’. We shall all on us be dead some time, I reckon—it ’ud
7727: be better if folks ’ud make much on us beforehand, i’stid o’ beginnin’
7728: when we’re gone. It’s but little good you’ll do a-watering the last
7729: year’s crop.”
7730: 
7731: “Well, Adam,” said Mr. Poyser, feeling that his wife’s words were, as
7732: usual, rather incisive than soothing, and that it would be well to
7733: change the subject, “you’ll come and see us again now, I hope. I hanna
7734: had a talk with you this long while, and the missis here wants you to
7735: see what can be done with her best spinning-wheel, for it’s got broke,
7736: and it’ll be a nice job to mend it—there’ll want a bit o’ turning.
7737: You’ll come as soon as you can now, will you?”
7738: 
7739: Mr. Poyser paused and looked round while he was speaking, as if to see
7740: where Hetty was; for the children were running on before. Hetty was not
7741: without a companion, and she had, besides, more pink and white about
7742: her than ever, for she held in her hand the wonderful pink-and-white
7743: hot-house plant, with a very long name—a Scotch name, she supposed,
7744: since people said Mr. Craig the gardener was Scotch. Adam took the
7745: opportunity of looking round too; and I am sure you will not require of
7746: him that he should feel any vexation in observing a pouting expression
7747: on Hetty’s face as she listened to the gardener’s small talk. Yet in
7748: her secret heart she was glad to have him by her side, for she would
7749: perhaps learn from him how it was Arthur had not come to church. Not
7750: that she cared to ask him the question, but she hoped the information
7751: would be given spontaneously; for Mr. Craig, like a superior man, was
7752: very fond of giving information.
7753: 
7754: Mr. Craig was never aware that his conversation and advances were
7755: received coldly, for to shift one’s point of view beyond certain limits
7756: is impossible to the most liberal and expansive mind; we are none of us
7757: aware of the impression we produce on Brazilian monkeys of feeble
7758: understanding—it is possible they see hardly anything in us. Moreover,
7759: Mr. Craig was a man of sober passions, and was already in his tenth
7760: year of hesitation as to the relative advantages of matrimony and
7761: bachelorhood. It is true that, now and then, when he had been a little
7762: heated by an extra glass of grog, he had been heard to say of Hetty
7763: that the “lass was well enough,” and that “a man might do worse”; but
7764: on convivial occasions men are apt to express themselves strongly.
7765: 
7766: Martin Poyser held Mr. Craig in honour, as a man who “knew his
7767: business” and who had great lights concerning soils and compost; but he
7768: was less of a favourite with Mrs. Poyser, who had more than once said
7769: in confidence to her husband, “You’re mighty fond o’ Craig, but for my
7770: part, I think he’s welly like a cock as thinks the sun’s rose o’
7771: purpose to hear him crow.” For the rest, Mr. Craig was an estimable
7772: gardener, and was not without reasons for having a high opinion of
7773: himself. He had also high shoulders and high cheek-bones and hung his
7774: head forward a little, as he walked along with his hands in his
7775: breeches pockets. I think it was his pedigree only that had the
7776: advantage of being Scotch, and not his “bringing up”; for except that
7777: he had a stronger burr in his accent, his speech differed little from
7778: that of the Loamshire people about him. But a gardener is Scotch, as a
7779: French teacher is Parisian.
7780: 
7781: “Well, Mr. Poyser,” he said, before the good slow farmer had time to
7782: speak, “ye’ll not be carrying your hay to-morrow, I’m thinking. The
7783: glass sticks at ‘change,’ and ye may rely upo’ my word as we’ll ha’
7784: more downfall afore twenty-four hours is past. Ye see that darkish-blue
7785: cloud there upo’ the ’rizon—ye know what I mean by the ’rizon, where
7786: the land and sky seems to meet?”
7787: 
7788: “Aye, aye, I see the cloud,” said Mr. Poyser, “’rizon or no ’rizon.
7789: It’s right o’er Mike Holdsworth’s fallow, and a foul fallow it is.”
7790: 
7791: “Well, you mark my words, as that cloud ’ull spread o’er the sky pretty
7792: nigh as quick as you’d spread a tarpaulin over one o’ your hay-ricks.
7793: It’s a great thing to ha’ studied the look o’ the clouds. Lord bless
7794: you! Th’ met’orological almanecks can learn me nothing, but there’s a
7795: pretty sight o’ things I could let _them_ up to, if they’d just come to
7796: me. And how are _you_, Mrs. Poyser?—thinking o’ getherin’ the red
7797: currants soon, I reckon. You’d a deal better gether ’em afore they’re
7798: o’erripe, wi’ such weather as we’ve got to look forward to. How do ye
7799: do, Mistress Bede?” Mr. Craig continued, without a pause, nodding by
7800: the way to Adam and Seth. “I hope y’ enjoyed them spinach and
7801: gooseberries as I sent Chester with th’ other day. If ye want
7802: vegetables while ye’re in trouble, ye know where to come to. It’s well
7803: known I’m not giving other folks’ things away, for when I’ve supplied
7804: the house, the garden’s my own spekilation, and it isna every man th’
7805: old squire could get as ’ud be equil to the undertaking, let alone
7806: asking whether he’d be willing I’ve got to run my calkilation fine, I
7807: can tell you, to make sure o’ getting back the money as I pay the
7808: squire. I should like to see some o’ them fellows as make the almanecks
7809: looking as far before their noses as I’ve got to do every year as
7810: comes.”
7811: 
7812: “They look pretty fur, though,” said Mr. Poyser, turning his head on
7813: one side and speaking in rather a subdued reverential tone. “Why, what
7814: could come truer nor that pictur o’ the cock wi’ the big spurs, as has
7815: got its head knocked down wi’ th’ anchor, an’ th’ firin’, an’ the ships
7816: behind? Why, that pictur was made afore Christmas, and yit it’s come as
7817: true as th’ Bible. Why, th’ cock’s France, an’ th’ anchor’s Nelson—an’
7818: they told us that beforehand.”
7819: 
7820: “Pee—ee-eh!” said Mr. Craig. “A man doesna want to see fur to know as
7821: th’ English ’ull beat the French. Why, I know upo’ good authority as
7822: it’s a big Frenchman as reaches five foot high, an’ they live upo’
7823: spoon-meat mostly. I knew a man as his father had a particular
7824: knowledge o’ the French. I should like to know what them grasshoppers
7825: are to do against such fine fellows as our young Captain Arthur. Why,
7826: it ’ud astonish a Frenchman only to look at him; his arm’s thicker nor
7827: a Frenchman’s body, I’ll be bound, for they pinch theirsells in wi’
7828: stays; and it’s easy enough, for they’ve got nothing i’ their insides.”
7829: 
7830: “Where is the captain, as he wasna at church to-day?” said Adam. “I was
7831: talking to him o’ Friday, and he said nothing about his going away.”
7832: 
7833: “Oh, he’s only gone to Eagledale for a bit o’ fishing; I reckon he’ll
7834: be back again afore many days are o’er, for he’s to be at all th’
7835: arranging and preparing o’ things for the comin’ o’ age o’ the 30th o’
7836: July. But he’s fond o’ getting away for a bit, now and then. Him and
7837: th’ old squire fit one another like frost and flowers.”
7838: 
7839: Mr. Craig smiled and winked slowly as he made this last observation,
7840: but the subject was not developed farther, for now they had reached the
7841: turning in the road where Adam and his companions must say “good-bye.”
7842: The gardener, too, would have had to turn off in the same direction if
7843: he had not accepted Mr. Poyser’s invitation to tea. Mrs. Poyser duly
7844: seconded the invitation, for she would have held it a deep disgrace not
7845: to make her neighbours welcome to her house: personal likes and
7846: dislikes must not interfere with that sacred custom. Moreover, Mr.
7847: Craig had always been full of civilities to the family at the Hall
7848: Farm, and Mrs. Poyser was scrupulous in declaring that she had “nothing
7849: to say again’ him, on’y it was a pity he couldna be hatched o’er again,
7850: an’ hatched different.”
7851: 
7852: So Adam and Seth, with their mother between them, wound their way down
7853: to the valley and up again to the old house, where a saddened memory
7854: had taken the place of a long, long anxiety—where Adam would never have
7855: to ask again as he entered, “Where’s Father?”
7856: 
7857: And the other family party, with Mr. Craig for company, went back to
7858: the pleasant bright house-place at the Hall Farm—all with quiet minds,
7859: except Hetty, who knew now where Arthur was gone, but was only the more
7860: puzzled and uneasy. For it appeared that his absence was quite
7861: voluntary; he need not have gone—he would not have gone if he had
7862: wanted to see her. She had a sickening sense that no lot could ever be
7863: pleasant to her again if her Thursday night’s vision was not to be
7864: fulfilled; and in this moment of chill, bare, wintry disappointment and
7865: doubt, she looked towards the possibility of being with Arthur again,
7866: of meeting his loving glance, and hearing his soft words with that
7867: eager yearning which one may call the “growing pain” of passion.
7868: 
7869: 
7870: 
7871: 
7872: Chapter XIX
7873: Adam on a Working Day
7874: 
7875: 
7876: Notwithstanding Mr. Craig’s prophecy, the dark-blue cloud dispersed
7877: itself without having produced the threatened consequences. “The
7878: weather”—as he observed the next morning—“the weather, you see, ’s a
7879: ticklish thing, an’ a fool ’ull hit on’t sometimes when a wise man
7880: misses; that’s why the almanecks get so much credit. It’s one o’ them
7881: chancy things as fools thrive on.”
7882: 
7883: This unreasonable behaviour of the weather, however, could displease no
7884: one else in Hayslope besides Mr. Craig. All hands were to be out in the
7885: meadows this morning as soon as the dew had risen; the wives and
7886: daughters did double work in every farmhouse, that the maids might give
7887: their help in tossing the hay; and when Adam was marching along the
7888: lanes, with his basket of tools over his shoulder, he caught the sound
7889: of jocose talk and ringing laughter from behind the hedges. The jocose
7890: talk of hay-makers is best at a distance; like those clumsy bells round
7891: the cows’ necks, it has rather a coarse sound when it comes close, and
7892: may even grate on your ears painfully; but heard from far off, it
7893: mingles very prettily with the other joyous sounds of nature. Men’s
7894: muscles move better when their souls are making merry music, though
7895: their merriment is of a poor blundering sort, not at all like the
7896: merriment of birds.
7897: 
7898: And perhaps there is no time in a summer’s day more cheering than when
7899: the warmth of the sun is just beginning to triumph over the freshness
7900: of the morning—when there is just a lingering hint of early coolness to
7901: keep off languor under the delicious influence of warmth. The reason
7902: Adam was walking along the lanes at this time was because his work for
7903: the rest of the day lay at a country-house about three miles off, which
7904: was being put in repair for the son of a neighbouring squire; and he
7905: had been busy since early morning with the packing of panels, doors,
7906: and chimney-pieces, in a waggon which was now gone on before him, while
7907: Jonathan Burge himself had ridden to the spot on horseback, to await
7908: its arrival and direct the workmen.
7909: 
7910: This little walk was a rest to Adam, and he was unconsciously under the
7911: charm of the moment. It was summer morning in his heart, and he saw
7912: Hetty in the sunshine—a sunshine without glare, with slanting rays that
7913: tremble between the delicate shadows of the leaves. He thought,
7914: yesterday when he put out his hand to her as they came out of church,
7915: that there was a touch of melancholy kindness in her face, such as he
7916: had not seen before, and he took it as a sign that she had some
7917: sympathy with his family trouble. Poor fellow! That touch of melancholy
7918: came from quite another source, but how was he to know? We look at the
7919: one little woman’s face we love as we look at the face of our mother
7920: earth, and see all sorts of answers to our own yearnings. It was
7921: impossible for Adam not to feel that what had happened in the last week
7922: had brought the prospect of marriage nearer to him. Hitherto he had
7923: felt keenly the danger that some other man might step in and get
7924: possession of Hetty’s heart and hand, while he himself was still in a
7925: position that made him shrink from asking her to accept him. Even if he
7926: had had a strong hope that she was fond of him—and his hope was far
7927: from being strong—he had been too heavily burdened with other claims to
7928: provide a home for himself and Hetty—a home such as he could expect her
7929: to be content with after the comfort and plenty of the Farm. Like all
7930: strong natures, Adam had confidence in his ability to achieve something
7931: in the future; he felt sure he should some day, if he lived, be able to
7932: maintain a family and make a good broad path for himself; but he had
7933: too cool a head not to estimate to the full the obstacles that were to
7934: be overcome. And the time would be so long! And there was Hetty, like a
7935: bright-cheeked apple hanging over the orchard wall, within sight of
7936: everybody, and everybody must long for her! To be sure, if she loved
7937: him very much, she would be content to wait for him: but _did_ she love
7938: him? His hopes had never risen so high that he had dared to ask her. He
7939: was clear-sighted enough to be aware that her uncle and aunt would have
7940: looked kindly on his suit, and indeed, without this encouragement he
7941: would never have persevered in going to the Farm; but it was impossible
7942: to come to any but fluctuating conclusions about Hetty’s feelings. She
7943: was like a kitten, and had the same distractingly pretty looks, that
7944: meant nothing, for everybody that came near her.
7945: 
7946: But now he could not help saying to himself that the heaviest part of
7947: his burden was removed, and that even before the end of another year
7948: his circumstances might be brought into a shape that would allow him to
7949: think of marrying. It would always be a hard struggle with his mother,
7950: he knew: she would be jealous of any wife he might choose, and she had
7951: set her mind especially against Hetty—perhaps for no other reason than
7952: that she suspected Hetty to be the woman he _had_ chosen. It would
7953: never do, he feared, for his mother to live in the same house with him
7954: when he was married; and yet how hard she would think it if he asked
7955: her to leave him! Yes, there was a great deal of pain to be gone
7956: through with his mother, but it was a case in which he must make her
7957: feel that his will was strong—it would be better for her in the end.
7958: For himself, he would have liked that they should all live together
7959: till Seth was married, and they might have built a bit themselves to
7960: the old house, and made more room. He did not like “to part wi’ th’
7961: lad”: they had hardly ever been separated for more than a day since
7962: they were born.
7963: 
7964: But Adam had no sooner caught his imagination leaping forward in this
7965: way—making arrangements for an uncertain future—than he checked
7966: himself. “A pretty building I’m making, without either bricks or
7967: timber. I’m up i’ the garret a’ready, and haven’t so much as dug the
7968: foundation.” Whenever Adam was strongly convinced of any proposition,
7969: it took the form of a principle in his mind: it was knowledge to be
7970: acted on, as much as the knowledge that damp will cause rust. Perhaps
7971: here lay the secret of the hardness he had accused himself of: he had
7972: too little fellow-feeling with the weakness that errs in spite of
7973: foreseen consequences. Without this fellow-feeling, how are we to get
7974: enough patience and charity towards our stumbling, falling companions
7975: in the long and changeful journey? And there is but one way in which a
7976: strong determined soul can learn it—by getting his heart-strings bound
7977: round the weak and erring, so that he must share not only the outward
7978: consequence of their error, but their inward suffering. That is a long
7979: and hard lesson, and Adam had at present only learned the alphabet of
7980: it in his father’s sudden death, which, by annihilating in an instant
7981: all that had stimulated his indignation, had sent a sudden rush of
7982: thought and memory over what had claimed his pity and tenderness.
7983: 
7984: But it was Adam’s strength, not its correlative hardness, that
7985: influenced his meditations this morning. He had long made up his mind
7986: that it would be wrong as well as foolish for him to marry a blooming
7987: young girl, so long as he had no other prospect than that of growing
7988: poverty with a growing family. And his savings had been so constantly
7989: drawn upon (besides the terrible sweep of paying for Seth’s substitute
7990: in the militia) that he had not enough money beforehand to furnish even
7991: a small cottage, and keep something in reserve against a rainy day. He
7992: had good hope that he should be “firmer on his legs” by and by; but he
7993: could not be satisfied with a vague confidence in his arm and brain; he
7994: must have definite plans, and set about them at once. The partnership
7995: with Jonathan Burge was not to be thought of at present—there were
7996: things implicitly tacked to it that he could not accept; but Adam
7997: thought that he and Seth might carry on a little business for
7998: themselves in addition to their journeyman’s work, by buying a small
7999: stock of superior wood and making articles of household furniture, for
8000: which Adam had no end of contrivances. Seth might gain more by working
8001: at separate jobs under Adam’s direction than by his journeyman’s work,
8002: and Adam, in his overhours, could do all the “nice” work that required
8003: peculiar skill. The money gained in this way, with the good wages he
8004: received as foreman, would soon enable them to get beforehand with the
8005: world, so sparingly as they would all live now. No sooner had this
8006: little plan shaped itself in his mind than he began to be busy with
8007: exact calculations about the wood to be bought and the particular
8008: article of furniture that should be undertaken first—a kitchen cupboard
8009: of his own contrivance, with such an ingenious arrangement of
8010: sliding-doors and bolts, such convenient nooks for stowing household
8011: provender, and such a symmetrical result to the eye, that every good
8012: housewife would be in raptures with it, and fall through all the
8013: gradations of melancholy longing till her husband promised to buy it
8014: for her. Adam pictured to himself Mrs. Poyser examining it with her
8015: keen eye and trying in vain to find out a deficiency; and, of course,
8016: close to Mrs. Poyser stood Hetty, and Adam was again beguiled from
8017: calculations and contrivances into dreams and hopes. Yes, he would go
8018: and see her this evening—it was so long since he had been at the Hall
8019: Farm. He would have liked to go to the night-school, to see why Bartle
8020: Massey had not been at church yesterday, for he feared his old friend
8021: was ill; but, unless he could manage both visits, this last must be put
8022: off till to-morrow—the desire to be near Hetty and to speak to her
8023: again was too strong.
8024: 
8025: As he made up his mind to this, he was coming very near to the end of
8026: his walk, within the sound of the hammers at work on the refitting of
8027: the old house. The sound of tools to a clever workman who loves his
8028: work is like the tentative sounds of the orchestra to the violinist who
8029: has to bear his part in the overture: the strong fibres begin their
8030: accustomed thrill, and what was a moment before joy, vexation, or
8031: ambition, begins its change into energy. All passion becomes strength
8032: when it has an outlet from the narrow limits of our personal lot in the
8033: labour of our right arm, the cunning of our right hand, or the still,
8034: creative activity of our thought. Look at Adam through the rest of the
8035: day, as he stands on the scaffolding with the two-feet ruler in his
8036: hand, whistling low while he considers how a difficulty about a
8037: floor-joist or a window-frame is to be overcome; or as he pushes one of
8038: the younger workmen aside and takes his place in upheaving a weight of
8039: timber, saying, “Let alone, lad! Thee’st got too much gristle i’ thy
8040: bones yet”; or as he fixes his keen black eyes on the motions of a
8041: workman on the other side of the room and warns him that his distances
8042: are not right. Look at this broad-shouldered man with the bare muscular
8043: arms, and the thick, firm, black hair tossed about like trodden
8044: meadow-grass whenever he takes off his paper cap, and with the strong
8045: barytone voice bursting every now and then into loud and solemn
8046: psalm-tunes, as if seeking an outlet for superfluous strength, yet
8047: presently checking himself, apparently crossed by some thought which
8048: jars with the singing. Perhaps, if you had not been already in the
8049: secret, you might not have guessed what sad memories, what warm
8050: affection, what tender fluttering hopes, had their home in this
8051: athletic body with the broken finger-nails—in this rough man, who knew
8052: no better lyrics than he could find in the Old and New Version and an
8053: occasional hymn; who knew the smallest possible amount of profane
8054: history; and for whom the motion and shape of the earth, the course of
8055: the sun, and the changes of the seasons lay in the region of mystery
8056: just made visible by fragmentary knowledge. It had cost Adam a great
8057: deal of trouble and work in overhours to know what he knew over and
8058: above the secrets of his handicraft, and that acquaintance with
8059: mechanics and figures, and the nature of the materials he worked with,
8060: which was made easy to him by inborn inherited faculty—to get the
8061: mastery of his pen, and write a plain hand, to spell without any other
8062: mistakes than must in fairness be attributed to the unreasonable
8063: character of orthography rather than to any deficiency in the speller,
8064: and, moreover, to learn his musical notes and part-singing. Besides all
8065: this, he had read his Bible, including the apocryphal books; Poor
8066: Richard’s Almanac, Taylor’s Holy Living and Dying, The Pilgrim’s
8067: Progress, with Bunyan’s Life and Holy War, a great deal of Bailey’s
8068: Dictionary, Valentine and Orson, and part of a History of Babylon,
8069: which Bartle Massey had lent him. He might have had many more books
8070: from Bartle Massey, but he had no time for reading “the commin print,”
8071: as Lisbeth called it, so busy as he was with figures in all the leisure
8072: moments which he did not fill up with extra carpentry.
8073: 
8074: Adam, you perceive, was by no means a marvellous man, nor, properly
8075: speaking, a genius, yet I will not pretend that his was an ordinary
8076: character among workmen; and it would not be at all a safe conclusion
8077: that the next best man you may happen to see with a basket of tools
8078: over his shoulder and a paper cap on his head has the strong conscience
8079: and the strong sense, the blended susceptibility and self-command, of
8080: our friend Adam. He was not an average man. Yet such men as he are
8081: reared here and there in every generation of our peasant artisans—with
8082: an inheritance of affections nurtured by a simple family life of common
8083: need and common industry, and an inheritance of faculties trained in
8084: skilful courageous labour: they make their way upwards, rarely as
8085: geniuses, most commonly as painstaking honest men, with the skill and
8086: conscience to do well the tasks that lie before them. Their lives have
8087: no discernible echo beyond the neighbourhood where they dwelt, but you
8088: are almost sure to find there some good piece of road, some building,
8089: some application of mineral produce, some improvement in farming
8090: practice, some reform of parish abuses, with which their names are
8091: associated by one or two generations after them. Their employers were
8092: the richer for them, the work of their hands has worn well, and the
8093: work of their brains has guided well the hands of other men. They went
8094: about in their youth in flannel or paper caps, in coats black with
8095: coal-dust or streaked with lime and red paint; in old age their white
8096: hairs are seen in a place of honour at church and at market, and they
8097: tell their well-dressed sons and daughters, seated round the bright
8098: hearth on winter evenings, how pleased they were when they first earned
8099: their twopence a-day. Others there are who die poor and never put off
8100: the workman’s coat on weekdays. They have not had the art of getting
8101: rich, but they are men of trust, and when they die before the work is
8102: all out of them, it is as if some main screw had got loose in a
8103: machine; the master who employed them says, “Where shall I find their
8104: like?”
8105:

8109: Chapter XX
8110: Adam Visits the Hall Farm
8111: 
8112: 
8113: Adam came back from his work in the empty waggon—that was why he had
8114: changed his clothes—and was ready to set out to the Hall Farm when it
8115: still wanted a quarter to seven.
8116: 
8117: “What’s thee got thy Sunday cloose on for?” said Lisbeth complainingly,
8118: as he came downstairs. “Thee artna goin’ to th’ school i’ thy best
8119: coat?”
8120: 
8121: “No, Mother,” said Adam, quietly. “I’m going to the Hall Farm, but
8122: mayhap I may go to the school after, so thee mustna wonder if I’m a bit
8123: late. Seth ’ull be at home in half an hour—he’s only gone to the
8124: village; so thee wutna mind.”
8125: 
8126: “Eh, an’ what’s thee got thy best cloose on for to go to th’ Hall Farm?
8127: The Poyser folks see’d thee in ’em yesterday, I warrand. What dost mean
8128: by turnin’ worki’day into Sunday a-that’n? It’s poor keepin’ company
8129: wi’ folks as donna like to see thee i’ thy workin’ jacket.”
8130: 
8131: “Good-bye, mother, I can’t stay,” said Adam, putting on his hat and
8132: going out.
8133: 
8134: But he had no sooner gone a few paces beyond the door than Lisbeth
8135: became uneasy at the thought that she had vexed him. Of course, the
8136: secret of her objection to the best clothes was her suspicion that they
8137: were put on for Hetty’s sake; but deeper than all her peevishness lay
8138: the need that her son should love her. She hurried after him, and laid
8139: hold of his arm before he had got half-way down to the brook, and said,
8140: “Nay, my lad, thee wutna go away angered wi’ thy mother, an’ her got
8141: nought to do but to sit by hersen an’ think on thee?”
8142: 
8143: “Nay, nay, Mother,” said Adam, gravely, and standing still while he put
8144: his arm on her shoulder, “I’m not angered. But I wish, for thy own
8145: sake, thee’dst be more contented to let me do what I’ve made up my mind
8146: to do. I’ll never be no other than a good son to thee as long as we
8147: live. But a man has other feelings besides what he owes to’s father and
8148: mother, and thee oughtna to want to rule over me body and soul. And
8149: thee must make up thy mind as I’ll not give way to thee where I’ve a
8150: right to do what I like. So let us have no more words about it.”
8151: 
8152: “Eh,” said Lisbeth, not willing to show that she felt the real bearing
8153: of Adam’s words, “and’ who likes to see thee i’ thy best cloose better
8154: nor thy mother? An’ when thee’st got thy face washed as clean as the
8155: smooth white pibble, an’ thy hair combed so nice, and thy eyes
8156: a-sparklin’—what else is there as thy old mother should like to look at
8157: half so well? An’ thee sha’t put on thy Sunday cloose when thee lik’st
8158: for me—I’ll ne’er plague thee no moor about’n.”
8159: 
8160: “Well, well; good-bye, mother,” said Adam, kissing her and hurrying
8161: away. He saw there was no other means of putting an end to the
8162: dialogue. Lisbeth stood still on the spot, shading her eyes and looking
8163: after him till he was quite out of sight. She felt to the full all the
8164: meaning that had lain in Adam’s words, and, as she lost sight of him
8165: and turned back slowly into the house, she said aloud to herself—for it
8166: was her way to speak her thoughts aloud in the long days when her
8167: husband and sons were at their work—“Eh, he’ll be tellin’ me as he’s
8168: goin’ to bring her home one o’ these days; an’ she’ll be missis o’er
8169: me, and I mun look on, belike, while she uses the blue-edged platters,
8170: and breaks ’em, mayhap, though there’s ne’er been one broke sin’ my old
8171: man an’ me bought ’em at the fair twenty ’ear come next Whissuntide.
8172: Eh!” she went on, still louder, as she caught up her knitting from the
8173: table, “but she’ll ne’er knit the lad’s stockin’s, nor foot ’em
8174: nayther, while I live; an’ when I’m gone, he’ll bethink him as nobody
8175: ’ull ne’er fit’s leg an’ foot as his old mother did. She’ll know
8176: nothin’ o’ narrowin’ an’ heelin’, I warrand, an’ she’ll make a long toe
8177: as he canna get’s boot on. That’s what comes o’ marr’in’ young wenches.
8178: I war gone thirty, an’ th’ feyther too, afore we war married; an’ young
8179: enough too. She’ll be a poor dratchell by then _she’s_ thirty,
8180: a-marr’in’ a-that’n, afore her teeth’s all come.”
8181: 
8182: Adam walked so fast that he was at the yard-gate before seven. Martin
8183: Poyser and the grandfather were not yet come in from the meadow: every
8184: one was in the meadow, even to the black-and-tan terrier—no one kept
8185: watch in the yard but the bull-dog; and when Adam reached the
8186: house-door, which stood wide open, he saw there was no one in the
8187: bright clean house-place. But he guessed where Mrs. Poyser and some one
8188: else would be, quite within hearing; so he knocked on the door and said
8189: in his strong voice, “Mrs. Poyser within?”
8190: 
8191: “Come in, Mr. Bede, come in,” Mrs. Poyser called out from the dairy.
8192: She always gave Adam this title when she received him in her own house.
8193: “You may come into the dairy if you will, for I canna justly leave the
8194: cheese.”
8195: 
8196: Adam walked into the dairy, where Mrs. Poyser and Nancy were crushing
8197: the first evening cheese.
8198: 
8199: “Why, you might think you war come to a dead-house,” said Mrs. Poyser,
8200: as he stood in the open doorway; “they’re all i’ the meadow; but
8201: Martin’s sure to be in afore long, for they’re leaving the hay cocked
8202: to-night, ready for carrying first thing to-morrow. I’ve been forced t’
8203: have Nancy in, upo’ ’count as Hetty must gether the red currants
8204: to-night; the fruit allays ripens so contrairy, just when every hand’s
8205: wanted. An’ there’s no trustin’ the children to gether it, for they put
8206: more into their own mouths nor into the basket; you might as well set
8207: the wasps to gether the fruit.”
8208: 
8209: Adam longed to say he would go into the garden till Mr. Poyser came in,
8210: but he was not quite courageous enough, so he said, “I could be looking
8211: at your spinning-wheel, then, and see what wants doing to it. Perhaps
8212: it stands in the house, where I can find it?”
8213: 
8214: “No, I’ve put it away in the right-hand parlour; but let it be till I
8215: can fetch it and show it you. I’d be glad now if you’d go into the
8216: garden and tell Hetty to send Totty in. The child ’ull run in if she’s
8217: told, an’ I know Hetty’s lettin’ her eat too many currants. I’ll be
8218: much obliged to you, Mr. Bede, if you’ll go and send her in; an’
8219: there’s the York and Lankester roses beautiful in the garden now—you’ll
8220: like to see ’em. But you’d like a drink o’ whey first, p’r’aps; I know
8221: you’re fond o’ whey, as most folks is when they hanna got to crush it
8222: out.”
8223: 
8224: “Thank you, Mrs. Poyser,” said Adam; “a drink o’ whey’s allays a treat
8225: to me. I’d rather have it than beer any day.”
8226: 
8227: “Aye, aye,” said Mrs. Poyser, reaching a small white basin that stood
8228: on the shelf, and dipping it into the whey-tub, “the smell o’ bread’s
8229: sweet t’ everybody but the baker. The Miss Irwines allays say, ‘Oh,
8230: Mrs. Poyser, I envy you your dairy; and I envy you your chickens; and
8231: what a beautiful thing a farm-house is, to be sure!’ An’ I say, ‘Yes; a
8232: farm-house is a fine thing for them as look on, an’ don’t know the
8233: liftin’, an’ the stannin’, an’ the worritin’ o’ th’ inside as belongs
8234: to’t.’”
8235: 
8236: “Why, Mrs. Poyser, you wouldn’t like to live anywhere else but in a
8237: farm-house, so well as you manage it,” said Adam, taking the basin;
8238: “and there can be nothing to look at pleasanter nor a fine milch cow,
8239: standing up to’ts knees in pasture, and the new milk frothing in the
8240: pail, and the fresh butter ready for market, and the calves, and the
8241: poultry. Here’s to your health, and may you allays have strength to
8242: look after your own dairy, and set a pattern t’ all the farmers’ wives
8243: in the country.”
8244: 
8245: Mrs. Poyser was not to be caught in the weakness of smiling at a
8246: compliment, but a quiet complacency over-spread her face like a
8247: stealing sunbeam, and gave a milder glance than usual to her blue-grey
8248: eyes, as she looked at Adam drinking the whey. Ah! I think I taste that
8249: whey now—with a flavour so delicate that one can hardly distinguish it
8250: from an odour, and with that soft gliding warmth that fills one’s
8251: imagination with a still, happy dreaminess. And the light music of the
8252: dropping whey is in my ears, mingling with the twittering of a bird
8253: outside the wire network window—the window overlooking the garden, and
8254: shaded by tall Guelder roses.
8255: 
8256: “Have a little more, Mr. Bede?” said Mrs. Poyser, as Adam set down the
8257: basin.
8258: 
8259: “No, thank you; I’ll go into the garden now, and send in the little
8260: lass.”
8261: 
8262: “Aye, do; and tell her to come to her mother in the dairy.”
8263: 
8264: Adam walked round by the rick-yard, at present empty of ricks, to the
8265: little wooden gate leading into the garden—once the well-tended
8266: kitchen-garden of a manor-house; now, but for the handsome brick wall
8267: with stone coping that ran along one side of it, a true farmhouse
8268: garden, with hardy perennial flowers, unpruned fruit-trees, and kitchen
8269: vegetables growing together in careless, half-neglected abundance. In
8270: that leafy, flowery, bushy time, to look for any one in this garden was
8271: like playing at “hide-and-seek.” There were the tall hollyhocks
8272: beginning to flower and dazzle the eye with their pink, white, and
8273: yellow; there were the syringas and Guelder roses, all large and
8274: disorderly for want of trimming; there were leafy walls of scarlet
8275: beans and late peas; there was a row of bushy filberts in one
8276: direction, and in another a huge apple-tree making a barren circle
8277: under its low-spreading boughs. But what signified a barren patch or
8278: two? The garden was so large. There was always a superfluity of broad
8279: beans—it took nine or ten of Adam’s strides to get to the end of the
8280: uncut grass walk that ran by the side of them; and as for other
8281: vegetables, there was so much more room than was necessary for them
8282: that in the rotation of crops a large flourishing bed of groundsel was
8283: of yearly occurrence on one spot or other. The very rose-trees at which
8284: Adam stopped to pluck one looked as if they grew wild; they were all
8285: huddled together in bushy masses, now flaunting with wide-open petals,
8286: almost all of them of the streaked pink-and-white kind, which doubtless
8287: dated from the union of the houses of York and Lancaster. Adam was wise
8288: enough to choose a compact Provence rose that peeped out half-smothered
8289: by its flaunting scentless neighbours, and held it in his hand—he
8290: thought he should be more at ease holding something in his hand—as he
8291: walked on to the far end of the garden, where he remembered there was
8292: the largest row of currant-trees, not far off from the great yew-tree
8293: arbour.
8294: 
8295: But he had not gone many steps beyond the roses, when he heard the
8296: shaking of a bough, and a boy’s voice saying, “Now, then, Totty, hold
8297: out your pinny—there’s a duck.”
8298: 
8299: The voice came from the boughs of a tall cherry-tree, where Adam had no
8300: difficulty in discerning a small blue-pinafored figure perched in a
8301: commodious position where the fruit was thickest. Doubtless Totty was
8302: below, behind the screen of peas. Yes—with her bonnet hanging down her
8303: back, and her fat face, dreadfully smeared with red juice, turned up
8304: towards the cherry-tree, while she held her little round hole of a
8305: mouth and her red-stained pinafore to receive the promised downfall. I
8306: am sorry to say, more than half the cherries that fell were hard and
8307: yellow instead of juicy and red; but Totty spent no time in useless
8308: regrets, and she was already sucking the third juiciest when Adam said,
8309: “There now, Totty, you’ve got your cherries. Run into the house with
8310: ’em to Mother—she wants you—she’s in the dairy. Run in this
8311: minute—there’s a good little girl.”
8312: 
8313: He lifted her up in his strong arms and kissed her as he spoke, a
8314: ceremony which Totty regarded as a tiresome interruption to
8315: cherry-eating; and when he set her down she trotted off quite silently
8316: towards the house, sucking her cherries as she went along.
8317: 
8318: “Tommy, my lad, take care you’re not shot for a little thieving bird,”
8319: said Adam, as he walked on towards the currant-trees.
8320: 
8321: He could see there was a large basket at the end of the row: Hetty
8322: would not be far off, and Adam already felt as if she were looking at
8323: him. Yet when he turned the corner she was standing with her back
8324: towards him, and stooping to gather the low-hanging fruit. Strange that
8325: she had not heard him coming! Perhaps it was because she was making the
8326: leaves rustle. She started when she became conscious that some one was
8327: near—started so violently that she dropped the basin with the currants
8328: in it, and then, when she saw it was Adam, she turned from pale to deep
8329: red. That blush made his heart beat with a new happiness. Hetty had
8330: never blushed at seeing him before.
8331: 
8332: “I frightened you,” he said, with a delicious sense that it didn’t
8333: signify what he said, since Hetty seemed to feel as much as he did;
8334: “let _me_ pick the currants up.”
8335: 
8336: That was soon done, for they had only fallen in a tangled mass on the
8337: grass-plot, and Adam, as he rose and gave her the basin again, looked
8338: straight into her eyes with the subdued tenderness that belongs to the
8339: first moments of hopeful love.
8340: 
8341: Hetty did not turn away her eyes; her blush had subsided, and she met
8342: his glance with a quiet sadness, which contented Adam because it was so
8343: unlike anything he had seen in her before.
8344: 
8345: “There’s not many more currants to get,” she said; “I shall soon ha’
8346: done now.”
8347: 
8348: “I’ll help you,” said Adam; and he fetched the large basket, which was
8349: nearly full of currants, and set it close to them.
8350: 
8351: Not a word more was spoken as they gathered the currants. Adam’s heart
8352: was too full to speak, and he thought Hetty knew all that was in it.
8353: She was not indifferent to his presence after all; she had blushed when
8354: she saw him, and then there was that touch of sadness about her which
8355: must surely mean love, since it was the opposite of her usual manner,
8356: which had often impressed him as indifference. And he could glance at
8357: her continually as she bent over the fruit, while the level evening
8358: sunbeams stole through the thick apple-tree boughs, and rested on her
8359: round cheek and neck as if they too were in love with her. It was to
8360: Adam the time that a man can least forget in after-life, the time when
8361: he believes that the first woman he has ever loved betrays by a slight
8362: something—a word, a tone, a glance, the quivering of a lip or an
8363: eyelid—that she is at least beginning to love him in return. The sign
8364: is so slight, it is scarcely perceptible to the ear or eye—he could
8365: describe it to no one—it is a mere feather-touch, yet it seems to have
8366: changed his whole being, to have merged an uneasy yearning into a
8367: delicious unconsciousness of everything but the present moment. So much
8368: of our early gladness vanishes utterly from our memory: we can never
8369: recall the joy with which we laid our heads on our mother’s bosom or
8370: rode on our father’s back in childhood. Doubtless that joy is wrought
8371: up into our nature, as the sunlight of long-past mornings is wrought up
8372: in the soft mellowness of the apricot, but it is gone for ever from our
8373: imagination, and we can only _believe_ in the joy of childhood. But the
8374: first glad moment in our first love is a vision which returns to us to
8375: the last, and brings with it a thrill of feeling intense and special as
8376: the recurrent sensation of a sweet odour breathed in a far-off hour of
8377: happiness. It is a memory that gives a more exquisite touch to
8378: tenderness, that feeds the madness of jealousy and adds the last
8379: keenness to the agony of despair.
8380: 
8381: Hetty bending over the red bunches, the level rays piercing the screen
8382: of apple-tree boughs, the length of bushy garden beyond, his own
8383: emotion as he looked at her and believed that she was thinking of him,
8384: and that there was no need for them to talk—Adam remembered it all to
8385: the last moment of his life.
8386: 
8387: And Hetty? You know quite well that Adam was mistaken about her. Like
8388: many other men, he thought the signs of love for another were signs of
8389: love towards himself. When Adam was approaching unseen by her, she was
8390: absorbed as usual in thinking and wondering about Arthur’s possible
8391: return. The sound of any man’s footstep would have affected her just in
8392: the same way—she would have _felt_ it might be Arthur before she had
8393: time to see, and the blood that forsook her cheek in the agitation of
8394: that momentary feeling would have rushed back again at the sight of any
8395: one else just as much as at the sight of Adam. He was not wrong in
8396: thinking that a change had come over Hetty: the anxieties and fears of
8397: a first passion, with which she was trembling, had become stronger than
8398: vanity, had given her for the first time that sense of helpless
8399: dependence on another’s feeling which awakens the clinging deprecating
8400: womanhood even in the shallowest girl that can ever experience it, and
8401: creates in her a sensibility to kindness which found her quite hard
8402: before. For the first time Hetty felt that there was something soothing
8403: to her in Adam’s timid yet manly tenderness. She wanted to be treated
8404: lovingly—oh, it was very hard to bear this blank of absence, silence,
8405: apparent indifference, after those moments of glowing love! She was not
8406: afraid that Adam would tease her with love-making and flattering
8407: speeches like her other admirers; he had always been so reserved to
8408: her; she could enjoy without any fear the sense that this strong brave
8409: man loved her and was near her. It never entered into her mind that
8410: Adam was pitiable too—that Adam too must suffer one day.
8411: 
8412: Hetty, we know, was not the first woman that had behaved more gently to
8413: the man who loved her in vain because she had herself begun to love
8414: another. It was a very old story, but Adam knew nothing about it, so he
8415: drank in the sweet delusion.
8416: 
8417: “That’ll do,” said Hetty, after a little while. “Aunt wants me to leave
8418: some on the trees. I’ll take ’em in now.”
8419: 
8420: “It’s very well I came to carry the basket,” said Adam “for it ’ud ha’
8421: been too heavy for your little arms.”
8422: 
8423: “No; I could ha’ carried it with both hands.”
8424: 
8425: “Oh, I daresay,” said Adam, smiling, “and been as long getting into the
8426: house as a little ant carrying a caterpillar. Have you ever seen those
8427: tiny fellows carrying things four times as big as themselves?”
8428: 
8429: “No,” said Hetty, indifferently, not caring to know the difficulties of
8430: ant life.
8431: 
8432: “Oh, I used to watch ’em often when I was a lad. But now, you see, I
8433: can carry the basket with one arm, as if it was an empty nutshell, and
8434: give you th’ other arm to lean on. Won’t you? Such big arms as mine
8435: were made for little arms like yours to lean on.”
8436: 
8437: Hetty smiled faintly and put her arm within his. Adam looked down at
8438: her, but her eyes were turned dreamily towards another corner of the
8439: garden.
8440: 
8441: “Have you ever been to Eagledale?” she said, as they walked slowly
8442: along.
8443: 
8444: “Yes,” said Adam, pleased to have her ask a question about himself.
8445: “Ten years ago, when I was a lad, I went with father to see about some
8446: work there. It’s a wonderful sight—rocks and caves such as you never
8447: saw in your life. I never had a right notion o’ rocks till I went
8448: there.”
8449: 
8450: “How long did it take to get there?”
8451: 
8452: “Why, it took us the best part o’ two days’ walking. But it’s nothing
8453: of a day’s journey for anybody as has got a first-rate nag. The captain
8454: ’ud get there in nine or ten hours, I’ll be bound, he’s such a rider.
8455: And I shouldn’t wonder if he’s back again to-morrow; he’s too active to
8456: rest long in that lonely place, all by himself, for there’s nothing but
8457: a bit of a inn i’ that part where he’s gone to fish. I wish he’d got
8458: th’ estate in his hands; that ’ud be the right thing for him, for it
8459: ’ud give him plenty to do, and he’d do’t well too, for all he’s so
8460: young; he’s got better notions o’ things than many a man twice his age.
8461: He spoke very handsome to me th’ other day about lending me money to
8462: set up i’ business; and if things came round that way, I’d rather be
8463: beholding to him nor to any man i’ the world.”
8464: 
8465: Poor Adam was led on to speak about Arthur because he thought Hetty
8466: would be pleased to know that the young squire was so ready to befriend
8467: him; the fact entered into his future prospects, which he would like to
8468: seem promising in her eyes. And it was true that Hetty listened with an
8469: interest which brought a new light into her eyes and a half-smile upon
8470: her lips.
8471: 
8472: “How pretty the roses are now!” Adam continued, pausing to look at
8473: them. “See! I stole the prettiest, but I didna mean to keep it myself.
8474: I think these as are all pink, and have got a finer sort o’ green
8475: leaves, are prettier than the striped uns, don’t you?”
8476: 
8477: He set down the basket and took the rose from his button-hole.
8478: 
8479: “It smells very sweet,” he said; “those striped uns have no smell.
8480: Stick it in your frock, and then you can put it in water after. It ’ud
8481: be a pity to let it fade.”
8482: 
8483: Hetty took the rose, smiling as she did so at the pleasant thought that
8484: Arthur could so soon get back if he liked. There was a flash of hope
8485: and happiness in her mind, and with a sudden impulse of gaiety she did
8486: what she had very often done before—stuck the rose in her hair a little
8487: above the left ear. The tender admiration in Adam’s face was slightly
8488: shadowed by reluctant disapproval. Hetty’s love of finery was just the
8489: thing that would most provoke his mother, and he himself disliked it as
8490: much as it was possible for him to dislike anything that belonged to
8491: her.
8492: 
8493: “Ah,” he said, “that’s like the ladies in the pictures at the Chase;
8494: they’ve mostly got flowers or feathers or gold things i’ their hair,
8495: but somehow I don’t like to see ’em; they allays put me i’ mind o’ the
8496: painted women outside the shows at Treddles’on Fair. What can a woman
8497: have to set her off better than her own hair, when it curls so, like
8498: yours? If a woman’s young and pretty, I think you can see her good
8499: looks all the better for her being plain dressed. Why, Dinah Morris
8500: looks very nice, for all she wears such a plain cap and gown. It seems
8501: to me as a woman’s face doesna want flowers; it’s almost like a flower
8502: itself. I’m sure yours is.”
8503: 
8504: “Oh, very well,” said Hetty, with a little playful pout, taking the
8505: rose out of her hair. “I’ll put one o’ Dinah’s caps on when we go in,
8506: and you’ll see if I look better in it. She left one behind, so I can
8507: take the pattern.”
8508: 
8509: “Nay, nay, I don’t want you to wear a Methodist cap like Dinah’s. I
8510: daresay it’s a very ugly cap, and I used to think when I saw her here
8511: as it was nonsense for her to dress different t’ other people; but I
8512: never rightly noticed her till she came to see mother last week, and
8513: then I thought the cap seemed to fit her face somehow as th ‘acorn-cup
8514: fits th’ acorn, and I shouldn’t like to see her so well without it. But
8515: you’ve got another sort o’ face; I’d have you just as you are now,
8516: without anything t’ interfere with your own looks. It’s like when a
8517: man’s singing a good tune—you don’t want t’ hear bells tinkling and
8518: interfering wi’ the sound.”
8519: 
8520: He took her arm and put it within his again, looking down on her
8521: fondly. He was afraid she should think he had lectured her, imagining,
8522: as we are apt to do, that she had perceived all the thoughts he had
8523: only half-expressed. And the thing he dreaded most was lest any cloud
8524: should come over this evening’s happiness. For the world he would not
8525: have spoken of his love to Hetty yet, till this commencing kindness
8526: towards him should have grown into unmistakable love. In his
8527: imagination he saw long years of his future life stretching before him,
8528: blest with the right to call Hetty his own: he could be content with
8529: very little at present. So he took up the basket of currants once more,
8530: and they went on towards the house.
8531: 
8532: The scene had quite changed in the half-hour that Adam had been in the
8533: garden. The yard was full of life now: Marty was letting the screaming
8534: geese through the gate, and wickedly provoking the gander by hissing at
8535: him; the granary-door was groaning on its hinges as Alick shut it,
8536: after dealing out the corn; the horses were being led out to watering,
8537: amidst much barking of all the three dogs and many “whups” from Tim the
8538: ploughman, as if the heavy animals who held down their meek,
8539: intelligent heads, and lifted their shaggy feet so deliberately, were
8540: likely to rush wildly in every direction but the right. Everybody was
8541: come back from the meadow; and when Hetty and Adam entered the
8542: house-place, Mr. Poyser was seated in the three-cornered chair, and the
8543: grandfather in the large arm-chair opposite, looking on with pleasant
8544: expectation while the supper was being laid on the oak table. Mrs.
8545: Poyser had laid the cloth herself—a cloth made of homespun linen, with
8546: a shining checkered pattern on it, and of an agreeable whitey-brown
8547: hue, such as all sensible housewives like to see—none of your bleached
8548: “shop-rag” that would wear into holes in no time, but good homespun
8549: that would last for two generations. The cold veal, the fresh lettuces,
8550: and the stuffed chine might well look tempting to hungry men who had
8551: dined at half-past twelve o’clock. On the large deal table against the
8552: wall there were bright pewter plates and spoons and cans, ready for
8553: Alick and his companions; for the master and servants ate their supper
8554: not far off each other; which was all the pleasanter, because if a
8555: remark about to-morrow morning’s work occurred to Mr. Poyser, Alick was
8556: at hand to hear it.
8557: 
8558: “Well, Adam, I’m glad to see ye,” said Mr. Poyser. “What! ye’ve been
8559: helping Hetty to gether the curran’s, eh? Come, sit ye down, sit ye
8560: down. Why, it’s pretty near a three-week since y’ had your supper with
8561: us; and the missis has got one of her rare stuffed chines. I’m glad
8562: ye’re come.”
8563: 
8564: “Hetty,” said Mrs. Poyser, as she looked into the basket of currants to
8565: see if the fruit was fine, “run upstairs and send Molly down. She’s
8566: putting Totty to bed, and I want her to draw th’ ale, for Nancy’s busy
8567: yet i’ the dairy. You can see to the child. But whativer did you let
8568: her run away from you along wi’ Tommy for, and stuff herself wi’ fruit
8569: as she can’t eat a bit o’ good victual?”
8570: 
8571: This was said in a lower tone than usual, while her husband was talking
8572: to Adam; for Mrs. Poyser was strict in adherence to her own rules of
8573: propriety, and she considered that a young girl was not to be treated
8574: sharply in the presence of a respectable man who was courting her. That
8575: would not be fair-play: every woman was young in her turn, and had her
8576: chances of matrimony, which it was a point of honour for other women
8577: not to spoil—just as one market-woman who has sold her own eggs must
8578: not try to balk another of a customer.
8579: 
8580: Hetty made haste to run away upstairs, not easily finding an answer to
8581: her aunt’s question, and Mrs. Poyser went out to see after Marty and
8582: Tommy and bring them in to supper.
8583: 
8584: Soon they were all seated—the two rosy lads, one on each side, by the
8585: pale mother, a place being left for Hetty between Adam and her uncle.
8586: Alick too was come in, and was seated in his far corner, eating cold
8587: broad beans out of a large dish with his pocket-knife, and finding a
8588: flavour in them which he would not have exchanged for the finest
8589: pineapple.
8590: 
8591: “What a time that gell is drawing th’ ale, to be sure!” said Mrs.
8592: Poyser, when she was dispensing her slices of stuffed chine. “I think
8593: she sets the jug under and forgets to turn the tap, as there’s nothing
8594: you can’t believe o’ them wenches: they’ll set the empty kettle o’ the
8595: fire, and then come an hour after to see if the water boils.”
8596: 
8597: “She’s drawin’ for the men too,” said Mr. Poyser. “Thee shouldst ha’
8598: told her to bring our jug up first.”
8599: 
8600: “Told her?” said Mrs. Poyser. “Yes, I might spend all the wind i’ my
8601: body, an’ take the bellows too, if I was to tell them gells everything
8602: as their own sharpness wonna tell ’em. Mr. Bede, will you take some
8603: vinegar with your lettuce? Aye you’re i’ the right not. It spoils the
8604: flavour o’ the chine, to my thinking. It’s poor eating where the
8605: flavour o’ the meat lies i’ the cruets. There’s folks as make bad
8606: butter and trusten to the salt t’ hide it.”
8607: 
8608: Mrs. Poyser’s attention was here diverted by the appearance of Molly,
8609: carrying a large jug, two small mugs, and four drinking-cans, all full
8610: of ale or small beer—an interesting example of the prehensile power
8611: possessed by the human hand. Poor Molly’s mouth was rather wider open
8612: than usual, as she walked along with her eyes fixed on the double
8613: cluster of vessels in her hands, quite innocent of the expression in
8614: her mistress’s eye.
8615: 
8616: “Molly, I niver knew your equils—to think o’ your poor mother as is a
8617: widow, an’ I took you wi’ as good as no character, an’ the times an’
8618: times I’ve told you....”
8619: 
8620: Molly had not seen the lightning, and the thunder shook her nerves the
8621: more for the want of that preparation. With a vague alarmed sense that
8622: she must somehow comport herself differently, she hastened her step a
8623: little towards the far deal table, where she might set down her
8624: cans—caught her foot in her apron, which had become untied, and fell
8625: with a crash and a splash into a pool of beer; whereupon a tittering
8626: explosion from Marty and Tommy, and a serious “Ello!” from Mr. Poyser,
8627: who saw his draught of ale unpleasantly deferred.
8628: 
8629: “There you go!” resumed Mrs. Poyser, in a cutting tone, as she rose and
8630: went towards the cupboard while Molly began dolefully to pick up the
8631: fragments of pottery. “It’s what I told you ’ud come, over and over
8632: again; and there’s your month’s wage gone, and more, to pay for that
8633: jug as I’ve had i’ the house this ten year, and nothing ever happened
8634: to’t before; but the crockery you’ve broke sin’ here in th’ house
8635: you’ve been ’ud make a parson swear—God forgi’ me for saying so—an’ if
8636: it had been boiling wort out o’ the copper, it ’ud ha’ been the same,
8637: and you’d ha’ been scalded and very like lamed for life, as there’s no
8638: knowing but what you will be some day if you go on; for anybody ’ud
8639: think you’d got the St. Vitus’s Dance, to see the things you’ve throwed
8640: down. It’s a pity but what the bits was stacked up for you to see,
8641: though it’s neither seeing nor hearing as ’ull make much odds to
8642: you—anybody ’ud think you war case-hardened.”
8643: 
8644: Poor Molly’s tears were dropping fast by this time, and in her
8645: desperation at the lively movement of the beer-stream towards Alick’s
8646: legs, she was converting her apron into a mop, while Mrs. Poyser,
8647: opening the cupboard, turned a blighting eye upon her.
8648: 
8649: “Ah,” she went on, “you’ll do no good wi’ crying an’ making more wet to
8650: wipe up. It’s all your own wilfulness, as I tell you, for there’s
8651: nobody no call to break anything if they’ll only go the right way to
8652: work. But wooden folks had need ha’ wooden things t’ handle. And here
8653: must I take the brown-and-white jug, as it’s niver been used three
8654: times this year, and go down i’ the cellar myself, and belike catch my
8655: death, and be laid up wi’ inflammation....”
8656: 
8657: Mrs. Poyser had turned round from the cupboard with the brown-and-white
8658: jug in her hand, when she caught sight of something at the other end of
8659: the kitchen; perhaps it was because she was already trembling and
8660: nervous that the apparition had so strong an effect on her; perhaps
8661: jug-breaking, like other crimes, has a contagious influence. However it
8662: was, she stared and started like a ghost-seer, and the precious
8663: brown-and-white jug fell to the ground, parting for ever with its spout
8664: and handle.
8665: 
8666: “Did ever anybody see the like?” she said, with a suddenly lowered
8667: tone, after a moment’s bewildered glance round the room. “The jugs are
8668: bewitched, _I_ think. It’s them nasty glazed handles—they slip o’er the
8669: finger like a snail.”
8670: 
8671: “Why, thee’st let thy own whip fly i’ thy face,” said her husband, who
8672: had now joined in the laugh of the young ones.
8673: 
8674: “It’s all very fine to look on and grin,” rejoined Mrs. Poyser; “but
8675: there’s times when the crockery seems alive an’ flies out o’ your hand
8676: like a bird. It’s like the glass, sometimes, ’ull crack as it stands.
8677: What is to be broke _will_ be broke, for I never dropped a thing i’ my
8678: life for want o’ holding it, else I should never ha’ kept the crockery
8679: all these ’ears as I bought at my own wedding. And Hetty, are you mad?
8680: Whativer do you mean by coming down i’ that way, and making one think
8681: as there’s a ghost a-walking i’ th’ house?”
8682: 
8683: A new outbreak of laughter, while Mrs. Poyser was speaking, was caused,
8684: less by her sudden conversion to a fatalistic view of jug-breaking than
8685: by that strange appearance of Hetty, which had startled her aunt. The
8686: little minx had found a black gown of her aunt’s, and pinned it close
8687: round her neck to look like Dinah’s, had made her hair as flat as she
8688: could, and had tied on one of Dinah’s high-crowned borderless net caps.
8689: The thought of Dinah’s pale grave face and mild grey eyes, which the
8690: sight of the gown and cap brought with it, made it a laughable surprise
8691: enough to see them replaced by Hetty’s round rosy cheeks and coquettish
8692: dark eyes. The boys got off their chairs and jumped round her, clapping
8693: their hands, and even Alick gave a low ventral laugh as he looked up
8694: from his beans. Under cover of the noise, Mrs. Poyser went into the
8695: back kitchen to send Nancy into the cellar with the great pewter
8696: measure, which had some chance of being free from bewitchment.
8697: 
8698: “Why, Hetty, lass, are ye turned Methodist?” said Mr. Poyser, with that
8699: comfortable slow enjoyment of a laugh which one only sees in stout
8700: people. “You must pull your face a deal longer before you’ll do for
8701: one; mustna she, Adam? How come you put them things on, eh?”
8702: 
8703: “Adam said he liked Dinah’s cap and gown better nor my clothes,” said
8704: Hetty, sitting down demurely. “He says folks looks better in ugly
8705: clothes.”
8706: 
8707: “Nay, nay,” said Adam, looking at her admiringly; “I only said they
8708: seemed to suit Dinah. But if I’d said you’d look pretty in ’em, I
8709: should ha’ said nothing but what was true.”
8710: 
8711: “Why, thee thought’st Hetty war a ghost, didstna?” said Mr. Poyser to
8712: his wife, who now came back and took her seat again. “Thee look’dst as
8713: scared as scared.”
8714: 
8715: “It little sinnifies how I looked,” said Mrs. Poyser; “looks ’ull mend
8716: no jugs, nor laughing neither, as I see. Mr. Bede, I’m sorry you’ve to
8717: wait so long for your ale, but it’s coming in a minute. Make yourself
8718: at home wi’ th’ cold potatoes: I know you like ’em. Tommy, I’ll send
8719: you to bed this minute, if you don’t give over laughing. What is there
8720: to laugh at, I should like to know? I’d sooner cry nor laugh at the
8721: sight o’ that poor thing’s cap; and there’s them as ’ud be better if
8722: they could make theirselves like her i’ more ways nor putting on her
8723: cap. It little becomes anybody i’ this house to make fun o’ my sister’s
8724: child, an’ her just gone away from us, as it went to my heart to part
8725: wi’ her. An’ I know one thing, as if trouble was to come, an’ I was to
8726: be laid up i’ my bed, an’ the children was to die—as there’s no knowing
8727: but what they will—an’ the murrain was to come among the cattle again,
8728: an’ everything went to rack an’ ruin, I say we might be glad to get
8729: sight o’ Dinah’s cap again, wi’ her own face under it, border or no
8730: border. For she’s one o’ them things as looks the brightest on a rainy
8731: day, and loves you the best when you’re most i’ need on’t.”
8732: 
8733: Mrs. Poyser, you perceive, was aware that nothing would be so likely to
8734: expel the comic as the terrible. Tommy, who was of a susceptible
8735: disposition, and very fond of his mother, and who had, besides, eaten
8736: so many cherries as to have his feelings less under command than usual,
8737: was so affected by the dreadful picture she had made of the possible
8738: future that he began to cry; and the good-natured father, indulgent to
8739: all weaknesses but those of negligent farmers, said to Hetty, “You’d
8740: better take the things off again, my lass; it hurts your aunt to see
8741: ’em.”
8742: 
8743: Hetty went upstairs again, and the arrival of the ale made an agreeable
8744: diversion; for Adam had to give his opinion of the new tap, which could
8745: not be otherwise than complimentary to Mrs. Poyser; and then followed a
8746: discussion on the secrets of good brewing, the folly of stinginess in
8747: “hopping,” and the doubtful economy of a farmer’s making his own malt.
8748: Mrs. Poyser had so many opportunities of expressing herself with weight
8749: on these subjects that by the time supper was ended, the ale-jug
8750: refilled, and Mr. Poyser’s pipe alight she was once more in high good
8751: humour, and ready, at Adam’s request, to fetch the broken
8752: spinning-wheel for his inspection.
8753: 
8754: “Ah,” said Adam, looking at it carefully, “here’s a nice bit o’ turning
8755: wanted. It’s a pretty wheel. I must have it up at the turning-shop in
8756: the village and do it there, for I’ve no convenence for turning at
8757: home. If you’ll send it to Mr. Burge’s shop i’ the morning, I’ll get it
8758: done for you by Wednesday. I’ve been turning it over in my mind,” he
8759: continued, looking at Mr. Poyser, “to make a bit more convenence at
8760: home for nice jobs o’ cabinet-making. I’ve always done a deal at such
8761: little things in odd hours, and they’re profitable, for there’s more
8762: workmanship nor material in ’em. I look for me and Seth to get a little
8763: business for ourselves i’ that way, for I know a man at Rosseter as
8764: ’ull take as many things as we should make, besides what we could get
8765: orders for round about.”
8766: 
8767: Mr. Poyser entered with interest into a project which seemed a step
8768: towards Adam’s becoming a “master-man,” and Mrs. Poyser gave her
8769: approbation to the scheme of the movable kitchen cupboard, which was to
8770: be capable of containing grocery, pickles, crockery, and house-linen in
8771: the utmost compactness without confusion. Hetty, once more in her own
8772: dress, with her neckerchief pushed a little backwards on this warm
8773: evening, was seated picking currants near the window, where Adam could
8774: see her quite well. And so the time passed pleasantly till Adam got up
8775: to go. He was pressed to come again soon, but not to stay longer, for
8776: at this busy time sensible people would not run the risk of being
8777: sleepy at five o’clock in the morning.
8778: 
8779: “I shall take a step farther,” said Adam, “and go on to see Mester
8780: Massey, for he wasn’t at church yesterday, and I’ve not seen him for a
8781: week past. I’ve never hardly known him to miss church before.”
8782: 
8783: “Aye,” said Mr. Poyser, “we’ve heared nothing about him, for it’s the
8784: boys’ hollodays now, so we can give you no account.”
8785: 
8786: “But you’ll niver think o’ going there at this hour o’ the night?” said
8787: Mrs. Poyser, folding up her knitting.
8788: 
8789: “Oh, Mester Massey sits up late,” said Adam. “An’ the night-school’s
8790: not over yet. Some o’ the men don’t come till late—they’ve got so far
8791: to walk. And Bartle himself’s never in bed till it’s gone eleven.”
8792: 
8793: “I wouldna have him to live wi’ me, then,” said Mrs. Poyser,
8794: “a-dropping candle-grease about, as you’re like to tumble down o’ the
8795: floor the first thing i’ the morning.”
8796: 
8797: “Aye, eleven o’clock’s late—it’s late,” said old Martin. “I ne’er sot
8798: up so i’ _my_ life, not to say as it warna a marr’in’, or a
8799: christenin’, or a wake, or th’ harvest supper. Eleven o’clock’s late.”
8800: 
8801: “Why, I sit up till after twelve often,” said Adam, laughing, “but it
8802: isn’t t’ eat and drink extry, it’s to work extry. Good-night, Mrs.
8803: Poyser; good-night, Hetty.”
8804: 
8805: Hetty could only smile and not shake hands, for hers were dyed and damp
8806: with currant-juice; but all the rest gave a hearty shake to the large
8807: palm that was held out to them, and said, “Come again, come again!”
8808: 
8809: “Aye, think o’ that now,” said Mr. Poyser, when Adam was out of on the
8810: causeway. “Sitting up till past twelve to do extry work! Ye’ll not find
8811: many men o’ six-an’ twenty as ’ull do to put i’ the shafts wi’ him. If
8812: you can catch Adam for a husband, Hetty, you’ll ride i’ your own
8813: spring-cart some day, I’ll be your warrant.”
8814: 
8815: Hetty was moving across the kitchen with the currants, so her uncle did
8816: not see the little toss of the head with which she answered him. To
8817: ride in a spring-cart seemed a very miserable lot indeed to her now.
8818: 
8819: 
8820: 
8821: 
8822: Chapter XXI
8823: The Night-School and the Schoolmaster
8824: 
8825: 
8826: Bartle Massey’s was one of a few scattered houses on the edge of a
8827: common, which was divided by the road to Treddleston. Adam reached it
8828: in a quarter of an hour after leaving the Hall Farm; and when he had
8829: his hand on the door-latch, he could see, through the curtainless
8830: window, that there were eight or nine heads bending over the desks,
8831: lighted by thin dips.
8832: 
8833: When he entered, a reading lesson was going forward and Bartle Massey
8834: merely nodded, leaving him to take his place where he pleased. He had
8835: not come for the sake of a lesson to-night, and his mind was too full
8836: of personal matters, too full of the last two hours he had passed in
8837: Hetty’s presence, for him to amuse himself with a book till school was
8838: over; so he sat down in a corner and looked on with an absent mind. It
8839: was a sort of scene which Adam had beheld almost weekly for years; he
8840: knew by heart every arabesque flourish in the framed specimen of Bartle
8841: Massey’s handwriting which hung over the schoolmaster’s head, by way of
8842: keeping a lofty ideal before the minds of his pupils; he knew the backs
8843: of all the books on the shelf running along the whitewashed wall above
8844: the pegs for the slates; he knew exactly how many grains were gone out
8845: of the ear of Indian corn that hung from one of the rafters; he had
8846: long ago exhausted the resources of his imagination in trying to think
8847: how the bunch of leathery seaweed had looked and grown in its native
8848: element; and from the place where he sat, he could make nothing of the
8849: old map of England that hung against the opposite wall, for age had
8850: turned it of a fine yellow brown, something like that of a
8851: well-seasoned meerschaum. The drama that was going on was almost as
8852: familiar as the scene, nevertheless habit had not made him indifferent
8853: to it, and even in his present self-absorbed mood, Adam felt a
8854: momentary stirring of the old fellow-feeling, as he looked at the rough
8855: men painfully holding pen or pencil with their cramped hands, or humbly
8856: labouring through their reading lesson.
8857: 
8858: The reading class now seated on the form in front of the schoolmaster’s
8859: desk consisted of the three most backward pupils. Adam would have known
8860: it only by seeing Bartle Massey’s face as he looked over his
8861: spectacles, which he had shifted to the ridge of his nose, not
8862: requiring them for present purposes. The face wore its mildest
8863: expression: the grizzled bushy eyebrows had taken their more acute
8864: angle of compassionate kindness, and the mouth, habitually compressed
8865: with a pout of the lower lip, was relaxed so as to be ready to speak a
8866: helpful word or syllable in a moment. This gentle expression was the
8867: more interesting because the schoolmaster’s nose, an irregular aquiline
8868: twisted a little on one side, had rather a formidable character; and
8869: his brow, moreover, had that peculiar tension which always impresses
8870: one as a sign of a keen impatient temperament: the blue veins stood out
8871: like cords under the transparent yellow skin, and this intimidating
8872: brow was softened by no tendency to baldness, for the grey bristly
8873: hair, cut down to about an inch in length, stood round it in as close
8874: ranks as ever.
8875: 
8876: “Nay, Bill, nay,” Bartle was saying in a kind tone, as he nodded to
8877: Adam, “begin that again, and then perhaps, it’ll come to you what d-r-y
8878: spells. It’s the same lesson you read last week, you know.”
8879: 
8880: “Bill” was a sturdy fellow, aged four-and-twenty, an excellent
8881: stone-sawyer, who could get as good wages as any man in the trade of
8882: his years; but he found a reading lesson in words of one syllable a
8883: harder matter to deal with than the hardest stone he had ever had to
8884: saw. The letters, he complained, were so “uncommon alike, there was no
8885: tellin’ ’em one from another,” the sawyer’s business not being
8886: concerned with minute differences such as exist between a letter with
8887: its tail turned up and a letter with its tail turned down. But Bill had
8888: a firm determination that he would learn to read, founded chiefly on
8889: two reasons: first, that Tom Hazelow, his cousin, could read anything
8890: “right off,” whether it was print or writing, and Tom had sent him a
8891: letter from twenty miles off, saying how he was prospering in the world
8892: and had got an overlooker’s place; secondly, that Sam Phillips, who
8893: sawed with him, had learned to read when he was turned twenty, and what
8894: could be done by a little fellow like Sam Phillips, Bill considered,
8895: could be done by himself, seeing that he could pound Sam into wet clay
8896: if circumstances required it. So here he was, pointing his big finger
8897: towards three words at once, and turning his head on one side that he
8898: might keep better hold with his eye of the one word which was to be
8899: discriminated out of the group. The amount of knowledge Bartle Massey
8900: must possess was something so dim and vast that Bill’s imagination
8901: recoiled before it: he would hardly have ventured to deny that the
8902: schoolmaster might have something to do in bringing about the regular
8903: return of daylight and the changes in the weather.
8904: 
8905: The man seated next to Bill was of a very different type: he was a
8906: Methodist brickmaker who, after spending thirty years of his life in
8907: perfect satisfaction with his ignorance, had lately “got religion,” and
8908: along with it the desire to read the Bible. But with him, too, learning
8909: was a heavy business, and on his way out to-night he had offered as
8910: usual a special prayer for help, seeing that he had undertaken this
8911: hard task with a single eye to the nourishment of his soul—that he
8912: might have a greater abundance of texts and hymns wherewith to banish
8913: evil memories and the temptations of old habit—or, in brief language,
8914: the devil. For the brickmaker had been a notorious poacher, and was
8915: suspected, though there was no good evidence against him, of being the
8916: man who had shot a neighbouring gamekeeper in the leg. However that
8917: might be, it is certain that shortly after the accident referred to,
8918: which was coincident with the arrival of an awakening Methodist
8919: preacher at Treddleston, a great change had been observed in the
8920: brickmaker; and though he was still known in the neighbourhood by his
8921: old sobriquet of “Brimstone,” there was nothing he held in so much
8922: horror as any further transactions with that evil-smelling element. He
8923: was a broad-chested fellow with a fervid temperament, which helped him
8924: better in imbibing religious ideas than in the dry process of acquiring
8925: the mere human knowledge of the alphabet. Indeed, he had been already a
8926: little shaken in his resolution by a brother Methodist, who assured him
8927: that the letter was a mere obstruction to the Spirit, and expressed a
8928: fear that Brimstone was too eager for the knowledge that puffeth up.
8929: 
8930: The third beginner was a much more promising pupil. He was a tall but
8931: thin and wiry man, nearly as old as Brimstone, with a very pale face
8932: and hands stained a deep blue. He was a dyer, who in the course of
8933: dipping homespun wool and old women’s petticoats had got fired with the
8934: ambition to learn a great deal more about the strange secrets of
8935: colour. He had already a high reputation in the district for his dyes,
8936: and he was bent on discovering some method by which he could reduce the
8937: expense of crimsons and scarlets. The druggist at Treddleston had given
8938: him a notion that he might save himself a great deal of labour and
8939: expense if he could learn to read, and so he had begun to give his
8940: spare hours to the night-school, resolving that his “little chap”
8941: should lose no time in coming to Mr. Massey’s day-school as soon as he
8942: was old enough.
8943: 
8944: It was touching to see these three big men, with the marks of their
8945: hard labour about them, anxiously bending over the worn books and
8946: painfully making out, “The grass is green,” “The sticks are dry,” “The
8947: corn is ripe”—a very hard lesson to pass to after columns of single
8948: words all alike except in the first letter. It was almost as if three
8949: rough animals were making humble efforts to learn how they might become
8950: human. And it touched the tenderest fibre in Bartle Massey’s nature,
8951: for such full-grown children as these were the only pupils for whom he
8952: had no severe epithets and no impatient tones. He was not gifted with
8953: an imperturbable temper, and on music-nights it was apparent that
8954: patience could never be an easy virtue to him; but this evening, as he
8955: glances over his spectacles at Bill Downes, the sawyer, who is turning
8956: his head on one side with a desperate sense of blankness before the
8957: letters d-r-y, his eyes shed their mildest and most encouraging light.
8958: 
8959: After the reading class, two youths between sixteen and nineteen came
8960: up with the imaginary bills of parcels, which they had been writing out
8961: on their slates and were now required to calculate “off-hand”—a test
8962: which they stood with such imperfect success that Bartle Massey, whose
8963: eyes had been glaring at them ominously through his spectacles for some
8964: minutes, at length burst out in a bitter, high-pitched tone, pausing
8965: between every sentence to rap the floor with a knobbed stick which
8966: rested between his legs.
8967: 
8968: “Now, you see, you don’t do this thing a bit better than you did a
8969: fortnight ago, and I’ll tell you what’s the reason. You want to learn
8970: accounts—that’s well and good. But you think all you need do to learn
8971: accounts is to come to me and do sums for an hour or so, two or three
8972: times a-week; and no sooner do you get your caps on and turn out of
8973: doors again than you sweep the whole thing clean out of your mind. You
8974: go whistling about, and take no more care what you’re thinking of than
8975: if your heads were gutters for any rubbish to swill through that
8976: happened to be in the way; and if you get a good notion in ’em, it’s
8977: pretty soon washed out again. You think knowledge is to be got
8978: cheap—you’ll come and pay Bartle Massey sixpence a-week, and he’ll make
8979: you clever at figures without your taking any trouble. But knowledge
8980: isn’t to be got with paying sixpence, let me tell you. If you’re to
8981: know figures, you must turn ’em over in your heads and keep your
8982: thoughts fixed on ’em. There’s nothing you can’t turn into a sum, for
8983: there’s nothing but what’s got number in it—even a fool. You may say to
8984: yourselves, ‘I’m one fool, and Jack’s another; if my fool’s head
8985: weighed four pound, and Jack’s three pound three ounces and three
8986: quarters, how many pennyweights heavier would my head be than Jack’s?’
8987: A man that had got his heart in learning figures would make sums for
8988: himself and work ’em in his head. When he sat at his shoemaking, he’d
8989: count his stitches by fives, and then put a price on his stitches, say
8990: half a farthing, and then see how much money he could get in an hour;
8991: and then ask himself how much money he’d get in a day at that rate; and
8992: then how much ten workmen would get working three, or twenty, or a
8993: hundred years at that rate—and all the while his needle would be going
8994: just as fast as if he left his head empty for the devil to dance in.
8995: But the long and the short of it is—I’ll have nobody in my night-school
8996: that doesn’t strive to learn what he comes to learn, as hard as if he
8997: was striving to get out of a dark hole into broad daylight. I’ll send
8998: no man away because he’s stupid: if Billy Taft, the idiot, wanted to
8999: learn anything, I’d not refuse to teach him. But I’ll not throw away
9000: good knowledge on people who think they can get it by the sixpenn’orth,
9001: and carry it away with ’em as they would an ounce of snuff. So never
9002: come to me again, if you can’t show that you’ve been working with your
9003: own heads, instead of thinking that you can pay for mine to work for
9004: you. That’s the last word I’ve got to say to you.”
9005: 
9006: With this final sentence, Bartle Massey gave a sharper rap than ever
9007: with his knobbed stick, and the discomfited lads got up to go with a
9008: sulky look. The other pupils had happily only their writing-books to
9009: show, in various stages of progress from pot-hooks to round text; and
9010: mere pen-strokes, however perverse, were less exasperating to Bartle
9011: than false arithmetic. He was a little more severe than usual on Jacob
9012: Storey’s Z’s, of which poor Jacob had written a pageful, all with their
9013: tops turned the wrong way, with a puzzled sense that they were not
9014: right “somehow.” But he observed in apology, that it was a letter you
9015: never wanted hardly, and he thought it had only been there “to finish
9016: off th’ alphabet, like, though ampusand (&) would ha’ done as well, for
9017: what he could see.”
9018: 
9019: At last the pupils had all taken their hats and said their
9020: “Good-nights,” and Adam, knowing his old master’s habits, rose and
9021: said, “Shall I put the candles out, Mr. Massey?”
9022: 
9023: “Yes, my boy, yes, all but this, which I’ll carry into the house; and
9024: just lock the outer door, now you’re near it,” said Bartle, getting his
9025: stick in the fitting angle to help him in descending from his stool. He
9026: was no sooner on the ground than it became obvious why the stick was
9027: necessary—the left leg was much shorter than the right. But the
9028: school-master was so active with his lameness that it was hardly
9029: thought of as a misfortune; and if you had seen him make his way along
9030: the schoolroom floor, and up the step into his kitchen, you would
9031: perhaps have understood why the naughty boys sometimes felt that his
9032: pace might be indefinitely quickened and that he and his stick might
9033: overtake them even in their swiftest run.
9034: 
9035: The moment he appeared at the kitchen door with the candle in his hand,
9036: a faint whimpering began in the chimney-corner, and a
9037: brown-and-tan-coloured bitch, of that wise-looking breed with short
9038: legs and long body, known to an unmechanical generation as turnspits,
9039: came creeping along the floor, wagging her tail, and hesitating at
9040: every other step, as if her affections were painfully divided between
9041: the hamper in the chimney-corner and the master, whom she could not
9042: leave without a greeting.
9043: 
9044: “Well, Vixen, well then, how are the babbies?” said the schoolmaster,
9045: making haste towards the chimney-corner and holding the candle over the
9046: low hamper, where two extremely blind puppies lifted up their heads
9047: towards the light from a nest of flannel and wool. Vixen could not even
9048: see her master look at them without painful excitement: she got into
9049: the hamper and got out again the next moment, and behaved with true
9050: feminine folly, though looking all the while as wise as a dwarf with a
9051: large old-fashioned head and body on the most abbreviated legs.
9052: 
9053: “Why, you’ve got a family, I see, Mr. Massey?” said Adam, smiling, as
9054: he came into the kitchen. “How’s that? I thought it was against the law
9055: here.”
9056: 
9057: “Law? What’s the use o’ law when a man’s once such a fool as to let a
9058: woman into his house?” said Bartle, turning away from the hamper with
9059: some bitterness. He always called Vixen a woman, and seemed to have
9060: lost all consciousness that he was using a figure of speech. “If I’d
9061: known Vixen was a woman, I’d never have held the boys from drowning
9062: her; but when I’d got her into my hand, I was forced to take to her.
9063: And now you see what she’s brought me to—the sly, hypocritical
9064: wench”—Bartle spoke these last words in a rasping tone of reproach, and
9065: looked at Vixen, who poked down her head and turned up her eyes towards
9066: him with a keen sense of opprobrium—“and contrived to be brought to bed
9067: on a Sunday at church-time. I’ve wished again and again I’d been a
9068: bloody minded man, that I could have strangled the mother and the brats
9069: with one cord.”
9070: 
9071: “I’m glad it was no worse a cause kept you from church,” said Adam. “I
9072: was afraid you must be ill for the first time i’ your life. And I was
9073: particularly sorry not to have you at church yesterday.”
9074: 
9075: “Ah, my boy, I know why, I know why,” said Bartle kindly, going up to
9076: Adam and raising his hand up to the shoulder that was almost on a level
9077: with his own head. “You’ve had a rough bit o’ road to get over since I
9078: saw you—a rough bit o’ road. But I’m in hopes there are better times
9079: coming for you. I’ve got some news to tell you. But I must get my
9080: supper first, for I’m hungry, I’m hungry. Sit down, sit down.”
9081: 
9082: Bartel went into his little pantry, and brought out an excellent
9083: home-baked loaf; for it was his one extravagance in these dear times to
9084: eat bread once a-day instead of oat-cake; and he justified it by
9085: observing, that what a schoolmaster wanted was brains, and oat-cake ran
9086: too much to bone instead of brains. Then came a piece of cheese and a
9087: quart jug with a crown of foam upon it. He placed them all on the round
9088: deal table which stood against his large arm-chair in the
9089: chimney-corner, with Vixen’s hamper on one side of it and a
9090: window-shelf with a few books piled up in it on the other. The table
9091: was as clean as if Vixen had been an excellent housewife in a checkered
9092: apron; so was the quarry floor; and the old carved oaken press, table,
9093: and chairs, which in these days would be bought at a high price in
9094: aristocratic houses, though, in that period of spider-legs and inlaid
9095: cupids, Bartle had got them for an old song, were as free from dust as
9096: things could be at the end of a summer’s day.
9097: 
9098: “Now, then, my boy, draw up, draw up. We’ll not talk about business
9099: till we’ve had our supper. No man can be wise on an empty stomach.
9100: But,” said Bartle, rising from his chair again, “I must give Vixen her
9101: supper too, confound her! Though she’ll do nothing with it but nourish
9102: those unnecessary babbies. That’s the way with these women—they’ve got
9103: no head-pieces to nourish, and so their food all runs either to fat or
9104: to brats.”
9105: 
9106: He brought out of the pantry a dish of scraps, which Vixen at once
9107: fixed her eyes on, and jumped out of her hamper to lick up with the
9108: utmost dispatch.
9109: 
9110: “I’ve had my supper, Mr. Massey,” said Adam, “so I’ll look on while you
9111: eat yours. I’ve been at the Hall Farm, and they always have their
9112: supper betimes, you know: they don’t keep your late hours.”
9113: 
9114: “I know little about their hours,” said Bartle dryly, cutting his bread
9115: and not shrinking from the crust. “It’s a house I seldom go into,
9116: though I’m fond of the boys, and Martin Poyser’s a good fellow. There’s
9117: too many women in the house for me: I hate the sound of women’s voices;
9118: they’re always either a-buzz or a-squeak—always either a-buzz or
9119: a-squeak. Mrs. Poyser keeps at the top o’ the talk like a fife; and as
9120: for the young lasses, I’d as soon look at water-grubs. I know what
9121: they’ll turn to—stinging gnats, stinging gnats. Here, take some ale, my
9122: boy: it’s been drawn for you—it’s been drawn for you.”
9123: 
9124: “Nay, Mr. Massey,” said Adam, who took his old friend’s whim more
9125: seriously than usual to-night, “don’t be so hard on the creaturs God
9126: has made to be companions for us. A working-man ’ud be badly off
9127: without a wife to see to th’ house and the victual, and make things
9128: clean and comfortable.”
9129: 
9130: “Nonsense! It’s the silliest lie a sensible man like you ever believed,
9131: to say a woman makes a house comfortable. It’s a story got up because
9132: the women are there and something must be found for ’em to do. I tell
9133: you there isn’t a thing under the sun that needs to be done at all, but
9134: what a man can do better than a woman, unless it’s bearing children,
9135: and they do that in a poor make-shift way; it had better ha’ been left
9136: to the men—it had better ha’ been left to the men. I tell you, a woman
9137: ’ull bake you a pie every week of her life and never come to see that
9138: the hotter th’ oven the shorter the time. I tell you, a woman ’ull make
9139: your porridge every day for twenty years and never think of measuring
9140: the proportion between the meal and the milk—a little more or less,
9141: she’ll think, doesn’t signify. The porridge _will_ be awk’ard now and
9142: then: if it’s wrong, it’s summat in the meal, or it’s summat in the
9143: milk, or it’s summat in the water. Look at me! I make my own bread, and
9144: there’s no difference between one batch and another from year’s end to
9145: year’s end; but if I’d got any other woman besides Vixen in the house,
9146: I must pray to the Lord every baking to give me patience if the bread
9147: turned out heavy. And as for cleanliness, my house is cleaner than any
9148: other house on the Common, though the half of ’em swarm with women.
9149: Will Baker’s lad comes to help me in a morning, and we get as much
9150: cleaning done in one hour, without any fuss, as a woman ’ud get done in
9151: three, and all the while be sending buckets o’ water after your ankles,
9152: and let the fender and the fire-irons stand in the middle o’ the floor
9153: half the day for you to break your shins against ’em. Don’t tell me
9154: about God having made such creatures to be companions for us! I don’t
9155: say but He might make Eve to be a companion to Adam in Paradise—there
9156: was no cooking to be spoilt there, and no other woman to cackle with
9157: and make mischief, though you see what mischief she did as soon as
9158: she’d an opportunity. But it’s an impious, unscriptural opinion to say
9159: a woman’s a blessing to a man now; you might as well say adders and
9160: wasps, and foxes and wild beasts are a blessing, when they’re only the
9161: evils that belong to this state o’ probation, which it’s lawful for a
9162: man to keep as clear of as he can in this life, hoping to get quit of
9163: ’em for ever in another—hoping to get quit of ’em for ever in another.”
9164: 
9165: Bartle had become so excited and angry in the course of his invective
9166: that he had forgotten his supper, and only used the knife for the
9167: purpose of rapping the table with the haft. But towards the close, the
9168: raps became so sharp and frequent, and his voice so quarrelsome, that
9169: Vixen felt it incumbent on her to jump out of the hamper and bark
9170: vaguely.
9171: 
9172: “Quiet, Vixen!” snarled Bartle, turning round upon her. “You’re like
9173: the rest o’ the women—always putting in _your_ word before you know
9174: why.”
9175: 
9176: Vixen returned to her hamper again in humiliation, and her master
9177: continued his supper in a silence which Adam did not choose to
9178: interrupt; he knew the old man would be in a better humour when he had
9179: had his supper and lighted his pipe. Adam was used to hear him talk in
9180: this way, but had never learned so much of Bartle’s past life as to
9181: know whether his view of married comfort was founded on experience. On
9182: that point Bartle was mute, and it was even a secret where he had lived
9183: previous to the twenty years in which happily for the peasants and
9184: artisans of this neighbourhood he had been settled among them as their
9185: only schoolmaster. If anything like a question was ventured on this
9186: subject, Bartle always replied, “Oh, I’ve seen many places—I’ve been a
9187: deal in the south,” and the Loamshire men would as soon have thought of
9188: asking for a particular town or village in Africa as in “the south.”
9189: 
9190: “Now then, my boy,” said Bartle, at last, when he had poured out his
9191: second mug of ale and lighted his pipe, “now then, we’ll have a little
9192: talk. But tell me first, have you heard any particular news to-day?”
9193: 
9194: “No,” said Adam, “not as I remember.”
9195: 
9196: “Ah, they’ll keep it close, they’ll keep it close, I daresay. But I
9197: found it out by chance; and it’s news that may concern you, Adam, else
9198: I’m a man that don’t know a superficial square foot from a solid.”
9199: 
9200: Here Bartle gave a series of fierce and rapid puffs, looking earnestly
9201: the while at Adam. Your impatient loquacious man has never any notion
9202: of keeping his pipe alight by gentle measured puffs; he is always
9203: letting it go nearly out, and then punishing it for that negligence. At
9204: last he said, “Satchell’s got a paralytic stroke. I found it out from
9205: the lad they sent to Treddleston for the doctor, before seven o’clock
9206: this morning. He’s a good way beyond sixty, you know; it’s much if he
9207: gets over it.”
9208: 
9209: “Well,” said Adam, “I daresay there’d be more rejoicing than sorrow in
9210: the parish at his being laid up. He’s been a selfish, tale-bearing,
9211: mischievous fellow; but, after all, there’s nobody he’s done so much
9212: harm to as to th’ old squire. Though it’s the squire himself as is to
9213: blame—making a stupid fellow like that a sort o’ man-of-all-work, just
9214: to save th’ expense of having a proper steward to look after th’
9215: estate. And he’s lost more by ill management o’ the woods, I’ll be
9216: bound, than ’ud pay for two stewards. If he’s laid on the shelf, it’s
9217: to be hoped he’ll make way for a better man, but I don’t see how it’s
9218: like to make any difference to me.”
9219: 
9220: “But I see it, but I see it,” said Bartle, “and others besides me. The
9221: captain’s coming of age now—you know that as well as I do—and it’s to
9222: be expected he’ll have a little more voice in things. And I know, and
9223: you know too, what ’ud be the captain’s wish about the woods, if there
9224: was a fair opportunity for making a change. He’s said in plenty of
9225: people’s hearing that he’d make you manager of the woods to-morrow, if
9226: he’d the power. Why, Carroll, Mr. Irwine’s butler, heard him say so to
9227: the parson not many days ago. Carroll looked in when we were smoking
9228: our pipes o’ Saturday night at Casson’s, and he told us about it; and
9229: whenever anybody says a good word for you, the parson’s ready to back
9230: it, that I’ll answer for. It was pretty well talked over, I can tell
9231: you, at Casson’s, and one and another had their fling at you; for if
9232: donkeys set to work to sing, you’re pretty sure what the tune’ll be.”
9233: 
9234: “Why, did they talk it over before Mr. Burge?” said Adam; “or wasn’t he
9235: there o’ Saturday?”
9236: 
9237: “Oh, he went away before Carroll came; and Casson—he’s always for
9238: setting other folks right, you know—would have it Burge was the man to
9239: have the management of the woods. ‘A substantial man,’ says he, ‘with
9240: pretty near sixty years’ experience o’ timber: it ’ud be all very well
9241: for Adam Bede to act under him, but it isn’t to be supposed the squire
9242: ’ud appoint a young fellow like Adam, when there’s his elders and
9243: betters at hand!’ But I said, ‘That’s a pretty notion o’ yours, Casson.
9244: Why, Burge is the man to _buy_ timber; would you put the woods into his
9245: hands and let him make his own bargains? I think you don’t leave your
9246: customers to score their own drink, do you? And as for age, what that’s
9247: worth depends on the quality o’ the liquor. It’s pretty well known
9248: who’s the backbone of Jonathan Burge’s business.’”
9249: 
9250: “I thank you for your good word, Mr. Massey,” said Adam. “But, for all
9251: that, Casson was partly i’ the right for once. There’s not much
9252: likelihood that th’ old squire ’ud ever consent t’ employ me. I
9253: offended him about two years ago, and he’s never forgiven me.”
9254: 
9255: “Why, how was that? You never told me about it,” said Bartle.
9256: 
9257: “Oh, it was a bit o’ nonsense. I’d made a frame for a screen for Miss
9258: Lyddy—she’s allays making something with her worsted-work, you know—and
9259: she’d given me particular orders about this screen, and there was as
9260: much talking and measuring as if we’d been planning a house. However,
9261: it was a nice bit o’ work, and I liked doing it for her. But, you know,
9262: those little friggling things take a deal o’ time. I only worked at it
9263: in overhours—often late at night—and I had to go to Treddleston over
9264: an’ over again about little bits o’ brass nails and such gear; and I
9265: turned the little knobs and the legs, and carved th’ open work, after a
9266: pattern, as nice as could be. And I was uncommon pleased with it when
9267: it was done. And when I took it home, Miss Lyddy sent for me to bring
9268: it into her drawing-room, so as she might give me directions about
9269: fastening on the work—very fine needlework, Jacob and Rachel a-kissing
9270: one another among the sheep, like a picture—and th’ old squire was
9271: sitting there, for he mostly sits with her. Well, she was mighty
9272: pleased with the screen, and then she wanted to know what pay she was
9273: to give me. I didn’t speak at random—you know it’s not my way; I’d
9274: calculated pretty close, though I hadn’t made out a bill, and I said,
9275: ‘One pound thirteen.’ That was paying for the mater’als and paying me,
9276: but none too much, for my work. Th’ old squire looked up at this, and
9277: peered in his way at the screen, and said, ‘One pound thirteen for a
9278: gimcrack like that! Lydia, my dear, if you must spend money on these
9279: things, why don’t you get them at Rosseter, instead of paying double
9280: price for clumsy work here? Such things are not work for a carpenter
9281: like Adam. Give him a guinea, and no more.’ Well, Miss Lyddy, I reckon,
9282: believed what he told her, and she’s not overfond o’ parting with the
9283: money herself—she’s not a bad woman at bottom, but she’s been brought
9284: up under his thumb; so she began fidgeting with her purse, and turned
9285: as red as her ribbon. But I made a bow, and said, ‘No, thank you,
9286: madam; I’ll make you a present o’ the screen, if you please. I’ve
9287: charged the regular price for my work, and I know it’s done well; and I
9288: know, begging His Honour’s pardon, that you couldn’t get such a screen
9289: at Rosseter under two guineas. I’m willing to give you my work—it’s
9290: been done in my own time, and nobody’s got anything to do with it but
9291: me; but if I’m paid, I can’t take a smaller price than I asked, because
9292: that ’ud be like saying I’d asked more than was just. With your leave,
9293: madam, I’ll bid you good-morning.’ I made my bow and went out before
9294: she’d time to say any more, for she stood with the purse in her hand,
9295: looking almost foolish. I didn’t mean to be disrespectful, and I spoke
9296: as polite as I could; but I can give in to no man, if he wants to make
9297: it out as I’m trying to overreach him. And in the evening the footman
9298: brought me the one pound thirteen wrapped in paper. But since then I’ve
9299: seen pretty clear as th’ old squire can’t abide me.”
9300: 
9301: “That’s likely enough, that’s likely enough,” said Bartle meditatively.
9302: “The only way to bring him round would be to show him what was for his
9303: own interest, and that the captain may do—that the captain may do.”
9304: 
9305: “Nay, I don’t know,” said Adam; “the squire’s ’cute enough but it takes
9306: something else besides ’cuteness to make folks see what’ll be their
9307: interest in the long run. It takes some conscience and belief in right
9308: and wrong, I see that pretty clear. You’d hardly ever bring round th’
9309: old squire to believe he’d gain as much in a straightfor’ard way as by
9310: tricks and turns. And, besides, I’ve not much mind to work under him: I
9311: don’t want to quarrel with any gentleman, more particular an old
9312: gentleman turned eighty, and I know we couldn’t agree long. If the
9313: captain was master o’ th’ estate, it ’ud be different: he’s got a
9314: conscience and a will to do right, and I’d sooner work for him nor for
9315: any man living.”
9316: 
9317: “Well, well, my boy, if good luck knocks at your door, don’t you put
9318: your head out at window and tell it to be gone about its business,
9319: that’s all. You must learn to deal with odd and even in life, as well
9320: as in figures. I tell you now, as I told you ten years ago, when you
9321: pommelled young Mike Holdsworth for wanting to pass a bad shilling
9322: before you knew whether he was in jest or earnest—you’re overhasty and
9323: proud, and apt to set your teeth against folks that don’t square to
9324: your notions. It’s no harm for me to be a bit fiery and
9325: stiff-backed—I’m an old schoolmaster, and shall never want to get on to
9326: a higher perch. But where’s the use of all the time I’ve spent in
9327: teaching you writing and mapping and mensuration, if you’re not to get
9328: for’ard in the world and show folks there’s some advantage in having a
9329: head on your shoulders, instead of a turnip? Do you mean to go on
9330: turning up your nose at every opportunity because it’s got a bit of a
9331: smell about it that nobody finds out but yourself? It’s as foolish as
9332: that notion o’ yours that a wife is to make a working-man comfortable.
9333: Stuff and nonsense! Stuff and nonsense! Leave that to fools that never
9334: got beyond a sum in simple addition. Simple addition enough! Add one
9335: fool to another fool, and in six years’ time six fools more—they’re all
9336: of the same denomination, big and little’s nothing to do with the sum!”
9337: 
9338: During this rather heated exhortation to coolness and discretion the
9339: pipe had gone out, and Bartle gave the climax to his speech by striking
9340: a light furiously, after which he puffed with fierce resolution, fixing
9341: his eye still on Adam, who was trying not to laugh.
9342: 
9343: “There’s a good deal o’ sense in what you say, Mr. Massey,” Adam began,
9344: as soon as he felt quite serious, “as there always is. But you’ll give
9345: in that it’s no business o’ mine to be building on chances that may
9346: never happen. What I’ve got to do is to work as well as I can with the
9347: tools and mater’als I’ve got in my hands. If a good chance comes to me,
9348: I’ll think o’ what you’ve been saying; but till then, I’ve got nothing
9349: to do but to trust to my own hands and my own head-piece. I’m turning
9350: over a little plan for Seth and me to go into the cabinet-making a bit
9351: by ourselves, and win a extra pound or two in that way. But it’s
9352: getting late now—it’ll be pretty near eleven before I’m at home, and
9353: Mother may happen to lie awake; she’s more fidgety nor usual now. So
9354: I’ll bid you good-night.”
9355: 
9356: “Well, well, we’ll go to the gate with you—it’s a fine night,” said
9357: Bartle, taking up his stick. Vixen was at once on her legs, and without
9358: further words the three walked out into the starlight, by the side of
9359: Bartle’s potato-beds, to the little gate.
9360: 
9361: “Come to the music o’ Friday night, if you can, my boy,” said the old
9362: man, as he closed the gate after Adam and leaned against it.
9363: 
9364: “Aye, aye,” said Adam, striding along towards the streak of pale road.
9365: He was the only object moving on the wide common. The two grey donkeys,
9366: just visible in front of the gorse bushes, stood as still as limestone
9367: images—as still as the grey-thatched roof of the mud cottage a little
9368: farther on. Bartle kept his eye on the moving figure till it passed
9369: into the darkness, while Vixen, in a state of divided affection, had
9370: twice run back to the house to bestow a parenthetic lick on her
9371: puppies.
9372: 
9373: “Aye, aye,” muttered the schoolmaster, as Adam disappeared, “there you
9374: go, stalking along—stalking along; but you wouldn’t have been what you
9375: are if you hadn’t had a bit of old lame Bartle inside you. The
9376: strongest calf must have something to suck at. There’s plenty of these
9377: big, lumbering fellows ’ud never have known their A B C if it hadn’t
9378: been for Bartle Massey. Well, well, Vixen, you foolish wench, what is
9379: it, what is it? I must go in, must I? Aye, aye, I’m never to have a
9380: will o’ my own any more. And those pups—what do you think I’m to do
9381: with ’em, when they’re twice as big as you? For I’m pretty sure the
9382: father was that hulking bull-terrier of Will Baker’s—wasn’t he now, eh,
9383: you sly hussy?”(Here Vixen tucked her tail between her legs and ran
9384: forward into the house. Subjects are sometimes broached which a
9385: well-bred female will ignore.)
9386: 
9387: “But where’s the use of talking to a woman with babbies?” continued
9388: Bartle. “She’s got no conscience—no conscience; it’s all run to milk.”

9398: Chapter XXII
9399: Going to the Birthday Feast
9400: 
9401: 
9402: The thirtieth of July was come, and it was one of those half-dozen warm
9403: days which sometimes occur in the middle of a rainy English summer. No
9404: rain had fallen for the last three or four days, and the weather was
9405: perfect for that time of the year: there was less dust than usual on
9406: the dark-green hedge-rows and on the wild camomile that starred the
9407: roadside, yet the grass was dry enough for the little children to roll
9408: on it, and there was no cloud but a long dash of light, downy ripple,
9409: high, high up in the far-off blue sky. Perfect weather for an outdoor
9410: July merry-making, yet surely not the best time of year to be born in.
9411: Nature seems to make a hot pause just then: all the loveliest flowers
9412: are gone; the sweet time of early growth and vague hopes is past; and
9413: yet the time of harvest and ingathering is not come, and we tremble at
9414: the possible storms that may ruin the precious fruit in the moment of
9415: its ripeness. The woods are all one dark monotonous green; the
9416: waggon-loads of hay no longer creep along the lanes, scattering their
9417: sweet-smelling fragments on the blackberry branches; the pastures are
9418: often a little tanned, yet the corn has not got its last splendour of
9419: red and gold; the lambs and calves have lost all traces of their
9420: innocent frisky prettiness, and have become stupid young sheep and
9421: cows. But it is a time of leisure on the farm—that pause between
9422: hay-and corn-harvest, and so the farmers and labourers in Hayslope and
9423: Broxton thought the captain did well to come of age just then, when
9424: they could give their undivided minds to the flavour of the great cask
9425: of ale which had been brewed the autumn after “the heir” was born, and
9426: was to be tapped on his twenty-first birthday. The air had been merry
9427: with the ringing of church-bells very early this morning, and every one
9428: had made haste to get through the needful work before twelve, when it
9429: would be time to think of getting ready to go to the Chase.
9430: 
9431: The midday sun was streaming into Hetty’s bedchamber, and there was no
9432: blind to temper the heat with which it fell on her head as she looked
9433: at herself in the old specked glass. Still, that was the only glass she
9434: had in which she could see her neck and arms, for the small hanging
9435: glass she had fetched out of the next room—the room that had been
9436: Dinah’s—would show her nothing below her little chin; and that
9437: beautiful bit of neck where the roundness of her cheek melted into
9438: another roundness shadowed by dark delicate curls. And to-day she
9439: thought more than usual about her neck and arms; for at the dance this
9440: evening she was not to wear any neckerchief, and she had been busy
9441: yesterday with her spotted pink-and-white frock, that she might make
9442: the sleeves either long or short at will. She was dressed now just as
9443: she was to be in the evening, with a tucker made of “real” lace, which
9444: her aunt had lent her for this unparalleled occasion, but with no
9445: ornaments besides; she had even taken out her small round ear-rings
9446: which she wore every day. But there was something more to be done,
9447: apparently, before she put on her neckerchief and long sleeves, which
9448: she was to wear in the day-time, for now she unlocked the drawer that
9449: held her private treasures. It is more than a month since we saw her
9450: unlock that drawer before, and now it holds new treasures, so much more
9451: precious than the old ones that these are thrust into the corner. Hetty
9452: would not care to put the large coloured glass ear-rings into her ears
9453: now; for see! she has got a beautiful pair of gold and pearls and
9454: garnet, lying snugly in a pretty little box lined with white satin. Oh,
9455: the delight of taking out that little box and looking at the ear-rings!
9456: Do not reason about it, my philosphical reader, and say that Hetty,
9457: being very pretty, must have known that it did not signify whether she
9458: had on any ornaments or not; and that, moreover, to look at ear-rings
9459: which she could not possibly wear out of her bedroom could hardly be a
9460: satisfaction, the essence of vanity being a reference to the
9461: impressions produced on others; you will never understand women’s
9462: natures if you are so excessively rational. Try rather to divest
9463: yourself of all your rational prejudices, as much as if you were
9464: studying the psychology of a canary bird, and only watch the movements
9465: of this pretty round creature as she turns her head on one side with an
9466: unconscious smile at the ear-rings nestled in the little box. Ah, you
9467: think, it is for the sake of the person who has given them to her, and
9468: her thoughts are gone back now to the moment when they were put into
9469: her hands. No; else why should she have cared to have ear-rings rather
9470: than anything else? And I know that she had longed for ear-rings from
9471: among all the ornaments she could imagine.
9472: 
9473: “Little, little ears!” Arthur had said, pretending to pinch them one
9474: evening, as Hetty sat beside him on the grass without her hat. “I wish
9475: I had some pretty ear-rings!” she said in a moment, almost before she
9476: knew what she was saying—the wish lay so close to her lips, it _would_
9477: flutter past them at the slightest breath. And the next day—it was only
9478: last week—Arthur had ridden over to Rosseter on purpose to buy them.
9479: That little wish so naively uttered seemed to him the prettiest bit of
9480: childishness; he had never heard anything like it before; and he had
9481: wrapped the box up in a great many covers, that he might see Hetty
9482: unwrapping it with growing curiosity, till at last her eyes flashed
9483: back their new delight into his.
9484: 
9485: No, she was not thinking most of the giver when she smiled at the
9486: ear-rings, for now she is taking them out of the box, not to press them
9487: to her lips, but to fasten them in her ears—only for one moment, to see
9488: how pretty they look, as she peeps at them in the glass against the
9489: wall, with first one position of the head and then another, like a
9490: listening bird. It is impossible to be wise on the subject of ear-rings
9491: as one looks at her; what should those delicate pearls and crystals be
9492: made for, if not for such ears? One cannot even find fault with the
9493: tiny round hole which they leave when they are taken out; perhaps
9494: water-nixies, and such lovely things without souls, have these little
9495: round holes in their ears by nature, ready to hang jewels in. And Hetty
9496: must be one of them: it is too painful to think that she is a woman,
9497: with a woman’s destiny before her—a woman spinning in young ignorance a
9498: light web of folly and vain hopes which may one day close round her and
9499: press upon her, a rancorous poisoned garment, changing all at once her
9500: fluttering, trivial butterfly sensations into a life of deep human
9501: anguish.
9502: 
9503: But she cannot keep in the ear-rings long, else she may make her uncle
9504: and aunt wait. She puts them quickly into the box again and shuts them
9505: up. Some day she will be able to wear any ear-rings she likes, and
9506: already she lives in an invisible world of brilliant costumes,
9507: shimmering gauze, soft satin, and velvet, such as the lady’s maid at
9508: the Chase has shown her in Miss Lydia’s wardrobe. She feels the
9509: bracelets on her arms, and treads on a soft carpet in front of a tall
9510: mirror. But she has one thing in the drawer which she can venture to
9511: wear to-day, because she can hang it on the chain of dark-brown berries
9512: which she has been used to wear on grand days, with a tiny flat
9513: scent-bottle at the end of it tucked inside her frock; and she _must_
9514: put on her brown berries—her neck would look so unfinished without it.
9515: Hetty was not quite as fond of the locket as of the ear-rings, though
9516: it was a handsome large locket, with enamelled flowers at the back and
9517: a beautiful gold border round the glass, which showed a light-brown
9518: slightly waving lock, forming a background for two little dark rings.
9519: She must keep it under her clothes, and no one would see it. But Hetty
9520: had another passion, only a little less strong than her love of finery,
9521: and that other passion made her like to wear the locket even hidden in
9522: her bosom. She would always have worn it, if she had dared to encounter
9523: her aunt’s questions about a ribbon round her neck. So now she slipped
9524: it on along her chain of dark-brown berries, and snapped the chain
9525: round her neck. It was not a very long chain, only allowing the locket
9526: to hang a little way below the edge of her frock. And now she had
9527: nothing to do but to put on her long sleeves, her new white gauze
9528: neckerchief, and her straw hat trimmed with white to-day instead of the
9529: pink, which had become rather faded under the July sun. That hat made
9530: the drop of bitterness in Hetty’s cup to-day, for it was not quite
9531: new—everybody would see that it was a little tanned against the white
9532: ribbon—and Mary Burge, she felt sure, would have a new hat or bonnet
9533: on. She looked for consolation at her fine white cotton stockings: they
9534: really were very nice indeed, and she had given almost all her spare
9535: money for them. Hetty’s dream of the future could not make her
9536: insensible to triumph in the present. To be sure, Captain Donnithorne
9537: loved her so that he would never care about looking at other people,
9538: but then those other people didn’t know how he loved her, and she was
9539: not satisfied to appear shabby and insignificant in their eyes even for
9540: a short space.
9541: 
9542: The whole party was assembled in the house-place when Hetty went down,
9543: all of course in their Sunday clothes; and the bells had been ringing
9544: so this morning in honour of the captain’s twenty-first birthday, and
9545: the work had all been got done so early, that Marty and Tommy were not
9546: quite easy in their minds until their mother had assured them that
9547: going to church was not part of the day’s festivities. Mr. Poyser had
9548: once suggested that the house should be shut up and left to take care
9549: of itself; “for,” said he, “there’s no danger of anybody’s breaking
9550: in—everybody’ll be at the Chase, thieves an’ all. If we lock th’ house
9551: up, all the men can go: it’s a day they wonna see twice i’ their
9552: lives.” But Mrs. Poyser answered with great decision: “I never left the
9553: house to take care of itself since I was a missis, and I never will.
9554: There’s been ill-looking tramps enoo’ about the place this last week,
9555: to carry off every ham an’ every spoon we’n got; and they all collogue
9556: together, them tramps, as it’s a mercy they hanna come and poisoned the
9557: dogs and murdered us all in our beds afore we knowed, some Friday night
9558: when we’n got the money in th’ house to pay the men. And it’s like
9559: enough the tramps know where we’re going as well as we do oursens; for
9560: if Old Harry wants any work done, you may be sure he’ll find the
9561: means.”
9562: 
9563: “Nonsense about murdering us in our beds,” said Mr. Poyser; “I’ve got a
9564: gun i’ our room, hanna I? and thee’st got ears as ’ud find it out if a
9565: mouse was gnawing the bacon. Howiver, if thee wouldstna be easy, Alick
9566: can stay at home i’ the forepart o’ the day, and Tim can come back
9567: tow’rds five o’clock, and let Alick have his turn. They may let Growler
9568: loose if anybody offers to do mischief, and there’s Alick’s dog too,
9569: ready enough to set his tooth in a tramp if Alick gives him a wink.”
9570: 
9571: Mrs. Poyser accepted this compromise, but thought it advisable to bar
9572: and bolt to the utmost; and now, at the last moment before starting,
9573: Nancy, the dairy-maid, was closing the shutters of the house-place,
9574: although the window, lying under the immediate observation of Alick and
9575: the dogs, might have been supposed the least likely to be selected for
9576: a burglarious attempt.
9577: 
9578: The covered cart, without springs, was standing ready to carry the
9579: whole family except the men-servants. Mr. Poyser and the grandfather
9580: sat on the seat in front, and within there was room for all the women
9581: and children; the fuller the cart the better, because then the jolting
9582: would not hurt so much, and Nancy’s broad person and thick arms were an
9583: excellent cushion to be pitched on. But Mr. Poyser drove at no more
9584: than a walking pace, that there might be as little risk of jolting as
9585: possible on this warm day, and there was time to exchange greetings and
9586: remarks with the foot-passengers who were going the same way, specking
9587: the paths between the green meadows and the golden cornfields with bits
9588: of movable bright colour—a scarlet waistcoat to match the poppies that
9589: nodded a little too thickly among the corn, or a dark-blue neckerchief
9590: with ends flaunting across a brand-new white smock-frock. All Broxton
9591: and all Hayslope were to be at the Chase, and make merry there in
9592: honour of “th’ heir”; and the old men and women, who had never been so
9593: far down this side of the hill for the last twenty years, were being
9594: brought from Broxton and Hayslope in one of the farmer’s waggons, at
9595: Mr. Irwine’s suggestion. The church-bells had struck up again now—a
9596: last tune, before the ringers came down the hill to have their share in
9597: the festival; and before the bells had finished, other music was heard
9598: approaching, so that even Old Brown, the sober horse that was drawing
9599: Mr. Poyser’s cart, began to prick up his ears. It was the band of the
9600: Benefit Club, which had mustered in all its glory—that is to say, in
9601: bright-blue scarfs and blue favours, and carrying its banner with the
9602: motto, “Let brotherly love continue,” encircling a picture of a
9603: stone-pit.
9604: 
9605: The carts, of course, were not to enter the Chase. Every one must get
9606: down at the lodges, and the vehicles must be sent back.
9607: 
9608: “Why, the Chase is like a fair a’ready,” said Mrs. Poyser, as she got
9609: down from the cart, and saw the groups scattered under the great oaks,
9610: and the boys running about in the hot sunshine to survey the tall poles
9611: surmounted by the fluttering garments that were to be the prize of the
9612: successful climbers. “I should ha’ thought there wasna so many people
9613: i’ the two parishes. Mercy on us! How hot it is out o’ the shade! Come
9614: here, Totty, else your little face ’ull be burnt to a scratchin’! They
9615: might ha’ cooked the dinners i’ that open space an’ saved the fires. I
9616: shall go to Mrs. Best’s room an’ sit down.”
9617: 
9618: “Stop a bit, stop a bit,” said Mr. Poyser. “There’s th’ waggin coming
9619: wi’ th’ old folks in’t; it’ll be such a sight as wonna come o’er again,
9620: to see ’em get down an’ walk along all together. You remember some on
9621: ’em i’ their prime, eh, Father?”
9622: 
9623: “Aye, aye,” said old Martin, walking slowly under the shade of the
9624: lodge porch, from which he could see the aged party descend. “I
9625: remember Jacob Taft walking fifty mile after the Scotch raybels, when
9626: they turned back from Stoniton.”
9627: 
9628: He felt himself quite a youngster, with a long life before him, as he
9629: saw the Hayslope patriarch, old Feyther Taft, descend from the waggon
9630: and walk towards him, in his brown nightcap, and leaning on his two
9631: sticks.
9632: 
9633: “Well, Mester Taft,” shouted old Martin, at the utmost stretch of his
9634: voice—for though he knew the old man was stone deaf, he could not omit
9635: the propriety of a greeting—“you’re hearty yet. You can enjoy yoursen
9636: to-day, for-all you’re ninety an’ better.”
9637: 
9638: “Your sarvant, mesters, your sarvant,” said Feyther Taft in a treble
9639: tone, perceiving that he was in company.
9640: 
9641: The aged group, under care of sons or daughters, themselves worn and
9642: grey, passed on along the least-winding carriage-road towards the
9643: house, where a special table was prepared for them; while the Poyser
9644: party wisely struck across the grass under the shade of the great
9645: trees, but not out of view of the house-front, with its sloping lawn
9646: and flower-beds, or of the pretty striped marquee at the edge of the
9647: lawn, standing at right angles with two larger marquees on each side of
9648: the open green space where the games were to be played. The house would
9649: have been nothing but a plain square mansion of Queen Anne’s time, but
9650: for the remnant of an old abbey to which it was united at one end, in
9651: much the same way as one may sometimes see a new farmhouse rising high
9652: and prim at the end of older and lower farm-offices. The fine old
9653: remnant stood a little backward and under the shadow of tall beeches,
9654: but the sun was now on the taller and more advanced front, the blinds
9655: were all down, and the house seemed asleep in the hot midday. It made
9656: Hetty quite sad to look at it: Arthur must be somewhere in the back
9657: rooms, with the grand company, where he could not possibly know that
9658: she was come, and she should not see him for a long, long while—not
9659: till after dinner, when they said he was to come up and make a speech.
9660: 
9661: But Hetty was wrong in part of her conjecture. No grand company was
9662: come except the Irwines, for whom the carriage had been sent early, and
9663: Arthur was at that moment not in a back room, but walking with the
9664: rector into the broad stone cloisters of the old abbey, where the long
9665: tables were laid for all the cottage tenants and the farm-servants. A
9666: very handsome young Briton he looked to-day, in high spirits and a
9667: bright-blue frock-coat, the highest mode—his arm no longer in a sling.
9668: So open-looking and candid, too; but candid people have their secrets,
9669: and secrets leave no lines in young faces.
9670: 
9671: “Upon my word,” he said, as they entered the cool cloisters, “I think
9672: the cottagers have the best of it: these cloisters make a delightful
9673: dining-room on a hot day. That was capital advice of yours, Irwine,
9674: about the dinners—to let them be as orderly and comfortable as
9675: possible, and only for the tenants: especially as I had only a limited
9676: sum after all; for though my grandfather talked of a _carte blanche_,
9677: he couldn’t make up his mind to trust me, when it came to the point.”
9678: 
9679: “Never mind, you’ll give more pleasure in this quiet way,” said Mr.
9680: Irwine. “In this sort of thing people are constantly confounding
9681: liberality with riot and disorder. It sounds very grand to say that so
9682: many sheep and oxen were roasted whole, and everybody ate who liked to
9683: come; but in the end it generally happens that no one has had an
9684: enjoyable meal. If the people get a good dinner and a moderate quantity
9685: of ale in the middle of the day, they’ll be able to enjoy the games as
9686: the day cools. You can’t hinder some of them from getting too much
9687: towards evening, but drunkenness and darkness go better together than
9688: drunkenness and daylight.”
9689: 
9690: “Well, I hope there won’t be much of it. I’ve kept the Treddleston
9691: people away by having a feast for them in the town; and I’ve got Casson
9692: and Adam Bede and some other good fellows to look to the giving out of
9693: ale in the booths, and to take care things don’t go too far. Come, let
9694: us go up above now and see the dinner-tables for the large tenants.”
9695: 
9696: They went up the stone staircase leading simply to the long gallery
9697: above the cloisters, a gallery where all the dusty worthless old
9698: pictures had been banished for the last three generations—mouldy
9699: portraits of Queen Elizabeth and her ladies, General Monk with his eye
9700: knocked out, Daniel very much in the dark among the lions, and Julius
9701: Cæsar on horseback, with a high nose and laurel crown, holding his
9702: Commentaries in his hand.
9703: 
9704: “What a capital thing it is that they saved this piece of the old
9705: abbey!” said Arthur. “If I’m ever master here, I shall do up the
9706: gallery in first-rate style. We’ve got no room in the house a third as
9707: large as this. That second table is for the farmers’ wives and
9708: children: Mrs. Best said it would be more comfortable for the mothers
9709: and children to be by themselves. I was determined to have the
9710: children, and make a regular family thing of it. I shall be ‘the old
9711: squire’ to those little lads and lasses some day, and they’ll tell
9712: their children what a much finer young fellow I was than my own son.
9713: There’s a table for the women and children below as well. But you will
9714: see them all—you will come up with me after dinner, I hope?”
9715: 
9716: “Yes, to be sure,” said Mr. Irwine. “I wouldn’t miss your maiden speech
9717: to the tenantry.”
9718: 
9719: “And there will be something else you’ll like to hear,” said Arthur.
9720: “Let us go into the library and I’ll tell you all about it while my
9721: grandfather is in the drawing-room with the ladies. Something that will
9722: surprise you,” he continued, as they sat down. “My grandfather has come
9723: round after all.”
9724: 
9725: “What, about Adam?”
9726: 
9727: “Yes; I should have ridden over to tell you about it, only I was so
9728: busy. You know I told you I had quite given up arguing the matter with
9729: him—I thought it was hopeless—but yesterday morning he asked me to come
9730: in here to him before I went out, and astonished me by saying that he
9731: had decided on all the new arrangements he should make in consequence
9732: of old Satchell being obliged to lay by work, and that he intended to
9733: employ Adam in superintending the woods at a salary of a guinea a-week,
9734: and the use of a pony to be kept here. I believe the secret of it is,
9735: he saw from the first it would be a profitable plan, but he had some
9736: particular dislike of Adam to get over—and besides, the fact that I
9737: propose a thing is generally a reason with him for rejecting it.
9738: There’s the most curious contradiction in my grandfather: I know he
9739: means to leave me all the money he has saved, and he is likely enough
9740: to have cut off poor Aunt Lydia, who has been a slave to him all her
9741: life, with only five hundred a-year, for the sake of giving me all the
9742: more; and yet I sometimes think he positively hates me because I’m his
9743: heir. I believe if I were to break my neck, he would feel it the
9744: greatest misfortune that could befall him, and yet it seems a pleasure
9745: to him to make my life a series of petty annoyances.”
9746: 
9747: “Ah, my boy, it is not only woman’s love that is ἀπέρωτος ἒρως as old
9748: Æschylus calls it. There’s plenty of ‘unloving love’ in the world of a
9749: masculine kind. But tell me about Adam. Has he accepted the post? I
9750: don’t see that it can be much more profitable than his present work,
9751: though, to be sure, it will leave him a good deal of time on his own
9752: hands.
9753: 
9754: “Well, I felt some doubt about it when I spoke to him and he seemed to
9755: hesitate at first. His objection was that he thought he should not be
9756: able to satisfy my grandfather. But I begged him as a personal favour
9757: to me not to let any reason prevent him from accepting the place, if he
9758: really liked the employment and would not be giving up anything that
9759: was more profitable to him. And he assured me he should like it of all
9760: things—it would be a great step forward for him in business, and it
9761: would enable him to do what he had long wished to do, to give up
9762: working for Burge. He says he shall have plenty of time to superintend
9763: a little business of his own, which he and Seth will carry on, and will
9764: perhaps be able to enlarge by degrees. So he has agreed at last, and I
9765: have arranged that he shall dine with the large tenants to-day; and I
9766: mean to announce the appointment to them, and ask them to drink Adam’s
9767: health. It’s a little drama I’ve got up in honour of my friend Adam.
9768: He’s a fine fellow, and I like the opportunity of letting people know
9769: that I think so.”
9770: 
9771: “A drama in which friend Arthur piques himself on having a pretty part
9772: to play,” said Mr. Irwine, smiling. But when he saw Arthur colour, he
9773: went on relentingly, “My part, you know, is always that of the old fogy
9774: who sees nothing to admire in the young folks. I don’t like to admit
9775: that I’m proud of my pupil when he does graceful things. But I must
9776: play the amiable old gentleman for once, and second your toast in
9777: honour of Adam. Has your grandfather yielded on the other point too,
9778: and agreed to have a respectable man as steward?”
9779: 
9780: “Oh no,” said Arthur, rising from his chair with an air of impatience
9781: and walking along the room with his hands in his pockets. “He’s got
9782: some project or other about letting the Chase Farm and bargaining for a
9783: supply of milk and butter for the house. But I ask no questions about
9784: it—it makes me too angry. I believe he means to do all the business
9785: himself, and have nothing in the shape of a steward. It’s amazing what
9786: energy he has, though.”
9787: 
9788: “Well, we’ll go to the ladies now,” said Mr. Irwine, rising too. “I
9789: want to tell my mother what a splendid throne you’ve prepared for her
9790: under the marquee.”
9791: 
9792: “Yes, and we must be going to luncheon too,” said Arthur. “It must be
9793: two o’clock, for there is the gong beginning to sound for the tenants’
9794: dinners.”

9799: Chapter XXIII
9800: Dinner-Time
9801: 
9802: 
9803: When Adam heard that he was to dine upstairs with the large tenants, he
9804: felt rather uncomfortable at the idea of being exalted in this way
9805: above his mother and Seth, who were to dine in the cloisters below. But
9806: Mr. Mills, the butler, assured him that Captain Donnithorne had given
9807: particular orders about it, and would be very angry if Adam was not
9808: there.
9809: 
9810: Adam nodded and went up to Seth, who was standing a few yards off.
9811: “Seth, lad,” he said, “the captain has sent to say I’m to dine
9812: upstairs—he wishes it particular, Mr. Mills says, so I suppose it ’ud
9813: be behaving ill for me not to go. But I don’t like sitting up above
9814: thee and mother, as if I was better than my own flesh and blood. Thee’t
9815: not take it unkind, I hope?”
9816: 
9817: “Nay, nay, lad,” said Seth, “thy honour’s our honour; and if thee
9818: get’st respect, thee’st won it by thy own deserts. The further I see
9819: thee above me, the better, so long as thee feel’st like a brother to
9820: me. It’s because o’ thy being appointed over the woods, and it’s
9821: nothing but what’s right. That’s a place o’ trust, and thee’t above a
9822: common workman now.”
9823: 
9824: “Aye,” said Adam, “but nobody knows a word about it yet. I haven’t
9825: given notice to Mr. Burge about leaving him, and I don’t like to tell
9826: anybody else about it before he knows, for he’ll be a good bit hurt, I
9827: doubt. People ’ull be wondering to see me there, and they’ll like
9828: enough be guessing the reason and asking questions, for there’s been so
9829: much talk up and down about my having the place, this last three
9830: weeks.”
9831: 
9832: “Well, thee canst say thee wast ordered to come without being told the
9833: reason. That’s the truth. And mother ’ull be fine and joyful about it.
9834: Let’s go and tell her.”
9835: 
9836: Adam was not the only guest invited to come upstairs on other grounds
9837: than the amount he contributed to the rent-roll. There were other
9838: people in the two parishes who derived dignity from their functions
9839: rather than from their pocket, and of these Bartle Massey was one. His
9840: lame walk was rather slower than usual on this warm day, so Adam
9841: lingered behind when the bell rang for dinner, that he might walk up
9842: with his old friend; for he was a little too shy to join the Poyser
9843: party on this public occasion. Opportunities of getting to Hetty’s side
9844: would be sure to turn up in the course of the day, and Adam contented
9845: himself with that for he disliked any risk of being “joked” about
9846: Hetty—the big, outspoken, fearless man was very shy and diffident as to
9847: his love-making.
9848: 
9849: “Well, Mester Massey,” said Adam, as Bartle came up “I’m going to dine
9850: upstairs with you to-day: the captain’s sent me orders.”
9851: 
9852: “Ah!” said Bartle, pausing, with one hand on his back. “Then there’s
9853: something in the wind—there’s something in the wind. Have you heard
9854: anything about what the old squire means to do?”
9855: 
9856: “Why, yes,” said Adam; “I’ll tell you what I know, because I believe
9857: you can keep a still tongue in your head if you like, and I hope you’ll
9858: not let drop a word till it’s common talk, for I’ve particular reasons
9859: against its being known.”
9860: 
9861: “Trust to me, my boy, trust to me. I’ve got no wife to worm it out of
9862: me and then run out and cackle it in everybody’s hearing. If you trust
9863: a man, let him be a bachelor—let him be a bachelor.”
9864: 
9865: “Well, then, it was so far settled yesterday that I’m to take the
9866: management o’ the woods. The captain sent for me t’ offer it me, when I
9867: was seeing to the poles and things here and I’ve agreed to’t. But if
9868: anybody asks any questions upstairs, just you take no notice, and turn
9869: the talk to something else, and I’ll be obliged to you. Now, let us go
9870: on, for we’re pretty nigh the last, I think.”
9871: 
9872: “I know what to do, never fear,” said Bartle, moving on. “The news will
9873: be good sauce to my dinner. Aye, aye, my boy, you’ll get on. I’ll back
9874: you for an eye at measuring and a head-piece for figures, against any
9875: man in this county and you’ve had good teaching—you’ve had good
9876: teaching.”
9877: 
9878: When they got upstairs, the question which Arthur had left unsettled,
9879: as to who was to be president, and who vice, was still under
9880: discussion, so that Adam’s entrance passed without remark.
9881: 
9882: “It stands to sense,” Mr. Casson was saying, “as old Mr. Poyser, as is
9883: th’ oldest man i’ the room, should sit at top o’ the table. I wasn’t
9884: butler fifteen year without learning the rights and the wrongs about
9885: dinner.”
9886: 
9887: “Nay, nay,” said old Martin, “I’n gi’en up to my son; I’m no tenant
9888: now: let my son take my place. Th’ ould foulks ha’ had their turn: they
9889: mun make way for the young uns.”
9890: 
9891: “I should ha’ thought the biggest tenant had the best right, more nor
9892: th’ oldest,” said Luke Britton, who was not fond of the critical Mr.
9893: Poyser; “there’s Mester Holdsworth has more land nor anybody else on
9894: th’ estate.”
9895: 
9896: “Well,” said Mr. Poyser, “suppose we say the man wi’ the foulest land
9897: shall sit at top; then whoever gets th’ honour, there’ll be no envying
9898: on him.”
9899: 
9900: “Eh, here’s Mester Massey,” said Mr. Craig, who, being a neutral in the
9901: dispute, had no interest but in conciliation; “the schoolmaster ought
9902: to be able to tell you what’s right. Who’s to sit at top o’ the table,
9903: Mr. Massey?”
9904: 
9905: “Why, the broadest man,” said Bartle; “and then he won’t take up other
9906: folks’ room; and the next broadest must sit at bottom.”
9907: 
9908: This happy mode of settling the dispute produced much laughter—a
9909: smaller joke would have sufficed for that. Mr. Casson, however, did not
9910: feel it compatible with his dignity and superior knowledge to join in
9911: the laugh, until it turned out that he was fixed on as the second
9912: broadest man. Martin Poyser the younger, as the broadest, was to be
9913: president, and Mr. Casson, as next broadest, was to be vice.
9914: 
9915: Owing to this arrangement, Adam, being, of course, at the bottom of the
9916: table, fell under the immediate observation of Mr. Casson, who, too
9917: much occupied with the question of precedence, had not hitherto noticed
9918: his entrance. Mr. Casson, we have seen, considered Adam “rather lifted
9919: up and peppery-like”: he thought the gentry made more fuss about this
9920: young carpenter than was necessary; they made no fuss about Mr. Casson,
9921: although he had been an excellent butler for fifteen years.
9922: 
9923: “Well, Mr. Bede, you’re one o’ them as mounts hup’ards apace,” he said,
9924: when Adam sat down. “You’ve niver dined here before, as I remember.”
9925: 
9926: “No, Mr. Casson,” said Adam, in his strong voice, that could be heard
9927: along the table; “I’ve never dined here before, but I come by Captain
9928: Donnithorne’s wish, and I hope it’s not disagreeable to anybody here.”
9929: 
9930: “Nay, nay,” said several voices at once, “we’re glad ye’re come. Who’s
9931: got anything to say again’ it?”
9932: 
9933: “And ye’ll sing us ‘Over the hills and far away,’ after dinner, wonna
9934: ye?” said Mr. Chowne. “That’s a song I’m uncommon fond on.”
9935: 
9936: “Peeh!” said Mr. Craig; “it’s not to be named by side o’ the Scotch
9937: tunes. I’ve never cared about singing myself; I’ve had something better
9938: to do. A man that’s got the names and the natur o’ plants in’s head
9939: isna likely to keep a hollow place t’ hold tunes in. But a second
9940: cousin o’ mine, a drovier, was a rare hand at remembering the Scotch
9941: tunes. He’d got nothing else to think on.”
9942: 
9943: “The Scotch tunes!” said Bartle Massey, contemptuously; “I’ve heard
9944: enough o’ the Scotch tunes to last me while I live. They’re fit for
9945: nothing but to frighten the birds with—that’s to say, the English
9946: birds, for the Scotch birds may sing Scotch for what I know. Give the
9947: lads a bagpipe instead of a rattle, and I’ll answer for it the corn ’ll
9948: be safe.”
9949: 
9950: “Yes, there’s folks as find a pleasure in undervallying what they know
9951: but little about,” said Mr. Craig.
9952: 
9953: “Why, the Scotch tunes are just like a scolding, nagging woman,” Bartle
9954: went on, without deigning to notice Mr. Craig’s remark. “They go on
9955: with the same thing over and over again, and never come to a reasonable
9956: end. Anybody ’ud think the Scotch tunes had always been asking a
9957: question of somebody as deaf as old Taft, and had never got an answer
9958: yet.”
9959: 
9960: Adam minded the less about sitting by Mr. Casson, because this position
9961: enabled him to see Hetty, who was not far off him at the next table.
9962: Hetty, however, had not even noticed his presence yet, for she was
9963: giving angry attention to Totty, who insisted on drawing up her feet on
9964: to the bench in antique fashion, and thereby threatened to make dusty
9965: marks on Hetty’s pink-and-white frock. No sooner were the little fat
9966: legs pushed down than up they came again, for Totty’s eyes were too
9967: busy in staring at the large dishes to see where the plum pudding was
9968: for her to retain any consciousness of her legs. Hetty got quite out of
9969: patience, and at last, with a frown and pout, and gathering tears, she
9970: said, “Oh dear, Aunt, I wish you’d speak to Totty; she keeps putting
9971: her legs up so, and messing my frock.”
9972: 
9973: “What’s the matter wi’ the child? She can niver please you,” said the
9974: mother. “Let her come by the side o’ me, then. _I_ can put up wi’ her.”
9975: 
9976: Adam was looking at Hetty, and saw the frown, and pout, and the dark
9977: eyes seeming to grow larger with pettish half-gathered tears. Quiet
9978: Mary Burge, who sat near enough to see that Hetty was cross and that
9979: Adam’s eyes were fixed on her, thought that so sensible a man as Adam
9980: must be reflecting on the small value of beauty in a woman whose temper
9981: was bad. Mary was a good girl, not given to indulge in evil feelings,
9982: but she said to herself, that, since Hetty had a bad temper, it was
9983: better Adam should know it. And it was quite true that if Hetty had
9984: been plain, she would have looked very ugly and unamiable at that
9985: moment, and no one’s moral judgment upon her would have been in the
9986: least beguiled. But really there was something quite charming in her
9987: pettishness: it looked so much more like innocent distress than ill
9988: humour; and the severe Adam felt no movement of disapprobation; he only
9989: felt a sort of amused pity, as if he had seen a kitten setting up its
9990: back, or a little bird with its feathers ruffled. He could not gather
9991: what was vexing her, but it was impossible to him to feel otherwise
9992: than that she was the prettiest thing in the world, and that if he
9993: could have his way, nothing should ever vex her any more. And
9994: presently, when Totty was gone, she caught his eye, and her face broke
9995: into one of its brightest smiles, as she nodded to him. It was a bit of
9996: flirtation—she knew Mary Burge was looking at them. But the smile was
9997: like wine to Adam.
9998:

10002: Chapter XXIV
10003: The Health-Drinking
10004: 
10005: 
10006: When the dinner was over, and the first draughts from the great cask of
10007: birthday ale were brought up, room was made for the broad Mr. Poyser at
10008: the side of the table, and two chairs were placed at the head. It had
10009: been settled very definitely what Mr. Poyser was to do when the young
10010: squire should appear, and for the last five minutes he had been in a
10011: state of abstraction, with his eyes fixed on the dark picture opposite,
10012: and his hands busy with the loose cash and other articles in his
10013: breeches pockets.
10014: 
10015: When the young squire entered, with Mr. Irwine by his side, every one
10016: stood up, and this moment of homage was very agreeable to Arthur. He
10017: liked to feel his own importance, and besides that, he cared a great
10018: deal for the good-will of these people: he was fond of thinking that
10019: they had a hearty, special regard for him. The pleasure he felt was in
10020: his face as he said, “My grandfather and I hope all our friends here
10021: have enjoyed their dinner, and find my birthday ale good. Mr. Irwine
10022: and I are come to taste it with you, and I am sure we shall all like
10023: anything the better that the rector shares with us.”
10024: 
10025: All eyes were now turned on Mr. Poyser, who, with his hands still busy
10026: in his pockets, began with the deliberateness of a slow-striking clock.
10027: “Captain, my neighbours have put it upo’ me to speak for ’em to-day,
10028: for where folks think pretty much alike, one spokesman’s as good as a
10029: score. And though we’ve mayhappen got contrairy ways o’ thinking about
10030: a many things—one man lays down his land one way an’ another
10031: another—an’ I’ll not take it upon me to speak to no man’s farming, but
10032: my own—this I’ll say, as we’re all o’ one mind about our young squire.
10033: We’ve pretty nigh all on us known you when you war a little un, an’
10034: we’ve niver known anything on you but what was good an’ honorable. You
10035: speak fair an’ y’ act fair, an’ we’re joyful when we look forrard to
10036: your being our landlord, for we ’lieve you mean to do right by
10037: everybody, an’ ’ull make no man’s bread bitter to him if you can help
10038: it. That’s what I mean, an’ that’s what we all mean; and when a man’s
10039: said what he means, he’d better stop, for th’ ale ’ull be none the
10040: better for stannin’. An’ I’ll not say how we like th’ ale yet, for we
10041: couldna well taste it till we’d drunk your health in it; but the dinner
10042: was good, an’ if there’s anybody hasna enjoyed it, it must be the fault
10043: of his own inside. An’ as for the rector’s company, it’s well known as
10044: that’s welcome t’ all the parish wherever he may be; an’ I hope, an’ we
10045: all hope, as he’ll live to see us old folks, an’ our children grown to
10046: men an’ women an’ Your Honour a family man. I’ve no more to say as
10047: concerns the present time, an’ so we’ll drink our young squire’s
10048: health—three times three.”
10049: 
10050: Hereupon a glorious shouting, a rapping, a jingling, a clattering, and
10051: a shouting, with plentiful _da capo_, pleasanter than a strain of
10052: sublimest music in the ears that receive such a tribute for the first
10053: time. Arthur had felt a twinge of conscience during Mr. Poyser’s
10054: speech, but it was too feeble to nullify the pleasure he felt in being
10055: praised. Did he not deserve what was said of him on the whole? If there
10056: was something in his conduct that Poyser wouldn’t have liked if he had
10057: known it, why, no man’s conduct will bear too close an inspection; and
10058: Poyser was not likely to know it; and, after all, what had he done?
10059: Gone a little too far, perhaps, in flirtation, but another man in his
10060: place would have acted much worse; and no harm would come—no harm
10061: _should_ come, for the next time he was alone with Hetty, he would
10062: explain to her that she must not think seriously of him or of what had
10063: passed. It was necessary to Arthur, you perceive, to be satisfied with
10064: himself. Uncomfortable thoughts must be got rid of by good intentions
10065: for the future, which can be formed so rapidly that he had time to be
10066: uncomfortable and to become easy again before Mr. Poyser’s slow speech
10067: was finished, and when it was time for him to speak he was quite
10068: light-hearted.
10069: 
10070: “I thank you all, my good friends and neighbours,” Arthur said, “for
10071: the good opinion of me, and the kind feelings towards me which Mr.
10072: Poyser has been expressing on your behalf and on his own, and it will
10073: always be my heartiest wish to deserve them. In the course of things we
10074: may expect that, if I live, I shall one day or other be your landlord;
10075: indeed, it is on the ground of that expectation that my grandfather has
10076: wished me to celebrate this day and to come among you now; and I look
10077: forward to this position, not merely as one of power and pleasure for
10078: myself, but as a means of benefiting my neighbours. It hardly becomes
10079: so young a man as I am to talk much about farming to you, who are most
10080: of you so much older, and are men of experience; still, I have
10081: interested myself a good deal in such matters, and learned as much
10082: about them as my opportunities have allowed; and when the course of
10083: events shall place the estate in my hands, it will be my first desire
10084: to afford my tenants all the encouragement a landlord can give them, in
10085: improving their land and trying to bring about a better practice of
10086: husbandry. It will be my wish to be looked on by all my deserving
10087: tenants as their best friend, and nothing would make me so happy as to
10088: be able to respect every man on the estate, and to be respected by him
10089: in return. It is not my place at present to enter into particulars; I
10090: only meet your good hopes concerning me by telling you that my own
10091: hopes correspond to them—that what you expect from me I desire to
10092: fulfil; and I am quite of Mr. Poyser’s opinion, that when a man has
10093: said what he means, he had better stop. But the pleasure I feel in
10094: having my own health drunk by you would not be perfect if we did not
10095: drink the health of my grandfather, who has filled the place of both
10096: parents to me. I will say no more, until you have joined me in drinking
10097: his health on a day when he has wished me to appear among you as the
10098: future representative of his name and family.”
10099: 
10100: Perhaps there was no one present except Mr. Irwine who thoroughly
10101: understood and approved Arthur’s graceful mode of proposing his
10102: grandfather’s health. The farmers thought the young squire knew well
10103: enough that they hated the old squire, and Mrs. Poyser said, “he’d
10104: better not ha’ stirred a kettle o’ sour broth.” The bucolic mind does
10105: not readily apprehend the refinements of good taste. But the toast
10106: could not be rejected and when it had been drunk, Arthur said, “I thank
10107: you, both for my grandfather and myself; and now there is one more
10108: thing I wish to tell you, that you may share my pleasure about it, as I
10109: hope and believe you will. I think there can be no man here who has not
10110: a respect, and some of you, I am sure, have a very high regard, for my
10111: friend Adam Bede. It is well known to every one in this neighbourhood
10112: that there is no man whose word can be more depended on than his; that
10113: whatever he undertakes to do, he does well, and is as careful for the
10114: interests of those who employ him as for his own. I’m proud to say that
10115: I was very fond of Adam when I was a little boy, and I have never lost
10116: my old feeling for him—I think that shows that I know a good fellow
10117: when I find him. It has long been my wish that he should have the
10118: management of the woods on the estate, which happen to be very
10119: valuable, not only because I think so highly of his character, but
10120: because he has the knowledge and the skill which fit him for the place.
10121: And I am happy to tell you that it is my grandfather’s wish too, and it
10122: is now settled that Adam shall manage the woods—a change which I am
10123: sure will be very much for the advantage of the estate; and I hope you
10124: will by and by join me in drinking his health, and in wishing him all
10125: the prosperity in life that he deserves. But there is a still older
10126: friend of mine than Adam Bede present, and I need not tell you that it
10127: is Mr. Irwine. I’m sure you will agree with me that we must drink no
10128: other person’s health until we have drunk his. I know you have all
10129: reason to love him, but no one of his parishioners has so much reason
10130: as I. Come, charge your glasses, and let us drink to our excellent
10131: rector—three times three!”
10132: 
10133: This toast was drunk with all the enthusiasm that was wanting to the
10134: last, and it certainly was the most picturesque moment in the scene
10135: when Mr. Irwine got up to speak, and all the faces in the room were
10136: turned towards him. The superior refinement of his face was much more
10137: striking than that of Arthur’s when seen in comparison with the people
10138: round them. Arthur’s was a much commoner British face, and the
10139: splendour of his new-fashioned clothes was more akin to the young
10140: farmer’s taste in costume than Mr. Irwine’s powder and the well-brushed
10141: but well-worn black, which seemed to be his chosen suit for great
10142: occasions; for he had the mysterious secret of never wearing a
10143: new-looking coat.
10144: 
10145: “This is not the first time, by a great many,” he said, “that I have
10146: had to thank my parishioners for giving me tokens of their goodwill,
10147: but neighbourly kindness is among those things that are the more
10148: precious the older they get. Indeed, our pleasant meeting to-day is a
10149: proof that when what is good comes of age and is likely to live, there
10150: is reason for rejoicing, and the relation between us as clergyman and
10151: parishioners came of age two years ago, for it is three-and-twenty
10152: years since I first came among you, and I see some tall fine-looking
10153: young men here, as well as some blooming young women, that were far
10154: from looking as pleasantly at me when I christened them as I am happy
10155: to see them looking now. But I’m sure you will not wonder when I say
10156: that among all those young men, the one in whom I have the strongest
10157: interest is my friend Mr. Arthur Donnithorne, for whom you have just
10158: expressed your regard. I had the pleasure of being his tutor for
10159: several years, and have naturally had opportunities of knowing him
10160: intimately which cannot have occurred to any one else who is present;
10161: and I have some pride as well as pleasure in assuring you that I share
10162: your high hopes concerning him, and your confidence in his possession
10163: of those qualities which will make him an excellent landlord when the
10164: time shall come for him to take that important position among you. We
10165: feel alike on most matters on which a man who is getting towards fifty
10166: can feel in common with a young man of one-and-twenty, and he has just
10167: been expressing a feeling which I share very heartily, and I would not
10168: willingly omit the opportunity of saying so. That feeling is his value
10169: and respect for Adam Bede. People in a high station are of course more
10170: thought of and talked about and have their virtues more praised, than
10171: those whose lives are passed in humble everyday work; but every
10172: sensible man knows how necessary that humble everyday work is, and how
10173: important it is to us that it should be done well. And I agree with my
10174: friend Mr. Arthur Donnithorne in feeling that when a man whose duty
10175: lies in that sort of work shows a character which would make him an
10176: example in any station, his merit should be acknowledged. He is one of
10177: those to whom honour is due, and his friends should delight to honour
10178: him. I know Adam Bede well—I know what he is as a workman, and what he
10179: has been as a son and brother—and I am saying the simplest truth when I
10180: say that I respect him as much as I respect any man living. But I am
10181: not speaking to you about a stranger; some of you are his intimate
10182: friends, and I believe there is not one here who does not know enough
10183: of him to join heartily in drinking his health.”
10184: 
10185: As Mr. Irwine paused, Arthur jumped up and, filling his glass, said, “A
10186: bumper to Adam Bede, and may he live to have sons as faithful and
10187: clever as himself!”
10188: 
10189: No hearer, not even Bartle Massey, was so delighted with this toast as
10190: Mr. Poyser. “Tough work” as his first speech had been, he would have
10191: started up to make another if he had not known the extreme irregularity
10192: of such a course. As it was, he found an outlet for his feeling in
10193: drinking his ale unusually fast, and setting down his glass with a
10194: swing of his arm and a determined rap. If Jonathan Burge and a few
10195: others felt less comfortable on the occasion, they tried their best to
10196: look contented, and so the toast was drunk with a goodwill apparently
10197: unanimous.
10198: 
10199: Adam was rather paler than usual when he got up to thank his friends.
10200: He was a good deal moved by this public tribute—very naturally, for he
10201: was in the presence of all his little world, and it was uniting to do
10202: him honour. But he felt no shyness about speaking, not being troubled
10203: with small vanity or lack of words; he looked neither awkward nor
10204: embarrassed, but stood in his usual firm upright attitude, with his
10205: head thrown a little backward and his hands perfectly still, in that
10206: rough dignity which is peculiar to intelligent, honest, well-built
10207: workmen, who are never wondering what is their business in the world.
10208: 
10209: “I’m quite taken by surprise,” he said. “I didn’t expect anything o’
10210: this sort, for it’s a good deal more than my wages. But I’ve the more
10211: reason to be grateful to you, Captain, and to you, Mr. Irwine, and to
10212: all my friends here, who’ve drunk my health and wished me well. It ’ud
10213: be nonsense for me to be saying, I don’t at all deserve th’ opinion you
10214: have of me; that ’ud be poor thanks to you, to say that you’ve known me
10215: all these years and yet haven’t sense enough to find out a great deal
10216: o’ the truth about me. You think, if I undertake to do a bit o’ work,
10217: I’ll do it well, be my pay big or little—and that’s true. I’d be
10218: ashamed to stand before you here if it wasna true. But it seems to me
10219: that’s a man’s plain duty, and nothing to be conceited about, and it’s
10220: pretty clear to me as I’ve never done more than my duty; for let us do
10221: what we will, it’s only making use o’ the sperrit and the powers that
10222: ha’ been given to us. And so this kindness o’ yours, I’m sure, is no
10223: debt you owe me, but a free gift, and as such I accept it and am
10224: thankful. And as to this new employment I’ve taken in hand, I’ll only
10225: say that I took it at Captain Donnithorne’s desire, and that I’ll try
10226: to fulfil his expectations. I’d wish for no better lot than to work
10227: under him, and to know that while I was getting my own bread I was
10228: taking care of his int’rests. For I believe he’s one o’ those gentlemen
10229: as wishes to do the right thing, and to leave the world a bit better
10230: than he found it, which it’s my belief every man may do, whether he’s
10231: gentle or simple, whether he sets a good bit o’ work going and finds
10232: the money, or whether he does the work with his own hands. There’s no
10233: occasion for me to say any more about what I feel towards him: I hope
10234: to show it through the rest o’ my life in my actions.”
10235: 
10236: There were various opinions about Adam’s speech: some of the women
10237: whispered that he didn’t show himself thankful enough, and seemed to
10238: speak as proud as could be; but most of the men were of opinion that
10239: nobody could speak more straightfor’ard, and that Adam was as fine a
10240: chap as need to be. While such observations were being buzzed about,
10241: mingled with wonderings as to what the old squire meant to do for a
10242: bailiff, and whether he was going to have a steward, the two gentlemen
10243: had risen, and were walking round to the table where the wives and
10244: children sat. There was none of the strong ale here, of course, but
10245: wine and dessert—sparkling gooseberry for the young ones, and some good
10246: sherry for the mothers. Mrs. Poyser was at the head of this table, and
10247: Totty was now seated in her lap, bending her small nose deep down into
10248: a wine-glass in search of the nuts floating there.
10249: 
10250: “How do you do, Mrs. Poyser?” said Arthur. “Weren’t you pleased to hear
10251: your husband make such a good speech to-day?”
10252: 
10253: “Oh, sir, the men are mostly so tongue-tied—you’re forced partly to
10254: guess what they mean, as you do wi’ the dumb creaturs.”
10255: 
10256: “What! you think you could have made it better for him?” said Mr.
10257: Irwine, laughing.
10258: 
10259: “Well, sir, when I want to say anything, I can mostly find words to say
10260: it in, thank God. Not as I’m a-finding faut wi’ my husband, for if he’s
10261: a man o’ few words, what he says he’ll stand to.”
10262: 
10263: “I’m sure I never saw a prettier party than this,” Arthur said, looking
10264: round at the apple-cheeked children. “My aunt and the Miss Irwines will
10265: come up and see you presently. They were afraid of the noise of the
10266: toasts, but it would be a shame for them not to see you at table.”
10267: 
10268: He walked on, speaking to the mothers and patting the children, while
10269: Mr. Irwine satisfied himself with standing still and nodding at a
10270: distance, that no one’s attention might be disturbed from the young
10271: squire, the hero of the day. Arthur did not venture to stop near Hetty,
10272: but merely bowed to her as he passed along the opposite side. The
10273: foolish child felt her heart swelling with discontent; for what woman
10274: was ever satisfied with apparent neglect, even when she knows it to be
10275: the mask of love? Hetty thought this was going to be the most miserable
10276: day she had had for a long while, a moment of chill daylight and
10277: reality came across her dream: Arthur, who had seemed so near to her
10278: only a few hours before, was separated from her, as the hero of a great
10279: procession is separated from a small outsider in the crowd.
10280: 
10281: 
10282: 
10283: 
10284: Chapter XXV
10285: The Games
10286: 
10287: 
10288: The great dance was not to begin until eight o’clock, but for any lads
10289: and lasses who liked to dance on the shady grass before then, there was
10290: music always at hand—for was not the band of the Benefit Club capable
10291: of playing excellent jigs, reels, and hornpipes? And, besides this,
10292: there was a grand band hired from Rosseter, who, with their wonderful
10293: wind-instruments and puffed-out cheeks, were themselves a delightful
10294: show to the small boys and girls. To say nothing of Joshua Rann’s
10295: fiddle, which, by an act of generous forethought, he had provided
10296: himself with, in case any one should be of sufficiently pure taste to
10297: prefer dancing to a solo on that instrument.
10298: 
10299: Meantime, when the sun had moved off the great open space in front of
10300: the house, the games began. There were, of course, well-soaped poles to
10301: be climbed by the boys and youths, races to be run by the old women,
10302: races to be run in sacks, heavy weights to be lifted by the strong men,
10303: and a long list of challenges to such ambitious attempts as that of
10304: walking as many yards possible on one leg—feats in which it was
10305: generally remarked that Wiry Ben, being “the lissom’st, springest
10306: fellow i’ the country,” was sure to be pre-eminent. To crown all, there
10307: was to be a donkey-race—that sublimest of all races, conducted on the
10308: grand socialistic idea of everybody encouraging everybody else’s
10309: donkey, and the sorriest donkey winning.
10310: 
10311: And soon after four o’clock, splendid old Mrs. Irwine, in her damask
10312: satin and jewels and black lace, was led out by Arthur, followed by the
10313: whole family party, to her raised seat under the striped marquee, where
10314: she was to give out the prizes to the victors. Staid, formal Miss Lydia
10315: had requested to resign that queenly office to the royal old lady, and
10316: Arthur was pleased with this opportunity of gratifying his godmother’s
10317: taste for stateliness. Old Mr. Donnithorne, the delicately clean,
10318: finely scented, withered old man, led out Miss Irwine, with his air of
10319: punctilious, acid politeness; Mr. Gawaine brought Miss Lydia, looking
10320: neutral and stiff in an elegant peach-blossom silk; and Mr. Irwine came
10321: last with his pale sister Anne. No other friend of the family, besides
10322: Mr. Gawaine, was invited to-day; there was to be a grand dinner for the
10323: neighbouring gentry on the morrow, but to-day all the forces were
10324: required for the entertainment of the tenants.
10325: 
10326: There was a sunk fence in front of the marquee, dividing the lawn from
10327: the park, but a temporary bridge had been made for the passage of the
10328: victors, and the groups of people standing, or seated here and there on
10329: benches, stretched on each side of the open space from the white
10330: marquees up to the sunk fence.
10331: 
10332: “Upon my word it’s a pretty sight,” said the old lady, in her deep
10333: voice, when she was seated, and looked round on the bright scene with
10334: its dark-green background; “and it’s the last fête-day I’m likely to
10335: see, unless you make haste and get married, Arthur. But take care you
10336: get a charming bride, else I would rather die without seeing her.”
10337: 
10338: “You’re so terribly fastidious, Godmother,” said Arthur, “I’m afraid I
10339: should never satisfy you with my choice.”
10340: 
10341: “Well, I won’t forgive you if she’s not handsome. I can’t be put off
10342: with amiability, which is always the excuse people are making for the
10343: existence of plain people. And she must not be silly; that will never
10344: do, because you’ll want managing, and a silly woman can’t manage you.
10345: Who is that tall young man, Dauphin, with the mild face? There,
10346: standing without his hat, and taking such care of that tall old woman
10347: by the side of him—his mother, of course. I like to see that.”
10348: 
10349: “What, don’t you know him, Mother?” said Mr. Irwine. “That is Seth
10350: Bede, Adam’s brother—a Methodist, but a very good fellow. Poor Seth has
10351: looked rather down-hearted of late; I thought it was because of his
10352: father’s dying in that sad way, but Joshua Rann tells me he wanted to
10353: marry that sweet little Methodist preacher who was here about a month
10354: ago, and I suppose she refused him.”
10355: 
10356: “Ah, I remember hearing about her. But there are no end of people here
10357: that I don’t know, for they’re grown up and altered so since I used to
10358: go about.”
10359: 
10360: “What excellent sight you have!” said old Mr. Donnithorne, who was
10361: holding a double glass up to his eyes, “to see the expression of that
10362: young man’s face so far off. His face is nothing but a pale blurred
10363: spot to me. But I fancy I have the advantage of you when we come to
10364: look close. I can read small print without spectacles.”
10365: 
10366: “Ah, my dear sir, you began with being very near-sighted, and those
10367: near-sighted eyes always wear the best. I want very strong spectacles
10368: to read with, but then I think my eyes get better and better for things
10369: at a distance. I suppose if I could live another fifty years, I should
10370: be blind to everything that wasn’t out of other people’s sight, like a
10371: man who stands in a well and sees nothing but the stars.”
10372: 
10373: “See,” said Arthur, “the old women are ready to set out on their race
10374: now. Which do you bet on, Gawaine?”
10375: 
10376: “The long-legged one, unless they’re going to have several heats, and
10377: then the little wiry one may win.”
10378: 
10379: “There are the Poysers, Mother, not far off on the right hand,” said
10380: Miss Irwine. “Mrs. Poyser is looking at you. Do take notice of her.”
10381: 
10382: “To be sure I will,” said the old lady, giving a gracious bow to Mrs.
10383: Poyser. “A woman who sends me such excellent cream-cheese is not to be
10384: neglected. Bless me! What a fat child that is she is holding on her
10385: knee! But who is that pretty girl with dark eyes?”
10386: 
10387: “That is Hetty Sorrel,” said Miss Lydia Donnithorne, “Martin Poyser’s
10388: niece—a very likely young person, and well-looking too. My maid has
10389: taught her fine needlework, and she has mended some lace of mine very
10390: respectably indeed—very respectably.”
10391: 
10392: “Why, she has lived with the Poysers six or seven years, Mother; you
10393: must have seen her,” said Miss Irwine.
10394: 
10395: “No, I’ve never seen her, child—at least not as she is now,” said Mrs.
10396: Irwine, continuing to look at Hetty. “Well-looking, indeed! She’s a
10397: perfect beauty! I’ve never seen anything so pretty since my young days.
10398: What a pity such beauty as that should be thrown away among the
10399: farmers, when it’s wanted so terribly among the good families without
10400: fortune! I daresay, now, she’ll marry a man who would have thought her
10401: just as pretty if she had had round eyes and red hair.”
10402: 
10403: Arthur dared not turn his eyes towards Hetty while Mrs. Irwine was
10404: speaking of her. He feigned not to hear, and to be occupied with
10405: something on the opposite side. But he saw her plainly enough without
10406: looking; saw her in heightened beauty, because he heard her beauty
10407: praised—for other men’s opinion, you know, was like a native climate to
10408: Arthur’s feelings: it was the air on which they thrived the best, and
10409: grew strong. Yes! She _was_ enough to turn any man’s head: any man in
10410: his place would have done and felt the same. And to give her up after
10411: all, as he was determined to do, would be an act that he should always
10412: look back upon with pride.
10413: 
10414: “No, Mother,” and Mr. Irwine, replying to her last words; “I can’t
10415: agree with you there. The common people are not quite so stupid as you
10416: imagine. The commonest man, who has his ounce of sense and feeling, is
10417: conscious of the difference between a lovely, delicate woman and a
10418: coarse one. Even a dog feels a difference in their presence. The man
10419: may be no better able than the dog to explain the influence the more
10420: refined beauty has on him, but he feels it.”
10421: 
10422: “Bless me, Dauphin, what does an old bachelor like you know about it?”
10423: 
10424: “Oh, that is one of the matters in which old bachelors are wiser than
10425: married men, because they have time for more general contemplation.
10426: Your fine critic of woman must never shackle his judgment by calling
10427: one woman his own. But, as an example of what I was saying, that pretty
10428: Methodist preacher I mentioned just now told me that she had preached
10429: to the roughest miners and had never been treated with anything but the
10430: utmost respect and kindness by them. The reason is—though she doesn’t
10431: know it—that there’s so much tenderness, refinement, and purity about
10432: her. Such a woman as that brings with her ‘airs from heaven’ that the
10433: coarsest fellow is not insensible to.”
10434: 
10435: “Here’s a delicate bit of womanhood, or girlhood, coming to receive a
10436: prize, I suppose,” said Mr. Gawaine. “She must be one of the racers in
10437: the sacks, who had set off before we came.”
10438: 
10439: The “bit of womanhood” was our old acquaintance Bessy Cranage,
10440: otherwise Chad’s Bess, whose large red cheeks and blowsy person had
10441: undergone an exaggeration of colour, which, if she had happened to be a
10442: heavenly body, would have made her sublime. Bessy, I am sorry to say,
10443: had taken to her ear-rings again since Dinah’s departure, and was
10444: otherwise decked out in such small finery as she could muster. Any one
10445: who could have looked into poor Bessy’s heart would have seen a
10446: striking resemblance between her little hopes and anxieties and
10447: Hetty’s. The advantage, perhaps, would have been on Bessy’s side in the
10448: matter of feeling. But then, you see, they were so very different
10449: outside! You would have been inclined to box Bessy’s ears, and you
10450: would have longed to kiss Hetty.
10451: 
10452: Bessy had been tempted to run the arduous race, partly from mere
10453: hedonish gaiety, partly because of the prize. Some one had said there
10454: were to be cloaks and other nice clothes for prizes, and she approached
10455: the marquee, fanning herself with her handkerchief, but with exultation
10456: sparkling in her round eyes.
10457: 
10458: “Here is the prize for the first sack-race,” said Miss Lydia, taking a
10459: large parcel from the table where the prizes were laid and giving it to
10460: Mrs. Irwine before Bessy came up, “an excellent grogram gown and a
10461: piece of flannel.”
10462: 
10463: “You didn’t think the winner was to be so young, I suppose, Aunt?” said
10464: Arthur. “Couldn’t you find something else for this girl, and save that
10465: grim-looking gown for one of the older women?”
10466: 
10467: “I have bought nothing but what is useful and substantial,” said Miss
10468: Lydia, adjusting her own lace; “I should not think of encouraging a
10469: love of finery in young women of that class. I have a scarlet cloak,
10470: but that is for the old woman who wins.”
10471: 
10472: This speech of Miss Lydia’s produced rather a mocking expression in
10473: Mrs. Irwine’s face as she looked at Arthur, while Bessy came up and
10474: dropped a series of curtsies.
10475: 
10476: “This is Bessy Cranage, mother,” said Mr. Irwine, kindly, “Chad
10477: Cranage’s daughter. You remember Chad Cranage, the blacksmith?”
10478: 
10479: “Yes, to be sure,” said Mrs. Irwine. “Well, Bessy, here is your
10480: prize—excellent warm things for winter. I’m sure you have had hard work
10481: to win them this warm day.”
10482: 
10483: Bessy’s lip fell as she saw the ugly, heavy gown—which felt so hot and
10484: disagreeable too, on this July day, and was such a great ugly thing to
10485: carry. She dropped her curtsies again, without looking up, and with a
10486: growing tremulousness about the corners of her mouth, and then turned
10487: away.
10488: 
10489: “Poor girl,” said Arthur; “I think she’s disappointed. I wish it had
10490: been something more to her taste.”
10491: 
10492: “She’s a bold-looking young person,” observed Miss Lydia. “Not at all
10493: one I should like to encourage.”
10494: 
10495: Arthur silently resolved that he would make Bessy a present of money
10496: before the day was over, that she might buy something more to her mind;
10497: but she, not aware of the consolation in store for her, turned out of
10498: the open space, where she was visible from the marquee, and throwing
10499: down the odious bundle under a tree, began to cry—very much tittered at
10500: the while by the small boys. In this situation she was descried by her
10501: discreet matronly cousin, who lost no time in coming up, having just
10502: given the baby into her husband’s charge.
10503: 
10504: “What’s the matter wi’ ye?” said Bess the matron, taking up the bundle
10505: and examining it. “Ye’n sweltered yoursen, I reckon, running that
10506: fool’s race. An’ here, they’n gi’en you lots o’ good grogram and
10507: flannel, as should ha’ been gi’en by good rights to them as had the
10508: sense to keep away from such foolery. Ye might spare me a bit o’ this
10509: grogram to make clothes for the lad—ye war ne’er ill-natured, Bess; I
10510: ne’er said that on ye.”
10511: 
10512: “Ye may take it all, for what I care,” said Bess the maiden, with a
10513: pettish movement, beginning to wipe away her tears and recover herself.
10514: 
10515: “Well, I could do wi’t, if so be ye want to get rid on’t,” said the
10516: disinterested cousin, walking quickly away with the bundle, lest Chad’s
10517: Bess should change her mind.
10518: 
10519: But that bonny-cheeked lass was blessed with an elasticity of spirits
10520: that secured her from any rankling grief; and by the time the grand
10521: climax of the donkey-race came on, her disappointment was entirely lost
10522: in the delightful excitement of attempting to stimulate the last donkey
10523: by hisses, while the boys applied the argument of sticks. But the
10524: strength of the donkey mind lies in adopting a course inversely as the
10525: arguments urged, which, well considered, requires as great a mental
10526: force as the direct sequence; and the present donkey proved the
10527: first-rate order of his intelligence by coming to a dead standstill
10528: just when the blows were thickest. Great was the shouting of the crowd,
10529: radiant the grinning of Bill Downes the stone-sawyer and the fortunate
10530: rider of this superior beast, which stood calm and stiff-legged in the
10531: midst of its triumph.
10532: 
10533: Arthur himself had provided the prizes for the men, and Bill was made
10534: happy with a splendid pocket-knife, supplied with blades and gimlets
10535: enough to make a man at home on a desert island. He had hardly returned
10536: from the marquee with the prize in his hand, when it began to be
10537: understood that Wiry Ben proposed to amuse the company, before the
10538: gentry went to dinner, with an impromptu and gratuitous
10539: performance—namely, a hornpipe, the main idea of which was doubtless
10540: borrowed; but this was to be developed by the dancer in so peculiar and
10541: complex a manner that no one could deny him the praise of originality.
10542: Wiry Ben’s pride in his dancing—an accomplishment productive of great
10543: effect at the yearly Wake—had needed only slightly elevating by an
10544: extra quantity of good ale to convince him that the gentry would be
10545: very much struck with his performance of his hornpipe; and he had been
10546: decidedly encouraged in this idea by Joshua Rann, who observed that it
10547: was nothing but right to do something to please the young squire, in
10548: return for what he had done for them. You will be the less surprised at
10549: this opinion in so grave a personage when you learn that Ben had
10550: requested Mr. Rann to accompany him on the fiddle, and Joshua felt
10551: quite sure that though there might not be much in the dancing, the
10552: music would make up for it. Adam Bede, who was present in one of the
10553: large marquees, where the plan was being discussed, told Ben he had
10554: better not make a fool of himself—a remark which at once fixed Ben’s
10555: determination: he was not going to let anything alone because Adam Bede
10556: turned up his nose at it.
10557: 
10558: “What’s this, what’s this?” said old Mr. Donnithorne. “Is it something
10559: you’ve arranged, Arthur? Here’s the clerk coming with his fiddle, and a
10560: smart fellow with a nosegay in his button-hole.”
10561: 
10562: “No,” said Arthur; “I know nothing about it. By Jove, he’s going to
10563: dance! It’s one of the carpenters—I forget his name at this moment.”
10564: 
10565: “It’s Ben Cranage—Wiry Ben, they call him,” said Mr. Irwine; “rather a
10566: loose fish, I think. Anne, my dear, I see that fiddle-scraping is too
10567: much for you: you’re getting tired. Let me take you in now, that you
10568: may rest till dinner.”
10569: 
10570: Miss Anne rose assentingly, and the good brother took her away, while
10571: Joshua’s preliminary scrapings burst into the “White Cockade,” from
10572: which he intended to pass to a variety of tunes, by a series of
10573: transitions which his good ear really taught him to execute with some
10574: skill. It would have been an exasperating fact to him, if he had known
10575: it, that the general attention was too thoroughly absorbed by Ben’s
10576: dancing for any one to give much heed to the music.
10577: 
10578: Have you ever seen a real English rustic perform a solo dance? Perhaps
10579: you have only seen a ballet rustic, smiling like a merry countryman in
10580: crockery, with graceful turns of the haunch and insinuating movements
10581: of the head. That is as much like the real thing as the “Bird Waltz” is
10582: like the song of birds. Wiry Ben never smiled: he looked as serious as
10583: a dancing monkey—as serious as if he had been an experimental
10584: philosopher ascertaining in his own person the amount of shaking and
10585: the varieties of angularity that could be given to the human limbs.
10586: 
10587: To make amends for the abundant laughter in the striped marquee, Arthur
10588: clapped his hands continually and cried “Bravo!” But Ben had one
10589: admirer whose eyes followed his movements with a fervid gravity that
10590: equalled his own. It was Martin Poyser, who was seated on a bench, with
10591: Tommy between his legs.
10592: 
10593: “What dost think o’ that?” he said to his wife. “He goes as pat to the
10594: music as if he was made o’ clockwork. I used to be a pretty good un at
10595: dancing myself when I was lighter, but I could niver ha’ hit it just to
10596: th’ hair like that.”
10597: 
10598: “It’s little matter what his limbs are, to my thinking,” re-turned Mrs.
10599: Poyser. “He’s empty enough i’ the upper story, or he’d niver come
10600: jigging an’ stamping i’ that way, like a mad grasshopper, for the
10601: gentry to look at him. They’re fit to die wi’ laughing, I can see.”
10602: 
10603: “Well, well, so much the better, it amuses ’em,” said Mr. Poyser, who
10604: did not easily take an irritable view of things. “But they’re going
10605: away now, t’ have their dinner, I reckon. We’ll move about a bit, shall
10606: we, and see what Adam Bede’s doing. He’s got to look after the drinking
10607: and things: I doubt he hasna had much fun.”
10608: 
10609:

10612: Chapter XXVI
10613: The Dance
10614: 
10615: 
10616: Arthur had chosen the entrance-hall for the ballroom: very wisely, for
10617: no other room could have been so airy, or would have had the advantage
10618: of the wide doors opening into the garden, as well as a ready entrance
10619: into the other rooms. To be sure, a stone floor was not the pleasantest
10620: to dance on, but then, most of the dancers had known what it was to
10621: enjoy a Christmas dance on kitchen quarries. It was one of those
10622: entrance-halls which make the surrounding rooms look like closets—with
10623: stucco angels, trumpets, and flower-wreaths on the lofty ceiling, and
10624: great medallions of miscellaneous heroes on the walls, alternating with
10625: statues in niches. Just the sort of place to be ornamented well with
10626: green boughs, and Mr. Craig had been proud to show his taste and his
10627: hothouse plants on the occasion. The broad steps of the stone staircase
10628: were covered with cushions to serve as seats for the children, who were
10629: to stay till half-past nine with the servant-maids to see the dancing,
10630: and as this dance was confined to the chief tenants, there was abundant
10631: room for every one. The lights were charmingly disposed in
10632: coloured-paper lamps, high up among green boughs, and the farmers’
10633: wives and daughters, as they peeped in, believed no scene could be more
10634: splendid; they knew now quite well in what sort of rooms the king and
10635: queen lived, and their thoughts glanced with some pity towards cousins
10636: and acquaintances who had not this fine opportunity of knowing how
10637: things went on in the great world. The lamps were already lit, though
10638: the sun had not long set, and there was that calm light out of doors in
10639: which we seem to see all objects more distinctly than in the broad day.
10640: 
10641: It was a pretty scene outside the house: the farmers and their families
10642: were moving about the lawn, among the flowers and shrubs, or along the
10643: broad straight road leading from the east front, where a carpet of
10644: mossy grass spread on each side, studded here and there with a dark
10645: flat-boughed cedar, or a grand pyramidal fir sweeping the ground with
10646: its branches, all tipped with a fringe of paler green. The groups of
10647: cottagers in the park were gradually diminishing, the young ones being
10648: attracted towards the lights that were beginning to gleam from the
10649: windows of the gallery in the abbey, which was to be their
10650: dancing-room, and some of the sober elder ones thinking it time to go
10651: home quietly. One of these was Lisbeth Bede, and Seth went with her—not
10652: from filial attention only, for his conscience would not let him join
10653: in dancing. It had been rather a melancholy day to Seth: Dinah had
10654: never been more constantly present with him than in this scene, where
10655: everything was so unlike her. He saw her all the more vividly after
10656: looking at the thoughtless faces and gay-coloured dresses of the young
10657: women—just as one feels the beauty and the greatness of a pictured
10658: Madonna the more when it has been for a moment screened from us by a
10659: vulgar head in a bonnet. But this presence of Dinah in his mind only
10660: helped him to bear the better with his mother’s mood, which had been
10661: becoming more and more querulous for the last hour. Poor Lisbeth was
10662: suffering from a strange conflict of feelings. Her joy and pride in the
10663: honour paid to her darling son Adam was beginning to be worsted in the
10664: conflict with the jealousy and fretfulness which had revived when Adam
10665: came to tell her that Captain Donnithorne desired him to join the
10666: dancers in the hall. Adam was getting more and more out of her reach;
10667: she wished all the old troubles back again, for then it mattered more
10668: to Adam what his mother said and did.
10669: 
10670: “Eh, it’s fine talkin’ o’ dancin’,” she said, “an’ thy father not a
10671: five week in’s grave. An’ I wish I war there too, i’stid o’ bein’ left
10672: to take up merrier folks’s room above ground.”
10673: 
10674: “Nay, don’t look at it i’ that way, Mother,” said Adam, who was
10675: determined to be gentle to her to-day. “I don’t mean to dance—I shall
10676: only look on. And since the captain wishes me to be there, it ’ud look
10677: as if I thought I knew better than him to say as I’d rather not stay.
10678: And thee know’st how he’s behaved to me to-day.”
10679: 
10680: “Eh, thee’t do as thee lik’st, for thy old mother’s got no right t’
10681: hinder thee. She’s nought but th’ old husk, and thee’st slipped away
10682: from her, like the ripe nut.”
10683: 
10684: “Well, Mother,” said Adam, “I’ll go and tell the captain as it hurts
10685: thy feelings for me to stay, and I’d rather go home upo’ that account:
10686: he won’t take it ill then, I daresay, and I’m willing.” He said this
10687: with some effort, for he really longed to be near Hetty this evening.
10688: 
10689: “Nay, nay, I wonna ha’ thee do that—the young squire ’ull be angered.
10690: Go an’ do what thee’t ordered to do, an’ me and Seth ’ull go whome. I
10691: know it’s a grit honour for thee to be so looked on—an’ who’s to be
10692: prouder on it nor thy mother? Hadna she the cumber o’ rearin’ thee an’
10693: doin’ for thee all these ’ears?”
10694: 
10695: “Well, good-bye, then, Mother—good-bye, lad—remember Gyp when you get
10696: home,” said Adam, turning away towards the gate of the
10697: pleasure-grounds, where he hoped he might be able to join the Poysers,
10698: for he had been so occupied throughout the afternoon that he had had no
10699: time to speak to Hetty. His eye soon detected a distant group, which he
10700: knew to be the right one, returning to the house along the broad gravel
10701: road, and he hastened on to meet them.
10702: 
10703: “Why, Adam, I’m glad to get sight on y’ again,” said Mr. Poyser, who
10704: was carrying Totty on his arm. “You’re going t’ have a bit o’ fun, I
10705: hope, now your work’s all done. And here’s Hetty has promised no end o’
10706: partners, an’ I’ve just been askin’ her if she’d agreed to dance wi’
10707: you, an’ she says no.”
10708: 
10709: “Well, I didn’t think o’ dancing to-night,” said Adam, already tempted
10710: to change his mind, as he looked at Hetty.
10711: 
10712: “Nonsense!” said Mr. Poyser. “Why, everybody’s goin’ to dance to-night,
10713: all but th’ old squire and Mrs. Irwine. Mrs. Best’s been tellin’ us as
10714: Miss Lyddy and Miss Irwine ’ull dance, an’ the young squire ’ull pick
10715: my wife for his first partner, t’ open the ball: so she’ll be forced to
10716: dance, though she’s laid by ever sin’ the Christmas afore the little un
10717: was born. You canna for shame stand still, Adam, an’ you a fine young
10718: fellow and can dance as well as anybody.”
10719: 
10720: “Nay, nay,” said Mrs. Poyser, “it ’ud be unbecomin’. I know the
10721: dancin’s nonsense, but if you stick at everything because it’s
10722: nonsense, you wonna go far i’ this life. When your broth’s ready-made
10723: for you, you mun swallow the thickenin’, or else let the broth alone.”
10724: 
10725: “Then if Hetty ’ull dance with me,” said Adam, yielding either to Mrs.
10726: Poyser’s argument or to something else, “I’ll dance whichever dance
10727: she’s free.”
10728: 
10729: “I’ve got no partner for the fourth dance,” said Hetty; “I’ll dance
10730: that with you, if you like.”
10731: 
10732: “Ah,” said Mr. Poyser, “but you mun dance the first dance, Adam, else
10733: it’ll look partic’ler. There’s plenty o’ nice partners to pick an’
10734: choose from, an’ it’s hard for the gells when the men stan’ by and
10735: don’t ask ’em.”
10736: 
10737: Adam felt the justice of Mr. Poyser’s observation: it would not do for
10738: him to dance with no one besides Hetty; and remembering that Jonathan
10739: Burge had some reason to feel hurt to-day, he resolved to ask Miss Mary
10740: to dance with him the first dance, if she had no other partner.
10741: 
10742: “There’s the big clock strikin’ eight,” said Mr. Poyser; “we must make
10743: haste in now, else the squire and the ladies ’ull be in afore us, an’
10744: that wouldna look well.”
10745: 
10746: When they had entered the hall, and the three children under Molly’s
10747: charge had been seated on the stairs, the folding-doors of the
10748: drawing-room were thrown open, and Arthur entered in his regimentals,
10749: leading Mrs. Irwine to a carpet-covered dais ornamented with hot-house
10750: plants, where she and Miss Anne were to be seated with old Mr.
10751: Donnithorne, that they might look on at the dancing, like the kings and
10752: queens in the plays. Arthur had put on his uniform to please the
10753: tenants, he said, who thought as much of his militia dignity as if it
10754: had been an elevation to the premiership. He had not the least
10755: objection to gratify them in that way: his uniform was very
10756: advantageous to his figure.
10757: 
10758: The old squire, before sitting down, walked round the hall to greet the
10759: tenants and make polite speeches to the wives: he was always polite;
10760: but the farmers had found out, after long puzzling, that this polish
10761: was one of the signs of hardness. It was observed that he gave his most
10762: elaborate civility to Mrs. Poyser to-night, inquiring particularly
10763: about her health, recommending her to strengthen herself with cold
10764: water as he did, and avoid all drugs. Mrs. Poyser curtsied and thanked
10765: him with great self-command, but when he had passed on, she whispered
10766: to her husband, “I’ll lay my life he’s brewin’ some nasty turn against
10767: us. Old Harry doesna wag his tail so for nothin’.” Mr. Poyser had no
10768: time to answer, for now Arthur came up and said, “Mrs. Poyser, I’m come
10769: to request the favour of your hand for the first dance; and, Mr.
10770: Poyser, you must let me take you to my aunt, for she claims you as her
10771: partner.”
10772: 
10773: The wife’s pale cheek flushed with a nervous sense of unwonted honour
10774: as Arthur led her to the top of the room; but Mr. Poyser, to whom an
10775: extra glass had restored his youthful confidence in his good looks and
10776: good dancing, walked along with them quite proudly, secretly flattering
10777: himself that Miss Lydia had never had a partner in _her_ life who could
10778: lift her off the ground as he would. In order to balance the honours
10779: given to the two parishes, Miss Irwine danced with Luke Britton, the
10780: largest Broxton farmer, and Mr. Gawaine led out Mrs. Britton. Mr.
10781: Irwine, after seating his sister Anne, had gone to the abbey gallery,
10782: as he had agreed with Arthur beforehand, to see how the merriment of
10783: the cottagers was prospering. Meanwhile, all the less distinguished
10784: couples had taken their places: Hetty was led out by the inevitable Mr.
10785: Craig, and Mary Burge by Adam; and now the music struck up, and the
10786: glorious country-dance, best of all dances, began.
10787: 
10788: Pity it was not a boarded floor! Then the rhythmic stamping of the
10789: thick shoes would have been better than any drums. That merry stamping,
10790: that gracious nodding of the head, that waving bestowal of the
10791: hand—where can we see them now? That simple dancing of well-covered
10792: matrons, laying aside for an hour the cares of house and dairy,
10793: remembering but not affecting youth, not jealous but proud of the young
10794: maidens by their side—that holiday sprightliness of portly husbands
10795: paying little compliments to their wives, as if their courting days
10796: were come again—those lads and lasses a little confused and awkward
10797: with their partners, having nothing to say—it would be a pleasant
10798: variety to see all that sometimes, instead of low dresses and large
10799: skirts, and scanning glances exploring costumes, and languid men in
10800: lacquered boots smiling with double meaning.
10801: 
10802: There was but one thing to mar Martin Poyser’s pleasure in this dance:
10803: it was that he was always in close contact with Luke Britton, that
10804: slovenly farmer. He thought of throwing a little glazed coldness into
10805: his eye in the crossing of hands; but then, as Miss Irwine was opposite
10806: to him instead of the offensive Luke, he might freeze the wrong person.
10807: So he gave his face up to hilarity, unchilled by moral judgments.
10808: 
10809: How Hetty’s heart beat as Arthur approached her! He had hardly looked
10810: at her to-day: now he _must_ take her hand. Would he press it? Would he
10811: look at her? She thought she would cry if he gave her no sign of
10812: feeling. Now he was there—he had taken her hand—yes, he was pressing
10813: it. Hetty turned pale as she looked up at him for an instant and met
10814: his eyes, before the dance carried him away. That pale look came upon
10815: Arthur like the beginning of a dull pain, which clung to him, though he
10816: must dance and smile and joke all the same. Hetty would look so, when
10817: he told her what he had to tell her; and he should never be able to
10818: bear it—he should be a fool and give way again. Hetty’s look did not
10819: really mean so much as he thought: it was only the sign of a struggle
10820: between the desire for him to notice her and the dread lest she should
10821: betray the desire to others. But Hetty’s face had a language that
10822: transcended her feelings. There are faces which nature charges with a
10823: meaning and pathos not belonging to the single human soul that flutters
10824: beneath them, but speaking the joys and sorrows of foregone
10825: generations—eyes that tell of deep love which doubtless has been and is
10826: somewhere, but not paired with these eyes—perhaps paired with pale eyes
10827: that can say nothing; just as a national language may be instinct with
10828: poetry unfelt by the lips that use it. That look of Hetty’s oppressed
10829: Arthur with a dread which yet had something of a terrible unconfessed
10830: delight in it, that she loved him too well. There was a hard task
10831: before him, for at that moment he felt he would have given up three
10832: years of his youth for the happiness of abandoning himself without
10833: remorse to his passion for Hetty.
10834: 
10835: These were the incongruous thoughts in his mind as he led Mrs. Poyser,
10836: who was panting with fatigue, and secretly resolving that neither judge
10837: nor jury should force her to dance another dance, to take a quiet rest
10838: in the dining-room, where supper was laid out for the guests to come
10839: and take it as they chose.
10840: 
10841: “I’ve desired Hetty to remember as she’s got to dance wi’ you, sir,”
10842: said the good innocent woman; “for she’s so thoughtless, she’d be like
10843: enough to go an’ engage herself for ivery dance. So I told her not to
10844: promise too many.”
10845: 
10846: “Thank you, Mrs. Poyser,” said Arthur, not without a twinge. “Now, sit
10847: down in this comfortable chair, and here is Mills ready to give you
10848: what you would like best.”
10849: 
10850: He hurried away to seek another matronly partner, for due honour must
10851: be paid to the married women before he asked any of the young ones; and
10852: the country-dances, and the stamping, and the gracious nodding, and the
10853: waving of the hands, went on joyously.
10854: 
10855: At last the time had come for the fourth dance—longed for by the
10856: strong, grave Adam, as if he had been a delicate-handed youth of
10857: eighteen; for we are all very much alike when we are in our first love;
10858: and Adam had hardly ever touched Hetty’s hand for more than a transient
10859: greeting—had never danced with her but once before. His eyes had
10860: followed her eagerly to-night in spite of himself, and had taken in
10861: deeper draughts of love. He thought she behaved so prettily, so
10862: quietly; she did not seem to be flirting at all, she smiled less than
10863: usual; there was almost a sweet sadness about her. “God bless her!” he
10864: said inwardly; “I’d make her life a happy ’un, if a strong arm to work
10865: for her, and a heart to love her, could do it.”
10866: 
10867: And then there stole over him delicious thoughts of coming home from
10868: work, and drawing Hetty to his side, and feeling her cheek softly
10869: pressed against his, till he forgot where he was, and the music and the
10870: tread of feet might have been the falling of rain and the roaring of
10871: the wind, for what he knew.
10872: 
10873: But now the third dance was ended, and he might go up to her and claim
10874: her hand. She was at the far end of the hall near the staircase,
10875: whispering with Molly, who had just given the sleeping Totty into her
10876: arms before running to fetch shawls and bonnets from the landing. Mrs.
10877: Poyser had taken the two boys away into the dining-room to give them
10878: some cake before they went home in the cart with Grandfather and Molly
10879: was to follow as fast as possible.
10880: 
10881: “Let me hold her,” said Adam, as Molly turned upstairs; “the children
10882: are so heavy when they’re asleep.”
10883: 
10884: Hetty was glad of the relief, for to hold Totty in her arms, standing,
10885: was not at all a pleasant variety to her. But this second transfer had
10886: the unfortunate effect of rousing Totty, who was not behind any child
10887: of her age in peevishness at an unseasonable awaking. While Hetty was
10888: in the act of placing her in Adam’s arms, and had not yet withdrawn her
10889: own, Totty opened her eyes, and forthwith fought out with her left fist
10890: at Adam’s arm, and with her right caught at the string of brown beads
10891: round Hetty’s neck. The locket leaped out from her frock, and the next
10892: moment the string was broken, and Hetty, helpless, saw beads and locket
10893: scattered wide on the floor.
10894: 
10895: “My locket, my locket!” she said, in a loud frightened whisper to Adam;
10896: “never mind the beads.”
10897: 
10898: Adam had already seen where the locket fell, for it had attracted his
10899: glance as it leaped out of her frock. It had fallen on the raised
10900: wooden dais where the band sat, not on the stone floor; and as Adam
10901: picked it up, he saw the glass with the dark and light locks of hair
10902: under it. It had fallen that side upwards, so the glass was not broken.
10903: He turned it over on his hand, and saw the enamelled gold back.
10904: 
10905: “It isn’t hurt,” he said, as he held it towards Hetty, who was unable
10906: to take it because both her hands were occupied with Totty.
10907: 
10908: “Oh, it doesn’t matter, I don’t mind about it,” said Hetty, who had
10909: been pale and was now red.
10910: 
10911: “Not matter?” said Adam, gravely. “You seemed very frightened about it.
10912: I’ll hold it till you’re ready to take it,” he added, quietly closing
10913: his hand over it, that she might not think he wanted to look at it
10914: again.
10915: 
10916: By this time Molly had come with bonnet and shawl, and as soon as she
10917: had taken Totty, Adam placed the locket in Hetty’s hand. She took it
10918: with an air of indifference and put it in her pocket, in her heart
10919: vexed and angry with Adam because he had seen it, but determined now
10920: that she would show no more signs of agitation.
10921: 
10922: “See,” she said, “they’re taking their places to dance; let us go.”
10923: 
10924: Adam assented silently. A puzzled alarm had taken possession of him.
10925: Had Hetty a lover he didn’t know of? For none of her relations, he was
10926: sure, would give her a locket like that; and none of her admirers, with
10927: whom he was acquainted, was in the position of an accepted lover, as
10928: the giver of that locket must be. Adam was lost in the utter
10929: impossibility of finding any person for his fears to alight on. He
10930: could only feel with a terrible pang that there was something in
10931: Hetty’s life unknown to him; that while he had been rocking himself in
10932: the hope that she would come to love him, she was already loving
10933: another. The pleasure of the dance with Hetty was gone; his eyes, when
10934: they rested on her, had an uneasy questioning expression in them; he
10935: could think of nothing to say to her; and she too was out of temper and
10936: disinclined to speak. They were both glad when the dance was ended.
10937: 
10938: Adam was determined to stay no longer; no one wanted him, and no one
10939: would notice if he slipped away. As soon as he got out of doors, he
10940: began to walk at his habitual rapid pace, hurrying along without
10941: knowing why, busy with the painful thought that the memory of this day,
10942: so full of honour and promise to him, was poisoned for ever. Suddenly,
10943: when he was far on through the Chase, he stopped, startled by a flash
10944: of reviving hope. After all, he might be a fool, making a great misery
10945: out of a trifle. Hetty, fond of finery as she was, might have bought
10946: the thing herself. It looked too expensive for that—it looked like the
10947: things on white satin in the great jeweller’s shop at Rosseter. But
10948: Adam had very imperfect notions of the value of such things, and he
10949: thought it could certainly not cost more than a guinea. Perhaps Hetty
10950: had had as much as that in Christmas boxes, and there was no knowing
10951: but she might have been childish enough to spend it in that way; she
10952: was such a young thing, and she couldn’t help loving finery! But then,
10953: why had she been so frightened about it at first, and changed colour
10954: so, and afterwards pretended not to care? Oh, that was because she was
10955: ashamed of his seeing that she had such a smart thing—she was conscious
10956: that it was wrong for her to spend her money on it, and she knew that
10957: Adam disapproved of finery. It was a proof she cared about what he
10958: liked and disliked. She must have thought from his silence and gravity
10959: afterwards that he was very much displeased with her, that he was
10960: inclined to be harsh and severe towards her foibles. And as he walked
10961: on more quietly, chewing the cud of this new hope, his only uneasiness
10962: was that he had behaved in a way which might chill Hetty’s feeling
10963: towards him. For this last view of the matter _must_ be the true one.
10964: How could Hetty have an accepted lover, quite unknown to him? She was
10965: never away from her uncle’s house for more than a day; she could have
10966: no acquaintances that did not come there, and no intimacies unknown to
10967: her uncle and aunt. It would be folly to believe that the locket was
10968: given to her by a lover. The little ring of dark hair he felt sure was
10969: her own; he could form no guess about the light hair under it, for he
10970: had not seen it very distinctly. It might be a bit of her father’s or
10971: mother’s, who had died when she was a child, and she would naturally
10972: put a bit of her own along with it.
10973: 
10974: And so Adam went to bed comforted, having woven for himself an
10975: ingenious web of probabilities—the surest screen a wise man can place
10976: between himself and the truth. His last waking thoughts melted into a
10977: dream that he was with Hetty again at the Hall Farm, and that he was
10978: asking her to forgive him for being so cold and silent.
10979: 
10980: And while he was dreaming this, Arthur was leading Hetty to the dance
10981: and saying to her in low hurried tones, “I shall be in the wood the day
10982: after to-morrow at seven; come as early as you can.” And Hetty’s
10983: foolish joys and hopes, which had flown away for a little space, scared
10984: by a mere nothing, now all came fluttering back, unconscious of the
10985: real peril. She was happy for the first time this long day, and wished
10986: that dance would last for hours. Arthur wished it too; it was the last
10987: weakness he meant to indulge in; and a man never lies with more
10988: delicious languor under the influence of a passion than when he has
10989: persuaded himself that he shall subdue it to-morrow.
10990: 
10991: But Mrs. Poyser’s wishes were quite the reverse of this, for her mind
10992: was filled with dreary forebodings as to the retardation of to-morrow
10993: morning’s cheese in consequence of these late hours. Now that Hetty had
10994: done her duty and danced one dance with the young squire, Mr. Poyser
10995: must go out and see if the cart was come back to fetch them, for it was
10996: half-past ten o’clock, and notwithstanding a mild suggestion on his
10997: part that it would be bad manners for them to be the first to go, Mrs.
10998: Poyser was resolute on the point, “manners or no manners.”
10999: 
11000: “What! Going already, Mrs. Poyser?” said old Mr. Donnithorne, as she
11001: came to curtsy and take leave; “I thought we should not part with any
11002: of our guests till eleven. Mrs. Irwine and I, who are elderly people,
11003: think of sitting out the dance till then.”
11004: 
11005: “Oh, Your Honour, it’s all right and proper for gentlefolks to stay up
11006: by candlelight—they’ve got no cheese on their minds. We’re late enough
11007: as it is, an’ there’s no lettin’ the cows know as they mustn’t want to
11008: be milked so early to-morrow mornin’. So, if you’ll please t’ excuse
11009: us, we’ll take our leave.”
11010: 
11011: “Eh!” she said to her husband, as they set off in the cart, “I’d sooner
11012: ha’ brewin’ day and washin’ day together than one o’ these pleasurin’
11013: days. There’s no work so tirin’ as danglin’ about an’ starin’ an’ not
11014: rightly knowin’ what you’re goin’ to do next; and keepin’ your face i’
11015: smilin’ order like a grocer o’ market-day for fear people shouldna
11016: think you civil enough. An’ you’ve nothing to show for’t when it’s
11017: done, if it isn’t a yallow face wi’ eatin’ things as disagree.”
11018: 
11019: “Nay, nay,” said Mr. Poyser, who was in his merriest mood, and felt
11020: that he had had a great day, “a bit o’ pleasuring’s good for thee
11021: sometimes. An’ thee danc’st as well as any of ’em, for I’ll back thee
11022: against all the wives i’ the parish for a light foot an’ ankle. An’ it
11023: was a great honour for the young squire to ask thee first—I reckon it
11024: was because I sat at th’ head o’ the table an’ made the speech. An’
11025: Hetty too—_she_ never had such a partner before—a fine young gentleman
11026: in reg’mentals. It’ll serve you to talk on, Hetty, when you’re an old
11027: woman—how you danced wi’ th’ young squire the day he come o’ age.”

11037: Chapter XXVII
11038: A crisis
11039: 
11040: 
11041: It was beyond the middle of August—nearly three weeks after the
11042: birthday feast. The reaping of the wheat had begun in our north midland
11043: county of Loamshire, but the harvest was likely still to be retarded by
11044: the heavy rains, which were causing inundations and much damage
11045: throughout the country. From this last trouble the Broxton and Hayslope
11046: farmers, on their pleasant uplands and in their brook-watered valleys,
11047: had not suffered, and as I cannot pretend that they were such
11048: exceptional farmers as to love the general good better than their own,
11049: you will infer that they were not in very low spirits about the rapid
11050: rise in the price of bread, so long as there was hope of gathering in
11051: their own corn undamaged; and occasional days of sunshine and drying
11052: winds flattered this hope.
11053: 
11054: The eighteenth of August was one of these days when the sunshine looked
11055: brighter in all eyes for the gloom that went before. Grand masses of
11056: cloud were hurried across the blue, and the great round hills behind
11057: the Chase seemed alive with their flying shadows; the sun was hidden
11058: for a moment, and then shone out warm again like a recovered joy; the
11059: leaves, still green, were tossed off the hedgerow trees by the wind;
11060: around the farmhouses there was a sound of clapping doors; the apples
11061: fell in the orchards; and the stray horses on the green sides of the
11062: lanes and on the common had their manes blown about their faces. And
11063: yet the wind seemed only part of the general gladness because the sun
11064: was shining. A merry day for the children, who ran and shouted to see
11065: if they could top the wind with their voices; and the grown-up people
11066: too were in good spirits, inclined to believe in yet finer days, when
11067: the wind had fallen. If only the corn were not ripe enough to be blown
11068: out of the husk and scattered as untimely seed!
11069: 
11070: And yet a day on which a blighting sorrow may fall upon a man. For if
11071: it be true that Nature at certain moments seems charged with a
11072: presentiment of one individual lot must it not also be true that she
11073: seems unmindful, unconscious of another? For there is no hour that has
11074: not its births of gladness and despair, no morning brightness that does
11075: not bring new sickness to desolation as well as new forces to genius
11076: and love. There are so many of us, and our lots are so different, what
11077: wonder that Nature’s mood is often in harsh contrast with the great
11078: crisis of our lives? We are children of a large family, and must learn,
11079: as such children do, not to expect that our hurts will be made much
11080: of—to be content with little nurture and caressing, and help each other
11081: the more.
11082: 
11083: It was a busy day with Adam, who of late had done almost double work,
11084: for he was continuing to act as foreman for Jonathan Burge, until some
11085: satisfactory person could be found to supply his place, and Jonathan
11086: was slow to find that person. But he had done the extra work
11087: cheerfully, for his hopes were buoyant again about Hetty. Every time
11088: she had seen him since the birthday, she had seemed to make an effort
11089: to behave all the more kindly to him, that she might make him
11090: understand she had forgiven his silence and coldness during the dance.
11091: He had never mentioned the locket to her again; too happy that she
11092: smiled at him—still happier because he observed in her a more subdued
11093: air, something that he interpreted as the growth of womanly tenderness
11094: and seriousness. “Ah!” he thought, again and again, “she’s only
11095: seventeen; she’ll be thoughtful enough after a while. And her aunt
11096: allays says how clever she is at the work. She’ll make a wife as
11097: Mother’ll have no occasion to grumble at, after all.” To be sure, he
11098: had only seen her at home twice since the birthday; for one Sunday,
11099: when he was intending to go from church to the Hall Farm, Hetty had
11100: joined the party of upper servants from the Chase and had gone home
11101: with them—almost as if she were inclined to encourage Mr. Craig. “She’s
11102: takin’ too much likin’ to them folks i’ the housekeeper’s room,” Mrs.
11103: Poyser remarked. “For my part, I was never overfond o’ gentlefolks’s
11104: servants—they’re mostly like the fine ladies’ fat dogs, nayther good
11105: for barking nor butcher’s meat, but on’y for show.” And another evening
11106: she was gone to Treddleston to buy some things; though, to his great
11107: surprise, as he was returning home, he saw her at a distance getting
11108: over a stile quite out of the Treddleston road. But, when he hastened
11109: to her, she was very kind, and asked him to go in again when he had
11110: taken her to the yard gate. She had gone a little farther into the
11111: fields after coming from Treddleston because she didn’t want to go in,
11112: she said: it was so nice to be out of doors, and her aunt always made
11113: such a fuss about it if she wanted to go out. “Oh, do come in with me!”
11114: she said, as he was going to shake hands with her at the gate, and he
11115: could not resist that. So he went in, and Mrs. Poyser was contented
11116: with only a slight remark on Hetty’s being later than was expected;
11117: while Hetty, who had looked out of spirits when he met her, smiled and
11118: talked and waited on them all with unusual promptitude.
11119: 
11120: That was the last time he had seen her; but he meant to make leisure
11121: for going to the Farm to-morrow. To-day, he knew, was her day for going
11122: to the Chase to sew with the lady’s maid, so he would get as much work
11123: done as possible this evening, that the next might be clear.
11124: 
11125: One piece of work that Adam was superintending was some slight repairs
11126: at the Chase Farm, which had been hitherto occupied by Satchell, as
11127: bailiff, but which it was now rumoured that the old squire was going to
11128: let to a smart man in top-boots, who had been seen to ride over it one
11129: day. Nothing but the desire to get a tenant could account for the
11130: squire’s undertaking repairs, though the Saturday-evening party at Mr.
11131: Casson’s agreed over their pipes that no man in his senses would take
11132: the Chase Farm unless there was a bit more ploughland laid to it.
11133: However that might be, the repairs were ordered to be executed with all
11134: dispatch, and Adam, acting for Mr. Burge, was carrying out the order
11135: with his usual energy. But to-day, having been occupied elsewhere, he
11136: had not been able to arrive at the Chase Farm till late in the
11137: afternoon, and he then discovered that some old roofing, which he had
11138: calculated on preserving, had given way. There was clearly no good to
11139: be done with this part of the building without pulling it all down, and
11140: Adam immediately saw in his mind a plan for building it up again, so as
11141: to make the most convenient of cow-sheds and calf-pens, with a hovel
11142: for implements; and all without any great expense for materials. So,
11143: when the workmen were gone, he sat down, took out his pocket-book, and
11144: busied himself with sketching a plan, and making a specification of the
11145: expenses that he might show it to Burge the next morning, and set him
11146: on persuading the squire to consent. To “make a good job” of anything,
11147: however small, was always a pleasure to Adam, and he sat on a block,
11148: with his book resting on a planing-table, whistling low every now and
11149: then and turning his head on one side with a just perceptible smile of
11150: gratification—of pride, too, for if Adam loved a bit of good work, he
11151: loved also to think, “I did it!” And I believe the only people who are
11152: free from that weakness are those who have no work to call their own.
11153: It was nearly seven before he had finished and put on his jacket again;
11154: and on giving a last look round, he observed that Seth, who had been
11155: working here to-day, had left his basket of tools behind him. “Why, th’
11156: lad’s forgot his tools,” thought Adam, “and he’s got to work up at the
11157: shop to-morrow. There never was such a chap for wool-gathering; he’d
11158: leave his head behind him, if it was loose. However, it’s lucky I’ve
11159: seen ’em; I’ll carry ’em home.”
11160: 
11161: The buildings of the Chase Farm lay at one extremity of the Chase, at
11162: about ten minutes’ walking distance from the Abbey. Adam had come
11163: thither on his pony, intending to ride to the stables and put up his
11164: nag on his way home. At the stables he encountered Mr. Craig, who had
11165: come to look at the captain’s new horse, on which he was to ride away
11166: the day after to-morrow; and Mr. Craig detained him to tell how all the
11167: servants were to collect at the gate of the courtyard to wish the young
11168: squire luck as he rode out; so that by the time Adam had got into the
11169: Chase, and was striding along with the basket of tools over his
11170: shoulder, the sun was on the point of setting, and was sending level
11171: crimson rays among the great trunks of the old oaks, and touching every
11172: bare patch of ground with a transient glory that made it look like a
11173: jewel dropt upon the grass. The wind had fallen now, and there was only
11174: enough breeze to stir the delicate-stemmed leaves. Any one who had been
11175: sitting in the house all day would have been glad to walk now; but Adam
11176: had been quite enough in the open air to wish to shorten his way home,
11177: and he bethought himself that he might do so by striking across the
11178: Chase and going through the Grove, where he had never been for years.
11179: He hurried on across the Chase, stalking along the narrow paths between
11180: the fern, with Gyp at his heels, not lingering to watch the magnificent
11181: changes of the light—hardly once thinking of it—yet feeling its
11182: presence in a certain calm happy awe which mingled itself with his busy
11183: working-day thoughts. How could he help feeling it? The very deer felt
11184: it, and were more timid.
11185: 
11186: Presently Adam’s thoughts recurred to what Mr. Craig had said about
11187: Arthur Donnithorne, and pictured his going away, and the changes that
11188: might take place before he came back; then they travelled back
11189: affectionately over the old scenes of boyish companionship, and dwelt
11190: on Arthur’s good qualities, which Adam had a pride in, as we all have
11191: in the virtues of the superior who honours us. A nature like Adam’s,
11192: with a great need of love and reverence in it, depends for so much of
11193: its happiness on what it can believe and feel about others! And he had
11194: no ideal world of dead heroes; he knew little of the life of men in the
11195: past; he must find the beings to whom he could cling with loving
11196: admiration among those who came within speech of him. These pleasant
11197: thoughts about Arthur brought a milder expression than usual into his
11198: keen rough face: perhaps they were the reason why, when he opened the
11199: old green gate leading into the Grove, he paused to pat Gyp and say a
11200: kind word to him.
11201: 
11202: After that pause, he strode on again along the broad winding path
11203: through the Grove. What grand beeches! Adam delighted in a fine tree of
11204: all things; as the fisherman’s sight is keenest on the sea, so Adam’s
11205: perceptions were more at home with trees than with other objects. He
11206: kept them in his memory, as a painter does, with all the flecks and
11207: knots in their bark, all the curves and angles of their boughs, and had
11208: often calculated the height and contents of a trunk to a nicety, as he
11209: stood looking at it. No wonder that, not-withstanding his desire to get
11210: on, he could not help pausing to look at a curious large beech which he
11211: had seen standing before him at a turning in the road, and convince
11212: himself that it was not two trees wedded together, but only one. For
11213: the rest of his life he remembered that moment when he was calmly
11214: examining the beech, as a man remembers his last glimpse of the home
11215: where his youth was passed, before the road turned, and he saw it no
11216: more. The beech stood at the last turning before the Grove ended in an
11217: archway of boughs that let in the eastern light; and as Adam stepped
11218: away from the tree to continue his walk, his eyes fell on two figures
11219: about twenty yards before him.
11220: 
11221: He remained as motionless as a statue, and turned almost as pale. The
11222: two figures were standing opposite to each other, with clasped hands
11223: about to part; and while they were bending to kiss, Gyp, who had been
11224: running among the brushwood, came out, caught sight of them, and gave a
11225: sharp bark. They separated with a start—one hurried through the gate
11226: out of the Grove, and the other, turning round, walked slowly, with a
11227: sort of saunter, towards Adam who still stood transfixed and pale,
11228: clutching tighter the stick with which he held the basket of tools over
11229: his shoulder, and looking at the approaching figure with eyes in which
11230: amazement was fast turning to fierceness.
11231: 
11232: Arthur Donnithorne looked flushed and excited; he had tried to make
11233: unpleasant feelings more bearable by drinking a little more wine than
11234: usual at dinner to-day, and was still enough under its flattering
11235: influence to think more lightly of this unwished-for rencontre with
11236: Adam than he would otherwise have done. After all, Adam was the best
11237: person who could have happened to see him and Hetty together—he was a
11238: sensible fellow, and would not babble about it to other people. Arthur
11239: felt confident that he could laugh the thing off and explain it away.
11240: And so he sauntered forward with elaborate carelessness—his flushed
11241: face, his evening dress of fine cloth and fine linen, his hands
11242: half-thrust into his waistcoat pockets, all shone upon by the strange
11243: evening light which the light clouds had caught up even to the zenith,
11244: and were now shedding down between the topmost branches above him.
11245: 
11246: Adam was still motionless, looking at him as he came up. He understood
11247: it all now—the locket and everything else that had been doubtful to
11248: him: a terrible scorching light showed him the hidden letters that
11249: changed the meaning of the past. If he had moved a muscle, he must
11250: inevitably have sprung upon Arthur like a tiger; and in the conflicting
11251: emotions that filled those long moments, he had told himself that he
11252: would not give loose to passion, he would only speak the right thing.
11253: He stood as if petrified by an unseen force, but the force was his own
11254: strong will.
11255: 
11256: “Well, Adam,” said Arthur, “you’ve been looking at the fine old
11257: beeches, eh? They’re not to be come near by the hatchet, though; this
11258: is a sacred grove. I overtook pretty little Hetty Sorrel as I was
11259: coming to my den—the Hermitage, there. She ought not to come home this
11260: way so late. So I took care of her to the gate, and asked for a kiss
11261: for my pains. But I must get back now, for this road is confoundedly
11262: damp. Good-night, Adam. I shall see you to-morrow—to say good-bye, you
11263: know.”
11264: 
11265: Arthur was too much preoccupied with the part he was playing himself to
11266: be thoroughly aware of the expression in Adam’s face. He did not look
11267: directly at Adam, but glanced carelessly round at the trees and then
11268: lifted up one foot to look at the sole of his boot. He cared to say no
11269: more—he had thrown quite dust enough into honest Adam’s eyes—and as he
11270: spoke the last words, he walked on.
11271: 
11272: “Stop a bit, sir,” said Adam, in a hard peremptory voice, without
11273: turning round. “I’ve got a word to say to you.”
11274: 
11275: Arthur paused in surprise. Susceptible persons are more affected by a
11276: change of tone than by unexpected words, and Arthur had the
11277: susceptibility of a nature at once affectionate and vain. He was still
11278: more surprised when he saw that Adam had not moved, but stood with his
11279: back to him, as if summoning him to return. What did he mean? He was
11280: going to make a serious business of this affair. Arthur felt his temper
11281: rising. A patronising disposition always has its meaner side, and in
11282: the confusion of his irritation and alarm there entered the feeling
11283: that a man to whom he had shown so much favour as to Adam was not in a
11284: position to criticize his conduct. And yet he was dominated, as one who
11285: feels himself in the wrong always is, by the man whose good opinion he
11286: cares for. In spite of pride and temper, there was as much deprecation
11287: as anger in his voice when he said, “What do you mean, Adam?”
11288: 
11289: “I mean, sir”—answered Adam, in the same harsh voice, still without
11290: turning round—“I mean, sir, that you don’t deceive me by your light
11291: words. This is not the first time you’ve met Hetty Sorrel in this
11292: grove, and this is not the first time you’ve kissed her.”
11293: 
11294: Arthur felt a startled uncertainty how far Adam was speaking from
11295: knowledge, and how far from mere inference. And this uncertainty, which
11296: prevented him from contriving a prudent answer, heightened his
11297: irritation. He said, in a high sharp tone, “Well, sir, what then?”
11298: 
11299: “Why, then, instead of acting like th’ upright, honourable man we’ve
11300: all believed you to be, you’ve been acting the part of a selfish
11301: light-minded scoundrel. You know as well as I do what it’s to lead to
11302: when a gentleman like you kisses and makes love to a young woman like
11303: Hetty, and gives her presents as she’s frightened for other folks to
11304: see. And I say it again, you’re acting the part of a selfish
11305: light-minded scoundrel though it cuts me to th’ heart to say so, and
11306: I’d rather ha’ lost my right hand.”
11307: 
11308: “Let me tell you, Adam,” said Arthur, bridling his growing anger and
11309: trying to recur to his careless tone, “you’re not only devilishly
11310: impertinent, but you’re talking nonsense. Every pretty girl is not such
11311: a fool as you, to suppose that when a gentleman admires her beauty and
11312: pays her a little attention, he must mean something particular. Every
11313: man likes to flirt with a pretty girl, and every pretty girl likes to
11314: be flirted with. The wider the distance between them, the less harm
11315: there is, for then she’s not likely to deceive herself.”
11316: 
11317: “I don’t know what you mean by flirting,” said Adam, “but if you mean
11318: behaving to a woman as if you loved her, and yet not loving her all the
11319: while, I say that’s not th’ action of an honest man, and what isn’t
11320: honest does come t’ harm. I’m not a fool, and you’re not a fool, and
11321: you know better than what you’re saying. You know it couldn’t be made
11322: public as you’ve behaved to Hetty as y’ have done without her losing
11323: her character and bringing shame and trouble on her and her relations.
11324: What if you meant nothing by your kissing and your presents? Other
11325: folks won’t believe as you’ve meant nothing; and don’t tell me about
11326: her not deceiving herself. I tell you as you’ve filled her mind so with
11327: the thought of you as it’ll mayhap poison her life, and she’ll never
11328: love another man as ’ud make her a good husband.”
11329: 
11330: Arthur had felt a sudden relief while Adam was speaking; he perceived
11331: that Adam had no positive knowledge of the past, and that there was no
11332: irrevocable damage done by this evening’s unfortunate rencontre. Adam
11333: could still be deceived. The candid Arthur had brought himself into a
11334: position in which successful lying was his only hope. The hope allayed
11335: his anger a little.
11336: 
11337: “Well, Adam,” he said, in a tone of friendly concession, “you’re
11338: perhaps right. Perhaps I’ve gone a little too far in taking notice of
11339: the pretty little thing and stealing a kiss now and then. You’re such a
11340: grave, steady fellow, you don’t understand the temptation to such
11341: trifling. I’m sure I wouldn’t bring any trouble or annoyance on her and
11342: the good Poysers on any account if I could help it. But I think you
11343: look a little too seriously at it. You know I’m going away immediately,
11344: so I shan’t make any more mistakes of the kind. But let us say
11345: good-night”—Arthur here turned round to walk on—“and talk no more about
11346: the matter. The whole thing will soon be forgotten.”
11347: 
11348: “No, by God!” Adam burst out with rage that could be controlled no
11349: longer, throwing down the basket of tools and striding forward till he
11350: was right in front of Arthur. All his jealousy and sense of personal
11351: injury, which he had been hitherto trying to keep under, had leaped up
11352: and mastered him. What man of us, in the first moments of a sharp
11353: agony, could ever feel that the fellow-man who has been the medium of
11354: inflicting it did not mean to hurt us? In our instinctive rebellion
11355: against pain, we are children again, and demand an active will to wreak
11356: our vengeance on. Adam at this moment could only feel that he had been
11357: robbed of Hetty—robbed treacherously by the man in whom he had
11358: trusted—and he stood close in front of Arthur, with fierce eyes glaring
11359: at him, with pale lips and clenched hands, the hard tones in which he
11360: had hitherto been constraining himself to express no more than a just
11361: indignation giving way to a deep agitated voice that seemed to shake
11362: him as he spoke.
11363: 
11364: “No, it’ll not be soon forgot, as you’ve come in between her and me,
11365: when she might ha’ loved me—it’ll not soon be forgot as you’ve robbed
11366: me o’ my happiness, while I thought you was my best friend, and a
11367: noble-minded man, as I was proud to work for. And you’ve been kissing
11368: her, and meaning nothing, have you? And I never kissed her i’ my
11369: life—but I’d ha’ worked hard for years for the right to kiss her. And
11370: you make light of it. You think little o’ doing what may damage other
11371: folks, so as you get your bit o’ trifling, as means nothing. I throw
11372: back your favours, for you’re not the man I took you for. I’ll never
11373: count you my friend any more. I’d rather you’d act as my enemy, and
11374: fight me where I stand—it’s all th’ amends you can make me.”
11375: 
11376: Poor Adam, possessed by rage that could find no other vent, began to
11377: throw off his coat and his cap, too blind with passion to notice the
11378: change that had taken place in Arthur while he was speaking. Arthur’s
11379: lips were now as pale as Adam’s; his heart was beating violently. The
11380: discovery that Adam loved Hetty was a shock which made him for the
11381: moment see himself in the light of Adam’s indignation, and regard
11382: Adam’s suffering as not merely a consequence, but an element of his
11383: error. The words of hatred and contempt—the first he had ever heard in
11384: his life—seemed like scorching missiles that were making ineffaceable
11385: scars on him. All screening self-excuse, which rarely falls quite away
11386: while others respect us, forsook him for an instant, and he stood face
11387: to face with the first great irrevocable evil he had ever committed. He
11388: was only twenty-one, and three months ago—nay, much later—he had
11389: thought proudly that no man should ever be able to reproach him justly.
11390: His first impulse, if there had been time for it, would perhaps have
11391: been to utter words of propitiation; but Adam had no sooner thrown off
11392: his coat and cap than he became aware that Arthur was standing pale and
11393: motionless, with his hands still thrust in his waistcoat pockets.
11394: 
11395: “What!” he said, “won’t you fight me like a man? You know I won’t
11396: strike you while you stand so.”
11397: 
11398: “Go away, Adam,” said Arthur, “I don’t want to fight you.”
11399: 
11400: “No,” said Adam, bitterly; “you don’t want to fight me—you think I’m a
11401: common man, as you can injure without answering for it.”
11402: 
11403: “I never meant to injure you,” said Arthur, with returning anger. “I
11404: didn’t know you loved her.”
11405: 
11406: “But you’ve made her love _you_,” said Adam. “You’re a double-faced
11407: man—I’ll never believe a word you say again.”
11408: 
11409: “Go away, I tell you,” said Arthur, angrily, “or we shall both repent.”
11410: 
11411: “No,” said Adam, with a convulsed voice, “I swear I won’t go away
11412: without fighting you. Do you want provoking any more? I tell you you’re
11413: a coward and a scoundrel, and I despise you.”
11414: 
11415: The colour had all rushed back to Arthur’s face; in a moment his right
11416: hand was clenched, and dealt a blow like lightning, which sent Adam
11417: staggering backward. His blood was as thoroughly up as Adam’s now, and
11418: the two men, forgetting the emotions that had gone before, fought with
11419: the instinctive fierceness of panthers in the deepening twilight
11420: darkened by the trees. The delicate-handed gentleman was a match for
11421: the workman in everything but strength, and Arthur’s skill enabled him
11422: to protract the struggle for some long moments. But between unarmed men
11423: the battle is to the strong, where the strong is no blunderer, and
11424: Arthur must sink under a well-planted blow of Adam’s as a steel rod is
11425: broken by an iron bar. The blow soon came, and Arthur fell, his head
11426: lying concealed in a tuft of fern, so that Adam could only discern his
11427: darkly clad body.
11428: 
11429: He stood still in the dim light waiting for Arthur to rise.
11430: 
11431: The blow had been given now, towards which he had been straining all
11432: the force of nerve and muscle—and what was the good of it? What had he
11433: done by fighting? Only satisfied his own passion, only wreaked his own
11434: vengeance. He had not rescued Hetty, nor changed the past—there it was,
11435: just as it had been, and he sickened at the vanity of his own rage.
11436: 
11437: But why did not Arthur rise? He was perfectly motionless, and the time
11438: seemed long to Adam. Good God! had the blow been too much for him? Adam
11439: shuddered at the thought of his own strength, as with the oncoming of
11440: this dread he knelt down by Arthur’s side and lifted his head from
11441: among the fern. There was no sign of life: the eyes and teeth were set.
11442: The horror that rushed over Adam completely mastered him, and forced
11443: upon him its own belief. He could feel nothing but that death was in
11444: Arthur’s face, and that he was helpless before it. He made not a single
11445: movement, but knelt like an image of despair gazing at an image of
11446: death.
11447: 
11448: 
11449: 
11450: 
11451: Chapter XXVIII
11452: A Dilemma
11453: 
11454: 
11455: It was only a few minutes measured by the clock—though Adam always
11456: thought it had been a long while—before he perceived a gleam of
11457: consciousness in Arthur’s face and a slight shiver through his frame.
11458: The intense joy that flooded his soul brought back some of the old
11459: affection with it.
11460: 
11461: “Do you feel any pain, sir?” he said, tenderly, loosening Arthur’s
11462: cravat.
11463: 
11464: Arthur turned his eyes on Adam with a vague stare which gave way to a
11465: slightly startled motion as if from the shock of returning memory. But
11466: he only shivered again and said nothing.
11467: 
11468: “Do you feel any hurt, sir?” Adam said again, with a trembling in his
11469: voice.
11470: 
11471: Arthur put his hand up to his waistcoat buttons, and when Adam had
11472: unbuttoned it, he took a longer breath. “Lay my head down,” he said,
11473: faintly, “and get me some water if you can.”
11474: 
11475: Adam laid the head down gently on the fern again, and emptying the
11476: tools out of the flag-basket, hurried through the trees to the edge of
11477: the Grove bordering on the Chase, where a brook ran below the bank.
11478: 
11479: When he returned with his basket leaking, but still half-full, Arthur
11480: looked at him with a more thoroughly reawakened consciousness.
11481: 
11482: “Can you drink a drop out o’ your hand, sir?” said Adam, kneeling down
11483: again to lift up Arthur’s head.
11484: 
11485: “No,” said Arthur, “dip my cravat in and souse it on my head.”
11486: 
11487: The water seemed to do him some good, for he presently raised himself a
11488: little higher, resting on Adam’s arm.
11489: 
11490: “Do you feel any hurt inside sir?” Adam asked again
11491: 
11492: “No—no hurt,” said Arthur, still faintly, “but rather done up.”
11493: 
11494: After a while he said, “I suppose I fainted away when you knocked me
11495: down.”
11496: 
11497: “Yes, sir, thank God,” said Adam. “I thought it was worse.”
11498: 
11499: “What! You thought you’d done for me, eh? Come help me on my legs.”
11500: 
11501: “I feel terribly shaky and dizzy,” Arthur said, as he stood leaning on
11502: Adam’s arm; “that blow of yours must have come against me like a
11503: battering-ram. I don’t believe I can walk alone.”
11504: 
11505: “Lean on me, sir; I’ll get you along,” said Adam. “Or, will you sit
11506: down a bit longer, on my coat here, and I’ll prop y’ up. You’ll perhaps
11507: be better in a minute or two.”
11508: 
11509: “No,” said Arthur. “I’ll go to the Hermitage—I think I’ve got some
11510: brandy there. There’s a short road to it a little farther on, near the
11511: gate. If you’ll just help me on.”
11512: 
11513: They walked slowly, with frequent pauses, but without speaking again.
11514: In both of them, the concentration in the present which had attended
11515: the first moments of Arthur’s revival had now given way to a vivid
11516: recollection of the previous scene. It was nearly dark in the narrow
11517: path among the trees, but within the circle of fir-trees round the
11518: Hermitage there was room for the growing moonlight to enter in at the
11519: windows. Their steps were noiseless on the thick carpet of fir-needles,
11520: and the outward stillness seemed to heighten their inward
11521: consciousness, as Arthur took the key out of his pocket and placed it
11522: in Adam’s hand, for him to open the door. Adam had not known before
11523: that Arthur had furnished the old Hermitage and made it a retreat for
11524: himself, and it was a surprise to him when he opened the door to see a
11525: snug room with all the signs of frequent habitation.
11526: 
11527: Arthur loosed Adam’s arm and threw himself on the ottoman. “You’ll see
11528: my hunting-bottle somewhere,” he said. “A leather case with a bottle
11529: and glass in.”
11530: 
11531: Adam was not long in finding the case. “There’s very little brandy in
11532: it, sir,” he said, turning it downwards over the glass, as he held it
11533: before the window; “hardly this little glassful.”
11534: 
11535: “Well, give me that,” said Arthur, with the peevishness of physical
11536: depression. When he had taken some sips, Adam said, “Hadn’t I better
11537: run to th’ house, sir, and get some more brandy? I can be there and
11538: back pretty soon. It’ll be a stiff walk home for you, if you don’t have
11539: something to revive you.”
11540: 
11541: “Yes—go. But don’t say I’m ill. Ask for my man Pym, and tell him to get
11542: it from Mills, and not to say I’m at the Hermitage. Get some water
11543: too.”
11544: 
11545: Adam was relieved to have an active task—both of them were relieved to
11546: be apart from each other for a short time. But Adam’s swift pace could
11547: not still the eager pain of thinking—of living again with concentrated
11548: suffering through the last wretched hour, and looking out from it over
11549: all the new sad future.
11550: 
11551: Arthur lay still for some minutes after Adam was gone, but presently he
11552: rose feebly from the ottoman and peered about slowly in the broken
11553: moonlight, seeking something. It was a short bit of wax candle that
11554: stood amongst a confusion of writing and drawing materials. There was
11555: more searching for the means of lighting the candle, and when that was
11556: done, he went cautiously round the room, as if wishing to assure
11557: himself of the presence or absence of something. At last he had found a
11558: slight thing, which he put first in his pocket, and then, on a second
11559: thought, took out again and thrust deep down into a waste-paper basket.
11560: It was a woman’s little, pink, silk neckerchief. He set the candle on
11561: the table, and threw himself down on the ottoman again, exhausted with
11562: the effort.
11563: 
11564: When Adam came back with his supplies, his entrance awoke Arthur from a
11565: doze.
11566: 
11567: “That’s right,” Arthur said; “I’m tremendously in want of some
11568: brandy-vigour.”
11569: 
11570: “I’m glad to see you’ve got a light, sir,” said Adam. “I’ve been
11571: thinking I’d better have asked for a lanthorn.”
11572: 
11573: “No, no; the candle will last long enough—I shall soon be up to walking
11574: home now.”
11575: 
11576: “I can’t go before I’ve seen you safe home, sir,” said Adam,
11577: hesitatingly.
11578: 
11579: “No: it will be better for you to stay—sit down.”
11580: 
11581: Adam sat down, and they remained opposite to each other in uneasy
11582: silence, while Arthur slowly drank brandy-and-water, with visibly
11583: renovating effect. He began to lie in a more voluntary position, and
11584: looked as if he were less overpowered by bodily sensations. Adam was
11585: keenly alive to these indications, and as his anxiety about Arthur’s
11586: condition began to be allayed, he felt more of that impatience which
11587: every one knows who has had his just indignation suspended by the
11588: physical state of the culprit. Yet there was one thing on his mind to
11589: be done before he could recur to remonstrance: it was to confess what
11590: had been unjust in his own words. Perhaps he longed all the more to
11591: make this confession, that his indignation might be free again; and as
11592: he saw the signs of returning ease in Arthur, the words again and again
11593: came to his lips and went back, checked by the thought that it would be
11594: better to leave everything till to-morrow. As long as they were silent
11595: they did not look at each other, and a foreboding came across Adam that
11596: if they began to speak as though they remembered the past—if they
11597: looked at each other with full recognition—they must take fire again.
11598: So they sat in silence till the bit of wax candle flickered low in the
11599: socket, the silence all the while becoming more irksome to Adam. Arthur
11600: had just poured out some more brandy-and-water, and he threw one arm
11601: behind his head and drew up one leg in an attitude of recovered ease,
11602: which was an irresistible temptation to Adam to speak what was on his
11603: mind.
11604: 
11605: “You begin to feel more yourself again, sir,” he said, as the candle
11606: went out and they were half-hidden from each other in the faint
11607: moonlight.
11608: 
11609: “Yes: I don’t feel good for much—very lazy, and not inclined to move;
11610: but I’ll go home when I’ve taken this dose.”
11611: 
11612: There was a slight pause before Adam said, “My temper got the better of
11613: me, and I said things as wasn’t true. I’d no right to speak as if you’d
11614: known you was doing me an injury: you’d no grounds for knowing it; I’ve
11615: always kept what I felt for her as secret as I could.”
11616: 
11617: He paused again before he went on.
11618: 
11619: “And perhaps I judged you too harsh—I’m apt to be harsh—and you may
11620: have acted out o’ thoughtlessness more than I should ha’ believed was
11621: possible for a man with a heart and a conscience. We’re not all put
11622: together alike, and we may misjudge one another. God knows, it’s all
11623: the joy I could have now, to think the best of you.”
11624: 
11625: Arthur wanted to go home without saying any more—he was too painfully
11626: embarrassed in mind, as well as too weak in body, to wish for any
11627: further explanation to-night. And yet it was a relief to him that Adam
11628: reopened the subject in a way the least difficult for him to answer.
11629: Arthur was in the wretched position of an open, generous man who has
11630: committed an error which makes deception seem a necessity. The native
11631: impulse to give truth in return for truth, to meet trust with frank
11632: confession, must be suppressed, and duty was becoming a question of
11633: tactics. His deed was reacting upon him—was already governing him
11634: tyrannously and forcing him into a course that jarred with his habitual
11635: feelings. The only aim that seemed admissible to him now was to deceive
11636: Adam to the utmost: to make Adam think better of him than he deserved.
11637: And when he heard the words of honest retractation—when he heard the
11638: sad appeal with which Adam ended—he was obliged to rejoice in the
11639: remains of ignorant confidence it implied. He did not answer
11640: immediately, for he had to be judicious and not truthful.
11641: 
11642: “Say no more about our anger, Adam,” he said, at last, very languidly,
11643: for the labour of speech was unwelcome to him; “I forgive your
11644: momentary injustice—it was quite natural, with the exaggerated notions
11645: you had in your mind. We shall be none the worse friends in future, I
11646: hope, because we’ve fought. You had the best of it, and that was as it
11647: should be, for I believe I’ve been most in the wrong of the two. Come,
11648: let us shake hands.”
11649: 
11650: Arthur held out his hand, but Adam sat still.
11651: 
11652: “I don’t like to say ‘No’ to that, sir,” he said, “but I can’t shake
11653: hands till it’s clear what we mean by’t. I was wrong when I spoke as if
11654: you’d done me an injury knowingly, but I wasn’t wrong in what I said
11655: before, about your behaviour t’ Hetty, and I can’t shake hands with you
11656: as if I held you my friend the same as ever till you’ve cleared that up
11657: better.”
11658: 
11659: Arthur swallowed his pride and resentment as he drew back his hand. He
11660: was silent for some moments, and then said, as indifferently as he
11661: could, “I don’t know what you mean by clearing up, Adam. I’ve told you
11662: already that you think too seriously of a little flirtation. But if you
11663: are right in supposing there is any danger in it—I’m going away on
11664: Saturday, and there will be an end of it. As for the pain it has given
11665: you, I’m heartily sorry for it. I can say no more.”
11666: 
11667: Adam said nothing, but rose from his chair and stood with his face
11668: towards one of the windows, as if looking at the blackness of the
11669: moonlit fir-trees; but he was in reality conscious of nothing but the
11670: conflict within him. It was of no use now—his resolution not to speak
11671: till to-morrow. He must speak there and then. But it was several
11672: minutes before he turned round and stepped nearer to Arthur, standing
11673: and looking down on him as he lay.
11674: 
11675: “It’ll be better for me to speak plain,” he said, with evident effort,
11676: “though it’s hard work. You see, sir, this isn’t a trifle to me,
11677: whatever it may be to you. I’m none o’ them men as can go making love
11678: first to one woman and then t’ another, and don’t think it much odds
11679: which of ’em I take. What I feel for Hetty’s a different sort o’ love,
11680: such as I believe nobody can know much about but them as feel it and
11681: God as has given it to ’em. She’s more nor everything else to me, all
11682: but my conscience and my good name. And if it’s true what you’ve been
11683: saying all along—and if it’s only been trifling and flirting as you
11684: call it, as ’ll be put an end to by your going away—why, then, I’d
11685: wait, and hope her heart ’ud turn to me after all. I’m loath to think
11686: you’d speak false to me, and I’ll believe your word, however things may
11687: look.”
11688: 
11689: “You would be wronging Hetty more than me not to believe it,” said
11690: Arthur, almost violently, starting up from the ottoman and moving away.
11691: But he threw himself into a chair again directly, saying, more feebly,
11692: “You seem to forget that, in suspecting me, you are casting imputations
11693: upon her.”
11694: 
11695: “Nay, sir,” Adam said, in a calmer voice, as if he were
11696: half-relieved—for he was too straightforward to make a distinction
11697: between a direct falsehood and an indirect one—“Nay, sir, things don’t
11698: lie level between Hetty and you. You’re acting with your eyes open,
11699: whatever you may do; but how do you know what’s been in her mind? She’s
11700: all but a child—as any man with a conscience in him ought to feel bound
11701: to take care on. And whatever you may think, I know you’ve disturbed
11702: her mind. I know she’s been fixing her heart on you, for there’s a many
11703: things clear to me now as I didn’t understand before. But you seem to
11704: make light o’ what _she_ may feel—you don’t think o’ that.”
11705: 
11706: “Good God, Adam, let me alone!” Arthur burst out impetuously; “I feel
11707: it enough without your worrying me.”
11708: 
11709: He was aware of his indiscretion as soon as the words had escaped him.
11710: 
11711: “Well, then, if you feel it,” Adam rejoined, eagerly; “if you feel as
11712: you may ha’ put false notions into her mind, and made her believe as
11713: you loved her, when all the while you meant nothing, I’ve this demand
11714: to make of you—I’m not speaking for myself, but for her. I ask you t’
11715: undeceive her before you go away. Y’aren’t going away for ever, and if
11716: you leave her behind with a notion in her head o’ your feeling about
11717: her the same as she feels about you, she’ll be hankering after you, and
11718: the mischief may get worse. It may be a smart to her now, but it’ll
11719: save her pain i’ th’ end. I ask you to write a letter—you may trust to
11720: my seeing as she gets it. Tell her the truth, and take blame to
11721: yourself for behaving as you’d no right to do to a young woman as isn’t
11722: your equal. I speak plain, sir, but I can’t speak any other way.
11723: There’s nobody can take care o’ Hetty in this thing but me.”
11724: 
11725: “I can do what I think needful in the matter,” said Arthur, more and
11726: more irritated by mingled distress and perplexity, “without giving
11727: promises to you. I shall take what measures I think proper.”
11728: 
11729: “No,” said Adam, in an abrupt decided tone, “that won’t do. I must know
11730: what ground I’m treading on. I must be safe as you’ve put an end to
11731: what ought never to ha’ been begun. I don’t forget what’s owing to you
11732: as a gentleman, but in this thing we’re man and man, and I can’t give
11733: up.”
11734: 
11735: There was no answer for some moments. Then Arthur said, “I’ll see you
11736: to-morrow. I can bear no more now; I’m ill.” He rose as he spoke, and
11737: reached his cap, as if intending to go.
11738: 
11739: “You won’t see her again!” Adam exclaimed, with a flash of recurring
11740: anger and suspicion, moving towards the door and placing his back
11741: against it. “Either tell me she can never be my wife—tell me you’ve
11742: been lying—or else promise me what I’ve said.”
11743: 
11744: Adam, uttering this alternative, stood like a terrible fate before
11745: Arthur, who had moved forward a step or two, and now stopped, faint,
11746: shaken, sick in mind and body. It seemed long to both of them—that
11747: inward struggle of Arthur’s—before he said, feebly, “I promise; let me
11748: go.”
11749: 
11750: Adam moved away from the door and opened it, but when Arthur reached
11751: the step, he stopped again and leaned against the door-post.
11752: 
11753: “You’re not well enough to walk alone, sir,” said Adam. “Take my arm
11754: again.”
11755: 
11756: Arthur made no answer, and presently walked on, Adam following. But,
11757: after a few steps, he stood still again, and said, coldly, “I believe I
11758: must trouble you. It’s getting late now, and there may be an alarm set
11759: up about me at home.”
11760: 
11761: Adam gave his arm, and they walked on without uttering a word, till
11762: they came where the basket and the tools lay.
11763: 
11764: “I must pick up the tools, sir,” Adam said. “They’re my brother’s. I
11765: doubt they’ll be rusted. If you’ll please to wait a minute.”
11766: 
11767: Arthur stood still without speaking, and no other word passed between
11768: them till they were at the side entrance, where he hoped to get in
11769: without being seen by any one. He said then, “Thank you; I needn’t
11770: trouble you any further.”
11771: 
11772: “What time will it be conven’ent for me to see you to-morrow, sir?”
11773: said Adam.
11774: 
11775: “You may send me word that you’re here at five o’clock,” said Arthur;
11776: “not before.”
11777: 
11778: “Good-night, sir,” said Adam. But he heard no reply; Arthur had turned
11779: into the house.
11780: 
11781: 
11782: 
11783: 
11784: Chapter XXIX
11785: The Next Morning
11786: 
11787: 
11788: Arthur did not pass a sleepless night; he slept long and well. For
11789: sleep comes to the perplexed—if the perplexed are only weary enough.
11790: But at seven he rang his bell and astonished Pym by declaring he was
11791: going to get up, and must have breakfast brought to him at eight.
11792: 
11793: “And see that my mare is saddled at half-past eight, and tell my
11794: grandfather when he’s down that I’m better this morning and am gone for
11795: a ride.”
11796: 
11797: He had been awake an hour, and could rest in bed no longer. In bed our
11798: yesterdays are too oppressive: if a man can only get up, though it be
11799: but to whistle or to smoke, he has a present which offers some
11800: resistance to the past—sensations which assert themselves against
11801: tyrannous memories. And if there were such a thing as taking averages
11802: of feeling, it would certainly be found that in the hunting and
11803: shooting seasons regret, self-reproach, and mortified pride weigh
11804: lighter on country gentlemen than in late spring and summer. Arthur
11805: felt that he should be more of a man on horseback. Even the presence of
11806: Pym, waiting on him with the usual deference, was a reassurance to him
11807: after the scenes of yesterday. For, with Arthur’s sensitiveness to
11808: opinion, the loss of Adam’s respect was a shock to his self-contentment
11809: which suffused his imagination with the sense that he had sunk in all
11810: eyes—as a sudden shock of fear from some real peril makes a nervous
11811: woman afraid even to step, because all her perceptions are suffused
11812: with a sense of danger.
11813: 
11814: Arthur’s, as you know, was a loving nature. Deeds of kindness were as
11815: easy to him as a bad habit: they were the common issue of his
11816: weaknesses and good qualities, of his egoism and his sympathy. He
11817: didn’t like to witness pain, and he liked to have grateful eyes beaming
11818: on him as the giver of pleasure. When he was a lad of seven, he one day
11819: kicked down an old gardener’s pitcher of broth, from no motive but a
11820: kicking impulse, not reflecting that it was the old man’s dinner; but
11821: on learning that sad fact, he took his favourite pencil-case and a
11822: silver-hafted knife out of his pocket and offered them as compensation.
11823: He had been the same Arthur ever since, trying to make all offences
11824: forgotten in benefits. If there were any bitterness in his nature, it
11825: could only show itself against the man who refused to be conciliated by
11826: him. And perhaps the time was come for some of that bitterness to rise.
11827: At the first moment, Arthur had felt pure distress and self-reproach at
11828: discovering that Adam’s happiness was involved in his relation to
11829: Hetty. If there had been a possibility of making Adam tenfold amends—if
11830: deeds of gift, or any other deeds, could have restored Adam’s
11831: contentment and regard for him as a benefactor, Arthur would not only
11832: have executed them without hesitation, but would have felt bound all
11833: the more closely to Adam, and would never have been weary of making
11834: retribution. But Adam could receive no amends; his suffering could not
11835: be cancelled; his respect and affection could not be recovered by any
11836: prompt deeds of atonement. He stood like an immovable obstacle against
11837: which no pressure could avail; an embodiment of what Arthur most shrank
11838: from believing in—the irrevocableness of his own wrongdoing. The words
11839: of scorn, the refusal to shake hands, the mastery asserted over him in
11840: their last conversation in the Hermitage—above all, the sense of having
11841: been knocked down, to which a man does not very well reconcile himself,
11842: even under the most heroic circumstances—pressed on him with a galling
11843: pain which was stronger than compunction. Arthur would so gladly have
11844: persuaded himself that he had done no harm! And if no one had told him
11845: the contrary, he could have persuaded himself so much better. Nemesis
11846: can seldom forge a sword for herself out of our consciences—out of the
11847: suffering we feel in the suffering we may have caused: there is rarely
11848: metal enough there to make an effective weapon. Our moral sense learns
11849: the manners of good society and smiles when others smile, but when some
11850: rude person gives rough names to our actions, she is apt to take part
11851: against us. And so it was with Arthur: Adam’s judgment of him, Adam’s
11852: grating words, disturbed his self-soothing arguments.
11853: 
11854: Not that Arthur had been at ease before Adam’s discovery. Struggles and
11855: resolves had transformed themselves into compunction and anxiety. He
11856: was distressed for Hetty’s sake, and distressed for his own, that he
11857: must leave her behind. He had always, both in making and breaking
11858: resolutions, looked beyond his passion and seen that it must speedily
11859: end in separation; but his nature was too ardent and tender for him not
11860: to suffer at this parting; and on Hetty’s account he was filled with
11861: uneasiness. He had found out the dream in which she was living—that she
11862: was to be a lady in silks and satins—and when he had first talked to
11863: her about his going away, she had asked him tremblingly to let her go
11864: with him and be married. It was his painful knowledge of this which had
11865: given the most exasperating sting to Adam’s reproaches. He had said no
11866: word with the purpose of deceiving her—her vision was all spun by her
11867: own childish fancy—but he was obliged to confess to himself that it was
11868: spun half out of his own actions. And to increase the mischief, on this
11869: last evening he had not dared to hint the truth to Hetty; he had been
11870: obliged to soothe her with tender, hopeful words, lest he should throw
11871: her into violent distress. He felt the situation acutely, felt the
11872: sorrow of the dear thing in the present, and thought with a darker
11873: anxiety of the tenacity which her feelings might have in the future.
11874: That was the one sharp point which pressed against him; every other he
11875: could evade by hopeful self-persuasion. The whole thing had been
11876: secret; the Poysers had not the shadow of a suspicion. No one, except
11877: Adam, knew anything of what had passed—no one else was likely to know;
11878: for Arthur had impressed on Hetty that it would be fatal to betray, by
11879: word or look, that there had been the least intimacy between them; and
11880: Adam, who knew half their secret, would rather help them to keep it
11881: than betray it. It was an unfortunate business altogether, but there
11882: was no use in making it worse than it was by imaginary exaggerations
11883: and forebodings of evil that might never come. The temporary sadness
11884: for Hetty was the worst consequence; he resolutely turned away his eyes
11885: from any bad consequence that was not demonstrably inevitable. But—but
11886: Hetty might have had the trouble in some other way if not in this. And
11887: perhaps hereafter he might be able to do a great deal for her and make
11888: up to her for all the tears she would shed about him. She would owe the
11889: advantage of his care for her in future years to the sorrow she had
11890: incurred now. _So_ good comes out of evil. Such is the beautiful
11891: arrangement of things!
11892: 
11893: Are you inclined to ask whether this can be the same Arthur who, two
11894: months ago, had that freshness of feeling, that delicate honour which
11895: shrinks from wounding even a sentiment, and does not contemplate any
11896: more positive offence as possible for it?—who thought that his own
11897: self-respect was a higher tribunal than any external opinion? The same,
11898: I assure you, only under different conditions. Our deeds determine us,
11899: as much as we determine our deeds, and until we know what has been or
11900: will be the peculiar combination of outward with inward facts, which
11901: constitutes a man’s critical actions, it will be better not to think
11902: ourselves wise about his character. There is a terrible coercion in our
11903: deeds, which may first turn the honest man into a deceiver and then
11904: reconcile him to the change, for this reason—that the second wrong
11905: presents itself to him in the guise of the only practicable right. The
11906: action which before commission has been seen with that blended common
11907: sense and fresh untarnished feeling which is the healthy eye of the
11908: soul, is looked at afterwards with the lens of apologetic ingenuity,
11909: through which all things that men call beautiful and ugly are seen to
11910: be made up of textures very much alike. Europe adjusts itself to a
11911: _fait accompli_, and so does an individual character—until the placid
11912: adjustment is disturbed by a convulsive retribution.
11913: 
11914: No man can escape this vitiating effect of an offence against his own
11915: sentiment of right, and the effect was the stronger in Arthur because
11916: of that very need of self-respect which, while his conscience was still
11917: at ease, was one of his best safeguards. Self-accusation was too
11918: painful to him—he could not face it. He must persuade himself that he
11919: had not been very much to blame; he began even to pity himself for the
11920: necessity he was under of deceiving Adam—it was a course so opposed to
11921: the honesty of his own nature. But then, it was the only right thing to
11922: do.
11923: 
11924: Well, whatever had been amiss in him, he was miserable enough in
11925: consequence: miserable about Hetty; miserable about this letter that he
11926: had promised to write, and that seemed at one moment to be a gross
11927: barbarity, at another perhaps the greatest kindness he could do to her.
11928: And across all this reflection would dart every now and then a sudden
11929: impulse of passionate defiance towards all consequences. He would carry
11930: Hetty away, and all other considerations might go to....
11931: 
11932: In this state of mind the four walls of his room made an intolerable
11933: prison to him; they seemed to hem in and press down upon him all the
11934: crowd of contradictory thoughts and conflicting feelings, some of which
11935: would fly away in the open air. He had only an hour or two to make up
11936: his mind in, and he must get clear and calm. Once on Meg’s back, in the
11937: fresh air of that fine morning, he should be more master of the
11938: situation.
11939: 
11940: The pretty creature arched her bay neck in the sunshine, and pawed the
11941: gravel, and trembled with pleasure when her master stroked her nose,
11942: and patted her, and talked to her even in a more caressing tone than
11943: usual. He loved her the better because she knew nothing of his secrets.
11944: But Meg was quite as well acquainted with her master’s mental state as
11945: many others of her sex with the mental condition of the nice young
11946: gentlemen towards whom their hearts are in a state of fluttering
11947: expectation.
11948: 
11949: Arthur cantered for five miles beyond the Chase, till he was at the
11950: foot of a hill where there were no hedges or trees to hem in the road.
11951: Then he threw the bridle on Meg’s neck and prepared to make up his
11952: mind.
11953: 
11954: Hetty knew that their meeting yesterday must be the last before Arthur
11955: went away—there was no possibility of their contriving another without
11956: exciting suspicion—and she was like a frightened child, unable to think
11957: of anything, only able to cry at the mention of parting, and then put
11958: her face up to have the tears kissed away. He _could_ do nothing but
11959: comfort her, and lull her into dreaming on. A letter would be a
11960: dreadfully abrupt way of awakening her! Yet there was truth in what
11961: Adam said—that it would save her from a lengthened delusion, which
11962: might be worse than a sharp immediate pain. And it was the only way of
11963: satisfying Adam, who _must_ be satisfied, for more reasons than one. If
11964: he could have seen her again! But that was impossible; there was such a
11965: thorny hedge of hindrances between them, and an imprudence would be
11966: fatal. And yet, if he _could_ see her again, what good would it do?
11967: Only cause him to suffer more from the sight of her distress and the
11968: remembrance of it. Away from him she was surrounded by all the motives
11969: to self-control.
11970: 
11971: A sudden dread here fell like a shadow across his imagination—the dread
11972: lest she should do something violent in her grief; and close upon that
11973: dread came another, which deepened the shadow. But he shook them off
11974: with the force of youth and hope. What was the ground for painting the
11975: future in that dark way? It was just as likely to be the reverse.
11976: Arthur told himself he did not deserve that things should turn out
11977: badly. He had never meant beforehand to do anything his conscience
11978: disapproved; he had been led on by circumstances. There was a sort of
11979: implicit confidence in him that he was really such a good fellow at
11980: bottom, Providence would not treat him harshly.
11981: 
11982: At all events, he couldn’t help what would come now: all he could do
11983: was to take what seemed the best course at the present moment. And he
11984: persuaded himself that that course was to make the way open between
11985: Adam and Hetty. Her heart might really turn to Adam, as he said, after
11986: a while; and in that case there would have been no great harm done,
11987: since it was still Adam’s ardent wish to make her his wife. To be sure,
11988: Adam was deceived—deceived in a way that Arthur would have resented as
11989: a deep wrong if it had been practised on himself. That was a reflection
11990: that marred the consoling prospect. Arthur’s cheeks even burned in
11991: mingled shame and irritation at the thought. But what could a man do in
11992: such a dilemma? He was bound in honour to say no word that could injure
11993: Hetty: his first duty was to guard _her_. He would never have told or
11994: acted a lie on his own account. Good God! What a miserable fool he was
11995: to have brought himself into such a dilemma; and yet, if ever a man had
11996: excuses, he had. (Pity that consequences are determined not by excuses
11997: but by actions!)
11998: 
11999: Well, the letter must be written; it was the only means that promised a
12000: solution of the difficulty. The tears came into Arthur’s eyes as he
12001: thought of Hetty reading it; but it would be almost as hard for him to
12002: write it; he was not doing anything easy to himself; and this last
12003: thought helped him to arrive at a conclusion. He could never
12004: deliberately have taken a step which inflicted pain on another and left
12005: himself at ease. Even a movement of jealousy at the thought of giving
12006: up Hetty to Adam went to convince him that he was making a sacrifice.
12007: 
12008: When once he had come to this conclusion, he turned Meg round and set
12009: off home again in a canter. The letter should be written the first
12010: thing, and the rest of the day would be filled up with other business:
12011: he should have no time to look behind him. Happily, Irwine and Gawaine
12012: were coming to dinner, and by twelve o’clock the next day he should
12013: have left the Chase miles behind him. There was some security in this
12014: constant occupation against an uncontrollable impulse seizing him to
12015: rush to Hetty and thrust into her hand some mad proposition that would
12016: undo everything. Faster and faster went the sensitive Meg, at every
12017: slight sign from her rider, till the canter had passed into a swift
12018: gallop.
12019: 
12020: “I thought they said th’ young mester war took ill last night,” said
12021: sour old John, the groom, at dinner-time in the servants’ hall. “He’s
12022: been ridin’ fit to split the mare i’ two this forenoon.”
12023: 
12024: “That’s happen one o’ the symptims, John,” said the facetious coachman.
12025: 
12026: “Then I wish he war let blood for ’t, that’s all,” said John, grimly.
12027: 
12028: Adam had been early at the Chase to know how Arthur was, and had been
12029: relieved from all anxiety about the effects of his blow by learning
12030: that he was gone out for a ride. At five o’clock he was punctually
12031: there again, and sent up word of his arrival. In a few minutes Pym came
12032: down with a letter in his hand and gave it to Adam, saying that the
12033: captain was too busy to see him, and had written everything he had to
12034: say. The letter was directed to Adam, but he went out of doors again
12035: before opening it. It contained a sealed enclosure directed to Hetty.
12036: On the inside of the cover Adam read:
12037: 
12038: “In the enclosed letter I have written everything you wish. I leave it
12039: to you to decide whether you will be doing best to deliver it to Hetty
12040: or to return it to me. Ask yourself once more whether you are not
12041: taking a measure which may pain her more than mere silence.
12042:     “There is no need for our seeing each other again now. We shall
12043:     meet with better feelings some months hence.
12044: 
12045: 
12046: “A.D.”
12047: 
12048: 
12049: “Perhaps he’s i’ th’ right on ’t not to see me,” thought Adam. “It’s no
12050: use meeting to say more hard words, and it’s no use meeting to shake
12051: hands and say we’re friends again. We’re not friends, an’ it’s better
12052: not to pretend it. I know forgiveness is a man’s duty, but, to my
12053: thinking, that can only mean as you’re to give up all thoughts o’
12054: taking revenge: it can never mean as you’re t’ have your old feelings
12055: back again, for that’s not possible. He’s not the same man to me, and I
12056: can’t _feel_ the same towards him. God help me! I don’t know whether I
12057: feel the same towards anybody: I seem as if I’d been measuring my work
12058: from a false line, and had got it all to measure over again.”
12059: 
12060: But the question about delivering the letter to Hetty soon absorbed
12061: Adam’s thoughts. Arthur had procured some relief to himself by throwing
12062: the decision on Adam with a warning; and Adam, who was not given to
12063: hesitation, hesitated here. He determined to feel his way—to ascertain
12064: as well as he could what was Hetty’s state of mind before he decided on
12065: delivering the letter.
12066: 
12067:

12070: Chapter XXX
12071: The Delivery of the Letter
12072: 
12073: 
12074: The next Sunday Adam joined the Poysers on their way out of church,
12075: hoping for an invitation to go home with them. He had the letter in his
12076: pocket, and was anxious to have an opportunity of talking to Hetty
12077: alone. He could not see her face at church, for she had changed her
12078: seat, and when he came up to her to shake hands, her manner was
12079: doubtful and constrained. He expected this, for it was the first time
12080: she had met him since she had been aware that he had seen her with
12081: Arthur in the Grove.
12082: 
12083: “Come, you’ll go on with us, Adam,” Mr. Poyser said when they reached
12084: the turning; and as soon as they were in the fields Adam ventured to
12085: offer his arm to Hetty. The children soon gave them an opportunity of
12086: lingering behind a little, and then Adam said:
12087: 
12088: “Will you contrive for me to walk out in the garden a bit with you this
12089: evening, if it keeps fine, Hetty? I’ve something partic’lar to talk to
12090: you about.”
12091: 
12092: Hetty said, “Very well.” She was really as anxious as Adam was that she
12093: should have some private talk with him. She wondered what he thought of
12094: her and Arthur. He must have seen them kissing, she knew, but she had
12095: no conception of the scene that had taken place between Arthur and
12096: Adam. Her first feeling had been that Adam would be very angry with
12097: her, and perhaps would tell her aunt and uncle, but it never entered
12098: her mind that he would dare to say anything to Captain Donnithorne. It
12099: was a relief to her that he behaved so kindly to her to-day, and wanted
12100: to speak to _her_ alone; for she had trembled when she found he was
12101: going home with them lest he should mean “to tell.” But, now he wanted
12102: to talk to her by herself, she should learn what he thought and what he
12103: meant to do. She felt a certain confidence that she could persuade him
12104: not to do anything she did not want him to do; she could perhaps even
12105: make him believe that she didn’t care for Arthur; and as long as Adam
12106: thought there was any hope of her having him, he would do just what she
12107: liked, she knew. Besides, she _must_ go on seeming to encourage Adam,
12108: lest her uncle and aunt should be angry and suspect her of having some
12109: secret lover.
12110: 
12111: Hetty’s little brain was busy with this combination as she hung on
12112: Adam’s arm and said “yes” or “no” to some slight observations of his
12113: about the many hawthorn-berries there would be for the birds this next
12114: winter, and the low-hanging clouds that would hardly hold up till
12115: morning. And when they rejoined her aunt and uncle, she could pursue
12116: her thoughts without interruption, for Mr. Poyser held that though a
12117: young man might like to have the woman he was courting on his arm, he
12118: would nevertheless be glad of a little reasonable talk about business
12119: the while; and, for his own part, he was curious to hear the most
12120: recent news about the Chase Farm. So, through the rest of the walk, he
12121: claimed Adam’s conversation for himself, and Hetty laid her small plots
12122: and imagined her little scenes of cunning blandishment, as she walked
12123: along by the hedgerows on honest Adam’s arm, quite as well as if she
12124: had been an elegantly clad coquette alone in her boudoir. For if a
12125: country beauty in clumsy shoes be only shallow-hearted enough, it is
12126: astonishing how closely her mental processes may resemble those of a
12127: lady in society and crinoline, who applies her refined intellect to the
12128: problem of committing indiscretions without compromising herself.
12129: Perhaps the resemblance was not much the less because Hetty felt very
12130: unhappy all the while. The parting with Arthur was a double pain to
12131: her—mingling with the tumult of passion and vanity there was a dim
12132: undefined fear that the future might shape itself in some way quite
12133: unlike her dream. She clung to the comforting hopeful words Arthur had
12134: uttered in their last meeting—“I shall come again at Christmas, and
12135: then we will see what can be done.” She clung to the belief that he was
12136: so fond of her, he would never be happy without her; and she still
12137: hugged her secret—that a great gentleman loved her—with gratified
12138: pride, as a superiority over all the girls she knew. But the
12139: uncertainty of the future, the possibilities to which she could give no
12140: shape, began to press upon her like the invisible weight of air; she
12141: was alone on her little island of dreams, and all around her was the
12142: dark unknown water where Arthur was gone. She could gather no elation
12143: of spirits now by looking forward, but only by looking backward to
12144: build confidence on past words and caresses. But occasionally, since
12145: Thursday evening, her dim anxieties had been almost lost behind the
12146: more definite fear that Adam might betray what he knew to her uncle and
12147: aunt, and his sudden proposition to talk with her alone had set her
12148: thoughts to work in a new way. She was eager not to lose this evening’s
12149: opportunity; and after tea, when the boys were going into the garden
12150: and Totty begged to go with them, Hetty said, with an alacrity that
12151: surprised Mrs. Poyser, “I’ll go with her, Aunt.”
12152: 
12153: It did not seem at all surprising that Adam said he would go too, and
12154: soon he and Hetty were left alone together on the walk by the
12155: filbert-trees, while the boys were busy elsewhere gathering the large
12156: unripe nuts to play at “cob-nut” with, and Totty was watching them with
12157: a puppylike air of contemplation. It was but a short time—hardly two
12158: months—since Adam had had his mind filled with delicious hopes as he
12159: stood by Hetty’s side in this garden. The remembrance of that scene had
12160: often been with him since Thursday evening: the sunlight through the
12161: apple-tree boughs, the red bunches, Hetty’s sweet blush. It came
12162: importunately now, on this sad evening, with the low-hanging clouds,
12163: but he tried to suppress it, lest some emotion should impel him to say
12164: more than was needful for Hetty’s sake.
12165: 
12166: “After what I saw on Thursday night, Hetty,” he began, “you won’t think
12167: me making too free in what I’m going to say. If you was being courted
12168: by any man as ’ud make you his wife, and I’d known you was fond of him
12169: and meant to have him, I should have no right to speak a word to you
12170: about it; but when I see you’re being made love to by a gentleman as
12171: can never marry you, and doesna think o’ marrying you, I feel bound t’
12172: interfere for you. I can’t speak about it to them as are i’ the place
12173: o’ your parents, for that might bring worse trouble than’s needful.”
12174: 
12175: Adam’s words relieved one of Hetty’s fears, but they also carried a
12176: meaning which sickened her with a strengthened foreboding. She was pale
12177: and trembling, and yet she would have angrily contradicted Adam, if she
12178: had dared to betray her feelings. But she was silent.
12179: 
12180: “You’re so young, you know, Hetty,” he went on, almost tenderly, “and
12181: y’ haven’t seen much o’ what goes on in the world. It’s right for me to
12182: do what I can to save you from getting into trouble for want o’ your
12183: knowing where you’re being led to. If anybody besides me knew what I
12184: know about your meeting a gentleman and having fine presents from him,
12185: they’d speak light on you, and you’d lose your character. And besides
12186: that, you’ll have to suffer in your feelings, wi’ giving your love to a
12187: man as can never marry you, so as he might take care of you all your
12188: life.”
12189: 
12190: Adam paused and looked at Hetty, who was plucking the leaves from the
12191: filbert-trees and tearing them up in her hand. Her little plans and
12192: preconcerted speeches had all forsaken her, like an ill-learnt lesson,
12193: under the terrible agitation produced by Adam’s words. There was a
12194: cruel force in their calm certainty which threatened to grapple and
12195: crush her flimsy hopes and fancies. She wanted to resist them—she
12196: wanted to throw them off with angry contradiction—but the determination
12197: to conceal what she felt still governed her. It was nothing more than a
12198: blind prompting now, for she was unable to calculate the effect of her
12199: words.
12200: 
12201: “You’ve no right to say as I love him,” she said, faintly, but
12202: impetuously, plucking another rough leaf and tearing it up. She was
12203: very beautiful in her paleness and agitation, with her dark childish
12204: eyes dilated and her breath shorter than usual. Adam’s heart yearned
12205: over her as he looked at her. Ah, if he could but comfort her, and
12206: soothe her, and save her from this pain; if he had but some sort of
12207: strength that would enable him to rescue her poor troubled mind, as he
12208: would have rescued her body in the face of all danger!
12209: 
12210: “I doubt it must be so, Hetty,” he said, tenderly; “for I canna believe
12211: you’d let any man kiss you by yourselves, and give you a gold box with
12212: his hair, and go a-walking i’ the Grove to meet him, if you didna love
12213: him. I’m not blaming you, for I know it ’ud begin by little and little,
12214: till at last you’d not be able to throw it off. It’s him I blame for
12215: stealing your love i’ that way, when he knew he could never make you
12216: the right amends. He’s been trifling with you, and making a plaything
12217: of you, and caring nothing about you as a man ought to care.”
12218: 
12219: “Yes, he does care for me; I know better nor you,” Hetty burst out.
12220: Everything was forgotten but the pain and anger she felt at Adam’s
12221: words.
12222: 
12223: “Nay, Hetty,” said Adam, “if he’d cared for you rightly, he’d never ha’
12224: behaved so. He told me himself he meant nothing by his kissing and
12225: presents, and he wanted to make me believe as you thought light of ’em
12226: too. But I know better nor that. I can’t help thinking as you’ve been
12227: trusting to his loving you well enough to marry you, for all he’s a
12228: gentleman. And that’s why I must speak to you about it, Hetty, for fear
12229: you should be deceiving yourself. It’s never entered his head the
12230: thought o’ marrying you.”
12231: 
12232: “How do you know? How durst you say so?” said Hetty, pausing in her
12233: walk and trembling. The terrible decision of Adam’s tone shook her with
12234: fear. She had no presence of mind left for the reflection that Arthur
12235: would have his reasons for not telling the truth to Adam. Her words and
12236: look were enough to determine Adam: he must give her the letter.
12237: 
12238: “Perhaps you can’t believe me, Hetty, because you think too well of
12239: him—because you think he loves you better than he does. But I’ve got a
12240: letter i’ my pocket, as he wrote himself for me to give you. I’ve not
12241: read the letter, but he says he’s told you the truth in it. But before
12242: I give you the letter, consider, Hetty, and don’t let it take too much
12243: hold on you. It wouldna ha’ been good for you if he’d wanted to do such
12244: a mad thing as marry you: it ’ud ha’ led to no happiness i’ th’ end.”
12245: 
12246: Hetty said nothing; she felt a revival of hope at the mention of a
12247: letter which Adam had not read. There would be something quite
12248: different in it from what he thought.
12249: 
12250: Adam took out the letter, but he held it in his hand still, while he
12251: said, in a tone of tender entreaty, “Don’t you bear me ill will, Hetty,
12252: because I’m the means o’ bringing you this pain. God knows I’d ha’
12253: borne a good deal worse for the sake o’ sparing it you. And
12254: think—there’s nobody but me knows about this, and I’ll take care of you
12255: as if I was your brother. You’re the same as ever to me, for I don’t
12256: believe you’ve done any wrong knowingly.”
12257: 
12258: Hetty had laid her hand on the letter, but Adam did not loose it till
12259: he had done speaking. She took no notice of what he said—she had not
12260: listened; but when he loosed the letter, she put it into her pocket,
12261: without opening it, and then began to walk more quickly, as if she
12262: wanted to go in.
12263: 
12264: “You’re in the right not to read it just yet,” said Adam. “Read it when
12265: you’re by yourself. But stay out a little bit longer, and let us call
12266: the children: you look so white and ill, your aunt may take notice of
12267: it.”
12268: 
12269: Hetty heard the warning. It recalled to her the necessity of rallying
12270: her native powers of concealment, which had half given way under the
12271: shock of Adam’s words. And she had the letter in her pocket: she was
12272: sure there was comfort in that letter in spite of Adam. She ran to find
12273: Totty, and soon reappeared with recovered colour, leading Totty, who
12274: was making a sour face because she had been obliged to throw away an
12275: unripe apple that she had set her small teeth in.
12276: 
12277: “Hegh, Totty,” said Adam, “come and ride on my shoulder—ever so
12278: high—you’ll touch the tops o’ the trees.”
12279: 
12280: What little child ever refused to be comforted by that glorious sense
12281: of being seized strongly and swung upward? I don’t believe Ganymede
12282: cried when the eagle carried him away, and perhaps deposited him on
12283: Jove’s shoulder at the end. Totty smiled down complacently from her
12284: secure height, and pleasant was the sight to the mother’s eyes, as she
12285: stood at the house door and saw Adam coming with his small burden.
12286: 
12287: “Bless your sweet face, my pet,” she said, the mother’s strong love
12288: filling her keen eyes with mildness, as Totty leaned forward and put
12289: out her arms. She had no eyes for Hetty at that moment, and only said,
12290: without looking at her, “You go and draw some ale, Hetty; the gells are
12291: both at the cheese.”
12292: 
12293: After the ale had been drawn and her uncle’s pipe lighted, there was
12294: Totty to be taken to bed, and brought down again in her night-gown
12295: because she would cry instead of going to sleep. Then there was supper
12296: to be got ready, and Hetty must be continually in the way to give help.
12297: Adam stayed till he knew Mrs. Poyser expected him to go, engaging her
12298: and her husband in talk as constantly as he could, for the sake of
12299: leaving Hetty more at ease. He lingered, because he wanted to see her
12300: safely through that evening, and he was delighted to find how much
12301: self-command she showed. He knew she had not had time to read the
12302: letter, but he did not know she was buoyed up by a secret hope that the
12303: letter would contradict everything he had said. It was hard work for
12304: him to leave her—hard to think that he should not know for days how she
12305: was bearing her trouble. But he must go at last, and all he could do
12306: was to press her hand gently as he said “Good-bye,” and hope she would
12307: take that as a sign that if his love could ever be a refuge for her, it
12308: was there the same as ever. How busy his thoughts were, as he walked
12309: home, in devising pitying excuses for her folly, in referring all her
12310: weakness to the sweet lovingness of her nature, in blaming Arthur, with
12311: less and less inclination to admit that _his_ conduct might be
12312: extenuated too! His exasperation at Hetty’s suffering—and also at the
12313: sense that she was possibly thrust for ever out of his own
12314: reach—deafened him to any plea for the miscalled friend who had wrought
12315: this misery. Adam was a clear-sighted, fair-minded man—a fine fellow,
12316: indeed, morally as well as physically. But if Aristides the Just was
12317: ever in love and jealous, he was at that moment not perfectly
12318: magnanimous. And I cannot pretend that Adam, in these painful days,
12319: felt nothing but righteous indignation and loving pity. He was bitterly
12320: jealous, and in proportion as his love made him indulgent in his
12321: judgment of Hetty, the bitterness found a vent in his feeling towards
12322: Arthur.
12323: 
12324: “Her head was allays likely to be turned,” he thought, “when a
12325: gentleman, with his fine manners, and fine clothes, and his white
12326: hands, and that way o’ talking gentlefolks have, came about her, making
12327: up to her in a bold way, as a man couldn’t do that was only her equal;
12328: and it’s much if she’ll ever like a common man now.” He could not help
12329: drawing his own hands out of his pocket and looking at them—at the hard
12330: palms and the broken finger-nails. “I’m a roughish fellow, altogether;
12331: I don’t know, now I come to think on’t, what there is much for a woman
12332: to like about me; and yet I might ha’ got another wife easy enough, if
12333: I hadn’t set my heart on her. But it’s little matter what other women
12334: think about me, if she can’t love me. She might ha’ loved me, perhaps,
12335: as likely as any other man—there’s nobody hereabouts as I’m afraid of,
12336: if _he_ hadn’t come between us; but now I shall belike be hateful to
12337: her because I’m so different to him. And yet there’s no telling—she may
12338: turn round the other way, when she finds he’s made light of her all the
12339: while. She may come to feel the vally of a man as ’ud be thankful to be
12340: bound to her all his life. But I must put up with it whichever way it
12341: is—I’ve only to be thankful it’s been no worse. I am not th’ only man
12342: that’s got to do without much happiness i’ this life. There’s many a
12343: good bit o’ work done with a bad heart. It’s God’s will, and that’s
12344: enough for us: we shouldn’t know better how things ought to be than He
12345: does, I reckon, if we was to spend our lives i’ puzzling. But it ’ud
12346: ha’ gone near to spoil my work for me, if I’d seen her brought to
12347: sorrow and shame, and through the man as I’ve always been proud to
12348: think on. Since I’ve been spared that, I’ve no right to grumble. When a
12349: man’s got his limbs whole, he can bear a smart cut or two.”
12350: 
12351: As Adam was getting over a stile at this point in his reflections, he
12352: perceived a man walking along the field before him. He knew it was
12353: Seth, returning from an evening preaching, and made haste to overtake
12354: him.
12355: 
12356: “I thought thee’dst be at home before me,” he said, as Seth turned
12357: round to wait for him, “for I’m later than usual to-night.”
12358: 
12359: “Well, I’m later too, for I got into talk, after meeting, with John
12360: Barnes, who has lately professed himself in a state of perfection, and
12361: I’d a question to ask him about his experience. It’s one o’ them
12362: subjects that lead you further than y’ expect—they don’t lie along the
12363: straight road.”
12364: 
12365: They walked along together in silence two or three minutes. Adam was
12366: not inclined to enter into the subtleties of religious experience, but
12367: he was inclined to interchange a word or two of brotherly affection and
12368: confidence with Seth. That was a rare impulse in him, much as the
12369: brothers loved each other. They hardly ever spoke of personal matters,
12370: or uttered more than an allusion to their family troubles. Adam was by
12371: nature reserved in all matters of feeling, and Seth felt a certain
12372: timidity towards his more practical brother.
12373: 
12374: “Seth, lad,” Adam said, putting his arm on his brother’s shoulder,
12375: “hast heard anything from Dinah Morris since she went away?”
12376: 
12377: “Yes,” said Seth. “She told me I might write her word after a while,
12378: how we went on, and how mother bore up under her trouble. So I wrote to
12379: her a fortnight ago, and told her about thee having a new employment,
12380: and how Mother was more contented; and last Wednesday, when I called at
12381: the post at Treddles’on, I found a letter from her. I think thee’dst
12382: perhaps like to read it, but I didna say anything about it because
12383: thee’st seemed so full of other things. It’s quite easy t’ read—she
12384: writes wonderful for a woman.”
12385: 
12386: Seth had drawn the letter from his pocket and held it out to Adam, who
12387: said, as he took it, “Aye, lad, I’ve got a tough load to carry just
12388: now—thee mustna take it ill if I’m a bit silenter and crustier nor
12389: usual. Trouble doesna make me care the less for thee. I know we shall
12390: stick together to the last.”
12391: 
12392: “I take nought ill o’ thee, Adam. I know well enough what it means if
12393: thee’t a bit short wi’ me now and then.”
12394: 
12395: “There’s Mother opening the door to look out for us,” said Adam, as
12396: they mounted the slope. “She’s been sitting i’ the dark as usual. Well,
12397: Gyp, well, art glad to see me?”
12398: 
12399: Lisbeth went in again quickly and lighted a candle, for she had heard
12400: the welcome rustling of footsteps on the grass, before Gyp’s joyful
12401: bark.
12402: 
12403: “Eh, my lads! Th’ hours war ne’er so long sin’ I war born as they’n
12404: been this blessed Sunday night. What can ye both ha’ been doin’ till
12405: this time?”
12406: 
12407: “Thee shouldstna sit i’ the dark, Mother,” said Adam; “that makes the
12408: time seem longer.”
12409: 
12410: “Eh, what am I to do wi’ burnin’ candle of a Sunday, when there’s on’y
12411: me an’ it’s sin to do a bit o’ knittin’? The daylight’s long enough for
12412: me to stare i’ the booke as I canna read. It ’ud be a fine way o’
12413: shortenin’ the time, to make it waste the good candle. But which on
12414: you’s for ha’in’ supper? Ye mun ayther be clemmed or full, I should
12415: think, seein’ what time o’ night it is.”
12416: 
12417: “I’m hungry, Mother,” said Seth, seating himself at the little table,
12418: which had been spread ever since it was light.
12419: 
12420: “I’ve had my supper,” said Adam. “Here, Gyp,” he added, taking some
12421: cold potato from the table and rubbing the rough grey head that looked
12422: up towards him.
12423: 
12424: “Thee needstna be gi’in’ th’ dog,” said Lisbeth; “I’n fed him well
12425: a’ready. I’m not like to forget him, I reckon, when he’s all o’ thee I
12426: can get sight on.”
12427: 
12428: “Come, then, Gyp,” said Adam, “we’ll go to bed. Good-night, Mother; I’m
12429: very tired.”
12430: 
12431: “What ails him, dost know?” Lisbeth said to Seth, when Adam was gone
12432: upstairs. “He’s like as if he was struck for death this day or two—he’s
12433: so cast down. I found him i’ the shop this forenoon, arter thee wast
12434: gone, a-sittin’ an’ doin’ nothin’—not so much as a booke afore him.”
12435: 
12436: “He’s a deal o’ work upon him just now, Mother,” said Seth, “and I
12437: think he’s a bit troubled in his mind. Don’t you take notice of it,
12438: because it hurts him when you do. Be as kind to him as you can, Mother,
12439: and don’t say anything to vex him.”
12440: 
12441: “Eh, what dost talk o’ my vexin’ him? An’ what am I like to be but
12442: kind? I’ll ma’ him a kettle-cake for breakfast i’ the mornin’.”
12443: 
12444: Adam, meanwhile, was reading Dinah’s letter by the light of his dip
12445: candle.
12446: 
12447: DEAR BROTHER SETH—Your letter lay three days beyond my knowing of it at
12448: the post, for I had not money enough by me to pay the carriage, this
12449: being a time of great need and sickness here, with the rains that have
12450: fallen, as if the windows of heaven were opened again; and to lay by
12451: money, from day to day, in such a time, when there are so many in
12452: present need of all things, would be a want of trust like the laying up
12453: of the manna. I speak of this, because I would not have you think me
12454: slow to answer, or that I had small joy in your rejoicing at the
12455: worldly good that has befallen your brother Adam. The honour and love
12456: you bear him is nothing but meet, for God has given him great gifts,
12457: and he uses them as the patriarch Joseph did, who, when he was exalted
12458: to a place of power and trust, yet yearned with tenderness towards his
12459: parent and his younger brother.
12460: 
12461: “My heart is knit to your aged mother since it was granted me to be
12462: near her in the day of trouble. Speak to her of me, and tell her I
12463: often bear her in my thoughts at evening time, when I am sitting in the
12464: dim light as I did with her, and we held one another’s hands, and I
12465: spoke the words of comfort that were given to me. Ah, that is a blessed
12466: time, isn’t it, Seth, when the outward light is fading, and the body is
12467: a little wearied with its work and its labour. Then the inward light
12468: shines the brighter, and we have a deeper sense of resting on the
12469: Divine strength. I sit on my chair in the dark room and close my eyes,
12470: and it is as if I was out of the body and could feel no want for
12471: evermore. For then, the very hardship, and the sorrow, and the
12472: blindness, and the sin I have beheld and been ready to weep over—yea,
12473: all the anguish of the children of men, which sometimes wraps me round
12474: like sudden darkness—I can bear with a willing pain, as if I was
12475: sharing the Redeemer’s cross. For I feel it, I feel it—infinite love is
12476: suffering too—yea, in the fulness of knowledge it suffers, it yearns,
12477: it mourns; and that is a blind self-seeking which wants to be freed
12478: from the sorrow wherewith the whole creation groaneth and travaileth.
12479: Surely it is not true blessedness to be free from sorrow, while there
12480: is sorrow and sin in the world: sorrow is then a part of love, and love
12481: does not seek to throw it off. It is not the spirit only that tells me
12482: this—I see it in the whole work and word of the Gospel. Is there not
12483: pleading in heaven? Is not the Man of Sorrows there in that crucified
12484: body wherewith he ascended? And is He not one with the Infinite Love
12485: itself—as our love is one with our sorrow?
12486: 
12487: “These thoughts have been much borne in on me of late, and I have seen
12488: with new clearness the meaning of those words, ‘If any man love me, let
12489: him take up my cross.’ I have heard this enlarged on as if it meant the
12490: troubles and persecutions we bring on ourselves by confessing Jesus.
12491: But surely that is a narrow thought. The true cross of the Redeemer was
12492: the sin and sorrow of this world—_that_ was what lay heavy on his
12493: heart—and that is the cross we shall share with him, that is the cup we
12494: must drink of with him, if we would have any part in that Divine Love
12495: which is one with his sorrow.
12496: 
12497: “In my outward lot, which you ask about, I have all things and abound.
12498: I have had constant work in the mill, though some of the other hands
12499: have been turned off for a time, and my body is greatly strengthened,
12500: so that I feel little weariness after long walking and speaking. What
12501: you say about staying in your own country with your mother and brother
12502: shows me that you have a true guidance; your lot is appointed there by
12503: a clear showing, and to seek a greater blessing elsewhere would be like
12504: laying a false offering on the altar and expecting the fire from heaven
12505: to kindle it. My work and my joy are here among the hills, and I
12506: sometimes think I cling too much to my life among the people here, and
12507: should be rebellious if I was called away.
12508: 
12509: “I was thankful for your tidings about the dear friends at the Hall
12510: Farm, for though I sent them a letter, by my aunt’s desire, after I
12511: came back from my sojourn among them, I have had no word from them. My
12512: aunt has not the pen of a ready writer, and the work of the house is
12513: sufficient for the day, for she is weak in body. My heart cleaves to
12514: her and her children as the nearest of all to me in the flesh—yea, and
12515: to all in that house. I am carried away to them continually in my
12516: sleep, and often in the midst of work, and even of speech, the thought
12517: of them is borne in on me as if they were in need and trouble, which
12518: yet is dark to me. There may be some leading here; but I wait to be
12519: taught. You say they are all well.
12520: 
12521: “We shall see each other again in the body, I trust, though, it may be,
12522: not for a long while; for the brethren and sisters at Leeds are
12523: desirous to have me for a short space among them, when I have a door
12524: opened me again to leave Snowfield.
12525: 
12526: “Farewell, dear brother—and yet not farewell. For those children of God
12527: whom it has been granted to see each other face to face, and to hold
12528: communion together, and to feel the same spirit working in both can
12529: never more be sundered though the hills may lie between. For their
12530: souls are enlarged for evermore by that union, and they bear one
12531: another about in their thoughts continually as it were a new
12532: strength.—Your faithful Sister and fellow-worker in Christ,
12533: 
12534: “DINAH MORRIS.”
12535: 
12536: 
12537: “I have not skill to write the words so small as you do and my pen
12538: moves slow. And so I am straitened, and say but little of what is in my
12539: mind. Greet your mother for me with a kiss. She asked me to kiss her
12540: twice when we parted.”
12541: 
12542: Adam had refolded the letter, and was sitting meditatively with his
12543: head resting on his arm at the head of the bed, when Seth came
12544: upstairs.
12545: 
12546: “Hast read the letter?” said Seth.
12547: 
12548: “Yes,” said Adam. “I don’t know what I should ha’ thought of her and
12549: her letter if I’d never seen her: I daresay I should ha’ thought a
12550: preaching woman hateful. But she’s one as makes everything seem right
12551: she says and does, and I seemed to see her and hear her speaking when I
12552: read the letter. It’s wonderful how I remember her looks and her voice.
12553: She’d make thee rare and happy, Seth; she’s just the woman for thee.”
12554: 
12555: “It’s no use thinking o’ that,” said Seth, despondingly. “She spoke so
12556: firm, and she’s not the woman to say one thing and mean another.”
12557: 
12558: “Nay, but her feelings may grow different. A woman may get to love by
12559: degrees—the best fire dosna flare up the soonest. I’d have thee go and
12560: see her by and by: I’d make it convenient for thee to be away three or
12561: four days, and it ’ud be no walk for thee—only between twenty and
12562: thirty mile.”
12563: 
12564: “I should like to see her again, whether or no, if she wouldna be
12565: displeased with me for going,” said Seth.
12566: 
12567: “She’ll be none displeased,” said Adam emphatically, getting up and
12568: throwing off his coat. “It might be a great happiness to us all if
12569: she’d have thee, for mother took to her so wonderful and seemed so
12570: contented to be with her.”
12571: 
12572: “Aye,” said Seth, rather timidly, “and Dinah’s fond o’ Hetty too; she
12573: thinks a deal about her.”
12574: 
12575: Adam made no reply to that, and no other word but “good-night” passed
12576: between them.
12577: 
12578: 
12579: 
12580: 
12581: Chapter XXXI
12582: In Hetty’s Bed-Chamber
12583: 
12584: 
12585: It was no longer light enough to go to bed without a candle, even in
12586: Mrs. Poyser’s early household, and Hetty carried one with her as she
12587: went up at last to her bedroom soon after Adam was gone, and bolted the
12588: door behind her.
12589: 
12590: _Now_ she would read her letter. It must—it must have comfort in it.
12591: How was Adam to know the truth? It was always likely he should say what
12592: he did say.
12593: 
12594: She set down the candle and took out the letter. It had a faint scent
12595: of roses, which made her feel as if Arthur were close to her. She put
12596: it to her lips, and a rush of remembered sensations for a moment or two
12597: swept away all fear. But her heart began to flutter strangely, and her
12598: hands to tremble as she broke the seal. She read slowly; it was not
12599: easy for her to read a gentleman’s handwriting, though Arthur had taken
12600: pains to write plainly.
12601: 
12602: “DEAREST HETTY—I have spoken truly when I have said that I loved you,
12603: and I shall never forget our love. I shall be your true friend as long
12604: as life lasts, and I hope to prove this to you in many ways. If I say
12605: anything to pain you in this letter, do not believe it is for want of
12606: love and tenderness towards you, for there is nothing I would not do
12607: for you, if I knew it to be really for your happiness. I cannot bear to
12608: think of my little Hetty shedding tears when I am not there to kiss
12609: them away; and if I followed only my own inclinations, I should be with
12610: her at this moment instead of writing. It is very hard for me to part
12611: from her—harder still for me to write words which may seem unkind,
12612: though they spring from the truest kindness.
12613: 
12614: “Dear, dear Hetty, sweet as our love has been to me, sweet as it would
12615: be to me for you to love me always, I feel that it would have been
12616: better for us both if we had never had that happiness, and that it is
12617: my duty to ask you to love me and care for me as little as you can. The
12618: fault has all been mine, for though I have been unable to resist the
12619: longing to be near you, I have felt all the while that your affection
12620: for me might cause you grief. I ought to have resisted my feelings. I
12621: should have done so, if I had been a better fellow than I am; but now,
12622: since the past cannot be altered, I am bound to save you from any evil
12623: that I have power to prevent. And I feel it would be a great evil for
12624: you if your affections continued so fixed on me that you could think of
12625: no other man who might be able to make you happier by his love than I
12626: ever can, and if you continued to look towards something in the future
12627: which cannot possibly happen. For, dear Hetty, if I were to do what you
12628: one day spoke of, and make you my wife, I should do what you yourself
12629: would come to feel was for your misery instead of your welfare. I know
12630: you can never be happy except by marrying a man in your own station;
12631: and if I were to marry you now, I should only be adding to any wrong I
12632: have done, besides offending against my duty in the other relations of
12633: life. You know nothing, dear Hetty, of the world in which I must always
12634: live, and you would soon begin to dislike me, because there would be so
12635: little in which we should be alike.
12636: 
12637: “And since I cannot marry you, we must part—we must try not to feel
12638: like lovers any more. I am miserable while I say this, but nothing else
12639: can be. Be angry with me, my sweet one, I deserve it; but do not
12640: believe that I shall not always care for you—always be grateful to
12641: you—always remember my Hetty; and if any trouble should come that we do
12642: not now foresee, trust in me to do everything that lies in my power.
12643: 
12644: “I have told you where you are to direct a letter to, if you want to
12645: write, but I put it down below lest you should have forgotten. Do not
12646: write unless there is something I can really do for you; for, dear
12647: Hetty, we must try to think of each other as little as we can. Forgive
12648: me, and try to forget everything about me, except that I shall be, as
12649: long as I live, your affectionate friend,
12650: 
12651: “ARTHUR DONNITHORNE.”
12652: 
12653: 
12654: Slowly Hetty had read this letter; and when she looked up from it there
12655: was the reflection of a blanched face in the old dim glass—a white
12656: marble face with rounded childish forms, but with something sadder than
12657: a child’s pain in it. Hetty did not see the face—she saw nothing—she
12658: only felt that she was cold and sick and trembling. The letter shook
12659: and rustled in her hand. She laid it down. It was a horrible
12660: sensation—this cold and trembling. It swept away the very ideas that
12661: produced it, and Hetty got up to reach a warm cloak from her
12662: clothes-press, wrapped it round her, and sat as if she were thinking of
12663: nothing but getting warm. Presently she took up the letter with a
12664: firmer hand, and began to read it through again. The tears came this
12665: time—great rushing tears that blinded her and blotched the paper. She
12666: felt nothing but that Arthur was cruel—cruel to write so, cruel not to
12667: marry her. Reasons why he could not marry her had no existence for her
12668: mind; how could she believe in any misery that could come to her from
12669: the fulfilment of all she had been longing for and dreaming of? She had
12670: not the ideas that could make up the notion of that misery.
12671: 
12672: As she threw down the letter again, she caught sight of her face in the
12673: glass; it was reddened now, and wet with tears; it was almost like a
12674: companion that she might complain to—that would pity her. She leaned
12675: forward on her elbows, and looked into those dark overflooding eyes and
12676: at the quivering mouth, and saw how the tears came thicker and thicker,
12677: and how the mouth became convulsed with sobs.
12678: 
12679: The shattering of all her little dream-world, the crushing blow on her
12680: new-born passion, afflicted her pleasure-craving nature with an
12681: overpowering pain that annihilated all impulse to resistance, and
12682: suspended her anger. She sat sobbing till the candle went out, and
12683: then, wearied, aching, stupefied with crying, threw herself on the bed
12684: without undressing and went to sleep.
12685: 
12686: There was a feeble dawn in the room when Hetty awoke, a little after
12687: four o’clock, with a sense of dull misery, the cause of which broke
12688: upon her gradually as she began to discern the objects round her in the
12689: dim light. And then came the frightening thought that she had to
12690: conceal her misery as well as to bear it, in this dreary daylight that
12691: was coming. She could lie no longer. She got up and went towards the
12692: table: there lay the letter. She opened her treasure-drawer: there lay
12693: the ear-rings and the locket—the signs of all her short happiness—the
12694: signs of the lifelong dreariness that was to follow it. Looking at the
12695: little trinkets which she had once eyed and fingered so fondly as the
12696: earnest of her future paradise of finery, she lived back in the moments
12697: when they had been given to her with such tender caresses, such
12698: strangely pretty words, such glowing looks, which filled her with a
12699: bewildering delicious surprise—they were so much sweeter than she had
12700: thought anything could be. And the Arthur who had spoken to her and
12701: looked at her in this way, who was present with her now—whose arm she
12702: felt round her, his cheek against hers, his very breath upon her—was
12703: the cruel, cruel Arthur who had written that letter, that letter which
12704: she snatched and crushed and then opened again, that she might read it
12705: once more. The half-benumbed mental condition which was the effect of
12706: the last night’s violent crying made it necessary to her to look again
12707: and see if her wretched thoughts were actually true—if the letter was
12708: really so cruel. She had to hold it close to the window, else she could
12709: not have read it by the faint light. Yes! It was worse—it was more
12710: cruel. She crushed it up again in anger. She hated the writer of that
12711: letter—hated him for the very reason that she hung upon him with all
12712: her love—all the girlish passion and vanity that made up her love.
12713: 
12714: She had no tears this morning. She had wept them all away last night,
12715: and now she felt that dry-eyed morning misery, which is worse than the
12716: first shock because it has the future in it as well as the present.
12717: Every morning to come, as far as her imagination could stretch, she
12718: would have to get up and feel that the day would have no joy for her.
12719: For there is no despair so absolute as that which comes with the first
12720: moments of our first great sorrow, when we have not yet known what it
12721: is to have suffered and be healed, to have despaired and to have
12722: recovered hope. As Hetty began languidly to take off the clothes she
12723: had worn all the night, that she might wash herself and brush her hair,
12724: she had a sickening sense that her life would go on in this way. She
12725: should always be doing things she had no pleasure in, getting up to the
12726: old tasks of work, seeing people she cared nothing about, going to
12727: church, and to Treddleston, and to tea with Mrs. Best, and carrying no
12728: happy thought with her. For her short poisonous delights had spoiled
12729: for ever all the little joys that had once made the sweetness of her
12730: life—the new frock ready for Treddleston Fair, the party at Mr.
12731: Britton’s at Broxton wake, the beaux that she would say “No” to for a
12732: long while, and the prospect of the wedding that was to come at last
12733: when she would have a silk gown and a great many clothes all at once.
12734: These things were all flat and dreary to her now; everything would be a
12735: weariness, and she would carry about for ever a hopeless thirst and
12736: longing.
12737: 
12738: She paused in the midst of her languid undressing and leaned against
12739: the dark old clothes-press. Her neck and arms were bare, her hair hung
12740: down in delicate rings—and they were just as beautiful as they were
12741: that night two months ago, when she walked up and down this bed-chamber
12742: glowing with vanity and hope. She was not thinking of her neck and arms
12743: now; even her own beauty was indifferent to her. Her eyes wandered
12744: sadly over the dull old chamber, and then looked out vacantly towards
12745: the growing dawn. Did a remembrance of Dinah come across her mind? Of
12746: her foreboding words, which had made her angry? Of Dinah’s affectionate
12747: entreaty to think of her as a friend in trouble? No, the impression had
12748: been too slight to recur. Any affection or comfort Dinah could have
12749: given her would have been as indifferent to Hetty this morning as
12750: everything else was except her bruised passion. She was only thinking
12751: she could never stay here and go on with the old life—she could better
12752: bear something quite new than sinking back into the old everyday round.
12753: She would like to run away that very morning, and never see any of the
12754: old faces again. But Hetty’s was not a nature to face difficulties—to
12755: dare to loose her hold on the familiar and rush blindly on some unknown
12756: condition. Hers was a luxurious and vain nature—not a passionate
12757: one—and if she were ever to take any violent measure, she must be urged
12758: to it by the desperation of terror. There was not much room for her
12759: thoughts to travel in the narrow circle of her imagination, and she
12760: soon fixed on the one thing she would do to get away from her old life:
12761: she would ask her uncle to let her go to be a lady’s maid. Miss Lydia’s
12762: maid would help her to get a situation, if she knew Hetty had her
12763: uncle’s leave.
12764: 
12765: When she had thought of this, she fastened up her hair and began to
12766: wash: it seemed more possible to her to go downstairs and try to behave
12767: as usual. She would ask her uncle this very day. On Hetty’s blooming
12768: health it would take a great deal of such mental suffering as hers to
12769: leave any deep impress; and when she was dressed as neatly as usual in
12770: her working-dress, with her hair tucked up under her little cap, an
12771: indifferent observer would have been more struck with the young
12772: roundness of her cheek and neck and the darkness of her eyes and
12773: eyelashes than with any signs of sadness about her. But when she took
12774: up the crushed letter and put it in her drawer, that she might lock it
12775: out of sight, hard smarting tears, having no relief in them as the
12776: great drops had that fell last night, forced their way into her eyes.
12777: She wiped them away quickly: she must not cry in the day-time. Nobody
12778: should find out how miserable she was, nobody should know she was
12779: disappointed about anything; and the thought that the eyes of her aunt
12780: and uncle would be upon her gave her the self-command which often
12781: accompanies a great dread. For Hetty looked out from her secret misery
12782: towards the possibility of their ever knowing what had happened, as the
12783: sick and weary prisoner might think of the possible pillory. They would
12784: think her conduct shameful, and shame was torture. That was poor little
12785: Hetty’s conscience.
12786: 
12787: So she locked up her drawer and went away to her early work.
12788: 
12789: In the evening, when Mr. Poyser was smoking his pipe, and his
12790: good-nature was therefore at its superlative moment, Hetty seized the
12791: opportunity of her aunt’s absence to say, “Uncle, I wish you’d let me
12792: go for a lady’s maid.”
12793: 
12794: Mr. Poyser took the pipe from his mouth and looked at Hetty in mild
12795: surprise for some moments. She was sewing, and went on with her work
12796: industriously.
12797: 
12798: “Why, what’s put that into your head, my wench?” he said at last, after
12799: he had given one conservative puff.
12800: 
12801: “I should like it—I should like it better than farm-work.”
12802: 
12803: “Nay, nay; you fancy so because you donna know it, my wench. It
12804: wouldn’t be half so good for your health, nor for your luck i’ life.
12805: I’d like you to stay wi’ us till you’ve got a good husband: you’re my
12806: own niece, and I wouldn’t have you go to service, though it was a
12807: gentleman’s house, as long as I’ve got a home for you.”
12808: 
12809: Mr. Poyser paused, and puffed away at his pipe.
12810: 
12811: “I like the needlework,” said Hetty, “and I should get good wages.”
12812: 
12813: “Has your aunt been a bit sharp wi’ you?” said Mr. Poyser, not noticing
12814: Hetty’s further argument. “You mustna mind that, my wench—she does it
12815: for your good. She wishes you well; an’ there isn’t many aunts as are
12816: no kin to you ’ud ha’ done by you as she has.”
12817: 
12818: “No, it isn’t my aunt,” said Hetty, “but I should like the work
12819: better.”
12820: 
12821: “It was all very well for you to learn the work a bit—an’ I gev my
12822: consent to that fast enough, sin’ Mrs. Pomfret was willing to teach
12823: you. For if anything was t’ happen, it’s well to know how to turn your
12824: hand to different sorts o’ things. But I niver meant you to go to
12825: service, my wench; my family’s ate their own bread and cheese as fur
12826: back as anybody knows, hanna they, Father? You wouldna like your
12827: grand-child to take wage?”
12828: 
12829: “Na-a-y,” said old Martin, with an elongation of the word, meant to
12830: make it bitter as well as negative, while he leaned forward and looked
12831: down on the floor. “But the wench takes arter her mother. I’d hard work
12832: t’ hould _her_ in, an’ she married i’ spite o’ me—a feller wi’ on’y two
12833: head o’ stock when there should ha’ been ten on’s farm—she might well
12834: die o’ th’ inflammation afore she war thirty.”
12835: 
12836: It was seldom the old man made so long a speech, but his son’s question
12837: had fallen like a bit of dry fuel on the embers of a long
12838: unextinguished resentment, which had always made the grandfather more
12839: indifferent to Hetty than to his son’s children. Her mother’s fortune
12840: had been spent by that good-for-nought Sorrel, and Hetty had Sorrel’s
12841: blood in her veins.
12842: 
12843: “Poor thing, poor thing!” said Martin the younger, who was sorry to
12844: have provoked this retrospective harshness. “She’d but bad luck. But
12845: Hetty’s got as good a chance o’ getting a solid, sober husband as any
12846: gell i’ this country.”
12847: 
12848: After throwing out this pregnant hint, Mr. Poyser recurred to his pipe
12849: and his silence, looking at Hetty to see if she did not give some sign
12850: of having renounced her ill-advised wish. But instead of that, Hetty,
12851: in spite of herself, began to cry, half out of ill temper at the
12852: denial, half out of the day’s repressed sadness.
12853: 
12854: “Hegh, hegh!” said Mr. Poyser, meaning to check her playfully, “don’t
12855: let’s have any crying. Crying’s for them as ha’ got no home, not for
12856: them as want to get rid o’ one. What dost think?” he continued to his
12857: wife, who now came back into the house-place, knitting with fierce
12858: rapidity, as if that movement were a necessary function, like the
12859: twittering of a crab’s antennæ.
12860: 
12861: “Think? Why, I think we shall have the fowl stole before we are much
12862: older, wi’ that gell forgetting to lock the pens up o’ nights. What’s
12863: the matter now, Hetty? What are you crying at?”
12864: 
12865: “Why, she’s been wanting to go for a lady’s maid,” said Mr. Poyser. “I
12866: tell her we can do better for her nor that.”
12867: 
12868: “I thought she’d got some maggot in her head, she’s gone about wi’ her
12869: mouth buttoned up so all day. It’s all wi’ going so among them servants
12870: at the Chase, as we war fools for letting her. She thinks it ’ud be a
12871: finer life than being wi’ them as are akin to her and ha’ brought her
12872: up sin’ she war no bigger nor Marty. She thinks there’s nothing belongs
12873: to being a lady’s maid but wearing finer clothes nor she was born to,
12874: I’ll be bound. It’s what rag she can get to stick on her as she’s
12875: thinking on from morning till night, as I often ask her if she wouldn’t
12876: like to be the mawkin i’ the field, for then she’d be made o’ rags
12877: inside and out. I’ll never gi’ my consent to her going for a lady’s
12878: maid, while she’s got good friends to take care on her till she’s
12879: married to somebody better nor one o’ them valets, as is neither a
12880: common man nor a gentleman, an’ must live on the fat o’ the land, an’s
12881: like enough to stick his hands under his coat-tails and expect his wife
12882: to work for him.”
12883: 
12884: “Aye, aye,” said Mr. Poyser, “we must have a better husband for her nor
12885: that, and there’s better at hand. Come, my wench, give over crying and
12886: get to bed. I’ll do better for you nor letting you go for a lady’s
12887: maid. Let’s hear no more on’t.”
12888: 
12889: When Hetty was gone upstairs he said, “I canna make it out as she
12890: should want to go away, for I thought she’d got a mind t’ Adam Bede.
12891: She’s looked like it o’ late.”
12892: 
12893: “Eh, there’s no knowing what she’s got a liking to, for things take no
12894: more hold on her than if she was a dried pea. I believe that gell,
12895: Molly—as is aggravatin’ enough, for the matter o’ that—but I believe
12896: she’d care more about leaving us and the children, for all she’s been
12897: here but a year come Michaelmas, nor Hetty would. But she’s got this
12898: notion o’ being a lady’s maid wi’ going among them servants—we might
12899: ha’ known what it ’ud lead to when we let her go to learn the fine
12900: work. But I’ll put a stop to it pretty quick.”
12901: 
12902: “Thee’dst be sorry to part wi’ her, if it wasn’t for her good,” said
12903: Mr. Poyser. “She’s useful to thee i’ the work.”
12904: 
12905: “Sorry? Yes, I’m fonder on her nor she deserves—a little hard-hearted
12906: hussy, wanting to leave us i’ that way. I can’t ha’ had her about me
12907: these seven year, I reckon, and done for her, and taught her everything
12908: wi’out caring about her. An’ here I’m having linen spun, an’ thinking
12909: all the while it’ll make sheeting and table-clothing for her when she’s
12910: married, an’ she’ll live i’ the parish wi’ us, and never go out of our
12911: sights—like a fool as I am for thinking aught about her, as is no
12912: better nor a cherry wi’ a hard stone inside it.”
12913: 
12914: “Nay, nay, thee mustna make much of a trifle,” said Mr. Poyser,
12915: soothingly. “She’s fond on us, I’ll be bound; but she’s young, an’ gets
12916: things in her head as she can’t rightly give account on. Them young
12917: fillies ’ull run away often wi’out knowing why.”
12918: 
12919: Her uncle’s answers, however, had had another effect on Hetty besides
12920: that of disappointing her and making her cry. She knew quite well whom
12921: he had in his mind in his allusions to marriage, and to a sober, solid
12922: husband; and when she was in her bedroom again, the possibility of her
12923: marrying Adam presented itself to her in a new light. In a mind where
12924: no strong sympathies are at work, where there is no supreme sense of
12925: right to which the agitated nature can cling and steady itself to quiet
12926: endurance, one of the first results of sorrow is a desperate vague
12927: clutching after any deed that will change the actual condition. Poor
12928: Hetty’s vision of consequences, at no time more than a narrow fantastic
12929: calculation of her own probable pleasures and pains, was now quite shut
12930: out by reckless irritation under present suffering, and she was ready
12931: for one of those convulsive, motiveless actions by which wretched men
12932: and women leap from a temporary sorrow into a lifelong misery.
12933: 
12934: Why should she not marry Adam? She did not care what she did, so that
12935: it made some change in her life. She felt confident that he would still
12936: want to marry her, and any further thought about Adam’s happiness in
12937: the matter had never yet visited her.
12938: 
12939: “Strange!” perhaps you will say, “this rush of impulse towards a course
12940: that might have seemed the most repugnant to her present state of mind,
12941: and in only the second night of her sadness!”
12942: 
12943: Yes, the actions of a little trivial soul like Hetty’s, struggling
12944: amidst the serious sad destinies of a human being, _are_ strange. So
12945: are the motions of a little vessel without ballast tossed about on a
12946: stormy sea. How pretty it looked with its parti-coloured sail in the
12947: sunlight, moored in the quiet bay!
12948: 
12949: “Let that man bear the loss who loosed it from its moorings.”
12950: 
12951: But that will not save the vessel—the pretty thing that might have been
12952: a lasting joy.
12953: 
12954: 
12955: 
12956: 
12957: Chapter XXXII
12958: Mrs. Poyser “Has Her Say Out”
12959: 
12960: 
12961: The next Saturday evening there was much excited discussion at the
12962: Donnithorne Arms concerning an incident which had occurred that very
12963: day—no less than a second appearance of the smart man in top-boots said
12964: by some to be a mere farmer in treaty for the Chase Farm, by others to
12965: be the future steward, but by Mr. Casson himself, the personal witness
12966: to the stranger’s visit, pronounced contemptuously to be nothing better
12967: than a bailiff, such as Satchell had been before him. No one had
12968: thought of denying Mr. Casson’s testimony to the fact that he had seen
12969: the stranger; nevertheless, he proffered various corroborating
12970: circumstances.
12971: 
12972: “I see him myself,” he said; “I see him coming along by the Crab-tree
12973: Meadow on a bald-faced hoss. I’d just been t’ hev a pint—it was half
12974: after ten i’ the fore-noon, when I hev my pint as reg’lar as the
12975: clock—and I says to Knowles, as druv up with his waggon, ‘You’ll get a
12976: bit o’ barley to-day, Knowles,’ I says, ‘if you look about you’; and
12977: then I went round by the rick-yard, and towart the Treddles’on road,
12978: and just as I come up by the big ash-tree, I see the man i’ top-boots
12979: coming along on a bald-faced hoss—I wish I may never stir if I didn’t.
12980: And I stood still till he come up, and I says, ‘Good morning, sir,’ I
12981: says, for I wanted to hear the turn of his tongue, as I might know
12982: whether he was a this-country man; so I says, ‘Good morning, sir: it
12983: ’ll ’old hup for the barley this morning, I think. There’ll be a bit
12984: got hin, if we’ve good luck.’ And he says, ‘Eh, ye may be raight,
12985: there’s noo tallin’,’ he says, and I knowed by that”—here Mr. Casson
12986: gave a wink—“as he didn’t come from a hundred mile off. I daresay he’d
12987: think me a hodd talker, as you Loamshire folks allays does hany one as
12988: talks the right language.”
12989: 
12990: “The right language!” said Bartle Massey, contemptuously. “You’re about
12991: as near the right language as a pig’s squeaking is like a tune played
12992: on a key-bugle.”
12993: 
12994: “Well, I don’t know,” answered Mr. Casson, with an angry smile. “I
12995: should think a man as has lived among the gentry from a by, is likely
12996: to know what’s the right language pretty nigh as well as a
12997: schoolmaster.”
12998: 
12999: “Ay, ay, man,” said Bartle, with a tone of sarcastic consolation, “you
13000: talk the right language for _you_. When Mike Holdsworth’s goat says
13001: ba-a-a, it’s all right—it ’ud be unnatural for it to make any other
13002: noise.”
13003: 
13004: The rest of the party being Loamshire men, Mr. Casson had the laugh
13005: strongly against him, and wisely fell back on the previous question,
13006: which, far from being exhausted in a single evening, was renewed in the
13007: churchyard, before service, the next day, with the fresh interest
13008: conferred on all news when there is a fresh person to hear it; and that
13009: fresh hearer was Martin Poyser, who, as his wife said, “never went
13010: boozin’ with that set at Casson’s, a-sittin’ soakin’ in drink, and
13011: looking as wise as a lot o’ cod-fish wi’ red faces.”
13012: 
13013: It was probably owing to the conversation she had had with her husband
13014: on their way from church concerning this problematic stranger that Mrs.
13015: Poyser’s thoughts immediately reverted to him when, a day or two
13016: afterwards, as she was standing at the house-door with her knitting, in
13017: that eager leisure which came to her when the afternoon cleaning was
13018: done, she saw the old squire enter the yard on his black pony, followed
13019: by John the groom. She always cited it afterwards as a case of
13020: prevision, which really had something more in it than her own
13021: remarkable penetration, that the moment she set eyes on the squire she
13022: said to herself, “I shouldna wonder if he’s come about that man as is
13023: a-going to take the Chase Farm, wanting Poyser to do something for him
13024: without pay. But Poyser’s a fool if he does.”
13025: 
13026: Something unwonted must clearly be in the wind, for the old squire’s
13027: visits to his tenantry were rare; and though Mrs. Poyser had during the
13028: last twelvemonth recited many imaginary speeches, meaning even more
13029: than met the ear, which she was quite determined to make to him the
13030: next time he appeared within the gates of the Hall Farm, the speeches
13031: had always remained imaginary.
13032: 
13033: “Good-day, Mrs. Poyser,” said the old squire, peering at her with his
13034: short-sighted eyes—a mode of looking at her which, as Mrs. Poyser
13035: observed, “allays aggravated me: it was as if you was a insect, and he
13036: was going to dab his finger-nail on you.”
13037: 
13038: However, she said, “Your servant, sir,” and curtsied with an air of
13039: perfect deference as she advanced towards him: she was not the woman to
13040: misbehave towards her betters, and fly in the face of the catechism,
13041: without severe provocation.
13042: 
13043: “Is your husband at home, Mrs. Poyser?”
13044: 
13045: “Yes, sir; he’s only i’ the rick-yard. I’ll send for him in a minute,
13046: if you’ll please to get down and step in.”
13047: 
13048: “Thank you; I will do so. I want to consult him about a little matter;
13049: but you are quite as much concerned in it, if not more. I must have
13050: your opinion too.”
13051: 
13052: “Hetty, run and tell your uncle to come in,” said Mrs. Poyser, as they
13053: entered the house, and the old gentleman bowed low in answer to Hetty’s
13054: curtsy; while Totty, conscious of a pinafore stained with gooseberry
13055: jam, stood hiding her face against the clock and peeping round
13056: furtively.
13057: 
13058: “What a fine old kitchen this is!” said Mr. Donnithorne, looking round
13059: admiringly. He always spoke in the same deliberate, well-chiselled,
13060: polite way, whether his words were sugary or venomous. “And you keep it
13061: so exquisitely clean, Mrs. Poyser. I like these premises, do you know,
13062: beyond any on the estate.”
13063: 
13064: “Well, sir, since you’re fond of ’em, I should be glad if you’d let a
13065: bit o’ repairs be done to ’em, for the boarding’s i’ that state as
13066: we’re like to be eaten up wi’ rats and mice; and the cellar, you may
13067: stan’ up to your knees i’ water in’t, if you like to go down; but
13068: perhaps you’d rather believe my words. Won’t you please to sit down,
13069: sir?”
13070: 
13071: “Not yet; I must see your dairy. I have not seen it for years, and I
13072: hear on all hands about your fine cheese and butter,” said the squire,
13073: looking politely unconscious that there could be any question on which
13074: he and Mrs. Poyser might happen to disagree. “I think I see the door
13075: open, there. You must not be surprised if I cast a covetous eye on your
13076: cream and butter. I don’t expect that Mrs. Satchell’s cream and butter
13077: will bear comparison with yours.”
13078: 
13079: “I can’t say, sir, I’m sure. It’s seldom I see other folks’s butter,
13080: though there’s some on it as one’s no need to see—the smell’s enough.”
13081: 
13082: “Ah, now this I like,” said Mr. Donnithorne, looking round at the damp
13083: temple of cleanliness, but keeping near the door. “I’m sure I should
13084: like my breakfast better if I knew the butter and cream came from this
13085: dairy. Thank you, that really is a pleasant sight. Unfortunately, my
13086: slight tendency to rheumatism makes me afraid of damp: I’ll sit down in
13087: your comfortable kitchen. Ah, Poyser, how do you do? In the midst of
13088: business, I see, as usual. I’ve been looking at your wife’s beautiful
13089: dairy—the best manager in the parish, is she not?”
13090: 
13091: Mr. Poyser had just entered in shirt-sleeves and open waistcoat, with a
13092: face a shade redder than usual, from the exertion of “pitching.” As he
13093: stood, red, rotund, and radiant, before the small, wiry, cool old
13094: gentleman, he looked like a prize apple by the side of a withered crab.
13095: 
13096: “Will you please to take this chair, sir?” he said, lifting his
13097: father’s arm-chair forward a little: “you’ll find it easy.”
13098: 
13099: “No, thank you, I never sit in easy-chairs,” said the old gentleman,
13100: seating himself on a small chair near the door. “Do you know, Mrs.
13101: Poyser—sit down, pray, both of you—I’ve been far from contented, for
13102: some time, with Mrs. Satchell’s dairy management. I think she has not a
13103: good method, as you have.”
13104: 
13105: “Indeed, sir, I can’t speak to that,” said Mrs. Poyser in a hard voice,
13106: rolling and unrolling her knitting and looking icily out of the window,
13107: as she continued to stand opposite the squire. Poyser might sit down if
13108: he liked, she thought; _she_ wasn’t going to sit down, as if she’d give
13109: in to any such smooth-tongued palaver. Mr. Poyser, who looked and felt
13110: the reverse of icy, did sit down in his three-cornered chair.
13111: 
13112: “And now, Poyser, as Satchell is laid up, I am intending to let the
13113: Chase Farm to a respectable tenant. I’m tired of having a farm on my
13114: own hands—nothing is made the best of in such cases, as you know. A
13115: satisfactory bailiff is hard to find; and I think you and I, Poyser,
13116: and your excellent wife here, can enter into a little arrangement in
13117: consequence, which will be to our mutual advantage.”
13118: 
13119: “Oh,” said Mr. Poyser, with a good-natured blankness of imagination as
13120: to the nature of the arrangement.
13121: 
13122: “If I’m called upon to speak, sir,” said Mrs. Poyser, after glancing at
13123: her husband with pity at his softness, “you know better than me; but I
13124: don’t see what the Chase Farm is t’ us—we’ve cumber enough wi’ our own
13125: farm. Not but what I’m glad to hear o’ anybody respectable coming into
13126: the parish; there’s some as ha’ been brought in as hasn’t been looked
13127: on i’ that character.”
13128: 
13129: “You’re likely to find Mr. Thurle an excellent neighbour, I assure
13130: you—such a one as you will feel glad to have accommodated by the little
13131: plan I’m going to mention, especially as I hope you will find it as
13132: much to your own advantage as his.”
13133: 
13134: “Indeed, sir, if it’s anything t’ our advantage, it’ll be the first
13135: offer o’ the sort I’ve heared on. It’s them as take advantage that get
13136: advantage i’ this world, _I_ think: folks have to wait long enough
13137: afore it’s brought to ’em.”
13138: 
13139: “The fact is, Poyser,” said the squire, ignoring Mrs. Poyser’s theory
13140: of worldly prosperity, “there is too much dairy land, and too little
13141: plough land, on the Chase Farm to suit Thurle’s purpose—indeed, he will
13142: only take the farm on condition of some change in it: his wife, it
13143: appears, is not a clever dairy-woman, like yours. Now, the plan I’m
13144: thinking of is to effect a little exchange. If you were to have the
13145: Hollow Pastures, you might increase your dairy, which must be so
13146: profitable under your wife’s management; and I should request you, Mrs.
13147: Poyser, to supply my house with milk, cream, and butter at the market
13148: prices. On the other hand, Poyser, you might let Thurle have the Lower
13149: and Upper Ridges, which really, with our wet seasons, would be a good
13150: riddance for you. There is much less risk in dairy land than corn
13151: land.”
13152: 
13153: Mr. Poyser was leaning forward, with his elbows on his knees, his head
13154: on one side, and his mouth screwed up—apparently absorbed in making the
13155: tips of his fingers meet so as to represent with perfect accuracy the
13156: ribs of a ship. He was much too acute a man not to see through the
13157: whole business, and to foresee perfectly what would be his wife’s view
13158: of the subject; but he disliked giving unpleasant answers. Unless it
13159: was on a point of farming practice, he would rather give up than have a
13160: quarrel, any day; and, after all, it mattered more to his wife than to
13161: him. So, after a few moments’ silence, he looked up at her and said
13162: mildly, “What dost say?”
13163: 
13164: Mrs. Poyser had had her eyes fixed on her husband with cold severity
13165: during his silence, but now she turned away her head with a toss,
13166: looked icily at the opposite roof of the cow-shed, and spearing her
13167: knitting together with the loose pin, held it firmly between her
13168: clasped hands.
13169: 
13170: “Say? Why, I say you may do as you like about giving up any o’ your
13171: corn-land afore your lease is up, which it won’t be for a year come
13172: next Michaelmas, but I’ll not consent to take more dairy work into my
13173: hands, either for love or money; and there’s nayther love nor money
13174: here, as I can see, on’y other folks’s love o’ theirselves, and the
13175: money as is to go into other folks’s pockets. I know there’s them as is
13176: born t’ own the land, and them as is born to sweat on’t”—here Mrs.
13177: Poyser paused to gasp a little—“and I know it’s christened folks’s duty
13178: to submit to their betters as fur as flesh and blood ’ull bear it; but
13179: I’ll not make a martyr o’ myself, and wear myself to skin and bone, and
13180: worret myself as if I was a churn wi’ butter a-coming in’t, for no
13181: landlord in England, not if he was King George himself.”
13182: 
13183: “No, no, my dear Mrs. Poyser, certainly not,” said the squire, still
13184: confident in his own powers of persuasion, “you must not overwork
13185: yourself; but don’t you think your work will rather be lessened than
13186: increased in this way? There is so much milk required at the Abbey that
13187: you will have little increase of cheese and butter making from the
13188: addition to your dairy; and I believe selling the milk is the most
13189: profitable way of disposing of dairy produce, is it not?”
13190: 
13191: “Aye, that’s true,” said Mr. Poyser, unable to repress an opinion on a
13192: question of farming profits, and forgetting that it was not in this
13193: case a purely abstract question.
13194: 
13195: “I daresay,” said Mrs. Poyser bitterly, turning her head half-way
13196: towards her husband and looking at the vacant arm-chair—“I daresay it’s
13197: true for men as sit i’ th’ chimney-corner and make believe as
13198: everything’s cut wi’ ins an’ outs to fit int’ everything else. If you
13199: could make a pudding wi’ thinking o’ the batter, it ’ud be easy getting
13200: dinner. How do I know whether the milk ’ull be wanted constant? What’s
13201: to make me sure as the house won’t be put o’ board wage afore we’re
13202: many months older, and then I may have to lie awake o’ nights wi’
13203: twenty gallons o’ milk on my mind—and Dingall ’ull take no more butter,
13204: let alone paying for it; and we must fat pigs till we’re obliged to beg
13205: the butcher on our knees to buy ’em, and lose half of ’em wi’ the
13206: measles. And there’s the fetching and carrying, as ’ud be welly half a
13207: day’s work for a man an’ hoss—_that’s_ to be took out o’ the profits, I
13208: reckon? But there’s folks ’ud hold a sieve under the pump and expect to
13209: carry away the water.”
13210: 
13211: “That difficulty—about the fetching and carrying—you will not have,
13212: Mrs. Poyser,” said the squire, who thought that this entrance into
13213: particulars indicated a distant inclination to compromise on Mrs.
13214: Poyser’s part. “Bethell will do that regularly with the cart and pony.”
13215: 
13216: “Oh, sir, begging your pardon, I’ve never been used t’ having
13217: gentlefolks’s servants coming about my back places, a-making love to
13218: both the gells at once and keeping ’em with their hands on their hips
13219: listening to all manner o’ gossip when they should be down on their
13220: knees a-scouring. If we’re to go to ruin, it shanna be wi’ having our
13221: back kitchen turned into a public.”
13222: 
13223: “Well, Poyser,” said the squire, shifting his tactics and looking as if
13224: he thought Mrs. Poyser had suddenly withdrawn from the proceedings and
13225: left the room, “you can turn the Hollows into feeding-land. I can
13226: easily make another arrangement about supplying my house. And I shall
13227: not forget your readiness to accommodate your landlord as well as a
13228: neighbour. I know you will be glad to have your lease renewed for three
13229: years, when the present one expires; otherwise, I daresay Thurle, who
13230: is a man of some capital, would be glad to take both the farms, as they
13231: could be worked so well together. But I don’t want to part with an old
13232: tenant like you.”
13233: 
13234: To be thrust out of the discussion in this way would have been enough
13235: to complete Mrs. Poyser’s exasperation, even without the final threat.
13236: Her husband, really alarmed at the possibility of their leaving the old
13237: place where he had been bred and born—for he believed the old squire
13238: had small spite enough for anything—was beginning a mild remonstrance
13239: explanatory of the inconvenience he should find in having to buy and
13240: sell more stock, with, “Well, sir, I think as it’s rether hard...” when
13241: Mrs. Poyser burst in with the desperate determination to have her say
13242: out this once, though it were to rain notices to quit and the only
13243: shelter were the work-house.
13244: 
13245: “Then, sir, if I may speak—as, for all I’m a woman, and there’s folks
13246: as thinks a woman’s fool enough to stan’ by an’ look on while the men
13247: sign her soul away, I’ve a right to speak, for I make one quarter o’
13248: the rent, and save another quarter—I say, if Mr. Thurle’s so ready to
13249: take farms under you, it’s a pity but what he should take this, and see
13250: if he likes to live in a house wi’ all the plagues o’ Egypt in’t—wi’
13251: the cellar full o’ water, and frogs and toads hoppin’ up the steps by
13252: dozens—and the floors rotten, and the rats and mice gnawing every bit
13253: o’ cheese, and runnin’ over our heads as we lie i’ bed till we expect
13254: ’em to eat us up alive—as it’s a mercy they hanna eat the children long
13255: ago. I should like to see if there’s another tenant besides Poyser as
13256: ’ud put up wi’ never having a bit o’ repairs done till a place tumbles
13257: down—and not then, on’y wi’ begging and praying and having to pay
13258: half—and being strung up wi’ the rent as it’s much if he gets enough
13259: out o’ the land to pay, for all he’s put his own money into the ground
13260: beforehand. See if you’ll get a stranger to lead such a life here as
13261: that: a maggot must be born i’ the rotten cheese to like it, I reckon.
13262: You may run away from my words, sir,” continued Mrs. Poyser, following
13263: the old squire beyond the door—for after the first moments of stunned
13264: surprise he had got up, and, waving his hand towards her with a smile,
13265: had walked out towards his pony. But it was impossible for him to get
13266: away immediately, for John was walking the pony up and down the yard,
13267: and was some distance from the causeway when his master beckoned.
13268: 
13269: “You may run away from my words, sir, and you may go spinnin’ underhand
13270: ways o’ doing us a mischief, for you’ve got Old Harry to your friend,
13271: though nobody else is, but I tell you for once as we’re not dumb
13272: creatures to be abused and made money on by them as ha’ got the lash i’
13273: their hands, for want o’ knowing how t’ undo the tackle. An’ if I’m th’
13274: only one as speaks my mind, there’s plenty o’ the same way o’ thinking
13275: i’ this parish and the next to ’t, for your name’s no better than a
13276: brimstone match in everybody’s nose—if it isna two-three old folks as
13277: you think o’ saving your soul by giving ’em a bit o’ flannel and a drop
13278: o’ porridge. An’ you may be right i’ thinking it’ll take but little to
13279: save your soul, for it’ll be the smallest savin’ y’ iver made, wi’ all
13280: your scrapin’.”
13281: 
13282: There are occasions on which two servant-girls and a waggoner may be a
13283: formidable audience, and as the squire rode away on his black pony,
13284: even the gift of short-sightedness did not prevent him from being aware
13285: that Molly and Nancy and Tim were grinning not far from him. Perhaps he
13286: suspected that sour old John was grinning behind him—which was also the
13287: fact. Meanwhile the bull-dog, the black-and-tan terrier, Alick’s
13288: sheep-dog, and the gander hissing at a safe distance from the pony’s
13289: heels carried out the idea of Mrs. Poyser’s solo in an impressive
13290: quartet.
13291: 
13292: Mrs. Poyser, however, had no sooner seen the pony move off than she
13293: turned round, gave the two hilarious damsels a look which drove them
13294: into the back kitchen, and unspearing her knitting, began to knit again
13295: with her usual rapidity as she re-entered the house.
13296: 
13297: “Thee’st done it now,” said Mr. Poyser, a little alarmed and uneasy,
13298: but not without some triumphant amusement at his wife’s outbreak.
13299: 
13300: “Yes, I know I’ve done it,” said Mrs. Poyser; “but I’ve had my say out,
13301: and I shall be th’ easier for’t all my life. There’s no pleasure i’
13302: living if you’re to be corked up for ever, and only dribble your mind
13303: out by the sly, like a leaky barrel. I shan’t repent saying what I
13304: think, if I live to be as old as th’ old squire; and there’s little
13305: likelihood—for it seems as if them as aren’t wanted here are th’ only
13306: folks as aren’t wanted i’ th’ other world.”
13307: 
13308: “But thee wutna like moving from th’ old place, this Michaelmas
13309: twelvemonth,” said Mr. Poyser, “and going into a strange parish, where
13310: thee know’st nobody. It’ll be hard upon us both, and upo’ Father too.”
13311: 
13312: “Eh, it’s no use worreting; there’s plenty o’ things may happen between
13313: this and Michaelmas twelvemonth. The captain may be master afore them,
13314: for what we know,” said Mrs. Poyser, inclined to take an unusually
13315: hopeful view of an embarrassment which had been brought about by her
13316: own merit and not by other people’s fault.
13317: 
13318: “_I’m_ none for worreting,” said Mr. Poyser, rising from his
13319: three-cornered chair and walking slowly towards the door; “but I should
13320: be loath to leave th’ old place, and the parish where I was bred and
13321: born, and Father afore me. We should leave our roots behind us, I
13322: doubt, and niver thrive again.”

13329: 
13330: 
13331: The barley was all carried at last, and the harvest suppers went by
13332: without waiting for the dismal black crop of beans. The apples and nuts
13333: were gathered and stored; the scent of whey departed from the
13334: farm-houses, and the scent of brewing came in its stead. The woods
13335: behind the Chase, and all the hedgerow trees, took on a solemn
13336: splendour under the dark low-hanging skies. Michaelmas was come, with
13337: its fragrant basketfuls of purple damsons, and its paler purple
13338: daisies, and its lads and lasses leaving or seeking service and winding
13339: along between the yellow hedges, with their bundles under their arms.
13340: But though Michaelmas was come, Mr. Thurle, that desirable tenant, did
13341: not come to the Chase Farm, and the old squire, after all, had been
13342: obliged to put in a new bailiff. It was known throughout the two
13343: parishes that the squire’s plan had been frustrated because the Poysers
13344: had refused to be “put upon,” and Mrs. Poyser’s outbreak was discussed
13345: in all the farm-houses with a zest which was only heightened by
13346: frequent repetition. The news that “Bony” was come back from Egypt was
13347: comparatively insipid, and the repulse of the French in Italy was
13348: nothing to Mrs. Poyser’s repulse of the old squire. Mr. Irwine had
13349: heard a version of it in every parishioner’s house, with the one
13350: exception of the Chase. But since he had always, with marvellous skill,
13351: avoided any quarrel with Mr. Donnithorne, he could not allow himself
13352: the pleasure of laughing at the old gentleman’s discomfiture with any
13353: one besides his mother, who declared that if she were rich she should
13354: like to allow Mrs. Poyser a pension for life, and wanted to invite her
13355: to the parsonage that she might hear an account of the scene from Mrs.
13356: Poyser’s own lips.
13357: 
13358: “No, no, Mother,” said Mr. Irwine; “it was a little bit of irregular
13359: justice on Mrs. Poyser’s part, but a magistrate like me must not
13360: countenance irregular justice. There must be no report spread that I
13361: have taken notice of the quarrel, else I shall lose the little good
13362: influence I have over the old man.”
13363: 
13364: “Well, I like that woman even better than her cream-cheeses,” said Mrs.
13365: Irwine. “She has the spirit of three men, with that pale face of hers.
13366: And she says such sharp things too.”
13367: 
13368: “Sharp! Yes, her tongue is like a new-set razor. She’s quite original
13369: in her talk too; one of those untaught wits that help to stock a
13370: country with proverbs. I told you that capital thing I heard her say
13371: about Craig—that he was like a cock, who thought the sun had risen to
13372: hear him crow. Now that’s an Æsop’s fable in a sentence.”
13373: 
13374: “But it will be a bad business if the old gentleman turns them out of
13375: the farm next Michaelmas, eh?” said Mrs. Irwine.
13376: 
13377: “Oh, that must not be; and Poyser is such a good tenant that
13378: Donnithorne is likely to think twice, and digest his spleen rather than
13379: turn them out. But if he should give them notice at Lady Day, Arthur
13380: and I must move heaven and earth to mollify him. Such old parishioners
13381: as they are must not go.”
13382: 
13383: “Ah, there’s no knowing what may happen before Lady day,” said Mrs.
13384: Irwine. “It struck me on Arthur’s birthday that the old man was a
13385: little shaken: he’s eighty-three, you know. It’s really an
13386: unconscionable age. It’s only women who have a right to live as long as
13387: that.”
13388: 
13389: “When they’ve got old-bachelor sons who would be forlorn without them,”
13390: said Mr. Irwine, laughing, and kissing his mother’s hand.
13391: 
13392: Mrs. Poyser, too, met her husband’s occasional forebodings of a notice
13393: to quit with “There’s no knowing what may happen before Lady day”—one
13394: of those undeniable general propositions which are usually intended to
13395: convey a particular meaning very far from undeniable. But it is really
13396: too hard upon human nature that it should be held a criminal offence to
13397: imagine the death even of the king when he is turned eighty-three. It
13398: is not to be believed that any but the dullest Britons can be good
13399: subjects under that hard condition.
13400: 
13401: Apart from this foreboding, things went on much as usual in the Poyser
13402: household. Mrs. Poyser thought she noticed a surprising improvement in
13403: Hetty. To be sure, the girl got “closer tempered, and sometimes she
13404: seemed as if there’d be no drawing a word from her with cart-ropes,”
13405: but she thought much less about her dress, and went after the work
13406: quite eagerly, without any telling. And it was wonderful how she never
13407: wanted to go out now—indeed, could hardly be persuaded to go; and she
13408: bore her aunt’s putting a stop to her weekly lesson in fine-work at the
13409: Chase without the least grumbling or pouting. It must be, after all,
13410: that she had set her heart on Adam at last, and her sudden freak of
13411: wanting to be a lady’s maid must have been caused by some little pique
13412: or misunderstanding between them, which had passed by. For whenever
13413: Adam came to the Hall Farm, Hetty seemed to be in better spirits and to
13414: talk more than at other times, though she was almost sullen when Mr.
13415: Craig or any other admirer happened to pay a visit there.
13416: 
13417: Adam himself watched her at first with trembling anxiety, which gave
13418: way to surprise and delicious hope. Five days after delivering Arthur’s
13419: letter, he had ventured to go to the Hall Farm again—not without dread
13420: lest the sight of him might be painful to her. She was not in the
13421: house-place when he entered, and he sat talking to Mr. and Mrs. Poyser
13422: for a few minutes with a heavy fear on his heart that they might
13423: presently tell him Hetty was ill. But by and by there came a light step
13424: that he knew, and when Mrs. Poyser said, “Come, Hetty, where have you
13425: been?” Adam was obliged to turn round, though he was afraid to see the
13426: changed look there must be in her face. He almost started when he saw
13427: her smiling as if she were pleased to see him—looking the same as ever
13428: at a first glance, only that she had her cap on, which he had never
13429: seen her in before when he came of an evening. Still, when he looked at
13430: her again and again as she moved about or sat at her work, there was a
13431: change: the cheeks were as pink as ever, and she smiled as much as she
13432: had ever done of late, but there was something different in her eyes,
13433: in the expression of her face, in all her movements, Adam
13434: thought—something harder, older, less child-like. “Poor thing!” he said
13435: to himself, “that’s allays likely. It’s because she’s had her first
13436: heartache. But she’s got a spirit to bear up under it. Thank God for
13437: that.”
13438: 
13439: As the weeks went by, and he saw her always looking pleased to see
13440: him—turning up her lovely face towards him as if she meant him to
13441: understand that she was glad for him to come—and going about her work
13442: in the same equable way, making no sign of sorrow, he began to believe
13443: that her feeling towards Arthur must have been much slighter than he
13444: had imagined in his first indignation and alarm, and that she had been
13445: able to think of her girlish fancy that Arthur was in love with her and
13446: would marry her as a folly of which she was timely cured. And it
13447: perhaps was, as he had sometimes in his more cheerful moments hoped it
13448: would be—her heart was really turning with all the more warmth towards
13449: the man she knew to have a serious love for her.
13450: 
13451: Possibly you think that Adam was not at all sagacious in his
13452: interpretations, and that it was altogether extremely unbecoming in a
13453: sensible man to behave as he did—falling in love with a girl who really
13454: had nothing more than her beauty to recommend her, attributing
13455: imaginary virtues to her, and even condescending to cleave to her after
13456: she had fallen in love with another man, waiting for her kind looks as
13457: a patient trembling dog waits for his master’s eye to be turned upon
13458: him. But in so complex a thing as human nature, we must consider, it is
13459: hard to find rules without exceptions. Of course, I know that, as a
13460: rule, sensible men fall in love with the most sensible women of their
13461: acquaintance, see through all the pretty deceits of coquettish beauty,
13462: never imagine themselves loved when they are not loved, cease loving on
13463: all proper occasions, and marry the woman most fitted for them in every
13464: respect—indeed, so as to compel the approbation of all the maiden
13465: ladies in their neighbourhood. But even to this rule an exception will
13466: occur now and then in the lapse of centuries, and my friend Adam was
13467: one. For my own part, however, I respect him none the less—nay, I think
13468: the deep love he had for that sweet, rounded, blossom-like, dark-eyed
13469: Hetty, of whose inward self he was really very ignorant, came out of
13470: the very strength of his nature and not out of any inconsistent
13471: weakness. Is it any weakness, pray, to be wrought on by exquisite
13472: music? To feel its wondrous harmonies searching the subtlest windings
13473: of your soul, the delicate fibres of life where no memory can
13474: penetrate, and binding together your whole being past and present in
13475: one unspeakable vibration, melting you in one moment with all the
13476: tenderness, all the love that has been scattered through the toilsome
13477: years, concentrating in one emotion of heroic courage or resignation
13478: all the hard-learnt lessons of self-renouncing sympathy, blending your
13479: present joy with past sorrow and your present sorrow with all your past
13480: joy? If not, then neither is it a weakness to be so wrought upon by the
13481: exquisite curves of a woman’s cheek and neck and arms, by the liquid
13482: depths of her beseeching eyes, or the sweet childish pout of her lips.
13483: For the beauty of a lovely woman is like music: what can one say more?
13484: Beauty has an expression beyond and far above the one woman’s soul that
13485: it clothes, as the words of genius have a wider meaning than the
13486: thought that prompted them. It is more than a woman’s love that moves
13487: us in a woman’s eyes—it seems to be a far-off mighty love that has come
13488: near to us, and made speech for itself there; the rounded neck, the
13489: dimpled arm, move us by something more than their prettiness—by their
13490: close kinship with all we have known of tenderness and peace. The
13491: noblest nature sees the most of this _impersonal_ expression in beauty
13492: (it is needless to say that there are gentlemen with whiskers dyed and
13493: undyed who see none of it whatever), and for this reason, the noblest
13494: nature is often the most blinded to the character of the one woman’s
13495: soul that the beauty clothes. Whence, I fear, the tragedy of human life
13496: is likely to continue for a long time to come, in spite of mental
13497: philosophers who are ready with the best receipts for avoiding all
13498: mistakes of the kind.
13499: 
13500: Our good Adam had no fine words into which he could put his feeling for
13501: Hetty: he could not disguise mystery in this way with the appearance of
13502: knowledge; he called his love frankly a mystery, as you have heard him.
13503: He only knew that the sight and memory of her moved him deeply,
13504: touching the spring of all love and tenderness, all faith and courage
13505: within him. How could he imagine narrowness, selfishness, hardness in
13506: her? He created the mind he believed in out of his own, which was
13507: large, unselfish, tender.
13508: 
13509: The hopes he felt about Hetty softened a little his feeling towards
13510: Arthur. Surely his attentions to Hetty must have been of a slight kind;
13511: they were altogether wrong, and such as no man in Arthur’s position
13512: ought to have allowed himself, but they must have had an air of
13513: playfulness about them, which had probably blinded him to their danger
13514: and had prevented them from laying any strong hold on Hetty’s heart. As
13515: the new promise of happiness rose for Adam, his indignation and
13516: jealousy began to die out. Hetty was not made unhappy; he almost
13517: believed that she liked him best; and the thought sometimes crossed his
13518: mind that the friendship which had once seemed dead for ever might
13519: revive in the days to come, and he would not have to say “good-bye” to
13520: the grand old woods, but would like them better because they were
13521: Arthur’s. For this new promise of happiness following so quickly on the
13522: shock of pain had an intoxicating effect on the sober Adam, who had all
13523: his life been used to much hardship and moderate hope. Was he really
13524: going to have an easy lot after all? It seemed so, for at the beginning
13525: of November, Jonathan Burge, finding it impossible to replace Adam, had
13526: at last made up his mind to offer him a share in the business, without
13527: further condition than that he should continue to give his energies to
13528: it and renounce all thought of having a separate business of his own.
13529: Son-in-law or no son-in-law, Adam had made himself too necessary to be
13530: parted with, and his headwork was so much more important to Burge than
13531: his skill in handicraft that his having the management of the woods
13532: made little difference in the value of his services; and as to the
13533: bargains about the squire’s timber, it would be easy to call in a third
13534: person. Adam saw here an opening into a broadening path of prosperous
13535: work such as he had thought of with ambitious longing ever since he was
13536: a lad: he might come to build a bridge, or a town hall, or a factory,
13537: for he had always said to himself that Jonathan Burge’s building
13538: business was like an acorn, which might be the mother of a great tree.
13539: So he gave his hand to Burge on that bargain, and went home with his
13540: mind full of happy visions, in which (my refined reader will perhaps be
13541: shocked when I say it) the image of Hetty hovered, and smiled over
13542: plans for seasoning timber at a trifling expense, calculations as to
13543: the cheapening of bricks per thousand by water-carriage, and a
13544: favourite scheme for the strengthening of roofs and walls with a
13545: peculiar form of iron girder. What then? Adam’s enthusiasm lay in these
13546: things; and our love is inwrought in our enthusiasm as electricity is
13547: inwrought in the air, exalting its power by a subtle presence.
13548: 
13549: Adam would be able to take a separate house now, and provide for his
13550: mother in the old one; his prospects would justify his marrying very
13551: soon, and if Dinah consented to have Seth, their mother would perhaps
13552: be more contented to live apart from Adam. But he told himself that he
13553: would not be hasty—he would not try Hetty’s feeling for him until it
13554: had had time to grow strong and firm. However, tomorrow, after church,
13555: he would go to the Hall Farm and tell them the news. Mr. Poyser, he
13556: knew, would like it better than a five-pound note, and he should see if
13557: Hetty’s eyes brightened at it. The months would be short with all he
13558: had to fill his mind, and this foolish eagerness which had come over
13559: him of late must not hurry him into any premature words. Yet when he
13560: got home and told his mother the good news, and ate his supper, while
13561: she sat by almost crying for joy and wanting him to eat twice as much
13562: as usual because of this good-luck, he could not help preparing her
13563: gently for the coming change by talking of the old house being too
13564: small for them all to go on living in it always.

13568: 
13569: Chapter XXXIV
13570: The Betrothal
13571: 
13572: 
13573: It was a dry Sunday, and really a pleasant day for the 2d of November.
13574: There was no sunshine, but the clouds were high, and the wind was so
13575: still that the yellow leaves which fluttered down from the hedgerow
13576: elms must have fallen from pure decay. Nevertheless, Mrs. Poyser did
13577: not go to church, for she had taken a cold too serious to be neglected;
13578: only two winters ago she had been laid up for weeks with a cold; and
13579: since his wife did not go to church, Mr. Poyser considered that on the
13580: whole it would be as well for him to stay away too and “keep her
13581: company.” He could perhaps have given no precise form to the reasons
13582: that determined this conclusion, but it is well known to all
13583: experienced minds that our firmest convictions are often dependent on
13584: subtle impressions for which words are quite too coarse a medium.
13585: However it was, no one from the Poyser family went to church that
13586: afternoon except Hetty and the boys; yet Adam was bold enough to join
13587: them after church, and say that he would walk home with them, though
13588: all the way through the village he appeared to be chiefly occupied with
13589: Marty and Tommy, telling them about the squirrels in Binton Coppice,
13590: and promising to take them there some day. But when they came to the
13591: fields he said to the boys, “Now, then, which is the stoutest walker?
13592: Him as gets to th’ home-gate first shall be the first to go with me to
13593: Binton Coppice on the donkey. But Tommy must have the start up to the
13594: next stile, because he’s the smallest.”
13595: 
13596: Adam had never behaved so much like a determined lover before. As soon
13597: as the boys had both set off, he looked down at Hetty and said, “Won’t
13598: you hang on my arm, Hetty?” in a pleading tone, as if he had already
13599: asked her and she had refused. Hetty looked up at him smilingly and put
13600: her round arm through his in a moment. It was nothing to her, putting
13601: her arm through Adam’s, but she knew he cared a great deal about having
13602: her arm through his, and she wished him to care. Her heart beat no
13603: faster, and she looked at the half-bare hedgerows and the ploughed
13604: field with the same sense of oppressive dulness as before. But Adam
13605: scarcely felt that he was walking. He thought Hetty must know that he
13606: was pressing her arm a little—a very little. Words rushed to his lips
13607: that he dared not utter—that he had made up his mind not to utter
13608: yet—and so he was silent for the length of that field. The calm
13609: patience with which he had once waited for Hetty’s love, content only
13610: with her presence and the thought of the future, had forsaken him since
13611: that terrible shock nearly three months ago. The agitations of jealousy
13612: had given a new restlessness to his passion—had made fear and
13613: uncertainty too hard almost to bear. But though he might not speak to
13614: Hetty of his love, he would tell her about his new prospects and see if
13615: she would be pleased. So when he was enough master of himself to talk,
13616: he said, “I’m going to tell your uncle some news that’ll surprise him,
13617: Hetty; and I think he’ll be glad to hear it too.”
13618: 
13619: “What’s that?” Hetty said indifferently.
13620: 
13621: “Why, Mr. Burge has offered me a share in his business, and I’m going
13622: to take it.”
13623: 
13624: There was a change in Hetty’s face, certainly not produced by any
13625: agreeable impression from this news. In fact she felt a momentary
13626: annoyance and alarm, for she had so often heard it hinted by her uncle
13627: that Adam might have Mary Burge and a share in the business any day, if
13628: he liked, that she associated the two objects now, and the thought
13629: immediately occurred that perhaps Adam had given her up because of what
13630: had happened lately, and had turned towards Mary Burge. With that
13631: thought, and before she had time to remember any reasons why it could
13632: not be true, came a new sense of forsakenness and disappointment. The
13633: one thing—the one person—her mind had rested on in its dull weariness,
13634: had slipped away from her, and peevish misery filled her eyes with
13635: tears. She was looking on the ground, but Adam saw her face, saw the
13636: tears, and before he had finished saying, “Hetty, dear Hetty, what are
13637: you crying for?” his eager rapid thought had flown through all the
13638: causes conceivable to him, and had at last alighted on half the true
13639: one. Hetty thought he was going to marry Mary Burge—she didn’t like him
13640: to marry—perhaps she didn’t like him to marry any one but herself? All
13641: caution was swept away—all reason for it was gone, and Adam could feel
13642: nothing but trembling joy. He leaned towards her and took her hand, as
13643: he said:
13644: 
13645: “I could afford to be married now, Hetty—I could make a wife
13646: comfortable; but I shall never want to be married if you won’t have
13647: me.”
13648: 
13649: Hetty looked up at him and smiled through her tears, as she had done to
13650: Arthur that first evening in the wood, when she had thought he was not
13651: coming, and yet he came. It was a feebler relief, a feebler triumph she
13652: felt now, but the great dark eyes and the sweet lips were as beautiful
13653: as ever, perhaps more beautiful, for there was a more luxuriant
13654: womanliness about Hetty of late. Adam could hardly believe in the
13655: happiness of that moment. His right hand held her left, and he pressed
13656: her arm close against his heart as he leaned down towards her.
13657: 
13658: “Do you really love me, Hetty? Will you be my own wife, to love and
13659: take care of as long as I live?”
13660: 
13661: Hetty did not speak, but Adam’s face was very close to hers, and she
13662: put up her round cheek against his, like a kitten. She wanted to be
13663: caressed—she wanted to feel as if Arthur were with her again.
13664: 
13665: Adam cared for no words after that, and they hardly spoke through the
13666: rest of the walk. He only said, “I may tell your uncle and aunt, mayn’t
13667: I, Hetty?” and she said, “Yes.”
13668: 
13669: The red fire-light on the hearth at the Hall Farm shone on joyful faces
13670: that evening, when Hetty was gone upstairs and Adam took the
13671: opportunity of telling Mr. and Mrs. Poyser and the grandfather that he
13672: saw his way to maintaining a wife now, and that Hetty had consented to
13673: have him.
13674: 
13675: “I hope you have no objections against me for her husband,” said Adam;
13676: “I’m a poor man as yet, but she shall want nothing as I can work for.”
13677: 
13678: “Objections?” said Mr. Poyser, while the grandfather leaned forward and
13679: brought out his long “Nay, nay.” “What objections can we ha’ to you,
13680: lad? Never mind your being poorish as yet; there’s money in your
13681: head-piece as there’s money i’ the sown field, but it must ha’ time.
13682: You’n got enough to begin on, and we can do a deal tow’rt the bit o’
13683: furniture you’ll want. Thee’st got feathers and linen to spare—plenty,
13684: eh?”
13685: 
13686: This question was of course addressed to Mrs. Poyser, who was wrapped
13687: up in a warm shawl and was too hoarse to speak with her usual facility.
13688: At first she only nodded emphatically, but she was presently unable to
13689: resist the temptation to be more explicit.
13690: 
13691: “It ud be a poor tale if I hadna feathers and linen,” she said,
13692: hoarsely, “when I never sell a fowl but what’s plucked, and the wheel’s
13693: a-going every day o’ the week.”
13694: 
13695: “Come, my wench,” said Mr. Poyser, when Hetty came down, “come and kiss
13696: us, and let us wish you luck.”
13697: 
13698: Hetty went very quietly and kissed the big good-natured man.
13699: 
13700: “There!” he said, patting her on the back, “go and kiss your aunt and
13701: your grandfather. I’m as wishful t’ have you settled well as if you was
13702: my own daughter; and so’s your aunt, I’ll be bound, for she’s done by
13703: you this seven ’ear, Hetty, as if you’d been her own. Come, come, now,”
13704: he went on, becoming jocose, as soon as Hetty had kissed her aunt and
13705: the old man, “Adam wants a kiss too, I’ll warrant, and he’s a right to
13706: one now.”
13707: 
13708: Hetty turned away, smiling, towards her empty chair.
13709: 
13710: “Come, Adam, then, take one,” persisted Mr. Poyser, “else y’ arena half
13711: a man.”
13712: 
13713: Adam got up, blushing like a small maiden—great strong fellow as he
13714: was—and, putting his arm round Hetty stooped down and gently kissed her
13715: lips.
13716: 
13717: It was a pretty scene in the red fire-light; for there were no
13718: candles—why should there be, when the fire was so bright and was
13719: reflected from all the pewter and the polished oak? No one wanted to
13720: work on a Sunday evening. Even Hetty felt something like contentment in
13721: the midst of all this love. Adam’s attachment to her, Adam’s caress,
13722: stirred no passion in her, were no longer enough to satisfy her vanity,
13723: but they were the best her life offered her now—they promised her some
13724: change.
13725: 
13726: There was a great deal of discussion before Adam went away, about the
13727: possibility of his finding a house that would do for him to settle in.
13728: No house was empty except the one next to Will Maskery’s in the
13729: village, and that was too small for Adam now. Mr. Poyser insisted that
13730: the best plan would be for Seth and his mother to move and leave Adam
13731: in the old home, which might be enlarged after a while, for there was
13732: plenty of space in the woodyard and garden; but Adam objected to
13733: turning his mother out.
13734: 
13735: “Well, well,” said Mr. Poyser at last, “we needna fix everything
13736: to-night. We must take time to consider. You canna think o’ getting
13737: married afore Easter. I’m not for long courtships, but there must be a
13738: bit o’ time to make things comfortable.”
13739: 
13740: “Aye, to be sure,” said Mrs. Poyser, in a hoarse whisper; “Christian
13741: folks can’t be married like cuckoos, I reckon.”
13742: 
13743: “I’m a bit daunted, though,” said Mr. Poyser, “when I think as we may
13744: have notice to quit, and belike be forced to take a farm twenty mile
13745: off.”
13746: 
13747: “Eh,” said the old man, staring at the floor and lifting his hands up
13748: and down, while his arms rested on the elbows of his chair, “it’s a
13749: poor tale if I mun leave th’ ould spot an be buried in a strange
13750: parish. An’ you’ll happen ha’ double rates to pay,” he added, looking
13751: up at his son.
13752: 
13753: “Well, thee mustna fret beforehand, father,” said Martin the younger.
13754: “Happen the captain ’ull come home and make our peace wi’ th’ old
13755: squire. I build upo’ that, for I know the captain ’ll see folks righted
13756: if he can.”
13757: 
13758: 
13759: 
13760: 
13761: Chapter XXXV
13762: The Hidden Dread
13763: 
13764: 
13765: It was a busy time for Adam—the time between the beginning of November
13766: and the beginning of February, and he could see little of Hetty, except
13767: on Sundays. But a happy time, nevertheless, for it was taking him
13768: nearer and nearer to March, when they were to be married, and all the
13769: little preparations for their new housekeeping marked the progress
13770: towards the longed-for day. Two new rooms had been “run up” to the old
13771: house, for his mother and Seth were to live with them after all.
13772: Lisbeth had cried so piteously at the thought of leaving Adam that he
13773: had gone to Hetty and asked her if, for the love of him, she would put
13774: up with his mother’s ways and consent to live with her. To his great
13775: delight, Hetty said, “Yes; I’d as soon she lived with us as not.”
13776: Hetty’s mind was oppressed at that moment with a worse difficulty than
13777: poor Lisbeth’s ways; she could not care about them. So Adam was
13778: consoled for the disappointment he had felt when Seth had come back
13779: from his visit to Snowfield and said “it was no use—Dinah’s heart wasna
13780: turned towards marrying.” For when he told his mother that Hetty was
13781: willing they should all live together and there was no more need of
13782: them to think of parting, she said, in a more contented tone than he
13783: had heard her speak in since it had been settled that he was to be
13784: married, “Eh, my lad, I’ll be as still as th’ ould tabby, an’ ne’er
13785: want to do aught but th’ offal work, as _she_ wonna like t’ do. An’
13786: then we needna part the platters an’ things, as ha’ stood on the shelf
13787: together sin’ afore thee wast born.”
13788: 
13789: There was only one cloud that now and then came across Adam’s sunshine:
13790: Hetty seemed unhappy sometimes. But to all his anxious, tender
13791: questions, she replied with an assurance that she was quite contented
13792: and wished nothing different; and the next time he saw her she was more
13793: lively than usual. It might be that she was a little overdone with work
13794: and anxiety now, for soon after Christmas Mrs. Poyser had taken another
13795: cold, which had brought on inflammation, and this illness had confined
13796: her to her room all through January. Hetty had to manage everything
13797: downstairs, and half-supply Molly’s place too, while that good damsel
13798: waited on her mistress, and she seemed to throw herself so entirely
13799: into her new functions, working with a grave steadiness which was new
13800: in her, that Mr. Poyser often told Adam she was wanting to show him
13801: what a good housekeeper he would have; but he “doubted the lass was
13802: o’erdoing it—she must have a bit o’ rest when her aunt could come
13803: downstairs.”
13804: 
13805: This desirable event of Mrs. Poyser’s coming downstairs happened in the
13806: early part of February, when some mild weather thawed the last patch of
13807: snow on the Binton Hills. On one of these days, soon after her aunt
13808: came down, Hetty went to Treddleston to buy some of the wedding things
13809: which were wanting, and which Mrs. Poyser had scolded her for
13810: neglecting, observing that she supposed “it was because they were not
13811: for th’ outside, else she’d ha’ bought ’em fast enough.”
13812: 
13813: It was about ten o’clock when Hetty set off, and the slight hoar-frost
13814: that had whitened the hedges in the early morning had disappeared as
13815: the sun mounted the cloudless sky. Bright February days have a stronger
13816: charm of hope about them than any other days in the year. One likes to
13817: pause in the mild rays of the sun, and look over the gates at the
13818: patient plough-horses turning at the end of the furrow, and think that
13819: the beautiful year is all before one. The birds seem to feel just the
13820: same: their notes are as clear as the clear air. There are no leaves on
13821: the trees and hedgerows, but how green all the grassy fields are! And
13822: the dark purplish brown of the ploughed earth and of the bare branches
13823: is beautiful too. What a glad world this looks like, as one drives or
13824: rides along the valleys and over the hills! I have often thought so
13825: when, in foreign countries, where the fields and woods have looked to
13826: me like our English Loamshire—the rich land tilled with just as much
13827: care, the woods rolling down the gentle slopes to the green meadows—I
13828: have come on something by the roadside which has reminded me that I am
13829: not in Loamshire: an image of a great agony—the agony of the Cross. It
13830: has stood perhaps by the clustering apple-blossoms, or in the broad
13831: sunshine by the cornfield, or at a turning by the wood where a clear
13832: brook was gurgling below; and surely, if there came a traveller to this
13833: world who knew nothing of the story of man’s life upon it, this image
13834: of agony would seem to him strangely out of place in the midst of this
13835: joyous nature. He would not know that hidden behind the apple-blossoms,
13836: or among the golden corn, or under the shrouding boughs of the wood,
13837: there might be a human heart beating heavily with anguish—perhaps a
13838: young blooming girl, not knowing where to turn for refuge from
13839: swift-advancing shame, understanding no more of this life of ours than
13840: a foolish lost lamb wandering farther and farther in the nightfall on
13841: the lonely heath, yet tasting the bitterest of life’s bitterness.
13842: 
13843: Such things are sometimes hidden among the sunny fields and behind the
13844: blossoming orchards; and the sound of the gurgling brook, if you came
13845: close to one spot behind a small bush, would be mingled for your ear
13846: with a despairing human sob. No wonder man’s religion has much sorrow
13847: in it: no wonder he needs a suffering God.
13848: 
13849: Hetty, in her red cloak and warm bonnet, with her basket in her hand,
13850: is turning towards a gate by the side of the Treddleston road, but not
13851: that she may have a more lingering enjoyment of the sunshine and think
13852: with hope of the long unfolding year. She hardly knows that the sun is
13853: shining; and for weeks, now, when she has hoped at all, it has been for
13854: something at which she herself trembles and shudders. She only wants to
13855: be out of the high-road, that she may walk slowly and not care how her
13856: face looks, as she dwells on wretched thoughts; and through this gate
13857: she can get into a field-path behind the wide thick hedgerows. Her
13858: great dark eyes wander blankly over the fields like the eyes of one who
13859: is desolate, homeless, unloved, not the promised bride of a brave
13860: tender man. But there are no tears in them: her tears were all wept
13861: away in the weary night, before she went to sleep. At the next stile
13862: the pathway branches off: there are two roads before her—one along by
13863: the hedgerow, which will by and by lead her into the road again, the
13864: other across the fields, which will take her much farther out of the
13865: way into the Scantlands, low shrouded pastures where she will see
13866: nobody. She chooses this and begins to walk a little faster, as if she
13867: had suddenly thought of an object towards which it was worth while to
13868: hasten. Soon she is in the Scantlands, where the grassy land slopes
13869: gradually downwards, and she leaves the level ground to follow the
13870: slope. Farther on there is a clump of trees on the low ground, and she
13871: is making her way towards it. No, it is not a clump of trees, but a
13872: dark shrouded pool, so full with the wintry rains that the under boughs
13873: of the elder-bushes lie low beneath the water. She sits down on the
13874: grassy bank, against the stooping stem of the great oak that hangs over
13875: the dark pool. She has thought of this pool often in the nights of the
13876: month that has just gone by, and now at last she is come to see it. She
13877: clasps her hands round her knees, and leans forward, and looks
13878: earnestly at it, as if trying to guess what sort of bed it would make
13879: for her young round limbs.
13880: 
13881: No, she has not courage to jump into that cold watery bed, and if she
13882: had, they might find her—they might find out why she had drowned
13883: herself. There is but one thing left to her: she must go away, go where
13884: they can’t find her.
13885: 
13886: After the first on-coming of her great dread, some weeks after her
13887: betrothal to Adam, she had waited and waited, in the blind vague hope
13888: that something would happen to set her free from her terror; but she
13889: could wait no longer. All the force of her nature had been concentrated
13890: on the one effort of concealment, and she had shrunk with irresistible
13891: dread from every course that could tend towards a betrayal of her
13892: miserable secret. Whenever the thought of writing to Arthur had
13893: occurred to her, she had rejected it. He could do nothing for her that
13894: would shelter her from discovery and scorn among the relatives and
13895: neighbours who once more made all her world, now her airy dream had
13896: vanished. Her imagination no longer saw happiness with Arthur, for he
13897: could do nothing that would satisfy or soothe her pride. No, something
13898: else would happen—something _must_ happen—to set her free from this
13899: dread. In young, childish, ignorant souls there is constantly this
13900: blind trust in some unshapen chance: it is as hard to a boy or girl to
13901: believe that a great wretchedness will actually befall them as to
13902: believe that they will die.
13903: 
13904: But now necessity was pressing hard upon her—now the time of her
13905: marriage was close at hand—she could no longer rest in this blind
13906: trust. She must run away; she must hide herself where no familiar eyes
13907: could detect her; and then the terror of wandering out into the world,
13908: of which she knew nothing, made the possibility of going to Arthur a
13909: thought which brought some comfort with it. She felt so helpless now,
13910: so unable to fashion the future for herself, that the prospect of
13911: throwing herself on him had a relief in it which was stronger than her
13912: pride. As she sat by the pool and shuddered at the dark cold water, the
13913: hope that he would receive her tenderly—that he would care for her and
13914: think for her—was like a sense of lulling warmth, that made her for the
13915: moment indifferent to everything else; and she began now to think of
13916: nothing but the scheme by which she should get away.
13917: 
13918: She had had a letter from Dinah lately, full of kind words about the
13919: coming marriage, which she had heard of from Seth; and when Hetty had
13920: read this letter aloud to her uncle, he had said, “I wish Dinah ’ud
13921: come again now, for she’d be a comfort to your aunt when you’re gone.
13922: What do you think, my wench, o’ going to see her as soon as you can be
13923: spared and persuading her to come back wi’ you? You might happen
13924: persuade her wi’ telling her as her aunt wants her, for all she writes
13925: o’ not being able to come.” Hetty had not liked the thought of going to
13926: Snowfield, and felt no longing to see Dinah, so she only said, “It’s so
13927: far off, Uncle.” But now she thought this proposed visit would serve as
13928: a pretext for going away. She would tell her aunt when she got home
13929: again that she should like the change of going to Snowfield for a week
13930: or ten days. And then, when she got to Stoniton, where nobody knew her,
13931: she would ask for the coach that would take her on the way to Windsor.
13932: Arthur was at Windsor, and she would go to him.
13933: 
13934: As soon as Hetty had determined on this scheme, she rose from the
13935: grassy bank of the pool, took up her basket, and went on her way to
13936: Treddleston, for she must buy the wedding things she had come out for,
13937: though she would never want them. She must be careful not to raise any
13938: suspicion that she was going to run away.
13939: 
13940: Mrs. Poyser was quite agreeably surprised that Hetty wished to go and
13941: see Dinah and try to bring her back to stay over the wedding. The
13942: sooner she went the better, since the weather was pleasant now; and
13943: Adam, when he came in the evening, said, if Hetty could set off
13944: to-morrow, he would make time to go with her to Treddleston and see her
13945: safe into the Stoniton coach.
13946: 
13947: “I wish I could go with you and take care of you, Hetty,” he said, the
13948: next morning, leaning in at the coach door; “but you won’t stay much
13949: beyond a week—the time ’ull seem long.”
13950: 
13951: He was looking at her fondly, and his strong hand held hers in its
13952: grasp. Hetty felt a sense of protection in his presence—she was used to
13953: it now: if she could have had the past undone and known no other love
13954: than her quiet liking for Adam! The tears rose as she gave him the last
13955: look.
13956: 
13957: “God bless her for loving me,” said Adam, as he went on his way to work
13958: again, with Gyp at his heels.
13959: 
13960: But Hetty’s tears were not for Adam—not for the anguish that would come
13961: upon him when he found she was gone from him for ever. They were for
13962: the misery of her own lot, which took her away from this brave tender
13963: man who offered up his whole life to her, and threw her, a poor
13964: helpless suppliant, on the man who would think it a misfortune that she
13965: was obliged to cling to him.
13966: 
13967: At three o’clock that day, when Hetty was on the coach that was to take
13968: her, they said, to Leicester—part of the long, long way to Windsor—she
13969: felt dimly that she might be travelling all this weary journey towards
13970: the beginning of new misery.
13971: 
13972: Yet Arthur was at Windsor; he would surely not be angry with her. If he
13973: did not mind about her as he used to do, he had promised to be good to
13974: her.

13984: Chapter XXXVI
13985: The Journey of Hope
13986: 
13987: 
13988: A long, lonely journey, with sadness in the heart; away from the
13989: familiar to the strange: that is a hard and dreary thing even to the
13990: rich, the strong, the instructed; a hard thing, even when we are called
13991: by duty, not urged by dread.
13992: 
13993: What was it then to Hetty? With her poor narrow thoughts, no longer
13994: melting into vague hopes, but pressed upon by the chill of definite
13995: fear, repeating again and again the same small round of
13996: memories—shaping again and again the same childish, doubtful images of
13997: what was to come—seeing nothing in this wide world but the little
13998: history of her own pleasures and pains; with so little money in her
13999: pocket, and the way so long and difficult. Unless she could afford
14000: always to go in the coaches—and she felt sure she could not, for the
14001: journey to Stoniton was more expensive than she had expected—it was
14002: plain that she must trust to carriers’ carts or slow waggons; and what
14003: a time it would be before she could get to the end of her journey! The
14004: burly old coachman from Oakbourne, seeing such a pretty young woman
14005: among the outside passengers, had invited her to come and sit beside
14006: him; and feeling that it became him as a man and a coachman to open the
14007: dialogue with a joke, he applied himself as soon as they were off the
14008: stones to the elaboration of one suitable in all respects. After many
14009: cuts with his whip and glances at Hetty out of the corner of his eye,
14010: he lifted his lips above the edge of his wrapper and said, “He’s pretty
14011: nigh six foot, I’ll be bound, isna he, now?”
14012: 
14013: “Who?” said Hetty, rather startled.
14014: 
14015: “Why, the sweetheart as you’ve left behind, or else him as you’re goin’
14016: arter—which is it?”
14017: 
14018: Hetty felt her face flushing and then turning pale. She thought this
14019: coachman must know something about her. He must know Adam, and might
14020: tell him where she was gone, for it is difficult to country people to
14021: believe that those who make a figure in their own parish are not known
14022: everywhere else, and it was equally difficult to Hetty to understand
14023: that chance words could happen to apply closely to her circumstances.
14024: She was too frightened to speak.
14025: 
14026: “Hegh, hegh!” said the coachman, seeing that his joke was not so
14027: gratifying as he had expected, “you munna take it too ser’ous; if he’s
14028: behaved ill, get another. Such a pretty lass as you can get a
14029: sweetheart any day.”
14030: 
14031: Hetty’s fear was allayed by and by, when she found that the coachman
14032: made no further allusion to her personal concerns; but it still had the
14033: effect of preventing her from asking him what were the places on the
14034: road to Windsor. She told him she was only going a little way out of
14035: Stoniton, and when she got down at the inn where the coach stopped, she
14036: hastened away with her basket to another part of the town. When she had
14037: formed her plan of going to Windsor, she had not foreseen any
14038: difficulties except that of getting away, and after she had overcome
14039: this by proposing the visit to Dinah, her thoughts flew to the meeting
14040: with Arthur and the question how he would behave to her—not resting on
14041: any probable incidents of the journey. She was too entirely ignorant of
14042: traveling to imagine any of its details, and with all her store of
14043: money—her three guineas—in her pocket, she thought herself amply
14044: provided. It was not until she found how much it cost her to get to
14045: Stoniton that she began to be alarmed about the journey, and then, for
14046: the first time, she felt her ignorance as to the places that must be
14047: passed on her way. Oppressed with this new alarm, she walked along the
14048: grim Stoniton streets, and at last turned into a shabby little inn,
14049: where she hoped to get a cheap lodging for the night. Here she asked
14050: the landlord if he could tell her what places she must go to, to get to
14051: Windsor.
14052: 
14053: “Well, I can’t rightly say. Windsor must be pretty nigh London, for
14054: it’s where the king lives,” was the answer. “Anyhow, you’d best go t’
14055: Ashby next—that’s south’ard. But there’s as many places from here to
14056: London as there’s houses in Stoniton, by what I can make out. I’ve
14057: never been no traveller myself. But how comes a lone young woman like
14058: you to be thinking o’ taking such a journey as that?”
14059: 
14060: “I’m going to my brother—he’s a soldier at Windsor,” said Hetty,
14061: frightened at the landlord’s questioning look. “I can’t afford to go by
14062: the coach; do you think there’s a cart goes toward Ashby in the
14063: morning?”
14064: 
14065: “Yes, there may be carts if anybody knowed where they started from; but
14066: you might run over the town before you found out. You’d best set off
14067: and walk, and trust to summat overtaking you.”
14068: 
14069: Every word sank like lead on Hetty’s spirits; she saw the journey
14070: stretch bit by bit before her now. Even to get to Ashby seemed a hard
14071: thing: it might take the day, for what she knew, and that was nothing
14072: to the rest of the journey. But it must be done—she must get to Arthur.
14073: Oh, how she yearned to be again with somebody who would care for her!
14074: She who had never got up in the morning without the certainty of seeing
14075: familiar faces, people on whom she had an acknowledged claim; whose
14076: farthest journey had been to Rosseter on the pillion with her uncle;
14077: whose thoughts had always been taking holiday in dreams of pleasure,
14078: because all the business of her life was managed for her—this
14079: kittenlike Hetty, who till a few months ago had never felt any other
14080: grief than that of envying Mary Burge a new ribbon, or being girded at
14081: by her aunt for neglecting Totty, must now make her toilsome way in
14082: loneliness, her peaceful home left behind for ever, and nothing but a
14083: tremulous hope of distant refuge before her. Now for the first time, as
14084: she lay down to-night in the strange hard bed, she felt that her home
14085: had been a happy one, that her uncle had been very good to her, that
14086: her quiet lot at Hayslope among the things and people she knew, with
14087: her little pride in her one best gown and bonnet, and nothing to hide
14088: from any one, was what she would like to wake up to as a reality, and
14089: find that all the feverish life she had known besides was a short
14090: nightmare. She thought of all she had left behind with yearning regret
14091: for her own sake. Her own misery filled her heart—there was no room in
14092: it for other people’s sorrow. And yet, before the cruel letter, Arthur
14093: had been so tender and loving. The memory of that had still a charm for
14094: her, though it was no more than a soothing draught that just made pain
14095: bearable. For Hetty could conceive no other existence for herself in
14096: future than a hidden one, and a hidden life, even with love, would have
14097: had no delights for her; still less a life mingled with shame. She knew
14098: no romances, and had only a feeble share in the feelings which are the
14099: source of romance, so that well-read ladies may find it difficult to
14100: understand her state of mind. She was too ignorant of everything beyond
14101: the simple notions and habits in which she had been brought up to have
14102: any more definite idea of her probable future than that Arthur would
14103: take care of her somehow, and shelter her from anger and scorn. He
14104: would not marry her and make her a lady; and apart from that she could
14105: think of nothing he could give towards which she looked with longing
14106: and ambition.
14107: 
14108: The next morning she rose early, and taking only some milk and bread
14109: for her breakfast, set out to walk on the road towards Ashby, under a
14110: leaden-coloured sky, with a narrowing streak of yellow, like a
14111: departing hope, on the edge of the horizon. Now in her faintness of
14112: heart at the length and difficulty of her journey, she was most of all
14113: afraid of spending her money, and becoming so destitute that she would
14114: have to ask people’s charity; for Hetty had the pride not only of a
14115: proud nature but of a proud class—the class that pays the most
14116: poor-rates, and most shudders at the idea of profiting by a poor-rate.
14117: It had not yet occurred to her that she might get money for her locket
14118: and earrings which she carried with her, and she applied all her small
14119: arithmetic and knowledge of prices to calculating how many meals and
14120: how many rides were contained in her two guineas, and the odd
14121: shillings, which had a melancholy look, as if they were the pale ashes
14122: of the other bright-flaming coin.
14123: 
14124: For the first few miles out of Stoniton, she walked on bravely, always
14125: fixing on some tree or gate or projecting bush at the most distant
14126: visible point in the road as a goal, and feeling a faint joy when she
14127: had reached it. But when she came to the fourth milestone, the first
14128: she had happened to notice among the long grass by the roadside, and
14129: read that she was still only four miles beyond Stoniton, her courage
14130: sank. She had come only this little way, and yet felt tired, and almost
14131: hungry again in the keen morning air; for though Hetty was accustomed
14132: to much movement and exertion indoors, she was not used to long walks
14133: which produced quite a different sort of fatigue from that of household
14134: activity. As she was looking at the milestone she felt some drops
14135: falling on her face—it was beginning to rain. Here was a new trouble
14136: which had not entered into her sad thoughts before, and quite weighed
14137: down by this sudden addition to her burden, she sat down on the step of
14138: a stile and began to sob hysterically. The beginning of hardship is
14139: like the first taste of bitter food—it seems for a moment unbearable;
14140: yet, if there is nothing else to satisfy our hunger, we take another
14141: bite and find it possible to go on. When Hetty recovered from her burst
14142: of weeping, she rallied her fainting courage: it was raining, and she
14143: must try to get on to a village where she might find rest and shelter.
14144: Presently, as she walked on wearily, she heard the rumbling of heavy
14145: wheels behind her; a covered waggon was coming, creeping slowly along
14146: with a slouching driver cracking his whip beside the horses. She waited
14147: for it, thinking that if the waggoner were not a very sour-looking man,
14148: she would ask him to take her up. As the waggon approached her, the
14149: driver had fallen behind, but there was something in the front of the
14150: big vehicle which encouraged her. At any previous moment in her life
14151: she would not have noticed it, but now, the new susceptibility that
14152: suffering had awakened in her caused this object to impress her
14153: strongly. It was only a small white-and-liver-coloured spaniel which
14154: sat on the front ledge of the waggon, with large timid eyes, and an
14155: incessant trembling in the body, such as you may have seen in some of
14156: these small creatures. Hetty cared little for animals, as you know, but
14157: at this moment she felt as if the helpless timid creature had some
14158: fellowship with her, and without being quite aware of the reason, she
14159: was less doubtful about speaking to the driver, who now came forward—a
14160: large ruddy man, with a sack over his shoulders, by way of scarf or
14161: mantle.
14162: 
14163: “Could you take me up in your waggon, if you’re going towards Ashby?”
14164: said Hetty. “I’ll pay you for it.”
14165: 
14166: “Aw,” said the big fellow, with that slowly dawning smile which belongs
14167: to heavy faces, “I can take y’ up fawst enough wi’out bein’ paid for’t
14168: if you dooant mind lyin’ a bit closish a-top o’ the wool-packs. Where
14169: do you coom from? And what do you want at Ashby?”
14170: 
14171: “I come from Stoniton. I’m going a long way—to Windsor.”
14172: 
14173: “What! Arter some service, or what?”
14174: 
14175: “Going to my brother—he’s a soldier there.”
14176: 
14177: “Well, I’m going no furder nor Leicester—and fur enough too—but I’ll
14178: take you, if you dooant mind being a bit long on the road. Th’ hosses
14179: wooant feel _your_ weight no more nor they feel the little doog there,
14180: as I puck up on the road a fortni’t agoo. He war lost, I b’lieve, an’s
14181: been all of a tremble iver sin’. Come, gi’ us your basket an’ come
14182: behind and let me put y’ in.”
14183: 
14184: To lie on the wool-packs, with a cranny left between the curtains of
14185: the awning to let in the air, was luxury to Hetty now, and she
14186: half-slept away the hours till the driver came to ask her if she wanted
14187: to get down and have “some victual”; he himself was going to eat his
14188: dinner at this “public.” Late at night they reached Leicester, and so
14189: this second day of Hetty’s journey was past. She had spent no money
14190: except what she had paid for her food, but she felt that this slow
14191: journeying would be intolerable for her another day, and in the morning
14192: she found her way to a coach-office to ask about the road to Windsor,
14193: and see if it would cost her too much to go part of the distance by
14194: coach again. Yes! The distance was too great—the coaches were too
14195: dear—she must give them up; but the elderly clerk at the office,
14196: touched by her pretty anxious face, wrote down for her the names of the
14197: chief places she must pass through. This was the only comfort she got
14198: in Leicester, for the men stared at her as she went along the street,
14199: and for the first time in her life Hetty wished no one would look at
14200: her. She set out walking again; but this day she was fortunate, for she
14201: was soon overtaken by a carrier’s cart which carried her to Hinckley,
14202: and by the help of a return chaise, with a drunken postilion—who
14203: frightened her by driving like Jehu the son of Nimshi, and shouting
14204: hilarious remarks at her, twisting himself backwards on his saddle—she
14205: was before night in the heart of woody Warwickshire: but still almost a
14206: hundred miles from Windsor, they told her. Oh what a large world it
14207: was, and what hard work for her to find her way in it! She went by
14208: mistake to Stratford-on-Avon, finding Stratford set down in her list of
14209: places, and then she was told she had come a long way out of the right
14210: road. It was not till the fifth day that she got to Stony Stratford.
14211: That seems but a slight journey as you look at the map, or remember
14212: your own pleasant travels to and from the meadowy banks of the Avon.
14213: But how wearily long it was to Hetty! It seemed to her as if this
14214: country of flat fields, and hedgerows, and dotted houses, and villages,
14215: and market-towns—all so much alike to her indifferent eyes—must have no
14216: end, and she must go on wandering among them for ever, waiting tired at
14217: toll-gates for some cart to come, and then finding the cart went only a
14218: little way—a very little way—to the miller’s a mile off perhaps; and
14219: she hated going into the public houses, where she must go to get food
14220: and ask questions, because there were always men lounging there, who
14221: stared at her and joked her rudely. Her body was very weary too with
14222: these days of new fatigue and anxiety; they had made her look more pale
14223: and worn than all the time of hidden dread she had gone through at
14224: home. When at last she reached Stony Stratford, her impatience and
14225: weariness had become too strong for her economical caution; she
14226: determined to take the coach for the rest of the way, though it should
14227: cost her all her remaining money. She would need nothing at Windsor but
14228: to find Arthur. When she had paid the fare for the last coach, she had
14229: only a shilling; and as she got down at the sign of the Green Man in
14230: Windsor at twelve o’clock in the middle of the seventh day, hungry and
14231: faint, the coachman came up, and begged her to “remember him.” She put
14232: her hand in her pocket and took out the shilling, but the tears came
14233: with the sense of exhaustion and the thought that she was giving away
14234: her last means of getting food, which she really required before she
14235: could go in search of Arthur. As she held out the shilling, she lifted
14236: up her dark tear-filled eyes to the coachman’s face and said, “Can you
14237: give me back sixpence?”
14238: 
14239: “No, no,” he said, gruffly, “never mind—put the shilling up again.”
14240: 
14241: The landlord of the Green Man had stood near enough to witness this
14242: scene, and he was a man whose abundant feeding served to keep his good
14243: nature, as well as his person, in high condition. And that lovely
14244: tearful face of Hetty’s would have found out the sensitive fibre in
14245: most men.
14246: 
14247: “Come, young woman, come in,” he said, “and have a drop o’ something;
14248: you’re pretty well knocked up, I can see that.”
14249: 
14250: He took her into the bar and said to his wife, “Here, missis, take this
14251: young woman into the parlour; she’s a little overcome”—for Hetty’s
14252: tears were falling fast. They were merely hysterical tears: she thought
14253: she had no reason for weeping now, and was vexed that she was too weak
14254: and tired to help it. She was at Windsor at last, not far from Arthur.
14255: 
14256: She looked with eager, hungry eyes at the bread and meat and beer that
14257: the landlady brought her, and for some minutes she forgot everything
14258: else in the delicious sensations of satisfying hunger and recovering
14259: from exhaustion. The landlady sat opposite to her as she ate, and
14260: looked at her earnestly. No wonder: Hetty had thrown off her bonnet,
14261: and her curls had fallen down. Her face was all the more touching in
14262: its youth and beauty because of its weary look, and the good woman’s
14263: eyes presently wandered to her figure, which in her hurried dressing on
14264: her journey she had taken no pains to conceal; moreover, the stranger’s
14265: eye detects what the familiar unsuspecting eye leaves unnoticed.
14266: 
14267: “Why, you’re not very fit for travelling,” she said, glancing while she
14268: spoke at Hetty’s ringless hand. “Have you come far?”
14269: 
14270: “Yes,” said Hetty, roused by this question to exert more self-command,
14271: and feeling the better for the food she had taken. “I’ve come a good
14272: long way, and it’s very tiring. But I’m better now. Could you tell me
14273: which way to go to this place?” Here Hetty took from her pocket a bit
14274: of paper: it was the end of Arthur’s letter on which he had written his
14275: address.
14276: 
14277: While she was speaking, the landlord had come in and had begun to look
14278: at her as earnestly as his wife had done. He took up the piece of paper
14279: which Hetty handed across the table, and read the address.
14280: 
14281: “Why, what do you want at this house?” he said. It is in the nature of
14282: innkeepers and all men who have no pressing business of their own to
14283: ask as many questions as possible before giving any information.
14284: 
14285: “I want to see a gentleman as is there,” said Hetty.
14286: 
14287: “But there’s no gentleman there,” returned the landlord. “It’s shut
14288: up—been shut up this fortnight. What gentleman is it you want? Perhaps
14289: I can let you know where to find him.”
14290: 
14291: “It’s Captain Donnithorne,” said Hetty tremulously, her heart beginning
14292: to beat painfully at this disappointment of her hope that she should
14293: find Arthur at once.
14294: 
14295: “Captain Donnithorne? Stop a bit,” said the landlord, slowly. “Was he
14296: in the Loamshire Militia? A tall young officer with a fairish skin and
14297: reddish whiskers—and had a servant by the name o’ Pym?”
14298: 
14299: “Oh yes,” said Hetty; “you know him—where is he?”
14300: 
14301: “A fine sight o’ miles away from here. The Loamshire Militia’s gone to
14302: Ireland; it’s been gone this fortnight.”
14303: 
14304: “Look there! She’s fainting,” said the landlady, hastening to support
14305: Hetty, who had lost her miserable consciousness and looked like a
14306: beautiful corpse. They carried her to the sofa and loosened her dress.
14307: 
14308: “Here’s a bad business, I suspect,” said the landlord, as he brought in
14309: some water.
14310: 
14311: “Ah, it’s plain enough what sort of business it is,” said the wife.
14312: “She’s not a common flaunting dratchell, I can see that. She looks like
14313: a respectable country girl, and she comes from a good way off, to judge
14314: by her tongue. She talks something like that ostler we had that come
14315: from the north. He was as honest a fellow as we ever had about the
14316: house—they’re all honest folks in the north.”
14317: 
14318: “I never saw a prettier young woman in my life,” said the husband.
14319: “She’s like a pictur in a shop-winder. It goes to one’s ’eart to look
14320: at her.”
14321: 
14322: “It ’ud have been a good deal better for her if she’d been uglier and
14323: had more conduct,” said the landlady, who on any charitable
14324: construction must have been supposed to have more “conduct” than
14325: beauty. “But she’s coming to again. Fetch a drop more water.”
14326: 
14327:

14329: 
14330: Chapter XXXVII
14331: The Journey in Despair
14332: 
14333: 
14334: Hetty was too ill through the rest of that day for any questions to be
14335: addressed to her—too ill even to think with any distinctness of the
14336: evils that were to come. She only felt that all her hope was crushed,
14337: and that instead of having found a refuge she had only reached the
14338: borders of a new wilderness where no goal lay before her. The
14339: sensations of bodily sickness, in a comfortable bed, and with the
14340: tendance of the good-natured landlady, made a sort of respite for her;
14341: such a respite as there is in the faint weariness which obliges a man
14342: to throw himself on the sand instead of toiling onward under the
14343: scorching sun.
14344: 
14345: But when sleep and rest had brought back the strength necessary for the
14346: keenness of mental suffering—when she lay the next morning looking at
14347: the growing light which was like a cruel task-master returning to urge
14348: from her a fresh round of hated hopeless labour—she began to think what
14349: course she must take, to remember that all her money was gone, to look
14350: at the prospect of further wandering among strangers with the new
14351: clearness shed on it by the experience of her journey to Windsor. But
14352: which way could she turn? It was impossible for her to enter into any
14353: service, even if she could obtain it. There was nothing but immediate
14354: beggary before her. She thought of a young woman who had been found
14355: against the church wall at Hayslope one Sunday, nearly dead with cold
14356: and hunger—a tiny infant in her arms. The woman was rescued and taken
14357: to the parish. “The parish!” You can perhaps hardly understand the
14358: effect of that word on a mind like Hetty’s, brought up among people who
14359: were somewhat hard in their feelings even towards poverty, who lived
14360: among the fields, and had little pity for want and rags as a cruel
14361: inevitable fate such as they sometimes seem in cities, but held them a
14362: mark of idleness and vice—and it was idleness and vice that brought
14363: burdens on the parish. To Hetty the “parish” was next to the prison in
14364: obloquy, and to ask anything of strangers—to beg—lay in the same
14365: far-off hideous region of intolerable shame that Hetty had all her life
14366: thought it impossible she could ever come near. But now the remembrance
14367: of that wretched woman whom she had seen herself, on her way from
14368: church, being carried into Joshua Rann’s, came back upon her with the
14369: new terrible sense that there was very little now to divide _her_ from
14370: the same lot. And the dread of bodily hardship mingled with the dread
14371: of shame; for Hetty had the luxurious nature of a round soft-coated pet
14372: animal.
14373: 
14374: How she yearned to be back in her safe home again, cherished and cared
14375: for as she had always been! Her aunt’s scolding about trifles would
14376: have been music to her ears now; she longed for it; she used to hear it
14377: in a time when she had only trifles to hide. Could she be the same
14378: Hetty that used to make up the butter in the dairy with the Guelder
14379: roses peeping in at the window—she, a runaway whom her friends would
14380: not open their doors to again, lying in this strange bed, with the
14381: knowledge that she had no money to pay for what she received, and must
14382: offer those strangers some of the clothes in her basket? It was then
14383: she thought of her locket and ear-rings, and seeing her pocket lie
14384: near, she reached it and spread the contents on the bed before her.
14385: There were the locket and ear-rings in the little velvet-lined boxes,
14386: and with them there was a beautiful silver thimble which Adam had
14387: bought her, the words “Remember me” making the ornament of the border;
14388: a steel purse, with her one shilling in it; and a small red-leather
14389: case, fastening with a strap. Those beautiful little ear-rings, with
14390: their delicate pearls and garnet, that she had tried in her ears with
14391: such longing in the bright sunshine on the 30th of July! She had no
14392: longing to put them in her ears now: her head with its dark rings of
14393: hair lay back languidly on the pillow, and the sadness that rested
14394: about her brow and eyes was something too hard for regretful memory.
14395: Yet she put her hands up to her ears: it was because there were some
14396: thin gold rings in them, which were also worth a little money. Yes, she
14397: could surely get some money for her ornaments: those Arthur had given
14398: her must have cost a great deal of money. The landlord and landlady had
14399: been good to her; perhaps they would help her to get the money for
14400: these things.
14401: 
14402: But this money would not keep her long. What should she do when it was
14403: gone? Where should she go? The horrible thought of want and beggary
14404: drove her once to think she would go back to her uncle and aunt and ask
14405: them to forgive her and have pity on her. But she shrank from that idea
14406: again, as she might have shrunk from scorching metal. She could never
14407: endure that shame before her uncle and aunt, before Mary Burge, and the
14408: servants at the Chase, and the people at Broxton, and everybody who
14409: knew her. They should never know what had happened to her. What _could_
14410: she do? She would go away from Windsor—travel again as she had done the
14411: last week, and get among the flat green fields with the high hedges
14412: round them, where nobody could see her or know her; and there, perhaps,
14413: when there was nothing else she could do, she should get courage to
14414: drown herself in some pond like that in the Scantlands. Yes, she would
14415: get away from Windsor as soon as possible: she didn’t like these people
14416: at the inn to know about her, to know that she had come to look for
14417: Captain Donnithorne. She must think of some reason to tell them why she
14418: had asked for him.
14419: 
14420: With this thought she began to put the things back into her pocket,
14421: meaning to get up and dress before the landlady came to her. She had
14422: her hand on the red-leather case, when it occurred to her that there
14423: might be something in this case which she had forgotten—something worth
14424: selling; for without knowing what she should do with her life, she
14425: craved the means of living as long as possible; and when we desire
14426: eagerly to find something, we are apt to search for it in hopeless
14427: places. No, there was nothing but common needles and pins, and dried
14428: tulip-petals between the paper leaves where she had written down her
14429: little money-accounts. But on one of these leaves there was a name,
14430: which, often as she had seen it before, now flashed on Hetty’s mind
14431: like a newly discovered message. The name was—_Dinah Morris,
14432: Snowfield_. There was a text above it, written, as well as the name, by
14433: Dinah’s own hand with a little pencil, one evening that they were
14434: sitting together and Hetty happened to have the red case lying open
14435: before her. Hetty did not read the text now: she was only arrested by
14436: the name. Now, for the first time, she remembered without indifference
14437: the affectionate kindness Dinah had shown her, and those words of Dinah
14438: in the bed-chamber—that Hetty must think of her as a friend in trouble.
14439: Suppose she were to go to Dinah, and ask her to help her? Dinah did not
14440: think about things as other people did. She was a mystery to Hetty, but
14441: Hetty knew she was always kind. She couldn’t imagine Dinah’s face
14442: turning away from her in dark reproof or scorn, Dinah’s voice willingly
14443: speaking ill of her, or rejoicing in her misery as a punishment. Dinah
14444: did not seem to belong to that world of Hetty’s, whose glance she
14445: dreaded like scorching fire. But even to her Hetty shrank from
14446: beseeching and confession. She could not prevail on herself to say, “I
14447: will go to Dinah”: she only thought of that as a possible alternative,
14448: if she had not courage for death.
14449: 
14450: The good landlady was amazed when she saw Hetty come downstairs soon
14451: after herself, neatly dressed, and looking resolutely self-possessed.
14452: Hetty told her she was quite well this morning. She had only been very
14453: tired and overcome with her journey, for she had come a long way to ask
14454: about her brother, who had run away, and they thought he was gone for a
14455: soldier, and Captain Donnithorne might know, for he had been very kind
14456: to her brother once. It was a lame story, and the landlady looked
14457: doubtfully at Hetty as she told it; but there was a resolute air of
14458: self-reliance about her this morning, so different from the helpless
14459: prostration of yesterday, that the landlady hardly knew how to make a
14460: remark that might seem like prying into other people’s affairs. She
14461: only invited her to sit down to breakfast with them, and in the course
14462: of it Hetty brought out her ear-rings and locket, and asked the
14463: landlord if he could help her to get money for them. Her journey, she
14464: said, had cost her much more than she expected, and now she had no
14465: money to get back to her friends, which she wanted to do at once.
14466: 
14467: It was not the first time the landlady had seen the ornaments, for she
14468: had examined the contents of Hetty’s pocket yesterday, and she and her
14469: husband had discussed the fact of a country girl having these beautiful
14470: things, with a stronger conviction than ever that Hetty had been
14471: miserably deluded by the fine young officer.
14472: 
14473: “Well,” said the landlord, when Hetty had spread the precious trifles
14474: before him, “we might take ’em to the jeweller’s shop, for there’s one
14475: not far off; but Lord bless you, they wouldn’t give you a quarter o’
14476: what the things are worth. And you wouldn’t like to part with ’em?” he
14477: added, looking at her inquiringly.
14478: 
14479: “Oh, I don’t mind,” said Hetty, hastily, “so as I can get money to go
14480: back.”
14481: 
14482: “And they might think the things were stolen, as you wanted to sell
14483: ’em,” he went on, “for it isn’t usual for a young woman like you to
14484: have fine jew’llery like that.”
14485: 
14486: The blood rushed to Hetty’s face with anger. “I belong to respectable
14487: folks,” she said; “I’m not a thief.”
14488: 
14489: “No, that you aren’t, I’ll be bound,” said the landlady; “and you’d no
14490: call to say that,” looking indignantly at her husband. “The things were
14491: gev to her: that’s plain enough to be seen.”
14492: 
14493: “I didn’t mean as I thought so,” said the husband, apologetically, “but
14494: I said it was what the jeweller might think, and so he wouldn’t be
14495: offering much money for ’em.”
14496: 
14497: “Well,” said the wife, “suppose you were to advance some money on the
14498: things yourself, and then if she liked to redeem ’em when she got home,
14499: she could. But if we heard nothing from her after two months, we might
14500: do as we liked with ’em.”
14501: 
14502: I will not say that in this accommodating proposition the landlady had
14503: no regard whatever to the possible reward of her good nature in the
14504: ultimate possession of the locket and ear-rings: indeed, the effect
14505: they would have in that case on the mind of the grocer’s wife had
14506: presented itself with remarkable vividness to her rapid imagination.
14507: The landlord took up the ornaments and pushed out his lips in a
14508: meditative manner. He wished Hetty well, doubtless; but pray, how many
14509: of your well-wishers would decline to make a little gain out of you?
14510: Your landlady is sincerely affected at parting with you, respects you
14511: highly, and will really rejoice if any one else is generous to you; but
14512: at the same time she hands you a bill by which she gains as high a
14513: percentage as possible.
14514: 
14515: “How much money do you want to get home with, young woman?” said the
14516: well-wisher, at length.
14517: 
14518: “Three guineas,” answered Hetty, fixing on the sum she set out with,
14519: for want of any other standard, and afraid of asking too much.
14520: 
14521: “Well, I’ve no objections to advance you three guineas,” said the
14522: landlord; “and if you like to send it me back and get the jewellery
14523: again, you can, you know. The Green Man isn’t going to run away.”
14524: 
14525: “Oh yes, I’ll be very glad if you’ll give me that,” said Hetty,
14526: relieved at the thought that she would not have to go to the jeweller’s
14527: and be stared at and questioned.
14528: 
14529: “But if you want the things again, you’ll write before long,” said the
14530: landlady, “because when two months are up, we shall make up our minds
14531: as you don’t want ’em.”
14532: 
14533: “Yes,” said Hetty indifferently.
14534: 
14535: The husband and wife were equally content with this arrangement. The
14536: husband thought, if the ornaments were not redeemed, he could make a
14537: good thing of it by taking them to London and selling them. The wife
14538: thought she would coax the good man into letting her keep them. And
14539: they were accommodating Hetty, poor thing—a pretty, respectable-looking
14540: young woman, apparently in a sad case. They declined to take anything
14541: for her food and bed: she was quite welcome. And at eleven o’clock
14542: Hetty said “Good-bye” to them with the same quiet, resolute air she had
14543: worn all the morning, mounting the coach that was to take her twenty
14544: miles back along the way she had come.
14545: 
14546: There is a strength of self-possession which is the sign that the last
14547: hope has departed. Despair no more leans on others than perfect
14548: contentment, and in despair pride ceases to be counteracted by the
14549: sense of dependence.
14550: 
14551: Hetty felt that no one could deliver her from the evils that would make
14552: life hateful to her; and no one, she said to herself, should ever know
14553: her misery and humiliation. No; she would not confess even to Dinah.
14554: She would wander out of sight, and drown herself where her body would
14555: never be found, and no one should know what had become of her.
14556: 
14557: When she got off this coach, she began to walk again, and take cheap
14558: rides in carts, and get cheap meals, going on and on without distinct
14559: purpose, yet strangely, by some fascination, taking the way she had
14560: come, though she was determined not to go back to her own country.
14561: Perhaps it was because she had fixed her mind on the grassy
14562: Warwickshire fields, with the bushy tree-studded hedgerows that made a
14563: hiding-place even in this leafless season. She went more slowly than
14564: she came, often getting over the stiles and sitting for hours under the
14565: hedgerows, looking before her with blank, beautiful eyes; fancying
14566: herself at the edge of a hidden pool, low down, like that in the
14567: Scantlands; wondering if it were very painful to be drowned, and if
14568: there would be anything worse after death than what she dreaded in
14569: life. Religious doctrines had taken no hold on Hetty’s mind. She was
14570: one of those numerous people who have had godfathers and godmothers,
14571: learned their catechism, been confirmed, and gone to church every
14572: Sunday, and yet, for any practical result of strength in life, or trust
14573: in death, have never appropriated a single Christian idea or Christian
14574: feeling. You would misunderstand her thoughts during these wretched
14575: days, if you imagined that they were influenced either by religious
14576: fears or religious hopes.
14577: 
14578: She chose to go to Stratford-on-Avon again, where she had gone before
14579: by mistake, for she remembered some grassy fields on her former way
14580: towards it—fields among which she thought she might find just the sort
14581: of pool she had in her mind. Yet she took care of her money still; she
14582: carried her basket; death seemed still a long way off, and life was so
14583: strong in her. She craved food and rest—she hastened towards them at
14584: the very moment she was picturing to herself the bank from which she
14585: would leap towards death. It was already five days since she had left
14586: Windsor, for she had wandered about, always avoiding speech or
14587: questioning looks, and recovering her air of proud self-dependence
14588: whenever she was under observation, choosing her decent lodging at
14589: night, and dressing herself neatly in the morning, and setting off on
14590: her way steadily, or remaining under shelter if it rained, as if she
14591: had a happy life to cherish.
14592: 
14593: And yet, even in her most self-conscious moments, the face was sadly
14594: different from that which had smiled at itself in the old specked
14595: glass, or smiled at others when they glanced at it admiringly. A hard
14596: and even fierce look had come in the eyes, though their lashes were as
14597: long as ever, and they had all their dark brightness. And the cheek was
14598: never dimpled with smiles now. It was the same rounded, pouting,
14599: childish prettiness, but with all love and belief in love departed from
14600: it—the sadder for its beauty, like that wondrous Medusa-face, with the
14601: passionate, passionless lips.
14602: 
14603: At last she was among the fields she had been dreaming of, on a long
14604: narrow pathway leading towards a wood. If there should be a pool in
14605: that wood! It would be better hidden than one in the fields. No, it was
14606: not a wood, only a wild brake, where there had once been gravel-pits,
14607: leaving mounds and hollows studded with brushwood and small trees. She
14608: roamed up and down, thinking there was perhaps a pool in every hollow
14609: before she came to it, till her limbs were weary, and she sat down to
14610: rest. The afternoon was far advanced, and the leaden sky was darkening,
14611: as if the sun were setting behind it. After a little while Hetty
14612: started up again, feeling that darkness would soon come on; and she
14613: must put off finding the pool till to-morrow, and make her way to some
14614: shelter for the night. She had quite lost her way in the fields, and
14615: might as well go in one direction as another, for aught she knew. She
14616: walked through field after field, and no village, no house was in
14617: sight; but _there_, at the corner of this pasture, there was a break in
14618: the hedges; the land seemed to dip down a little, and two trees leaned
14619: towards each other across the opening. Hetty’s heart gave a great beat
14620: as she thought there must be a pool there. She walked towards it
14621: heavily over the tufted grass, with pale lips and a sense of trembling.
14622: It was as if the thing were come in spite of herself, instead of being
14623: the object of her search.
14624: 
14625: There it was, black under the darkening sky: no motion, no sound near.
14626: She set down her basket, and then sank down herself on the grass,
14627: trembling. The pool had its wintry depth now: by the time it got
14628: shallow, as she remembered the pools did at Hayslope, in the summer, no
14629: one could find out that it was her body. But then there was her
14630: basket—she must hide that too. She must throw it into the water—make it
14631: heavy with stones first, and then throw it in. She got up to look about
14632: for stones, and soon brought five or six, which she laid down beside
14633: her basket, and then sat down again. There was no need to hurry—there
14634: was all the night to drown herself in. She sat leaning her elbow on the
14635: basket. She was weary, hungry. There were some buns in her
14636: basket—three, which she had supplied herself with at the place where
14637: she ate her dinner. She took them out now and ate them eagerly, and
14638: then sat still again, looking at the pool. The soothed sensation that
14639: came over her from the satisfaction of her hunger, and this fixed
14640: dreamy attitude, brought on drowsiness, and presently her head sank
14641: down on her knees. She was fast asleep.
14642: 
14643: When she awoke it was deep night, and she felt chill. She was
14644: frightened at this darkness—frightened at the long night before her. If
14645: she _could_ but throw herself into the water! No, not yet. She began to
14646: walk about that she might get warm again, as if she would have more
14647: resolution then. Oh how long the time was in that darkness! The bright
14648: hearth and the warmth and the voices of home, the secure uprising and
14649: lying down, the familiar fields, the familiar people, the Sundays and
14650: holidays with their simple joys of dress and feasting—all the sweets of
14651: her young life rushed before her now, and she seemed to be stretching
14652: her arms towards them across a great gulf. She set her teeth when she
14653: thought of Arthur. She cursed him, without knowing what her cursing
14654: would do. She wished he too might know desolation, and cold, and a life
14655: of shame that he dared not end by death.
14656: 
14657: The horror of this cold, and darkness, and solitude—out of all human
14658: reach—became greater every long minute. It was almost as if she were
14659: dead already, and knew that she was dead, and longed to get back to
14660: life again. But no: she was alive still; she had not taken the dreadful
14661: leap. She felt a strange contradictory wretchedness and exultation:
14662: wretchedness, that she did not dare to face death; exultation, that she
14663: was still in life—that she might yet know light and warmth again. She
14664: walked backwards and forwards to warm herself, beginning to discern
14665: something of the objects around her, as her eyes became accustomed to
14666: the night—the darker line of the hedge, the rapid motion of some living
14667: creature—perhaps a field-mouse—rushing across the grass. She no longer
14668: felt as if the darkness hedged her in. She thought she could walk back
14669: across the field, and get over the stile; and then, in the very next
14670: field, she thought she remembered there was a hovel of furze near a
14671: sheepfold. If she could get into that hovel, she would be warmer. She
14672: could pass the night there, for that was what Alick did at Hayslope in
14673: lambing-time. The thought of this hovel brought the energy of a new
14674: hope. She took up her basket and walked across the field, but it was
14675: some time before she got in the right direction for the stile. The
14676: exercise and the occupation of finding the stile were a stimulus to
14677: her, however, and lightened the horror of the darkness and solitude.
14678: There were sheep in the next field, and she startled a group as she set
14679: down her basket and got over the stile; and the sound of their movement
14680: comforted her, for it assured her that her impression was right—this
14681: _was_ the field where she had seen the hovel, for it was the field
14682: where the sheep were. Right on along the path, and she would get to it.
14683: She reached the opposite gate, and felt her way along its rails and the
14684: rails of the sheep-fold, till her hand encountered the pricking of the
14685: gorsy wall. Delicious sensation! She had found the shelter. She groped
14686: her way, touching the prickly gorse, to the door, and pushed it open.
14687: It was an ill-smelling close place, but warm, and there was straw on
14688: the ground. Hetty sank down on the straw with a sense of escape. Tears
14689: came—she had never shed tears before since she left Windsor—tears and
14690: sobs of hysterical joy that she had still hold of life, that she was
14691: still on the familiar earth, with the sheep near her. The very
14692: consciousness of her own limbs was a delight to her: she turned up her
14693: sleeves, and kissed her arms with the passionate love of life. Soon
14694: warmth and weariness lulled her in the midst of her sobs, and she fell
14695: continually into dozing, fancying herself at the brink of the pool
14696: again—fancying that she had jumped into the water, and then awaking
14697: with a start, and wondering where she was. But at last deep dreamless
14698: sleep came; her head, guarded by her bonnet, found a pillow against the
14699: gorsy wall, and the poor soul, driven to and fro between two equal
14700: terrors, found the one relief that was possible to it—the relief of
14701: unconsciousness.
14702: 
14703: Alas! That relief seems to end the moment it has begun. It seemed to
14704: Hetty as if those dozen dreams had only passed into another dream—that
14705: she was in the hovel, and her aunt was standing over her with a candle
14706: in her hand. She trembled under her aunt’s glance, and opened her eyes.
14707: There was no candle, but there was light in the hovel—the light of
14708: early morning through the open door. And there was a face looking down
14709: on her; but it was an unknown face, belonging to an elderly man in a
14710: smock-frock.
14711: 
14712: “Why, what do you do here, young woman?” the man said roughly.
14713: 
14714: Hetty trembled still worse under this real fear and shame than she had
14715: done in her momentary dream under her aunt’s glance. She felt that she
14716: was like a beggar already—found sleeping in that place. But in spite of
14717: her trembling, she was so eager to account to the man for her presence
14718: here, that she found words at once.
14719: 
14720: “I lost my way,” she said. “I’m travelling—north’ard, and I got away
14721: from the road into the fields, and was overtaken by the dark. Will you
14722: tell me the way to the nearest village?”
14723: 
14724: She got up as she was speaking, and put her hands to her bonnet to
14725: adjust it, and then laid hold of her basket.
14726: 
14727: The man looked at her with a slow bovine gaze, without giving her any
14728: answer, for some seconds. Then he turned away and walked towards the
14729: door of the hovel, but it was not till he got there that he stood
14730: still, and, turning his shoulder half-round towards her, said, “Aw, I
14731: can show you the way to Norton, if you like. But what do you do gettin’
14732: out o’ the highroad?” he added, with a tone of gruff reproof. “Y’ull be
14733: gettin’ into mischief, if you dooant mind.”
14734: 
14735: “Yes,” said Hetty, “I won’t do it again. I’ll keep in the road, if
14736: you’ll be so good as show me how to get to it.”
14737: 
14738: “Why dooant you keep where there’s a finger-poasses an’ folks to ax the
14739: way on?” the man said, still more gruffly. “Anybody ’ud think you was a
14740: wild woman, an’ look at yer.”
14741: 
14742: Hetty was frightened at this gruff old man, and still more at this last
14743: suggestion that she looked like a wild woman. As she followed him out
14744: of the hovel she thought she would give him a sixpence for telling her
14745: the way, and then he would not suppose she was wild. As he stopped to
14746: point out the road to her, she put her hand in her pocket to get the
14747: six-pence ready, and when he was turning away, without saying
14748: good-morning, she held it out to him and said, “Thank you; will you
14749: please to take something for your trouble?”
14750: 
14751: He looked slowly at the sixpence, and then said, “I want none o’ your
14752: money. You’d better take care on’t, else you’ll get it stool from yer,
14753: if you go trapesin’ about the fields like a mad woman a-thatway.”
14754: 
14755: The man left her without further speech, and Hetty held on her way.
14756: Another day had risen, and she must wander on. It was no use to think
14757: of drowning herself—she could not do it, at least while she had money
14758: left to buy food and strength to journey on. But the incident on her
14759: waking this morning heightened her dread of that time when her money
14760: would be all gone; she would have to sell her basket and clothes then,
14761: and she would really look like a beggar or a wild woman, as the man had
14762: said. The passionate joy in life she had felt in the night, after
14763: escaping from the brink of the black cold death in the pool, was gone
14764: now. Life now, by the morning light, with the impression of that man’s
14765: hard wondering look at her, was as full of dread as death—it was worse;
14766: it was a dread to which she felt chained, from which she shrank and
14767: shrank as she did from the black pool, and yet could find no refuge
14768: from it.
14769: 
14770: She took out her money from her purse, and looked at it. She had still
14771: two-and-twenty shillings; it would serve her for many days more, or it
14772: would help her to get on faster to Stonyshire, within reach of Dinah.
14773: The thought of Dinah urged itself more strongly now, since the
14774: experience of the night had driven her shuddering imagination away from
14775: the pool. If it had been only going to Dinah—if nobody besides Dinah
14776: would ever know—Hetty could have made up her mind to go to her. The
14777: soft voice, the pitying eyes, would have drawn her. But afterwards the
14778: other people must know, and she could no more rush on that shame than
14779: she could rush on death.
14780: 
14781: She must wander on and on, and wait for a lower depth of despair to
14782: give her courage. Perhaps death would come to her, for she was getting
14783: less and less able to bear the day’s weariness. And yet—such is the
14784: strange action of our souls, drawing us by a lurking desire towards the
14785: very ends we dread—Hetty, when she set out again from Norton, asked the
14786: straightest road northwards towards Stonyshire, and kept it all that
14787: day.
14788: 
14789: Poor wandering Hetty, with the rounded childish face and the hard,
14790: unloving, despairing soul looking out of it—with the narrow heart and
14791: narrow thoughts, no room in them for any sorrows but her own, and
14792: tasting that sorrow with the more intense bitterness! My heart bleeds
14793: for her as I see her toiling along on her weary feet, or seated in a
14794: cart, with her eyes fixed vacantly on the road before her, never
14795: thinking or caring whither it tends, till hunger comes and makes her
14796: desire that a village may be near.
14797: 
14798: What will be the end, the end of her objectless wandering, apart from
14799: all love, caring for human beings only through her pride, clinging to
14800: life only as the hunted wounded brute clings to it?
14801: 
14802: God preserve you and me from being the beginners of such misery!
14803: 
14804: 
14805: 
14806: 
14807: Chapter XXXVIII
14808: The Quest
14809: 
14810: 
14811: The first ten days after Hetty’s departure passed as quietly as any
14812: other days with the family at the Hall Farm, and with Adam at his daily
14813: work. They had expected Hetty to stay away a week or ten days at least,
14814: perhaps a little longer if Dinah came back with her, because there
14815: might then be something to detain them at Snowfield. But when a
14816: fortnight had passed they began to feel a little surprise that Hetty
14817: did not return; she must surely have found it pleasanter to be with
14818: Dinah than any one could have supposed. Adam, for his part, was getting
14819: very impatient to see her, and he resolved that, if she did not appear
14820: the next day (Saturday), he would set out on Sunday morning to fetch
14821: her. There was no coach on a Sunday, but by setting out before it was
14822: light, and perhaps getting a lift in a cart by the way, he would arrive
14823: pretty early at Snowfield, and bring back Hetty the next day—Dinah too,
14824: if she were coming. It was quite time Hetty came home, and he would
14825: afford to lose his Monday for the sake of bringing her.
14826: 
14827: His project was quite approved at the Farm when he went there on
14828: Saturday evening. Mrs. Poyser desired him emphatically not to come back
14829: without Hetty, for she had been quite too long away, considering the
14830: things she had to get ready by the middle of March, and a week was
14831: surely enough for any one to go out for their health. As for Dinah,
14832: Mrs. Poyser had small hope of their bringing her, unless they could
14833: make her believe the folks at Hayslope were twice as miserable as the
14834: folks at Snowfield. “Though,” said Mrs. Poyser, by way of conclusion,
14835: “you might tell her she’s got but one aunt left, and _she’s_ wasted
14836: pretty nigh to a shadder; and we shall p’rhaps all be gone twenty mile
14837: farther off her next Michaelmas, and shall die o’ broken hearts among
14838: strange folks, and leave the children fatherless and motherless.”
14839: 
14840: “Nay, nay,” said Mr. Poyser, who certainly had the air of a man
14841: perfectly heart-whole, “it isna so bad as that. Thee’t looking rarely
14842: now, and getting flesh every day. But I’d be glad for Dinah t’ come,
14843: for she’d help thee wi’ the little uns: they took t’ her wonderful.”
14844: 
14845: So at daybreak, on Sunday, Adam set off. Seth went with him the first
14846: mile or two, for the thought of Snowfield and the possibility that
14847: Dinah might come again made him restless, and the walk with Adam in the
14848: cold morning air, both in their best clothes, helped to give him a
14849: sense of Sunday calm. It was the last morning in February, with a low
14850: grey sky, and a slight hoar-frost on the green border of the road and
14851: on the black hedges. They heard the gurgling of the full brooklet
14852: hurrying down the hill, and the faint twittering of the early birds.
14853: For they walked in silence, though with a pleased sense of
14854: companionship.
14855: 
14856: “Good-bye, lad,” said Adam, laying his hand on Seth’s shoulder and
14857: looking at him affectionately as they were about to part. “I wish thee
14858: wast going all the way wi’ me, and as happy as I am.”
14859: 
14860: “I’m content, Addy, I’m content,” said Seth cheerfully. “I’ll be an old
14861: bachelor, belike, and make a fuss wi’ thy children.”
14862: 
14863: They turned away from each other, and Seth walked leisurely homeward,
14864: mentally repeating one of his favourite hymns—he was very fond of
14865: hymns:
14866: 
14867: “Dark and cheerless is the morn
14868:     Unaccompanied by thee:
14869: Joyless is the day’s return
14870:     Till thy mercy’s beams I see:
14871: Till thou inward light impart,
14872: Glad my eyes and warm my heart.
14873: 
14874: Visit, then, this soul of mine,
14875:     Pierce the gloom of sin and grief—
14876: Fill me, Radiancy Divine,
14877:     Scatter all my unbelief.
14878: More and more thyself display,
14879: Shining to the perfect day.”
14880: 
14881: 
14882: Adam walked much faster, and any one coming along the Oakbourne road at
14883: sunrise that morning must have had a pleasant sight in this tall
14884: broad-chested man, striding along with a carriage as upright and firm
14885: as any soldier’s, glancing with keen glad eyes at the dark-blue hills
14886: as they began to show themselves on his way. Seldom in Adam’s life had
14887: his face been so free from any cloud of anxiety as it was this morning;
14888: and this freedom from care, as is usual with constructive practical
14889: minds like his, made him all the more observant of the objects round
14890: him and all the more ready to gather suggestions from them towards his
14891: own favourite plans and ingenious contrivances. His happy love—the
14892: knowledge that his steps were carrying him nearer and nearer to Hetty,
14893: who was so soon to be his—was to his thoughts what the sweet morning
14894: air was to his sensations: it gave him a consciousness of well-being
14895: that made activity delightful. Every now and then there was a rush of
14896: more intense feeling towards her, which chased away other images than
14897: Hetty; and along with that would come a wondering thankfulness that all
14898: this happiness was given to him—that this life of ours had such
14899: sweetness in it. For Adam had a devout mind, though he was perhaps
14900: rather impatient of devout words, and his tenderness lay very close to
14901: his reverence, so that the one could hardly be stirred without the
14902: other. But after feeling had welled up and poured itself out in this
14903: way, busy thought would come back with the greater vigour; and this
14904: morning it was intent on schemes by which the roads might be improved
14905: that were so imperfect all through the country, and on picturing all
14906: the benefits that might come from the exertions of a single country
14907: gentleman, if he would set himself to getting the roads made good in
14908: his own district.
14909: 
14910: It seemed a very short walk, the ten miles to Oakbourne, that pretty
14911: town within sight of the blue hills, where he break-fasted. After this,
14912: the country grew barer and barer: no more rolling woods, no more
14913: wide-branching trees near frequent homesteads, no more bushy hedgerows,
14914: but greystone walls intersecting the meagre pastures, and dismal
14915: wide-scattered greystone houses on broken lands where mines had been
14916: and were no longer. “A hungry land,” said Adam to himself. “I’d rather
14917: go south’ard, where they say it’s as flat as a table, than come to live
14918: here; though if Dinah likes to live in a country where she can be the
14919: most comfort to folks, she’s i’ the right to live o’ this side; for she
14920: must look as if she’d come straight from heaven, like th’ angels in the
14921: desert, to strengthen them as ha’ got nothing t’ eat.” And when at last
14922: he came in sight of Snowfield, he thought it looked like a town that
14923: was “fellow to the country,” though the stream through the valley where
14924: the great mill stood gave a pleasant greenness to the lower fields. The
14925: town lay, grim, stony, and unsheltered, up the side of a steep hill,
14926: and Adam did not go forward to it at present, for Seth had told him
14927: where to find Dinah. It was at a thatched cottage outside the town, a
14928: little way from the mill—an old cottage, standing sideways towards the
14929: road, with a little bit of potato-ground before it. Here Dinah lodged
14930: with an elderly couple; and if she and Hetty happened to be out, Adam
14931: could learn where they were gone, or when they would be at home again.
14932: Dinah might be out on some preaching errand, and perhaps she would have
14933: left Hetty at home. Adam could not help hoping this, and as he
14934: recognized the cottage by the roadside before him, there shone out in
14935: his face that involuntary smile which belongs to the expectation of a
14936: near joy.
14937: 
14938: He hurried his step along the narrow causeway, and rapped at the door.
14939: It was opened by a very clean old woman, with a slow palsied shake of
14940: the head.
14941: 
14942: “Is Dinah Morris at home?” said Adam.
14943: 
14944: “Eh?... no,” said the old woman, looking up at this tall stranger with
14945: a wonder that made her slower of speech than usual. “Will you please to
14946: come in?” she added, retiring from the door, as if recollecting
14947: herself. “Why, ye’re brother to the young man as come afore, arena ye?”
14948: 
14949: “Yes,” said Adam, entering. “That was Seth Bede. I’m his brother Adam.
14950: He told me to give his respects to you and your good master.”
14951: 
14952: “Aye, the same t’ him. He was a gracious young man. An’ ye feature him,
14953: on’y ye’re darker. Sit ye down i’ th’ arm-chair. My man isna come home
14954: from meeting.”
14955: 
14956: Adam sat down patiently, not liking to hurry the shaking old woman with
14957: questions, but looking eagerly towards the narrow twisting stairs in
14958: one corner, for he thought it was possible Hetty might have heard his
14959: voice and would come down them.
14960: 
14961: “So you’re come to see Dinah Morris?” said the old woman, standing
14962: opposite to him. “An’ you didn’ know she was away from home, then?”
14963: 
14964: “No,” said Adam, “but I thought it likely she might be away, seeing as
14965: it’s Sunday. But the other young woman—is she at home, or gone along
14966: with Dinah?”
14967: 
14968: The old woman looked at Adam with a bewildered air.
14969: 
14970: “Gone along wi’ her?” she said. “Eh, Dinah’s gone to Leeds, a big town
14971: ye may ha’ heared on, where there’s a many o’ the Lord’s people. She’s
14972: been gone sin’ Friday was a fortnight: they sent her the money for her
14973: journey. You may see her room here,” she went on, opening a door and
14974: not noticing the effect of her words on Adam. He rose and followed her,
14975: and darted an eager glance into the little room with its narrow bed,
14976: the portrait of Wesley on the wall, and the few books lying on the
14977: large Bible. He had had an irrational hope that Hetty might be there.
14978: He could not speak in the first moment after seeing that the room was
14979: empty; an undefined fear had seized him—something had happened to Hetty
14980: on the journey. Still the old woman was so slow of speech and
14981: apprehension, that Hetty might be at Snowfield after all.
14982: 
14983: “It’s a pity ye didna know,” she said. “Have ye come from your own
14984: country o’ purpose to see her?”
14985: 
14986: “But Hetty—Hetty Sorrel,” said Adam, abruptly; “Where is _she?_”
14987: 
14988: “I know nobody by that name,” said the old woman, wonderingly. “Is it
14989: anybody ye’ve heared on at Snowfield?”
14990: 
14991: “Did there come no young woman here—very young and pretty—Friday was a
14992: fortnight, to see Dinah Morris?”
14993: 
14994: “Nay; I’n seen no young woman.”
14995: 
14996: “Think; are you quite sure? A girl, eighteen years old, with dark eyes
14997: and dark curly hair, and a red cloak on, and a basket on her arm? You
14998: couldn’t forget her if you saw her.”
14999: 
15000: “Nay; Friday was a fortnight—it was the day as Dinah went away—there
15001: come nobody. There’s ne’er been nobody asking for her till you come,
15002: for the folks about know as she’s gone. Eh dear, eh dear, is there
15003: summat the matter?”
15004: 
15005: The old woman had seen the ghastly look of fear in Adam’s face. But he
15006: was not stunned or confounded: he was thinking eagerly where he could
15007: inquire about Hetty.
15008: 
15009: “Yes; a young woman started from our country to see Dinah, Friday was a
15010: fortnight. I came to fetch her back. I’m afraid something has happened
15011: to her. I can’t stop. Good-bye.”
15012: 
15013: He hastened out of the cottage, and the old woman followed him to the
15014: gate, watching him sadly with her shaking head as he almost ran towards
15015: the town. He was going to inquire at the place where the Oakbourne
15016: coach stopped.
15017: 
15018: No! No young woman like Hetty had been seen there. Had any accident
15019: happened to the coach a fortnight ago? No. And there was no coach to
15020: take him back to Oakbourne that day. Well, he would walk: he couldn’t
15021: stay here, in wretched inaction. But the innkeeper, seeing that Adam
15022: was in great anxiety, and entering into this new incident with the
15023: eagerness of a man who passes a great deal of time with his hands in
15024: his pockets looking into an obstinately monotonous street, offered to
15025: take him back to Oakbourne in his own “taxed cart” this very evening.
15026: It was not five o’clock; there was plenty of time for Adam to take a
15027: meal and yet to get to Oakbourne before ten o’clock. The innkeeper
15028: declared that he really wanted to go to Oakbourne, and might as well go
15029: to-night; he should have all Monday before him then. Adam, after making
15030: an ineffectual attempt to eat, put the food in his pocket, and,
15031: drinking a draught of ale, declared himself ready to set off. As they
15032: approached the cottage, it occurred to him that he would do well to
15033: learn from the old woman where Dinah was to be found in Leeds: if there
15034: was trouble at the Hall Farm—he only half-admitted the foreboding that
15035: there would be—the Poysers might like to send for Dinah. But Dinah had
15036: not left any address, and the old woman, whose memory for names was
15037: infirm, could not recall the name of the “blessed woman” who was
15038: Dinah’s chief friend in the Society at Leeds.
15039: 
15040: During that long, long journey in the taxed cart, there was time for
15041: all the conjectures of importunate fear and struggling hope. In the
15042: very first shock of discovering that Hetty had not been to Snowfield,
15043: the thought of Arthur had darted through Adam like a sharp pang, but he
15044: tried for some time to ward off its return by busying himself with
15045: modes of accounting for the alarming fact, quite apart from that
15046: intolerable thought. Some accident had happened. Hetty had, by some
15047: strange chance, got into a wrong vehicle from Oakbourne: she had been
15048: taken ill, and did not want to frighten them by letting them know. But
15049: this frail fence of vague improbabilities was soon hurled down by a
15050: rush of distinct agonizing fears. Hetty had been deceiving herself in
15051: thinking that she could love and marry him: she had been loving Arthur
15052: all the while; and now, in her desperation at the nearness of their
15053: marriage, she had run away. And she was gone to _him_. The old
15054: indignation and jealousy rose again, and prompted the suspicion that
15055: Arthur had been dealing falsely—had written to Hetty—had tempted her to
15056: come to him—being unwilling, after all, that she should belong to
15057: another man besides himself. Perhaps the whole thing had been contrived
15058: by him, and he had given her directions how to follow him to
15059: Ireland—for Adam knew that Arthur had been gone thither three weeks
15060: ago, having recently learnt it at the Chase. Every sad look of Hetty’s,
15061: since she had been engaged to Adam, returned upon him now with all the
15062: exaggeration of painful retrospect. He had been foolishly sanguine and
15063: confident. The poor thing hadn’t perhaps known her own mind for a long
15064: while; had thought that she could forget Arthur; had been momentarily
15065: drawn towards the man who offered her a protecting, faithful love. He
15066: couldn’t bear to blame her: she never meant to cause him this dreadful
15067: pain. The blame lay with that man who had selfishly played with her
15068: heart—had perhaps even deliberately lured her away.
15069: 
15070: At Oakbourne, the ostler at the Royal Oak remembered such a young woman
15071: as Adam described getting out of the Treddleston coach more than a
15072: fortnight ago—wasn’t likely to forget such a pretty lass as that in a
15073: hurry—was sure she had not gone on by the Buxton coach that went
15074: through Snowfield, but had lost sight of her while he went away with
15075: the horses and had never set eyes on her again. Adam then went straight
15076: to the house from which the Stoniton coach started: Stoniton was the
15077: most obvious place for Hetty to go to first, whatever might be her
15078: destination, for she would hardly venture on any but the chief
15079: coach-roads. She had been noticed here too, and was remembered to have
15080: sat on the box by the coachman; but the coachman could not be seen, for
15081: another man had been driving on that road in his stead the last three
15082: or four days. He could probably be seen at Stoniton, through inquiry at
15083: the inn where the coach put up. So the anxious heart-stricken Adam must
15084: of necessity wait and try to rest till morning—nay, till eleven
15085: o’clock, when the coach started.
15086: 
15087: At Stoniton another delay occurred, for the old coachman who had driven
15088: Hetty would not be in the town again till night. When he did come he
15089: remembered Hetty well, and remembered his own joke addressed to her,
15090: quoting it many times to Adam, and observing with equal frequency that
15091: he thought there was something more than common, because Hetty had not
15092: laughed when he joked her. But he declared, as the people had done at
15093: the inn, that he had lost sight of Hetty directly she got down. Part of
15094: the next morning was consumed in inquiries at every house in the town
15095: from which a coach started—(all in vain, for you know Hetty did not
15096: start from Stoniton by coach, but on foot in the grey morning)—and then
15097: in walking out to the first toll-gates on the different lines of road,
15098: in the forlorn hope of finding some recollection of her there. No, she
15099: was not to be traced any farther; and the next hard task for Adam was
15100: to go home and carry the wretched tidings to the Hall Farm. As to what
15101: he should do beyond that, he had come to two distinct resolutions
15102: amidst the tumult of thought and feeling which was going on within him
15103: while he went to and fro. He would not mention what he knew of Arthur
15104: Donnithorne’s behaviour to Hetty till there was a clear necessity for
15105: it: it was still possible Hetty might come back, and the disclosure
15106: might be an injury or an offence to her. And as soon as he had been
15107: home and done what was necessary there to prepare for his further
15108: absence, he would start off to Ireland: if he found no trace of Hetty
15109: on the road, he would go straight to Arthur Donnithorne and make
15110: himself certain how far he was acquainted with her movements. Several
15111: times the thought occurred to him that he would consult Mr. Irwine, but
15112: that would be useless unless he told him all, and so betrayed the
15113: secret about Arthur. It seems strange that Adam, in the incessant
15114: occupation of his mind about Hetty, should never have alighted on the
15115: probability that she had gone to Windsor, ignorant that Arthur was no
15116: longer there. Perhaps the reason was that he could not conceive Hetty’s
15117: throwing herself on Arthur uncalled; he imagined no cause that could
15118: have driven her to such a step, after that letter written in August.
15119: There were but two alternatives in his mind: either Arthur had written
15120: to her again and enticed her away, or she had simply fled from her
15121: approaching marriage with himself because she found, after all, she
15122: could not love him well enough, and yet was afraid of her friends’
15123: anger if she retracted.
15124: 
15125: With this last determination on his mind, of going straight to Arthur,
15126: the thought that he had spent two days in inquiries which had proved to
15127: be almost useless, was torturing to Adam; and yet, since he would not
15128: tell the Poysers his conviction as to where Hetty was gone, or his
15129: intention to follow her thither, he must be able to say to them that he
15130: had traced her as far as possible.
15131: 
15132: It was after twelve o’clock on Tuesday night when Adam reached
15133: Treddleston; and, unwilling to disturb his mother and Seth, and also to
15134: encounter their questions at that hour, he threw himself without
15135: undressing on a bed at the “Waggon Overthrown,” and slept hard from
15136: pure weariness. Not more than four hours, however, for before five
15137: o’clock he set out on his way home in the faint morning twilight. He
15138: always kept a key of the workshop door in his pocket, so that he could
15139: let himself in; and he wished to enter without awaking his mother, for
15140: he was anxious to avoid telling her the new trouble himself by seeing
15141: Seth first, and asking him to tell her when it should be necessary. He
15142: walked gently along the yard, and turned the key gently in the door;
15143: but, as he expected, Gyp, who lay in the workshop, gave a sharp bark.
15144: It subsided when he saw Adam, holding up his finger at him to impose
15145: silence, and in his dumb, tailless joy he must content himself with
15146: rubbing his body against his master’s legs.
15147: 
15148: Adam was too heart-sick to take notice of Gyp’s fondling. He threw
15149: himself on the bench and stared dully at the wood and the signs of work
15150: around him, wondering if he should ever come to feel pleasure in them
15151: again, while Gyp, dimly aware that there was something wrong with his
15152: master, laid his rough grey head on Adam’s knee and wrinkled his brows
15153: to look up at him. Hitherto, since Sunday afternoon, Adam had been
15154: constantly among strange people and in strange places, having no
15155: associations with the details of his daily life, and now that by the
15156: light of this new morning he was come back to his home and surrounded
15157: by the familiar objects that seemed for ever robbed of their charm, the
15158: reality—the hard, inevitable reality of his troubles pressed upon him
15159: with a new weight. Right before him was an unfinished chest of drawers,
15160: which he had been making in spare moments for Hetty’s use, when his
15161: home should be hers.
15162: 
15163: Seth had not heard Adam’s entrance, but he had been roused by Gyp’s
15164: bark, and Adam heard him moving about in the room above, dressing
15165: himself. Seth’s first thoughts were about his brother: he would come
15166: home to-day, surely, for the business would be wanting him sadly by
15167: to-morrow, but it was pleasant to think he had had a longer holiday
15168: than he had expected. And would Dinah come too? Seth felt that that was
15169: the greatest happiness he could look forward to for himself, though he
15170: had no hope left that she would ever love him well enough to marry him;
15171: but he had often said to himself, it was better to be Dinah’s friend
15172: and brother than any other woman’s husband. If he could but be always
15173: near her, instead of living so far off!
15174: 
15175: He came downstairs and opened the inner door leading from the kitchen
15176: into the workshop, intending to let out Gyp; but he stood still in the
15177: doorway, smitten with a sudden shock at the sight of Adam seated
15178: listlessly on the bench, pale, unwashed, with sunken blank eyes, almost
15179: like a drunkard in the morning. But Seth felt in an instant what the
15180: marks meant—not drunkenness, but some great calamity. Adam looked up at
15181: him without speaking, and Seth moved forward towards the bench, himself
15182: trembling so that speech did not come readily.
15183: 
15184: “God have mercy on us, Addy,” he said, in a low voice, sitting down on
15185: the bench beside Adam, “what is it?”
15186: 
15187: Adam was unable to speak. The strong man, accustomed to suppress the
15188: signs of sorrow, had felt his heart swell like a child’s at this first
15189: approach of sympathy. He fell on Seth’s neck and sobbed.
15190: 
15191: Seth was prepared for the worst now, for, even in his recollections of
15192: their boyhood, Adam had never sobbed before.
15193: 
15194: “Is it death, Adam? Is she dead?” he asked, in a low tone, when Adam
15195: raised his head and was recovering himself.
15196: 
15197: “No, lad; but she’s gone—gone away from us. She’s never been to
15198: Snowfield. Dinah’s been gone to Leeds ever since last Friday was a
15199: fortnight, the very day Hetty set out. I can’t find out where she went
15200: after she got to Stoniton.”
15201: 
15202: Seth was silent from utter astonishment: he knew nothing that could
15203: suggest to him a reason for Hetty’s going away.
15204: 
15205: “Hast any notion what she’s done it for?” he said, at last.
15206: 
15207: “She can’t ha’ loved me. She didn’t like our marriage when it came
15208: nigh—that must be it,” said Adam. He had determined to mention no
15209: further reason.
15210: 
15211: “I hear Mother stirring,” said Seth. “Must we tell her?”
15212: 
15213: “No, not yet,” said Adam, rising from the bench and pushing the hair
15214: from his face, as if he wanted to rouse himself. “I can’t have her told
15215: yet; and I must set out on another journey directly, after I’ve been to
15216: the village and th’ Hall Farm. I can’t tell thee where I’m going, and
15217: thee must say to her I’m gone on business as nobody is to know anything
15218: about. I’ll go and wash myself now.” Adam moved towards the door of the
15219: workshop, but after a step or two he turned round, and, meeting Seth’s
15220: eyes with a calm sad glance, he said, “I must take all the money out o’
15221: the tin box, lad; but if anything happens to me, all the rest ’ll be
15222: thine, to take care o’ Mother with.”
15223: 
15224: Seth was pale and trembling: he felt there was some terrible secret
15225: under all this. “Brother,” he said, faintly—he never called Adam
15226: “Brother” except in solemn moments—“I don’t believe you’ll do anything
15227: as you can’t ask God’s blessing on.”
15228: 
15229: “Nay, lad,” said Adam, “don’t be afraid. I’m for doing nought but
15230: what’s a man’s duty.”
15231: 
15232: The thought that if he betrayed his trouble to his mother, she would
15233: only distress him by words, half of blundering affection, half of
15234: irrepressible triumph that Hetty proved as unfit to be his wife as she
15235: had always foreseen, brought back some of his habitual firmness and
15236: self-command. He had felt ill on his journey home—he told her when she
15237: came down—had stayed all night at Tredddleston for that reason; and a
15238: bad headache, that still hung about him this morning, accounted for his
15239: paleness and heavy eyes.
15240: 
15241: He determined to go to the village, in the first place, attend to his
15242: business for an hour, and give notice to Burge of his being obliged to
15243: go on a journey, which he must beg him not to mention to any one; for
15244: he wished to avoid going to the Hall Farm near breakfast-time, when the
15245: children and servants would be in the house-place, and there must be
15246: exclamations in their hearing about his having returned without Hetty.
15247: He waited until the clock struck nine before he left the work-yard at
15248: the village, and set off, through the fields, towards the Farm. It was
15249: an immense relief to him, as he came near the Home Close, to see Mr.
15250: Poyser advancing towards him, for this would spare him the pain of
15251: going to the house. Mr. Poyser was walking briskly this March morning,
15252: with a sense of spring business on his mind: he was going to cast the
15253: master’s eye on the shoeing of a new cart-horse, carrying his spud as a
15254: useful companion by the way. His surprise was great when he caught
15255: sight of Adam, but he was not a man given to presentiments of evil.
15256: 
15257: “Why, Adam, lad, is’t you? Have ye been all this time away and not
15258: brought the lasses back, after all? Where are they?”
15259: 
15260: “No, I’ve not brought ’em,” said Adam, turning round, to indicate that
15261: he wished to walk back with Mr. Poyser.
15262: 
15263: “Why,” said Martin, looking with sharper attention at Adam, “ye look
15264: bad. Is there anything happened?”
15265: 
15266: “Yes,” said Adam, heavily. “A sad thing’s happened. I didna find Hetty
15267: at Snowfield.”
15268: 
15269: Mr. Poyser’s good-natured face showed signs of troubled astonishment.
15270: “Not find her? What’s happened to her?” he said, his thoughts flying at
15271: once to bodily accident.
15272: 
15273: “That I can’t tell, whether anything’s happened to her. She never went
15274: to Snowfield—she took the coach to Stoniton, but I can’t learn nothing
15275: of her after she got down from the Stoniton coach.”
15276: 
15277: “Why, you donna mean she’s run away?” said Martin, standing still, so
15278: puzzled and bewildered that the fact did not yet make itself felt as a
15279: trouble by him.
15280: 
15281: “She must ha’ done,” said Adam. “She didn’t like our marriage when it
15282: came to the point—that must be it. She’d mistook her feelings.”
15283: 
15284: Martin was silent for a minute or two, looking on the ground and
15285: rooting up the grass with his spud, without knowing what he was doing.
15286: His usual slowness was always trebled when the subject of speech was
15287: painful. At last he looked up, right in Adam’s face, saying, “Then she
15288: didna deserve t’ ha’ ye, my lad. An’ I feel i’ fault myself, for she
15289: was my niece, and I was allays hot for her marr’ing ye. There’s no
15290: amends I can make ye, lad—the more’s the pity: it’s a sad cut-up for
15291: ye, I doubt.”
15292: 
15293: Adam could say nothing; and Mr. Poyser, after pursuing his walk for a
15294: little while, went on, “I’ll be bound she’s gone after trying to get a
15295: lady’s maid’s place, for she’d got that in her head half a year ago,
15296: and wanted me to gi’ my consent. But I’d thought better on her”—he
15297: added, shaking his head slowly and sadly—“I’d thought better on her,
15298: nor to look for this, after she’d gi’en y’ her word, an’ everything
15299: been got ready.”
15300: 
15301: Adam had the strongest motives for encouraging this supposition in Mr.
15302: Poyser, and he even tried to believe that it might possibly be true. He
15303: had no warrant for the _certainty_ that she was gone to Arthur.
15304: 
15305: “It was better it should be so,” he said, as quietly as he could, “if
15306: she felt she couldn’t like me for a husband. Better run away before
15307: than repent after. I hope you won’t look harshly on her if she comes
15308: back, as she may do if she finds it hard to get on away from home.”
15309: 
15310: “I canna look on her as I’ve done before,” said Martin decisively.
15311: “She’s acted bad by you, and by all of us. But I’ll not turn my back on
15312: her: she’s but a young un, and it’s the first harm I’ve knowed on her.
15313: It’ll be a hard job for me to tell her aunt. Why didna Dinah come back
15314: wi’ ye? She’d ha’ helped to pacify her aunt a bit.”
15315: 
15316: “Dinah wasn’t at Snowfield. She’s been gone to Leeds this fortnight,
15317: and I couldn’t learn from th’ old woman any direction where she is at
15318: Leeds, else I should ha’ brought it you.”
15319: 
15320: “She’d a deal better be staying wi’ her own kin,” said Mr. Poyser,
15321: indignantly, “than going preaching among strange folks a-that’n.”
15322: 
15323: “I must leave you now, Mr. Poyser,” said Adam, “for I’ve a deal to see
15324: to.”
15325: 
15326: “Aye, you’d best be after your business, and I must tell the missis
15327: when I go home. It’s a hard job.”
15328: 
15329: “But,” said Adam, “I beg particular, you’ll keep what’s happened quiet
15330: for a week or two. I’ve not told my mother yet, and there’s no knowing
15331: how things may turn out.”
15332: 
15333: “Aye, aye; least said, soonest mended. We’n no need to say why the
15334: match is broke off, an’ we may hear of her after a bit. Shake hands wi’
15335: me, lad: I wish I could make thee amends.”
15336: 
15337: There was something in Martin Poyser’s throat at that moment which
15338: caused him to bring out those scanty words in rather a broken fashion.
15339: Yet Adam knew what they meant all the better, and the two honest men
15340: grasped each other’s hard hands in mutual understanding.
15341: 
15342: There was nothing now to hinder Adam from setting off. He had told Seth
15343: to go to the Chase and leave a message for the squire, saying that Adam
15344: Bede had been obliged to start off suddenly on a journey—and to say as
15345: much, and no more, to any one else who made inquiries about him. If the
15346: Poysers learned that he was gone away again, Adam knew they would infer
15347: that he was gone in search of Hetty.
15348: 
15349: He had intended to go right on his way from the Hall Farm, but now the
15350: impulse which had frequently visited him before—to go to Mr. Irwine,
15351: and make a confidant of him—recurred with the new force which belongs
15352: to a last opportunity. He was about to start on a long journey—a
15353: difficult one—by sea—and no soul would know where he was gone. If
15354: anything happened to him? Or, if he absolutely needed help in any
15355: matter concerning Hetty? Mr. Irwine was to be trusted; and the feeling
15356: which made Adam shrink from telling anything which was _her_ secret
15357: must give way before the need there was that she should have some one
15358: else besides himself who would be prepared to defend her in the worst
15359: extremity. Towards Arthur, even though he might have incurred no new
15360: guilt, Adam felt that he was not bound to keep silence when Hetty’s
15361: interest called on him to speak.
15362: 
15363: “I must do it,” said Adam, when these thoughts, which had spread
15364: themselves through hours of his sad journeying, now rushed upon him in
15365: an instant, like a wave that had been slowly gathering; “it’s the right
15366: thing. I can’t stand alone in this way any longer.”
15367: 
15368: 
15369: 
15370: 
15371: Chapter XXXIX
15372: The Tidings
15373: 
15374: 
15375: Adam turned his face towards Broxton and walked with his swiftest
15376: stride, looking at his watch with the fear that Mr. Irwine might be
15377: gone out—hunting, perhaps. The fear and haste together produced a state
15378: of strong excitement before he reached the rectory gate, and outside it
15379: he saw the deep marks of a recent hoof on the gravel.
15380: 
15381: But the hoofs were turned towards the gate, not away from it, and
15382: though there was a horse against the stable door, it was not Mr.
15383: Irwine’s: it had evidently had a journey this morning, and must belong
15384: to some one who had come on business. Mr. Irwine was at home, then; but
15385: Adam could hardly find breath and calmness to tell Carroll that he
15386: wanted to speak to the rector. The double suffering of certain and
15387: uncertain sorrow had begun to shake the strong man. The butler looked
15388: at him wonderingly, as he threw himself on a bench in the passage and
15389: stared absently at the clock on the opposite wall. The master had
15390: somebody with him, he said, but he heard the study door open—the
15391: stranger seemed to be coming out, and as Adam was in a hurry, he would
15392: let the master know at once.
15393: 
15394: Adam sat looking at the clock: the minute-hand was hurrying along the
15395: last five minutes to ten with a loud, hard, indifferent tick, and Adam
15396: watched the movement and listened to the sound as if he had had some
15397: reason for doing so. In our times of bitter suffering there are almost
15398: always these pauses, when our consciousness is benumbed to everything
15399: but some trivial perception or sensation. It is as if semi-idiocy came
15400: to give us rest from the memory and the dread which refuse to leave us
15401: in our sleep.
15402: 
15403: Carroll, coming back, recalled Adam to the sense of his burden. He was
15404: to go into the study immediately. “I can’t think what that strange
15405: person’s come about,” the butler added, from mere incontinence of
15406: remark, as he preceded Adam to the door, “he’s gone i’ the dining-room.
15407: And master looks unaccountable—as if he was frightened.” Adam took no
15408: notice of the words: he could not care about other people’s business.
15409: But when he entered the study and looked in Mr. Irwine’s face, he felt
15410: in an instant that there was a new expression in it, strangely
15411: different from the warm friendliness it had always worn for him before.
15412: A letter lay open on the table, and Mr. Irwine’s hand was on it, but
15413: the changed glance he cast on Adam could not be owing entirely to
15414: preoccupation with some disagreeable business, for he was looking
15415: eagerly towards the door, as if Adam’s entrance were a matter of
15416: poignant anxiety to him.
15417: 
15418: “You want to speak to me, Adam,” he said, in that low constrainedly
15419: quiet tone which a man uses when he is determined to suppress
15420: agitation. “Sit down here.” He pointed to a chair just opposite to him,
15421: at no more than a yard’s distance from his own, and Adam sat down with
15422: a sense that this cold manner of Mr. Irwine’s gave an additional
15423: unexpected difficulty to his disclosure. But when Adam had made up his
15424: mind to a measure, he was not the man to renounce it for any but
15425: imperative reasons.
15426: 
15427: “I come to you, sir,” he said, “as the gentleman I look up to most of
15428: anybody. I’ve something very painful to tell you—something as it’ll
15429: pain you to hear as well as me to tell. But if I speak o’ the wrong
15430: other people have done, you’ll see I didn’t speak till I’d good
15431: reason.”
15432: 
15433: Mr. Irwine nodded slowly, and Adam went on rather tremulously, “You was
15434: t’ ha’ married me and Hetty Sorrel, you know, sir, o’ the fifteenth o’
15435: this month. I thought she loved me, and I was th’ happiest man i’ the
15436: parish. But a dreadful blow’s come upon me.”
15437: 
15438: Mr. Irwine started up from his chair, as if involuntarily, but then,
15439: determined to control himself, walked to the window and looked out.
15440: 
15441: “She’s gone away, sir, and we don’t know where. She said she was going
15442: to Snowfield o’ Friday was a fortnight, and I went last Sunday to fetch
15443: her back; but she’d never been there, and she took the coach to
15444: Stoniton, and beyond that I can’t trace her. But now I’m going a long
15445: journey to look for her, and I can’t trust t’ anybody but you where I’m
15446: going.”
15447: 
15448: Mr. Irwine came back from the window and sat down.
15449: 
15450: “Have you no idea of the reason why she went away?” he said.
15451: 
15452: “It’s plain enough she didn’t want to marry me, sir,” said Adam. “She
15453: didn’t like it when it came so near. But that isn’t all, I doubt.
15454: There’s something else I must tell you, sir. There’s somebody else
15455: concerned besides me.”
15456: 
15457: A gleam of something—it was almost like relief or joy—came across the
15458: eager anxiety of Mr. Irwine’s face at that moment. Adam was looking on
15459: the ground, and paused a little: the next words were hard to speak. But
15460: when he went on, he lifted up his head and looked straight at Mr.
15461: Irwine. He would do the thing he had resolved to do, without flinching.
15462: 
15463: “You know who’s the man I’ve reckoned my greatest friend,” he said,
15464: “and used to be proud to think as I should pass my life i’ working for
15465: him, and had felt so ever since we were lads....”
15466: 
15467: Mr. Irwine, as if all self-control had forsaken him, grasped Adam’s
15468: arm, which lay on the table, and, clutching it tightly like a man in
15469: pain, said, with pale lips and a low hurried voice, “No, Adam, no—don’t
15470: say it, for God’s sake!”
15471: 
15472: Adam, surprised at the violence of Mr. Irwine’s feeling, repented of
15473: the words that had passed his lips and sat in distressed silence. The
15474: grasp on his arm gradually relaxed, and Mr. Irwine threw himself back
15475: in his chair, saying, “Go on—I must know it.”
15476: 
15477: “That man played with Hetty’s feelings, and behaved to her as he’d no
15478: right to do to a girl in her station o’ life—made her presents and used
15479: to go and meet her out a-walking. I found it out only two days before
15480: he went away—found him a-kissing her as they were parting in the Grove.
15481: There’d been nothing said between me and Hetty then, though I’d loved
15482: her for a long while, and she knew it. But I reproached him with his
15483: wrong actions, and words and blows passed between us; and he said
15484: solemnly to me, after that, as it had been all nonsense and no more
15485: than a bit o’ flirting. But I made him write a letter to tell Hetty
15486: he’d meant nothing, for I saw clear enough, sir, by several things as I
15487: hadn’t understood at the time, as he’d got hold of her heart, and I
15488: thought she’d belike go on thinking of him and never come to love
15489: another man as wanted to marry her. And I gave her the letter, and she
15490: seemed to bear it all after a while better than I’d expected... and she
15491: behaved kinder and kinder to me... I daresay she didn’t know her own
15492: feelings then, poor thing, and they came back upon her when it was too
15493: late... I don’t want to blame her... I can’t think as she meant to
15494: deceive me. But I was encouraged to think she loved me, and—you know
15495: the rest, sir. But it’s on my mind as he’s been false to me, and ’ticed
15496: her away, and she’s gone to him—and I’m going now to see, for I can
15497: never go to work again till I know what’s become of her.”
15498: 
15499: During Adam’s narrative, Mr. Irwine had had time to recover his
15500: self-mastery in spite of the painful thoughts that crowded upon him. It
15501: was a bitter remembrance to him now—that morning when Arthur
15502: breakfasted with him and seemed as if he were on the verge of a
15503: confession. It was plain enough _now_ what he had wanted to confess.
15504: And if their words had taken another turn... if he himself had been
15505: less fastidious about intruding on another man’s secrets... it was
15506: cruel to think how thin a film had shut out rescue from all this guilt
15507: and misery. He saw the whole history now by that terrible illumination
15508: which the present sheds back upon the past. But every other feeling as
15509: it rushed upon him was thrown into abeyance by pity, deep respectful
15510: pity, for the man who sat before him—already so bruised, going forth
15511: with sad blind resignedness to an unreal sorrow, while a real one was
15512: close upon him, too far beyond the range of common trial for him ever
15513: to have feared it. His own agitation was quelled by a certain awe that
15514: comes over us in the presence of a great anguish, for the anguish he
15515: must inflict on Adam was already present to him. Again he put his hand
15516: on the arm that lay on the table, but very gently this time, as he said
15517: solemnly:
15518: 
15519: “Adam, my dear friend, you have had some hard trials in your life. You
15520: can bear sorrow manfully, as well as act manfully. God requires both
15521: tasks at our hands. And there is a heavier sorrow coming upon you than
15522: any you have yet known. But you are not guilty—you have not the worst
15523: of all sorrows. God help him who has!”
15524: 
15525: The two pale faces looked at each other; in Adam’s there was trembling
15526: suspense, in Mr. Irwine’s hesitating, shrinking pity. But he went on.
15527: 
15528: “I have had news of Hetty this morning. She is not gone to _him_. She
15529: is in Stonyshire—at Stoniton.”
15530: 
15531: Adam started up from his chair, as if he thought he could have leaped
15532: to her that moment. But Mr. Irwine laid hold of his arm again and said,
15533: persuasively, “Wait, Adam, wait.” So he sat down.
15534: 
15535: “She is in a very unhappy position—one which will make it worse for you
15536: to find her, my poor friend, than to have lost her for ever.”
15537: 
15538: Adam’s lips moved tremulously, but no sound came. They moved again, and
15539: he whispered, “Tell me.”
15540: 
15541: “She has been arrested... she is in prison.”
15542: 
15543: It was as if an insulting blow had brought back the spirit of
15544: resistance into Adam. The blood rushed to his face, and he said, loudly
15545: and sharply, “For what?”
15546: 
15547: “For a great crime—the murder of her child.”
15548: 
15549: “It _can’t be!_” Adam almost shouted, starting up from his chair and
15550: making a stride towards the door; but he turned round again, setting
15551: his back against the bookcase, and looking fiercely at Mr. Irwine. “It
15552: isn’t possible. She never had a child. She can’t be guilty. _Who_ says
15553: it?”
15554: 
15555: “God grant she may be innocent, Adam. We can still hope she is.”
15556: 
15557: “But who says she is guilty?” said Adam violently. “Tell me
15558: everything.”
15559: 
15560: “Here is a letter from the magistrate before whom she was taken, and
15561: the constable who arrested her is in the dining-room. She will not
15562: confess her name or where she comes from; but I fear, I fear, there can
15563: be no doubt it is Hetty. The description of her person corresponds,
15564: only that she is said to look very pale and ill. She had a small
15565: red-leather pocket-book in her pocket with two names written in it—one
15566: at the beginning, ‘Hetty Sorrel, Hayslope,’ and the other near the end,
15567: ‘Dinah Morris, Snowfield.’ She will not say which is her own name—she
15568: denies everything, and will answer no questions, and application has
15569: been made to me, as a magistrate, that I may take measures for
15570: identifying her, for it was thought probable that the name which stands
15571: first is her own name.”
15572: 
15573: “But what proof have they got against her, if it _is_ Hetty?” said
15574: Adam, still violently, with an effort that seemed to shake his whole
15575: frame. “I’ll not believe it. It couldn’t ha’ been, and none of us know
15576: it.”
15577: 
15578: “Terrible proof that she was under the temptation to commit the crime;
15579: but we have room to hope that she did not really commit it. Try and
15580: read that letter, Adam.”
15581: 
15582: Adam took the letter between his shaking hands and tried to fix his
15583: eyes steadily on it. Mr. Irwine meanwhile went out to give some orders.
15584: When he came back, Adam’s eyes were still on the first page—he couldn’t
15585: read—he could not put the words together and make out what they meant.
15586: He threw it down at last and clenched his fist.
15587: 
15588: “It’s _his_ doing,” he said; “if there’s been any crime, it’s at his
15589: door, not at hers. _He_ taught her to deceive—_he_ deceived me first.
15590: Let ’em put _him_ on his trial—let him stand in court beside her, and
15591: I’ll tell ’em how he got hold of her heart, and ’ticed her t’ evil, and
15592: then lied to me. Is _he_ to go free, while they lay all the punishment
15593: on her... so weak and young?”
15594: 
15595: The image called up by these last words gave a new direction to poor
15596: Adam’s maddened feelings. He was silent, looking at the corner of the
15597: room as if he saw something there. Then he burst out again, in a tone
15598: of appealing anguish,
15599: 
15600: “I _can’t_ bear it... O God, it’s too hard to lay upon me—it’s too hard
15601: to think she’s wicked.”
15602: 
15603: Mr. Irwine had sat down again in silence. He was too wise to utter
15604: soothing words at present, and indeed, the sight of Adam before him,
15605: with that look of sudden age which sometimes comes over a young face in
15606: moments of terrible emotion—the hard bloodless look of the skin, the
15607: deep lines about the quivering mouth, the furrows in the brow—the sight
15608: of this strong firm man shattered by the invisible stroke of sorrow,
15609: moved him so deeply that speech was not easy. Adam stood motionless,
15610: with his eyes vacantly fixed in this way for a minute or two; in that
15611: short space he was living through all his love again.
15612: 
15613: “She can’t ha’ done it,” he said, still without moving his eyes, as if
15614: he were only talking to himself: “it was fear made her hide it... I
15615: forgive her for deceiving me... I forgive thee, Hetty... thee wast
15616: deceived too... it’s gone hard wi’ thee, my poor Hetty... but they’ll
15617: never make me believe it.”
15618: 
15619: He was silent again for a few moments, and then he said, with fierce
15620: abruptness, “I’ll go to him—I’ll bring him back—I’ll make him go and
15621: look at her in her misery—he shall look at her till he can’t forget
15622: it—it shall follow him night and day—as long as he lives it shall
15623: follow him—he shan’t escape wi’ lies this time—I’ll fetch him, I’ll
15624: drag him myself.”
15625: 
15626: In the act of going towards the door, Adam paused automatically and
15627: looked about for his hat, quite unconscious where he was or who was
15628: present with him. Mr. Irwine had followed him, and now took him by the
15629: arm, saying, in a quiet but decided tone,
15630: 
15631: “No, Adam, no; I’m sure you will wish to stay and see what good can be
15632: done for _her_, instead of going on a useless errand of vengeance. The
15633: punishment will surely fall without your aid. Besides, he is no longer
15634: in Ireland. He must be on his way home—or would be, long before you
15635: arrived, for his grandfather, I know, wrote for him to come at least
15636: ten days ago. I want you now to go with me to Stoniton. I have ordered
15637: a horse for you to ride with us, as soon as you can compose yourself.”
15638: 
15639: While Mr. Irwine was speaking, Adam recovered his consciousness of the
15640: actual scene. He rubbed his hair off his forehead and listened.
15641: 
15642: “Remember,” Mr. Irwine went on, “there are others to think of, and act
15643: for, besides yourself, Adam: there are Hetty’s friends, the good
15644: Poysers, on whom this stroke will fall more heavily than I can bear to
15645: think. I expect it from your strength of mind, Adam—from your sense of
15646: duty to God and man—that you will try to act as long as action can be
15647: of any use.”
15648: 
15649: In reality, Mr. Irwine proposed this journey to Stoniton for Adam’s own
15650: sake. Movement, with some object before him, was the best means of
15651: counteracting the violence of suffering in these first hours.
15652: 
15653: “You _will_ go with me to Stoniton, Adam?” he said again, after a
15654: moment’s pause. “We have to see if it is really Hetty who is there, you
15655: know.”
15656: 
15657: “Yes, sir,” said Adam, “I’ll do what you think right. But the folks at
15658: th’ Hall Farm?”
15659: 
15660: “I wish them not to know till I return to tell them myself. I shall
15661: have ascertained things then which I am uncertain about now, and I
15662: shall return as soon as possible. Come now, the horses are ready.”
15663:

15667: Chapter XL
15668: The Bitter Waters Spread
15669: 
15670: 
15671: Mr. Irwine returned from Stoniton in a post-chaise that night, and the
15672: first words Carroll said to him, as he entered the house, were, that
15673: Squire Donnithorne was dead—found dead in his bed at ten o’clock that
15674: morning—and that Mrs. Irwine desired him to say she should be awake
15675: when Mr. Irwine came home, and she begged him not to go to bed without
15676: seeing her.
15677: 
15678: “Well, Dauphin,” Mrs. Irwine said, as her son entered her room, “you’re
15679: come at last. So the old gentleman’s fidgetiness and low spirits, which
15680: made him send for Arthur in that sudden way, really meant something. I
15681: suppose Carroll has told you that Donnithorne was found dead in his bed
15682: this morning. You will believe my prognostications another time, though
15683: I daresay I shan’t live to prognosticate anything but my own death.”
15684: 
15685: “What have they done about Arthur?” said Mr. Irwine. “Sent a messenger
15686: to await him at Liverpool?”
15687: 
15688: “Yes, Ralph was gone before the news was brought to us. Dear Arthur, I
15689: shall live now to see him master at the Chase, and making good times on
15690: the estate, like a generous-hearted fellow as he is. He’ll be as happy
15691: as a king now.”
15692: 
15693: Mr. Irwine could not help giving a slight groan: he was worn with
15694: anxiety and exertion, and his mother’s light words were almost
15695: intolerable.
15696: 
15697: “What are you so dismal about, Dauphin? Is there any bad news? Or are
15698: you thinking of the danger for Arthur in crossing that frightful Irish
15699: Channel at this time of year?”
15700: 
15701: “No, Mother, I’m not thinking of that; but I’m not prepared to rejoice
15702: just now.”
15703: 
15704: “You’ve been worried by this law business that you’ve been to Stoniton
15705: about. What in the world is it, that you can’t tell me?”
15706: 
15707: “You will know by and by, mother. It would not be right for me to tell
15708: you at present. Good-night: you’ll sleep now you have no longer
15709: anything to listen for.”
15710: 
15711: Mr. Irwine gave up his intention of sending a letter to meet Arthur,
15712: since it would not now hasten his return: the news of his grandfather’s
15713: death would bring him as soon as he could possibly come. He could go to
15714: bed now and get some needful rest, before the time came for the
15715: morning’s heavy duty of carrying his sickening news to the Hall Farm
15716: and to Adam’s home.
15717: 
15718: Adam himself was not come back from Stoniton, for though he shrank from
15719: seeing Hetty, he could not bear to go to a distance from her again.
15720: 
15721: “It’s no use, sir,” he said to the rector, “it’s no use for me to go
15722: back. I can’t go to work again while she’s here, and I couldn’t bear
15723: the sight o’ the things and folks round home. I’ll take a bit of a room
15724: here, where I can see the prison walls, and perhaps I shall get, in
15725: time, to bear seeing _her_.”
15726: 
15727: Adam had not been shaken in his belief that Hetty was innocent of the
15728: crime she was charged with, for Mr. Irwine, feeling that the belief in
15729: her guilt would be a crushing addition to Adam’s load, had kept from
15730: him the facts which left no hope in his own mind. There was not any
15731: reason for thrusting the whole burden on Adam at once, and Mr. Irwine,
15732: at parting, only said, “If the evidence should tell too strongly
15733: against her, Adam, we may still hope for a pardon. Her youth and other
15734: circumstances will be a plea for her.”
15735: 
15736: “Ah, and it’s right people should know how she was tempted into the
15737: wrong way,” said Adam, with bitter earnestness. “It’s right they should
15738: know it was a fine gentleman made love to her, and turned her head wi’
15739: notions. You’ll remember, sir, you’ve promised to tell my mother, and
15740: Seth, and the people at the farm, who it was as led her wrong, else
15741: they’ll think harder of her than she deserves. You’ll be doing her a
15742: hurt by sparing him, and I hold him the guiltiest before God, let her
15743: ha’ done what she may. If you spare him, I’ll expose him!”
15744: 
15745: “I think your demand is just, Adam,” said Mr. Irwine, “but when you are
15746: calmer, you will judge Arthur more mercifully. I say nothing now, only
15747: that his punishment is in other hands than ours.”
15748: 
15749: Mr. Irwine felt it hard upon him that he should have to tell of
15750: Arthur’s sad part in the story of sin and sorrow—he who cared for
15751: Arthur with fatherly affection, who had cared for him with fatherly
15752: pride. But he saw clearly that the secret must be known before long,
15753: even apart from Adam’s determination, since it was scarcely to be
15754: supposed that Hetty would persist to the end in her obstinate silence.
15755: He made up his mind to withhold nothing from the Poysers, but to tell
15756: them the worst at once, for there was no time to rob the tidings of
15757: their suddenness. Hetty’s trial must come on at the Lent assizes, and
15758: they were to be held at Stoniton the next week. It was scarcely to be
15759: hoped that Martin Poyser could escape the pain of being called as a
15760: witness, and it was better he should know everything as long beforehand
15761: as possible.
15762: 
15763: Before ten o’clock on Thursday morning the home at the Hall Farm was a
15764: house of mourning for a misfortune felt to be worse than death. The
15765: sense of family dishonour was too keen even in the kind-hearted Martin
15766: Poyser the younger to leave room for any compassion towards Hetty. He
15767: and his father were simple-minded farmers, proud of their untarnished
15768: character, proud that they came of a family which had held up its head
15769: and paid its way as far back as its name was in the parish register;
15770: and Hetty had brought disgrace on them all—disgrace that could never be
15771: wiped out. That was the all-conquering feeling in the mind both of
15772: father and son—the scorching sense of disgrace, which neutralised all
15773: other sensibility—and Mr. Irwine was struck with surprise to observe
15774: that Mrs. Poyser was less severe than her husband. We are often
15775: startled by the severity of mild people on exceptional occasions; the
15776: reason is, that mild people are most liable to be under the yoke of
15777: traditional impressions.
15778: 
15779: “I’m willing to pay any money as is wanted towards trying to bring her
15780: off,” said Martin the younger when Mr. Irwine was gone, while the old
15781: grandfather was crying in the opposite chair, “but I’ll not go nigh
15782: her, nor ever see her again, by my own will. She’s made our bread
15783: bitter to us for all our lives to come, an’ we shall ne’er hold up our
15784: heads i’ this parish nor i’ any other. The parson talks o’ folks
15785: pitying us: it’s poor amends pity ’ull make us.”
15786: 
15787: “Pity?” said the grandfather, sharply. “I ne’er wanted folks’s pity i’
15788: _my_ life afore... an’ I mun begin to be looked down on now, an’ me
15789: turned seventy-two last St. Thomas’s, an’ all th’ underbearers and
15790: pall-bearers as I’n picked for my funeral are i’ this parish and the
15791: next to ’t.... It’s o’ no use now... I mun be ta’en to the grave by
15792: strangers.”
15793: 
15794: “Don’t fret so, father,” said Mrs. Poyser, who had spoken very little,
15795: being almost overawed by her husband’s unusual hardness and decision.
15796: “You’ll have your children wi’ you; an’ there’s the lads and the little
15797: un ’ull grow up in a new parish as well as i’ th’ old un.”
15798: 
15799: “Ah, there’s no staying i’ this country for us now,” said Mr. Poyser,
15800: and the hard tears trickled slowly down his round cheeks. “We thought
15801: it ’ud be bad luck if the old squire gave us notice this Lady day, but
15802: I must gi’ notice myself now, an’ see if there can anybody be got to
15803: come an’ take to the crops as I’n put i’ the ground; for I wonna stay
15804: upo’ that man’s land a day longer nor I’m forced to’t. An’ me, as
15805: thought him such a good upright young man, as I should be glad when he
15806: come to be our landlord. I’ll ne’er lift my hat to him again, nor sit
15807: i’ the same church wi’ him... a man as has brought shame on respectable
15808: folks... an’ pretended to be such a friend t’ everybody.... Poor Adam
15809: there... a fine friend he’s been t’ Adam, making speeches an’ talking
15810: so fine, an’ all the while poisoning the lad’s life, as it’s much if he
15811: can stay i’ this country any more nor we can.”
15812: 
15813: “An’ you t’ ha’ to go into court, and own you’re akin t’ her,” said the
15814: old man. “Why, they’ll cast it up to the little un, as isn’t four ’ear
15815: old, some day—they’ll cast it up t’ her as she’d a cousin tried at the
15816: ’sizes for murder.”
15817: 
15818: “It’ll be their own wickedness, then,” said Mrs. Poyser, with a sob in
15819: her voice. “But there’s One above ’ull take care o’ the innicent child,
15820: else it’s but little truth they tell us at church. It’ll be harder nor
15821: ever to die an’ leave the little uns, an’ nobody to be a mother to
15822: ’em.”
15823: 
15824: “We’d better ha’ sent for Dinah, if we’d known where she is,” said Mr.
15825: Poyser; “but Adam said she’d left no direction where she’d be at
15826: Leeds.”
15827: 
15828: “Why, she’d be wi’ that woman as was a friend t’ her Aunt Judith,” said
15829: Mrs. Poyser, comforted a little by this suggestion of her husband.
15830: “I’ve often heard Dinah talk of her, but I can’t remember what name she
15831: called her by. But there’s Seth Bede; he’s like enough to know, for
15832: she’s a preaching woman as the Methodists think a deal on.”
15833: 
15834: “I’ll send to Seth,” said Mr. Poyser. “I’ll send Alick to tell him to
15835: come, or else to send up word o’ the woman’s name, an’ thee canst write
15836: a letter ready to send off to Treddles’on as soon as we can make out a
15837: direction.”
15838: 
15839: “It’s poor work writing letters when you want folks to come to you i’
15840: trouble,” said Mrs. Poyser. “Happen it’ll be ever so long on the road,
15841: an’ never reach her at last.”
15842: 
15843: Before Alick arrived with the message, Lisbeth’s thoughts too had
15844: already flown to Dinah, and she had said to Seth, “Eh, there’s no
15845: comfort for us i’ this world any more, wi’out thee couldst get Dinah
15846: Morris to come to us, as she did when my old man died. I’d like her to
15847: come in an’ take me by th’ hand again, an’ talk to me. She’d tell me
15848: the rights on’t, belike—she’d happen know some good i’ all this trouble
15849: an’ heart-break comin’ upo’ that poor lad, as ne’er done a bit o’ wrong
15850: in’s life, but war better nor anybody else’s son, pick the country
15851: round. Eh, my lad... Adam, my poor lad!”
15852: 
15853: “Thee wouldstna like me to leave thee, to go and fetch Dinah?” said
15854: Seth, as his mother sobbed and rocked herself to and fro.
15855: 
15856: “Fetch her?” said Lisbeth, looking up and pausing from her grief, like
15857: a crying child who hears some promise of consolation. “Why, what place
15858: is’t she’s at, do they say?”
15859: 
15860: “It’s a good way off, mother—Leeds, a big town. But I could be back in
15861: three days, if thee couldst spare me.”
15862: 
15863: “Nay, nay, I canna spare thee. Thee must go an’ see thy brother, an’
15864: bring me word what he’s a-doin’. Mester Irwine said he’d come an’ tell
15865: me, but I canna make out so well what it means when he tells me. Thee
15866: must go thysen, sin’ Adam wonna let me go to him. Write a letter to
15867: Dinah canstna? Thee’t fond enough o’ writin’ when nobody wants thee.”
15868: 
15869: “I’m not sure where she’d be i’ that big town,” said Seth. “If I’d gone
15870: myself, I could ha’ found out by asking the members o’ the Society. But
15871: perhaps if I put Sarah Williamson, Methodist preacher, Leeds, o’ th’
15872: outside, it might get to her; for most like she’d be wi’ Sarah
15873: Williamson.”
15874: 
15875: Alick came now with the message, and Seth, finding that Mrs. Poyser was
15876: writing to Dinah, gave up the intention of writing himself; but he went
15877: to the Hall Farm to tell them all he could suggest about the address of
15878: the letter, and warn them that there might be some delay in the
15879: delivery, from his not knowing an exact direction.
15880: 
15881: On leaving Lisbeth, Mr. Irwine had gone to Jonathan Burge, who had also
15882: a claim to be acquainted with what was likely to keep Adam away from
15883: business for some time; and before six o’clock that evening there were
15884: few people in Broxton and Hayslope who had not heard the sad news. Mr.
15885: Irwine had not mentioned Arthur’s name to Burge, and yet the story of
15886: his conduct towards Hetty, with all the dark shadows cast upon it by
15887: its terrible consequences, was presently as well known as that his
15888: grandfather was dead, and that he was come into the estate. For Martin
15889: Poyser felt no motive to keep silence towards the one or two neighbours
15890: who ventured to come and shake him sorrowfully by the hand on the first
15891: day of his trouble; and Carroll, who kept his ears open to all that
15892: passed at the rectory, had framed an inferential version of the story,
15893: and found early opportunities of communicating it.
15894: 
15895: One of those neighbours who came to Martin Poyser and shook him by the
15896: hand without speaking for some minutes was Bartle Massey. He had shut
15897: up his school, and was on his way to the rectory, where he arrived
15898: about half-past seven in the evening, and, sending his duty to Mr.
15899: Irwine, begged pardon for troubling him at that hour, but had something
15900: particular on his mind. He was shown into the study, where Mr. Irwine
15901: soon joined him.
15902: 
15903: “Well, Bartle?” said Mr. Irwine, putting out his hand. That was not his
15904: usual way of saluting the schoolmaster, but trouble makes us treat all
15905: who feel with us very much alike. “Sit down.”
15906: 
15907: “You know what I’m come about as well as I do, sir, I daresay,” said
15908: Bartle.
15909: 
15910: “You wish to know the truth about the sad news that has reached you...
15911: about Hetty Sorrel?”
15912: 
15913: “Nay, sir, what I wish to know is about Adam Bede. I understand you
15914: left him at Stoniton, and I beg the favour of you to tell me what’s the
15915: state of the poor lad’s mind, and what he means to do. For as for that
15916: bit o’ pink-and-white they’ve taken the trouble to put in jail, I don’t
15917: value her a rotten nut—not a rotten nut—only for the harm or good that
15918: may come out of her to an honest man—a lad I’ve set such store
15919: by—trusted to, that he’d make my bit o’ knowledge go a good way in the
15920: world.... Why, sir, he’s the only scholar I’ve had in this stupid
15921: country that ever had the will or the head-piece for mathematics. If he
15922: hadn’t had so much hard work to do, poor fellow, he might have gone
15923: into the higher branches, and then this might never have happened—might
15924: never have happened.”
15925: 
15926: Bartle was heated by the exertion of walking fast in an agitated frame
15927: of mind, and was not able to check himself on this first occasion of
15928: venting his feelings. But he paused now to rub his moist forehead, and
15929: probably his moist eyes also.
15930: 
15931: “You’ll excuse me, sir,” he said, when this pause had given him time to
15932: reflect, “for running on in this way about my own feelings, like that
15933: foolish dog of mine howling in a storm, when there’s nobody wants to
15934: listen to me. I came to hear you speak, not to talk myself—if you’ll
15935: take the trouble to tell me what the poor lad’s doing.”
15936: 
15937: “Don’t put yourself under any restraint, Bartle,” said Mr. Irwine. “The
15938: fact is, I’m very much in the same condition as you just now; I’ve a
15939: great deal that’s painful on my mind, and I find it hard work to be
15940: quite silent about my own feelings and only attend to others. I share
15941: your concern for Adam, though he is not the only one whose sufferings I
15942: care for in this affair. He intends to remain at Stoniton till after
15943: the trial: it will come on probably a week to-morrow. He has taken a
15944: room there, and I encouraged him to do so, because I think it better he
15945: should be away from his own home at present; and, poor fellow, he still
15946: believes Hetty is innocent—he wants to summon up courage to see her if
15947: he can; he is unwilling to leave the spot where she is.”
15948: 
15949: “Do you think the creatur’s guilty, then?” said Bartle. “Do you think
15950: they’ll hang her?”
15951: 
15952: “I’m afraid it will go hard with her. The evidence is very strong. And
15953: one bad symptom is that she denies everything—denies that she has had a
15954: child in the face of the most positive evidence. I saw her myself, and
15955: she was obstinately silent to me; she shrank up like a frightened
15956: animal when she saw me. I was never so shocked in my life as at the
15957: change in her. But I trust that, in the worst case, we may obtain a
15958: pardon for the sake of the innocent who are involved.”
15959: 
15960: “Stuff and nonsense!” said Bartle, forgetting in his irritation to whom
15961: he was speaking. “I beg your pardon, sir, I mean it’s stuff and
15962: nonsense for the innocent to care about her being hanged. For my own
15963: part, I think the sooner such women are put out o’ the world the
15964: better; and the men that help ’em to do mischief had better go along
15965: with ’em for that matter. What good will you do by keeping such vermin
15966: alive, eating the victual that ’ud feed rational beings? But if Adam’s
15967: fool enough to care about it, I don’t want him to suffer more than’s
15968: needful.... Is he very much cut up, poor fellow?” Bartle added, taking
15969: out his spectacles and putting them on, as if they would assist his
15970: imagination.
15971: 
15972: “Yes, I’m afraid the grief cuts very deep,” said Mr. Irwine. “He looks
15973: terribly shattered, and a certain violence came over him now and then
15974: yesterday, which made me wish I could have remained near him. But I
15975: shall go to Stoniton again to-morrow, and I have confidence enough in
15976: the strength of Adam’s principle to trust that he will be able to
15977: endure the worst without being driven to anything rash.”
15978: 
15979: Mr. Irwine, who was involuntarily uttering his own thoughts rather than
15980: addressing Bartle Massey in the last sentence, had in his mind the
15981: possibility that the spirit of vengeance towards Arthur, which was the
15982: form Adam’s anguish was continually taking, might make him seek an
15983: encounter that was likely to end more fatally than the one in the
15984: Grove. This possibility heightened the anxiety with which he looked
15985: forward to Arthur’s arrival. But Bartle thought Mr. Irwine was
15986: referring to suicide, and his face wore a new alarm.
15987: 
15988: “I’ll tell you what I have in my head, sir,” he said, “and I hope
15989: you’ll approve of it. I’m going to shut up my school—if the scholars
15990: come, they must go back again, that’s all—and I shall go to Stoniton
15991: and look after Adam till this business is over. I’ll pretend I’m come
15992: to look on at the assizes; he can’t object to that. What do you think
15993: about it, sir?”
15994: 
15995: “Well,” said Mr. Irwine, rather hesitatingly, “there would be some real
15996: advantages in that... and I honour you for your friendship towards him,
15997: Bartle. But... you must be careful what you say to him, you know. I’m
15998: afraid you have too little fellow-feeling in what you consider his
15999: weakness about Hetty.”
16000: 
16001: “Trust to me, sir—trust to me. I know what you mean. I’ve been a fool
16002: myself in my time, but that’s between you and me. I shan’t thrust
16003: myself on him only keep my eye on him, and see that he gets some good
16004: food, and put in a word here and there.”
16005: 
16006: “Then,” said Mr. Irwine, reassured a little as to Bartle’s discretion,
16007: “I think you’ll be doing a good deed; and it will be well for you to
16008: let Adam’s mother and brother know that you’re going.”
16009: 
16010: “Yes, sir, yes,” said Bartle, rising, and taking off his spectacles,
16011: “I’ll do that, I’ll do that; though the mother’s a whimpering thing—I
16012: don’t like to come within earshot of her; however, she’s a
16013: straight-backed, clean woman, none of your slatterns. I wish you
16014: good-bye, sir, and thank you for the time you’ve spared me. You’re
16015: everybody’s friend in this business—everybody’s friend. It’s a heavy
16016: weight you’ve got on your shoulders.”
16017: 
16018: “Good-bye, Bartle, till we meet at Stoniton, as I daresay we shall.”
16019: 
16020: Bartle hurried away from the rectory, evading Carroll’s conversational
16021: advances, and saying in an exasperated tone to Vixen, whose short legs
16022: pattered beside him on the gravel, “Now, I shall be obliged to take you
16023: with me, you good-for-nothing woman. You’d go fretting yourself to
16024: death if I left you—you know you would, and perhaps get snapped up by
16025: some tramp. And you’ll be running into bad company, I expect, putting
16026: your nose in every hole and corner where you’ve no business! But if you
16027: do anything disgraceful, I’ll disown you—mind that, madam, mind that!”

16031: 
16032: Chapter XLI
16033: The Eve of the Trial
16034: 
16035: 
16036: An upper room in a dull Stoniton street, with two beds in it—one laid
16037: on the floor. It is ten o’clock on Thursday night, and the dark wall
16038: opposite the window shuts out the moonlight that might have struggled
16039: with the light of the one dip candle by which Bartle Massey is
16040: pretending to read, while he is really looking over his spectacles at
16041: Adam Bede, seated near the dark window.
16042: 
16043: You would hardly have known it was Adam without being told. His face
16044: has got thinner this last week: he has the sunken eyes, the neglected
16045: beard of a man just risen from a sick-bed. His heavy black hair hangs
16046: over his forehead, and there is no active impulse in him which inclines
16047: him to push it off, that he may be more awake to what is around him. He
16048: has one arm over the back of the chair, and he seems to be looking down
16049: at his clasped hands. He is roused by a knock at the door.
16050: 
16051: “There he is,” said Bartle Massey, rising hastily and unfastening the
16052: door. It was Mr. Irwine.
16053: 
16054: Adam rose from his chair with instinctive respect, as Mr. Irwine
16055: approached him and took his hand.
16056: 
16057: “I’m late, Adam,” he said, sitting down on the chair which Bartle
16058: placed for him, “but I was later in setting off from Broxton than I
16059: intended to be, and I have been incessantly occupied since I arrived. I
16060: have done everything now, however—everything that can be done to-night,
16061: at least. Let us all sit down.”
16062: 
16063: Adam took his chair again mechanically, and Bartle, for whom there was
16064: no chair remaining, sat on the bed in the background.
16065: 
16066: “Have you seen her, sir?” said Adam tremulously.
16067: 
16068: “Yes, Adam; I and the chaplain have both been with her this evening.”
16069: 
16070: “Did you ask her, sir... did you say anything about me?”
16071: 
16072: “Yes,” said Mr. Irwine, with some hesitation, “I spoke of you. I said
16073: you wished to see her before the trial, if she consented.”
16074: 
16075: As Mr. Irwine paused, Adam looked at him with eager, questioning eyes.
16076: 
16077: “You know she shrinks from seeing any one, Adam. It is not only
16078: you—some fatal influence seems to have shut up her heart against her
16079: fellow-creatures. She has scarcely said anything more than ‘No’ either
16080: to me or the chaplain. Three or four days ago, before you were
16081: mentioned to her, when I asked her if there was any one of her family
16082: whom she would like to see—to whom she could open her mind—she said,
16083: with a violent shudder, ‘Tell them not to come near me—I won’t see any
16084: of them.’”
16085: 
16086: Adam’s head was hanging down again, and he did not speak. There was
16087: silence for a few minutes, and then Mr. Irwine said, “I don’t like to
16088: advise you against your own feelings, Adam, if they now urge you
16089: strongly to go and see her to-morrow morning, even without her consent.
16090: It is just possible, notwithstanding appearances to the contrary, that
16091: the interview might affect her favourably. But I grieve to say I have
16092: scarcely any hope of that. She didn’t seem agitated when I mentioned
16093: your name; she only said ‘No,’ in the same cold, obstinate way as
16094: usual. And if the meeting had no good effect on her, it would be pure,
16095: useless suffering to you—severe suffering, I fear. She is very much
16096: changed...”
16097: 
16098: Adam started up from his chair and seized his hat, which lay on the
16099: table. But he stood still then, and looked at Mr. Irwine, as if he had
16100: a question to ask which it was yet difficult to utter. Bartle Massey
16101: rose quietly, turned the key in the door, and put it in his pocket.
16102: 
16103: “Is he come back?” said Adam at last.
16104: 
16105: “No, he is not,” said Mr. Irwine, quietly. “Lay down your hat, Adam,
16106: unless you like to walk out with me for a little fresh air. I fear you
16107: have not been out again to-day.”
16108: 
16109: “You needn’t deceive me, sir,” said Adam, looking hard at Mr. Irwine
16110: and speaking in a tone of angry suspicion. “You needn’t be afraid of
16111: me. I only want justice. I want him to feel what she feels. It’s his
16112: work... she was a child as it ’ud ha’ gone t’ anybody’s heart to look
16113: at... I don’t care what she’s done... it was him brought her to it. And
16114: he shall know it... he shall feel it... if there’s a just God, he shall
16115: feel what it is t’ ha’ brought a child like her to sin and misery.”
16116: 
16117: “I’m not deceiving you, Adam,” said Mr. Irwine. “Arthur Donnithorne is
16118: not come back—was not come back when I left. I have left a letter for
16119: him: he will know all as soon as he arrives.”
16120: 
16121: “But you don’t mind about it,” said Adam indignantly. “You think it
16122: doesn’t matter as she lies there in shame and misery, and he knows
16123: nothing about it—he suffers nothing.”
16124: 
16125: “Adam, he _will_ know—he _will_ suffer, long and bitterly. He has a
16126: heart and a conscience: I can’t be entirely deceived in his character.
16127: I am convinced—I am sure he didn’t fall under temptation without a
16128: struggle. He may be weak, but he is not callous, not coldly selfish. I
16129: am persuaded that this will be a shock of which he will feel the
16130: effects all his life. Why do you crave vengeance in this way? No amount
16131: of torture that you could inflict on _him_ could benefit _her_.”
16132: 
16133: “No—O God, no,” Adam groaned out, sinking on his chair again; “but
16134: then, that’s the deepest curse of all... that’s what makes the
16135: blackness of it... _it can never be undone_. My poor Hetty... she can
16136: never be my sweet Hetty again... the prettiest thing God had
16137: made—smiling up at me... I thought she loved me... and was good...”
16138: 
16139: Adam’s voice had been gradually sinking into a hoarse undertone, as if
16140: he were only talking to himself; but now he said abruptly, looking at
16141: Mr. Irwine, “But she isn’t as guilty as they say? You don’t think she
16142: is, sir? She can’t ha’ done it.”
16143: 
16144: “That perhaps can never be known with certainty, Adam,” Mr. Irwine
16145: answered gently. “In these cases we sometimes form our judgment on what
16146: seems to us strong evidence, and yet, for want of knowing some small
16147: fact, our judgment is wrong. But suppose the worst: you have no right
16148: to say that the guilt of her crime lies with him, and that he ought to
16149: bear the punishment. It is not for us men to apportion the shares of
16150: moral guilt and retribution. We find it impossible to avoid mistakes
16151: even in determining who has committed a single criminal act, and the
16152: problem how far a man is to be held responsible for the unforeseen
16153: consequences of his own deed is one that might well make us tremble to
16154: look into it. The evil consequences that may lie folded in a single act
16155: of selfish indulgence is a thought so awful that it ought surely to
16156: awaken some feeling less presumptuous than a rash desire to punish. You
16157: have a mind that can understand this fully, Adam, when you are calm.
16158: Don’t suppose I can’t enter into the anguish that drives you into this
16159: state of revengeful hatred. But think of this: if you were to obey your
16160: passion—for it _is_ passion, and you deceive yourself in calling it
16161: justice—it might be with you precisely as it has been with Arthur; nay,
16162: worse; your passion might lead you yourself into a horrible crime.”
16163: 
16164: “No—not worse,” said Adam, bitterly; “I don’t believe it’s worse—I’d
16165: sooner do it—I’d sooner do a wickedness as I could suffer for by myself
16166: than ha’ brought _her_ to do wickedness and then stand by and see ’em
16167: punish her while they let me alone; and all for a bit o’ pleasure, as,
16168: if he’d had a man’s heart in him, he’d ha’ cut his hand off sooner than
16169: he’d ha’ taken it. What if he didn’t foresee what’s happened? He
16170: foresaw enough; he’d no right to expect anything but harm and shame to
16171: her. And then he wanted to smooth it off wi’ lies. No—there’s plenty o’
16172: things folks are hanged for not half so hateful as that. Let a man do
16173: what he will, if he knows he’s to bear the punishment himself, he isn’t
16174: half so bad as a mean selfish coward as makes things easy t’ himself
16175: and knows all the while the punishment ’ll fall on somebody else.”
16176: 
16177: “There again you partly deceive yourself, Adam. There is no sort of
16178: wrong deed of which a man can bear the punishment alone; you can’t
16179: isolate yourself and say that the evil which is in you shall not
16180: spread. Men’s lives are as thoroughly blended with each other as the
16181: air they breathe: evil spreads as necessarily as disease. I know, I
16182: feel the terrible extent of suffering this sin of Arthur’s has caused
16183: to others; but so does every sin cause suffering to others besides
16184: those who commit it. An act of vengeance on your part against Arthur
16185: would simply be another evil added to those we are suffering under: you
16186: could not bear the punishment alone; you would entail the worst sorrows
16187: on every one who loves you. You would have committed an act of blind
16188: fury that would leave all the present evils just as they were and add
16189: worse evils to them. You may tell me that you meditate no fatal act of
16190: vengeance, but the feeling in your mind is what gives birth to such
16191: actions, and as long as you indulge it, as long as you do not see that
16192: to fix your mind on Arthur’s punishment is revenge, and not justice,
16193: you are in danger of being led on to the commission of some great
16194: wrong. Remember what you told me about your feelings after you had
16195: given that blow to Arthur in the Grove.”
16196: 
16197: Adam was silent: the last words had called up a vivid image of the
16198: past, and Mr. Irwine left him to his thoughts, while he spoke to Bartle
16199: Massey about old Mr. Donnithorne’s funeral and other matters of an
16200: indifferent kind. But at length Adam turned round and said, in a more
16201: subdued tone, “I’ve not asked about ’em at th’ Hall Farm, sir. Is Mr.
16202: Poyser coming?”
16203: 
16204: “He is come; he is in Stoniton to-night. But I could not advise him to
16205: see you, Adam. His own mind is in a very perturbed state, and it is
16206: best he should not see you till you are calmer.”
16207: 
16208: “Is Dinah Morris come to ’em, sir? Seth said they’d sent for her.”
16209: 
16210: “No. Mr. Poyser tells me she was not come when he left. They’re afraid
16211: the letter has not reached her. It seems they had no exact address.”
16212: 
16213: Adam sat ruminating a little while, and then said, “I wonder if Dinah
16214: ’ud ha’ gone to see her. But perhaps the Poysers would ha’ been sorely
16215: against it, since they won’t come nigh her themselves. But I think she
16216: would, for the Methodists are great folks for going into the prisons;
16217: and Seth said he thought she would. She’d a very tender way with her,
16218: Dinah had; I wonder if she could ha’ done any good. You never saw her,
16219: sir, did you?”
16220: 
16221: “Yes, I did. I had a conversation with her—she pleased me a good deal.
16222: And now you mention it, I wish she would come, for it is possible that
16223: a gentle mild woman like her might move Hetty to open her heart. The
16224: jail chaplain is rather harsh in his manner.”
16225: 
16226: “But it’s o’ no use if she doesn’t come,” said Adam sadly.
16227: 
16228: “If I’d thought of it earlier, I would have taken some measures for
16229: finding her out,” said Mr. Irwine, “but it’s too late now, I fear...
16230: Well, Adam, I must go now. Try to get some rest to-night. God bless
16231: you. I’ll see you early to-morrow morning.”
16232: 
16233: 
16234: 
16235: 
16236: Chapter XLII
16237: The Morning of the Trial
16238: 
16239: 
16240: At one o’clock the next day, Adam was alone in his dull upper room; his
16241: watch lay before him on the table, as if he were counting the long
16242: minutes. He had no knowledge of what was likely to be said by the
16243: witnesses on the trial, for he had shrunk from all the particulars
16244: connected with Hetty’s arrest and accusation. This brave active man,
16245: who would have hastened towards any danger or toil to rescue Hetty from
16246: an apprehended wrong or misfortune, felt himself powerless to
16247: contemplate irremediable evil and suffering. The susceptibility which
16248: would have been an impelling force where there was any possibility of
16249: action became helpless anguish when he was obliged to be passive, or
16250: else sought an active outlet in the thought of inflicting justice on
16251: Arthur. Energetic natures, strong for all strenuous deeds, will often
16252: rush away from a hopeless sufferer, as if they were hard-hearted. It is
16253: the overmastering sense of pain that drives them. They shrink by an
16254: ungovernable instinct, as they would shrink from laceration. Adam had
16255: brought himself to think of seeing Hetty, if she would consent to see
16256: him, because he thought the meeting might possibly be a good to
16257: her—might help to melt away this terrible hardness they told him of. If
16258: she saw he bore her no ill will for what she had done to him, she might
16259: open her heart to him. But this resolution had been an immense
16260: effort—he trembled at the thought of seeing her changed face, as a
16261: timid woman trembles at the thought of the surgeon’s knife, and he
16262: chose now to bear the long hours of suspense rather than encounter what
16263: seemed to him the more intolerable agony of witnessing her trial.
16264: 
16265: Deep unspeakable suffering may well be called a baptism, a
16266: regeneration, the initiation into a new state. The yearning memories,
16267: the bitter regret, the agonized sympathy, the struggling appeals to the
16268: Invisible Right—all the intense emotions which had filled the days and
16269: nights of the past week, and were compressing themselves again like an
16270: eager crowd into the hours of this single morning, made Adam look back
16271: on all the previous years as if they had been a dim sleepy existence,
16272: and he had only now awaked to full consciousness. It seemed to him as
16273: if he had always before thought it a light thing that men should
16274: suffer, as if all that he had himself endured and called sorrow before
16275: was only a moment’s stroke that had never left a bruise. Doubtless a
16276: great anguish may do the work of years, and we may come out from that
16277: baptism of fire with a soul full of new awe and new pity.
16278: 
16279: “O God,” Adam groaned, as he leaned on the table and looked blankly at
16280: the face of the watch, “and men have suffered like this before... and
16281: poor helpless young things have suffered like her.... Such a little
16282: while ago looking so happy and so pretty... kissing ’em all, her
16283: grandfather and all of ’em, and they wishing her luck.... O my poor,
16284: poor Hetty... dost think on it now?”
16285: 
16286: Adam started and looked round towards the door. Vixen had begun to
16287: whimper, and there was a sound of a stick and a lame walk on the
16288: stairs. It was Bartle Massey come back. Could it be all over?
16289: 
16290: Bartle entered quietly, and, going up to Adam, grasped his hand and
16291: said, “I’m just come to look at you, my boy, for the folks are gone out
16292: of court for a bit.”
16293: 
16294: Adam’s heart beat so violently he was unable to speak—he could only
16295: return the pressure of his friend’s hand—and Bartle, drawing up the
16296: other chair, came and sat in front of him, taking off his hat and his
16297: spectacles.
16298: 
16299: “That’s a thing never happened to me before,” he observed, “to go out
16300: o’ the door with my spectacles on. I clean forgot to take ’em off.”
16301: 
16302: The old man made this trivial remark, thinking it better not to respond
16303: at all to Adam’s agitation: he would gather, in an indirect way, that
16304: there was nothing decisive to communicate at present.
16305: 
16306: “And now,” he said, rising again, “I must see to your having a bit of
16307: the loaf, and some of that wine Mr. Irwine sent this morning. He’ll be
16308: angry with me if you don’t have it. Come, now,” he went on, bringing
16309: forward the bottle and the loaf and pouring some wine into a cup, “I
16310: must have a bit and a sup myself. Drink a drop with me, my lad—drink
16311: with me.”
16312: 
16313: Adam pushed the cup gently away and said, entreatingly, “Tell me about
16314: it, Mr. Massey—tell me all about it. Was she there? Have they begun?”
16315: 
16316: “Yes, my boy, yes—it’s taken all the time since I first went; but
16317: they’re slow, they’re slow; and there’s the counsel they’ve got for her
16318: puts a spoke in the wheel whenever he can, and makes a deal to do with
16319: cross-examining the witnesses and quarrelling with the other lawyers.
16320: That’s all he can do for the money they give him; and it’s a big
16321: sum—it’s a big sum. But he’s a ’cute fellow, with an eye that ’ud pick
16322: the needles out of the hay in no time. If a man had got no feelings, it
16323: ’ud be as good as a demonstration to listen to what goes on in court;
16324: but a tender heart makes one stupid. I’d have given up figures for ever
16325: only to have had some good news to bring to you, my poor lad.”
16326: 
16327: “But does it seem to be going against her?” said Adam. “Tell me what
16328: they’ve said. I must know it now—I must know what they have to bring
16329: against her.”
16330: 
16331: “Why, the chief evidence yet has been the doctors; all but Martin
16332: Poyser—poor Martin. Everybody in court felt for him—it was like one
16333: sob, the sound they made when he came down again. The worst was when
16334: they told him to look at the prisoner at the bar. It was hard work,
16335: poor fellow—it was hard work. Adam, my boy, the blow falls heavily on
16336: him as well as you; you must help poor Martin; you must show courage.
16337: Drink some wine now, and show me you mean to bear it like a man.”
16338: 
16339: Bartle had made the right sort of appeal. Adam, with an air of quiet
16340: obedience, took up the cup and drank a little.
16341: 
16342: “Tell me how _she_ looked,” he said presently.
16343: 
16344: “Frightened, very frightened, when they first brought her in; it was
16345: the first sight of the crowd and the judge, poor creatur. And there’s a
16346: lot o’ foolish women in fine clothes, with gewgaws all up their arms
16347: and feathers on their heads, sitting near the judge: they’ve dressed
16348: themselves out in that way, one ’ud think, to be scarecrows and
16349: warnings against any man ever meddling with a woman again. They put up
16350: their glasses, and stared and whispered. But after that she stood like
16351: a white image, staring down at her hands and seeming neither to hear
16352: nor see anything. And she’s as white as a sheet. She didn’t speak when
16353: they asked her if she’d plead ‘guilty’ or ‘not guilty,’ and they
16354: pleaded ‘not guilty’ for her. But when she heard her uncle’s name,
16355: there seemed to go a shiver right through her; and when they told him
16356: to look at her, she hung her head down, and cowered, and hid her face
16357: in her hands. He’d much ado to speak poor man, his voice trembled so.
16358: And the counsellors—who look as hard as nails mostly—I saw, spared him
16359: as much as they could. Mr. Irwine put himself near him and went with
16360: him out o’ court. Ah, it’s a great thing in a man’s life to be able to
16361: stand by a neighbour and uphold him in such trouble as that.”
16362: 
16363: “God bless him, and you too, Mr. Massey,” said Adam, in a low voice,
16364: laying his hand on Bartle’s arm.
16365: 
16366: “Aye, aye, he’s good metal; he gives the right ring when you try him,
16367: our parson does. A man o’ sense—says no more than’s needful. He’s not
16368: one of those that think they can comfort you with chattering, as if
16369: folks who stand by and look on knew a deal better what the trouble was
16370: than those who have to bear it. I’ve had to do with such folks in my
16371: time—in the south, when I was in trouble myself. Mr. Irwine is to be a
16372: witness himself, by and by, on her side, you know, to speak to her
16373: character and bringing up.”
16374: 
16375: “But the other evidence... does it go hard against her!” said Adam.
16376: “What do you think, Mr. Massey? Tell me the truth.”
16377: 
16378: “Yes, my lad, yes. The truth is the best thing to tell. It must come at
16379: last. The doctors’ evidence is heavy on her—is heavy. But she’s gone on
16380: denying she’s had a child from first to last. These poor silly
16381: women-things—they’ve not the sense to know it’s no use denying what’s
16382: proved. It’ll make against her with the jury, I doubt, her being so
16383: obstinate: they may be less for recommending her to mercy, if the
16384: verdict’s against her. But Mr. Irwine ’ull leave no stone unturned with
16385: the judge—you may rely upon that, Adam.”
16386: 
16387: “Is there nobody to stand by her and seem to care for her in the
16388: court?” said Adam.
16389: 
16390: “There’s the chaplain o’ the jail sits near her, but he’s a sharp
16391: ferrety-faced man—another sort o’ flesh and blood to Mr. Irwine. They
16392: say the jail chaplains are mostly the fag-end o’ the clergy.”
16393: 
16394: “There’s one man as ought to be there,” said Adam bitterly. Presently
16395: he drew himself up and looked fixedly out of the window, apparently
16396: turning over some new idea in his mind.
16397: 
16398: “Mr. Massey,” he said at last, pushing the hair off his forehead, “I’ll
16399: go back with you. I’ll go into court. It’s cowardly of me to keep away.
16400: I’ll stand by her—I’ll own her—for all she’s been deceitful. They
16401: oughtn’t to cast her off—her own flesh and blood. We hand folks over to
16402: God’s mercy, and show none ourselves. I used to be hard sometimes: I’ll
16403: never be hard again. I’ll go, Mr. Massey—I’ll go with you.”
16404: 
16405: There was a decision in Adam’s manner which would have prevented Bartle
16406: from opposing him, even if he had wished to do so. He only said, “Take
16407: a bit, then, and another sup, Adam, for the love of me. See, I must
16408: stop and eat a morsel. Now, you take some.”
16409: 
16410: Nerved by an active resolution, Adam took a morsel of bread and drank
16411: some wine. He was haggard and unshaven, as he had been yesterday, but
16412: he stood upright again, and looked more like the Adam Bede of former
16413: days.

16417: 
16418: Chapter XLIII
16419: The Verdict
16420: 
16421: 
16422: The place fitted up that day as a court of justice was a grand old
16423: hall, now destroyed by fire. The midday light that fell on the close
16424: pavement of human heads was shed through a line of high pointed
16425: windows, variegated with the mellow tints of old painted glass. Grim
16426: dusty armour hung in high relief in front of the dark oaken gallery at
16427: the farther end, and under the broad arch of the great mullioned window
16428: opposite was spread a curtain of old tapestry, covered with dim
16429: melancholy figures, like a dozing indistinct dream of the past. It was
16430: a place that through the rest of the year was haunted with the shadowy
16431: memories of old kings and queens, unhappy, discrowned, imprisoned; but
16432: to-day all those shadows had fled, and not a soul in the vast hall felt
16433: the presence of any but a living sorrow, which was quivering in warm
16434: hearts.
16435: 
16436: But that sorrow seemed to have made it itself feebly felt hitherto, now
16437: when Adam Bede’s tall figure was suddenly seen being ushered to the
16438: side of the prisoner’s dock. In the broad sunlight of the great hall,
16439: among the sleek shaven faces of other men, the marks of suffering in
16440: his face were startling even to Mr. Irwine, who had last seen him in
16441: the dim light of his small room; and the neighbours from Hayslope who
16442: were present, and who told Hetty Sorrel’s story by their firesides in
16443: their old age, never forgot to say how it moved them when Adam Bede,
16444: poor fellow, taller by the head than most of the people round him, came
16445: into court and took his place by her side.
16446: 
16447: But Hetty did not see him. She was standing in the same position Bartle
16448: Massey had described, her hands crossed over each other and her eyes
16449: fixed on them. Adam had not dared to look at her in the first moments,
16450: but at last, when the attention of the court was withdrawn by the
16451: proceedings he turned his face towards her with a resolution not to
16452: shrink.
16453: 
16454: Why did they say she was so changed? In the corpse we love, it is the
16455: _likeness_ we see—it is the likeness, which makes itself felt the more
16456: keenly because something else _was_ and _is not_. There they were—the
16457: sweet face and neck, with the dark tendrils of hair, the long dark
16458: lashes, the rounded cheek and the pouting lips—pale and thin, yes, but
16459: like Hetty, and only Hetty. Others thought she looked as if some demon
16460: had cast a blighting glance upon her, withered up the woman’s soul in
16461: her, and left only a hard despairing obstinacy. But the mother’s
16462: yearning, that completest type of the life in another life which is the
16463: essence of real human love, feels the presence of the cherished child
16464: even in the debased, degraded man; and to Adam, this pale, hard-looking
16465: culprit was the Hetty who had smiled at him in the garden under the
16466: apple-tree boughs—she was that Hetty’s corpse, which he had trembled to
16467: look at the first time, and then was unwilling to turn away his eyes
16468: from.
16469: 
16470: But presently he heard something that compelled him to listen, and made
16471: the sense of sight less absorbing. A woman was in the witness-box, a
16472: middle-aged woman, who spoke in a firm distinct voice. She said, “My
16473: name is Sarah Stone. I am a widow, and keep a small shop licensed to
16474: sell tobacco, snuff, and tea in Church Lane, Stoniton. The prisoner at
16475: the bar is the same young woman who came, looking ill and tired, with a
16476: basket on her arm, and asked for a lodging at my house on Saturday
16477: evening, the 27th of February. She had taken the house for a public,
16478: because there was a figure against the door. And when I said I didn’t
16479: take in lodgers, the prisoner began to cry, and said she was too tired
16480: to go anywhere else, and she only wanted a bed for one night. And her
16481: prettiness, and her condition, and something respectable about her
16482: clothes and looks, and the trouble she seemed to be in made me as I
16483: couldn’t find in my heart to send her away at once. I asked her to sit
16484: down, and gave her some tea, and asked her where she was going, and
16485: where her friends were. She said she was going home to her friends:
16486: they were farming folks a good way off, and she’d had a long journey
16487: that had cost her more money than she expected, so as she’d hardly any
16488: money left in her pocket, and was afraid of going where it would cost
16489: her much. She had been obliged to sell most of the things out of her
16490: basket, but she’d thankfully give a shilling for a bed. I saw no reason
16491: why I shouldn’t take the young woman in for the night. I had only one
16492: room, but there were two beds in it, and I told her she might stay with
16493: me. I thought she’d been led wrong, and got into trouble, but if she
16494: was going to her friends, it would be a good work to keep her out of
16495: further harm.”
16496: 
16497: The witness then stated that in the night a child was born, and she
16498: identified the baby-clothes then shown to her as those in which she had
16499: herself dressed the child.
16500: 
16501: “Those are the clothes. I made them myself, and had kept them by me
16502: ever since my last child was born. I took a deal of trouble both for
16503: the child and the mother. I couldn’t help taking to the little thing
16504: and being anxious about it. I didn’t send for a doctor, for there
16505: seemed no need. I told the mother in the day-time she must tell me the
16506: name of her friends, and where they lived, and let me write to them.
16507: She said, by and by she would write herself, but not to-day. She would
16508: have no nay, but she would get up and be dressed, in spite of
16509: everything I could say. She said she felt quite strong enough; and it
16510: was wonderful what spirit she showed. But I wasn’t quite easy what I
16511: should do about her, and towards evening I made up my mind I’d go,
16512: after Meeting was over, and speak to our minister about it. I left the
16513: house about half-past eight o’clock. I didn’t go out at the shop door,
16514: but at the back door, which opens into a narrow alley. I’ve only got
16515: the ground-floor of the house, and the kitchen and bedroom both look
16516: into the alley. I left the prisoner sitting up by the fire in the
16517: kitchen with the baby on her lap. She hadn’t cried or seemed low at
16518: all, as she did the night before. I thought she had a strange look with
16519: her eyes, and she got a bit flushed towards evening. I was afraid of
16520: the fever, and I thought I’d call and ask an acquaintance of mine, an
16521: experienced woman, to come back with me when I went out. It was a very
16522: dark night. I didn’t fasten the door behind me; there was no lock; it
16523: was a latch with a bolt inside, and when there was nobody in the house
16524: I always went out at the shop door. But I thought there was no danger
16525: in leaving it unfastened that little while. I was longer than I meant
16526: to be, for I had to wait for the woman that came back with me. It was
16527: an hour and a half before we got back, and when we went in, the candle
16528: was standing burning just as I left it, but the prisoner and the baby
16529: were both gone. She’d taken her cloak and bonnet, but she’d left the
16530: basket and the things in it.... I was dreadful frightened, and angry
16531: with her for going. I didn’t go to give information, because I’d no
16532: thought she meant to do any harm, and I knew she had money in her
16533: pocket to buy her food and lodging. I didn’t like to set the constable
16534: after her, for she’d a right to go from me if she liked.”
16535: 
16536: The effect of this evidence on Adam was electrical; it gave him new
16537: force. Hetty could not be guilty of the crime—her heart must have clung
16538: to her baby—else why should she have taken it with her? She might have
16539: left it behind. The little creature had died naturally, and then she
16540: had hidden it. Babies were so liable to death—and there might be the
16541: strongest suspicions without any proof of guilt. His mind was so
16542: occupied with imaginary arguments against such suspicions, that he
16543: could not listen to the cross-examination by Hetty’s counsel, who
16544: tried, without result, to elicit evidence that the prisoner had shown
16545: some movements of maternal affection towards the child. The whole time
16546: this witness was being examined, Hetty had stood as motionless as
16547: before: no word seemed to arrest her ear. But the sound of the next
16548: witness’s voice touched a chord that was still sensitive, she gave a
16549: start and a frightened look towards him, but immediately turned away
16550: her head and looked down at her hands as before. This witness was a
16551: man, a rough peasant. He said:
16552: 
16553: “My name is John Olding. I am a labourer, and live at Tedd’s Hole, two
16554: miles out of Stoniton. A week last Monday, towards one o’clock in the
16555: afternoon, I was going towards Hetton Coppice, and about a quarter of a
16556: mile from the coppice I saw the prisoner, in a red cloak, sitting under
16557: a bit of a haystack not far off the stile. She got up when she saw me,
16558: and seemed as if she’d be walking on the other way. It was a regular
16559: road through the fields, and nothing very uncommon to see a young woman
16560: there, but I took notice of her because she looked white and scared. I
16561: should have thought she was a beggar-woman, only for her good clothes.
16562: I thought she looked a bit crazy, but it was no business of mine. I
16563: stood and looked back after her, but she went right on while she was in
16564: sight. I had to go to the other side of the coppice to look after some
16565: stakes. There’s a road right through it, and bits of openings here and
16566: there, where the trees have been cut down, and some of ’em not carried
16567: away. I didn’t go straight along the road, but turned off towards the
16568: middle, and took a shorter way towards the spot I wanted to get to. I
16569: hadn’t got far out of the road into one of the open places before I
16570: heard a strange cry. I thought it didn’t come from any animal I knew,
16571: but I wasn’t for stopping to look about just then. But it went on, and
16572: seemed so strange to me in that place, I couldn’t help stopping to
16573: look. I began to think I might make some money of it, if it was a new
16574: thing. But I had hard work to tell which way it came from, and for a
16575: good while I kept looking up at the boughs. And then I thought it came
16576: from the ground; and there was a lot of timber-choppings lying about,
16577: and loose pieces of turf, and a trunk or two. And I looked about among
16578: them, but could find nothing, and at last the cry stopped. So I was for
16579: giving it up, and I went on about my business. But when I came back the
16580: same way pretty nigh an hour after, I couldn’t help laying down my
16581: stakes to have another look. And just as I was stooping and laying down
16582: the stakes, I saw something odd and round and whitish lying on the
16583: ground under a nut-bush by the side of me. And I stooped down on hands
16584: and knees to pick it up. And I saw it was a little baby’s hand.”
16585: 
16586: At these words a thrill ran through the court. Hetty was visibly
16587: trembling; now, for the first time, she seemed to be listening to what
16588: a witness said.
16589: 
16590: “There was a lot of timber-choppings put together just where the ground
16591: went hollow, like, under the bush, and the hand came out from among
16592: them. But there was a hole left in one place and I could see down it
16593: and see the child’s head; and I made haste and did away the turf and
16594: the choppings, and took out the child. It had got comfortable clothes
16595: on, but its body was cold, and I thought it must be dead. I made haste
16596: back with it out of the wood, and took it home to my wife. She said it
16597: was dead, and I’d better take it to the parish and tell the constable.
16598: And I said, ‘I’ll lay my life it’s that young woman’s child as I met
16599: going to the coppice.’ But she seemed to be gone clean out of sight.
16600: And I took the child on to Hetton parish and told the constable, and we
16601: went on to Justice Hardy. And then we went looking after the young
16602: woman till dark at night, and we went and gave information at Stoniton,
16603: as they might stop her. And the next morning, another constable came to
16604: me, to go with him to the spot where I found the child. And when we got
16605: there, there was the prisoner a-sitting against the bush where I found
16606: the child; and she cried out when she saw us, but she never offered to
16607: move. She’d got a big piece of bread on her lap.”
16608: 
16609: Adam had given a faint groan of despair while this witness was
16610: speaking. He had hidden his face on his arm, which rested on the
16611: boarding in front of him. It was the supreme moment of his suffering:
16612: Hetty was guilty; and he was silently calling to God for help. He heard
16613: no more of the evidence, and was unconscious when the case for the
16614: prosecution had closed—unconscious that Mr. Irwine was in the
16615: witness-box, telling of Hetty’s unblemished character in her own parish
16616: and of the virtuous habits in which she had been brought up. This
16617: testimony could have no influence on the verdict, but it was given as
16618: part of that plea for mercy which her own counsel would have made if he
16619: had been allowed to speak for her—a favour not granted to criminals in
16620: those stern times.
16621: 
16622: At last Adam lifted up his head, for there was a general movement round
16623: him. The judge had addressed the jury, and they were retiring. The
16624: decisive moment was not far off. Adam felt a shuddering horror that
16625: would not let him look at Hetty, but she had long relapsed into her
16626: blank hard indifference. All eyes were strained to look at her, but she
16627: stood like a statue of dull despair.
16628: 
16629: There was a mingled rustling, whispering, and low buzzing throughout
16630: the court during this interval. The desire to listen was suspended, and
16631: every one had some feeling or opinion to express in undertones. Adam
16632: sat looking blankly before him, but he did not see the objects that
16633: were right in front of his eyes—the counsel and attorneys talking with
16634: an air of cool business, and Mr. Irwine in low earnest conversation
16635: with the judge—did not see Mr. Irwine sit down again in agitation and
16636: shake his head mournfully when somebody whispered to him. The inward
16637: action was too intense for Adam to take in outward objects until some
16638: strong sensation roused him.
16639: 
16640: It was not very long, hardly more than a quarter of an hour, before the
16641: knock which told that the jury had come to their decision fell as a
16642: signal for silence on every ear. It is sublime—that sudden pause of a
16643: great multitude which tells that one soul moves in them all. Deeper and
16644: deeper the silence seemed to become, like the deepening night, while
16645: the jurymen’s names were called over, and the prisoner was made to hold
16646: up her hand, and the jury were asked for their verdict.
16647: 
16648: “Guilty.”
16649: 
16650: It was the verdict every one expected, but there was a sigh of
16651: disappointment from some hearts that it was followed by no
16652: recommendation to mercy. Still the sympathy of the court was not with
16653: the prisoner. The unnaturalness of her crime stood out the more harshly
16654: by the side of her hard immovability and obstinate silence. Even the
16655: verdict, to distant eyes, had not appeared to move her, but those who
16656: were near saw her trembling.
16657: 
16658: The stillness was less intense until the judge put on his black cap,
16659: and the chaplain in his canonicals was observed behind him. Then it
16660: deepened again, before the crier had had time to command silence. If
16661: any sound were heard, it must have been the sound of beating hearts.
16662: The judge spoke, “Hester Sorrel....”
16663: 
16664: The blood rushed to Hetty’s face, and then fled back again as she
16665: looked up at the judge and kept her wide-open eyes fixed on him, as if
16666: fascinated by fear. Adam had not yet turned towards her, there was a
16667: deep horror, like a great gulf, between them. But at the words “and
16668: then to be hanged by the neck till you be dead,” a piercing shriek rang
16669: through the hall. It was Hetty’s shriek. Adam started to his feet and
16670: stretched out his arms towards her. But the arms could not reach her:
16671: she had fallen down in a fainting-fit, and was carried out of court.
16672: 
16673: 
16674: 
16675: 
16676: Chapter XLIV
16677: Arthur’s Return
16678: 
16679: 
16680: When Arthur Donnithorne landed at Liverpool and read the letter from
16681: his Aunt Lydia, briefly announcing his grand-father’s death, his first
16682: feeling was, “Poor Grandfather! I wish I could have got to him to be
16683: with him when he died. He might have felt or wished something at the
16684: last that I shall never know now. It was a lonely death.”
16685: 
16686: It is impossible to say that his grief was deeper than that. Pity and
16687: softened memory took place of the old antagonism, and in his busy
16688: thoughts about the future, as the chaise carried him rapidly along
16689: towards the home where he was now to be master, there was a continually
16690: recurring effort to remember anything by which he could show a regard
16691: for his grandfather’s wishes, without counteracting his own cherished
16692: aims for the good of the tenants and the estate. But it is not in human
16693: nature—only in human pretence—for a young man like Arthur, with a fine
16694: constitution and fine spirits, thinking well of himself, believing that
16695: others think well of him, and having a very ardent intention to give
16696: them more and more reason for that good opinion—it is not possible for
16697: such a young man, just coming into a splendid estate through the death
16698: of a very old man whom he was not fond of, to feel anything very
16699: different from exultant joy. _Now_ his real life was beginning; now he
16700: would have room and opportunity for action, and he would use them. He
16701: would show the Loamshire people what a fine country gentleman was; he
16702: would not exchange that career for any other under the sun. He felt
16703: himself riding over the hills in the breezy autumn days, looking after
16704: favourite plans of drainage and enclosure; then admired on sombre
16705: mornings as the best rider on the best horse in the hunt; spoken well
16706: of on market-days as a first-rate landlord; by and by making speeches
16707: at election dinners, and showing a wonderful knowledge of agriculture;
16708: the patron of new ploughs and drills, the severe upbraider of negligent
16709: landowners, and withal a jolly fellow that everybody must like—happy
16710: faces greeting him everywhere on his own estate, and the neighbouring
16711: families on the best terms with him. The Irwines should dine with him
16712: every week, and have their own carriage to come in, for in some very
16713: delicate way that Arthur would devise, the lay-impropriator of the
16714: Hayslope tithes would insist on paying a couple of hundreds more to the
16715: vicar; and his aunt should be as comfortable as possible, and go on
16716: living at the Chase, if she liked, in spite of her old-maidish ways—at
16717: least until he was married, and that event lay in the indistinct
16718: background, for Arthur had not yet seen the woman who would play the
16719: lady-wife to the first-rate country gentleman.
16720: 
16721: These were Arthur’s chief thoughts, so far as a man’s thoughts through
16722: hours of travelling can be compressed into a few sentences, which are
16723: only like the list of names telling you what are the scenes in a long
16724: long panorama full of colour, of detail, and of life. The happy faces
16725: Arthur saw greeting him were not pale abstractions, but real ruddy
16726: faces, long familiar to him: Martin Poyser was there—the whole Poyser
16727: family.
16728: 
16729: What—Hetty?
16730: 
16731: Yes; for Arthur was at ease about Hetty—not quite at ease about the
16732: past, for a certain burning of the ears would come whenever he thought
16733: of the scenes with Adam last August, but at ease about her present lot.
16734: Mr. Irwine, who had been a regular correspondent, telling him all the
16735: news about the old places and people, had sent him word nearly three
16736: months ago that Adam Bede was not to marry Mary Burge, as he had
16737: thought, but pretty Hetty Sorrel. Martin Poyser and Adam himself had
16738: both told Mr. Irwine all about it—that Adam had been deeply in love
16739: with Hetty these two years, and that now it was agreed they were to be
16740: married in March. That stalwart rogue Adam was more susceptible than
16741: the rector had thought; it was really quite an idyllic love affair; and
16742: if it had not been too long to tell in a letter, he would have liked to
16743: describe to Arthur the blushing looks and the simple strong words with
16744: which the fine honest fellow told his secret. He knew Arthur would like
16745: to hear that Adam had this sort of happiness in prospect.
16746: 
16747: Yes, indeed! Arthur felt there was not air enough in the room to
16748: satisfy his renovated life, when he had read that passage in the
16749: letter. He threw up the windows, he rushed out of doors into the
16750: December air, and greeted every one who spoke to him with an eager
16751: gaiety, as if there had been news of a fresh Nelson victory. For the
16752: first time that day since he had come to Windsor, he was in true boyish
16753: spirits. The load that had been pressing upon him was gone, the
16754: haunting fear had vanished. He thought he could conquer his bitterness
16755: towards Adam now—could offer him his hand, and ask to be his friend
16756: again, in spite of that painful memory which would still make his ears
16757: burn. He had been knocked down, and he had been forced to tell a lie:
16758: such things make a scar, do what we will. But if Adam were the same
16759: again as in the old days, Arthur wished to be the same too, and to have
16760: Adam mixed up with his business and his future, as he had always
16761: desired before the accursed meeting in August. Nay, he would do a great
16762: deal more for Adam than he should otherwise have done, when he came
16763: into the estate; Hetty’s husband had a special claim on him—Hetty
16764: herself should feel that any pain she had suffered through Arthur in
16765: the past was compensated to her a hundredfold. For really she could not
16766: have felt much, since she had so soon made up her mind to marry Adam.
16767: 
16768: You perceive clearly what sort of picture Adam and Hetty made in the
16769: panorama of Arthur’s thoughts on his journey homeward. It was March
16770: now; they were soon to be married: perhaps they were already married.
16771: And _now_ it was actually in his power to do a great deal for them.
16772: Sweet—sweet little Hetty! The little puss hadn’t cared for him half as
16773: much as he cared for her; for he was a great fool about her still—was
16774: almost afraid of seeing her—indeed, had not cared much to look at any
16775: other woman since he parted from her. That little figure coming towards
16776: him in the Grove, those dark-fringed childish eyes, the lovely lips put
16777: up to kiss him—that picture had got no fainter with the lapse of
16778: months. And she would look just the same. It was impossible to think
16779: how he could meet her: he should certainly tremble. Strange, how long
16780: this sort of influence lasts, for he was certainly not in love with
16781: Hetty now. He had been earnestly desiring, for months, that she should
16782: marry Adam, and there was nothing that contributed more to his
16783: happiness in these moments than the thought of their marriage. It was
16784: the exaggerating effect of imagination that made his heart still beat a
16785: little more quickly at the thought of her. When he saw the little thing
16786: again as she really was, as Adam’s wife, at work quite prosaically in
16787: her new home, he should perhaps wonder at the possibility of his past
16788: feelings. Thank heaven it had turned out so well! He should have plenty
16789: of affairs and interests to fill his life now, and not be in danger of
16790: playing the fool again.
16791: 
16792: Pleasant the crack of the post-boy’s whip! Pleasant the sense of being
16793: hurried along in swift ease through English scenes, so like those round
16794: his own home, only not quite so charming. Here was a market-town—very
16795: much like Treddleston—where the arms of the neighbouring lord of the
16796: manor were borne on the sign of the principal inn; then mere fields and
16797: hedges, their vicinity to a market-town carrying an agreeable
16798: suggestion of high rent, till the land began to assume a trimmer look,
16799: the woods were more frequent, and at length a white or red mansion
16800: looked down from a moderate eminence, or allowed him to be aware of its
16801: parapet and chimneys among the dense-looking masses of oaks and
16802: elms—masses reddened now with early buds. And close at hand came the
16803: village: the small church, with its red-tiled roof, looking humble even
16804: among the faded half-timbered houses; the old green gravestones with
16805: nettles round them; nothing fresh and bright but the children, opening
16806: round eyes at the swift post-chaise; nothing noisy and busy but the
16807: gaping curs of mysterious pedigree. What a much prettier village
16808: Hayslope was! And it should not be neglected like this place: vigorous
16809: repairs should go on everywhere among farm-buildings and cottages, and
16810: travellers in post-chaises, coming along the Rosseter road, should do
16811: nothing but admire as they went. And Adam Bede should superintend all
16812: the repairs, for he had a share in Burge’s business now, and, if he
16813: liked, Arthur would put some money into the concern and buy the old man
16814: out in another year or two. That was an ugly fault in Arthur’s life,
16815: that affair last summer, but the future should make amends. Many men
16816: would have retained a feeling of vindictiveness towards Adam, but _he_
16817: would not—he would resolutely overcome all littleness of that kind, for
16818: he had certainly been very much in the wrong; and though Adam had been
16819: harsh and violent, and had thrust on him a painful dilemma, the poor
16820: fellow was in love, and had real provocation. No, Arthur had not an
16821: evil feeling in his mind towards any human being: he was happy, and
16822: would make every one else happy that came within his reach.
16823: 
16824: And here was dear old Hayslope at last, sleeping, on the hill, like a
16825: quiet old place as it was, in the late afternoon sunlight, and opposite
16826: to it the great shoulders of the Binton Hills, below them the purplish
16827: blackness of the hanging woods, and at last the pale front of the
16828: Abbey, looking out from among the oaks of the Chase, as if anxious for
16829: the heir’s return. “Poor Grandfather! And he lies dead there. _He_ was
16830: a young fellow once, coming into the estate and making his plans. So
16831: the world goes round! Aunt Lydia must feel very desolate, poor thing;
16832: but she shall be indulged as much as she indulges her fat Fido.”
16833: 
16834: The wheels of Arthur’s chaise had been anxiously listened for at the
16835: Chase, for to-day was Friday, and the funeral had already been deferred
16836: two days. Before it drew up on the gravel of the courtyard, all the
16837: servants in the house were assembled to receive him with a grave,
16838: decent welcome, befitting a house of death. A month ago, perhaps, it
16839: would have been difficult for them to have maintained a suitable
16840: sadness in their faces, when Mr. Arthur was come to take possession;
16841: but the hearts of the head-servants were heavy that day for another
16842: cause than the death of the old squire, and more than one of them was
16843: longing to be twenty miles away, as Mr. Craig was, knowing what was to
16844: become of Hetty Sorrel—pretty Hetty Sorrel—whom they used to see every
16845: week. They had the partisanship of household servants who like their
16846: places, and were not inclined to go the full length of the severe
16847: indignation felt against him by the farming tenants, but rather to make
16848: excuses for him; nevertheless, the upper servants, who had been on
16849: terms of neighbourly intercourse with the Poysers for many years, could
16850: not help feeling that the longed-for event of the young squire’s coming
16851: into the estate had been robbed of all its pleasantness.
16852: 
16853: To Arthur it was nothing surprising that the servants looked grave and
16854: sad: he himself was very much touched on seeing them all again, and
16855: feeling that he was in a new relation to them. It was that sort of
16856: pathetic emotion which has more pleasure than pain in it—which is
16857: perhaps one of the most delicious of all states to a good-natured man,
16858: conscious of the power to satisfy his good nature. His heart swelled
16859: agreeably as he said, “Well, Mills, how is my aunt?”
16860: 
16861: But now Mr. Bygate, the lawyer, who had been in the house ever since
16862: the death, came forward to give deferential greetings and answer all
16863: questions, and Arthur walked with him towards the library, where his
16864: Aunt Lydia was expecting him. Aunt Lydia was the only person in the
16865: house who knew nothing about Hetty. Her sorrow as a maiden daughter was
16866: unmixed with any other thoughts than those of anxiety about funeral
16867: arrangements and her own future lot; and, after the manner of women,
16868: she mourned for the father who had made her life important, all the
16869: more because she had a secret sense that there was little mourning for
16870: him in other hearts.
16871: 
16872: But Arthur kissed her tearful face more tenderly than he had ever done
16873: in his life before.
16874: 
16875: “Dear Aunt,” he said affectionately, as he held her hand, “_your_ loss
16876: is the greatest of all, but you must tell me how to try and make it up
16877: to you all the rest of your life.”
16878: 
16879: “It was so sudden and so dreadful, Arthur,” poor Miss Lydia began,
16880: pouring out her little plaints, and Arthur sat down to listen with
16881: impatient patience. When a pause came, he said:
16882: 
16883: “Now, Aunt, I’ll leave you for a quarter of an hour just to go to my
16884: own room, and then I shall come and give full attention to everything.”
16885: 
16886: “My room is all ready for me, I suppose, Mills?” he said to the butler,
16887: who seemed to be lingering uneasily about the entrance-hall.
16888: 
16889: “Yes, sir, and there are letters for you; they are all laid on the
16890: writing-table in your dressing-room.”
16891: 
16892: On entering the small anteroom which was called a dressing-room, but
16893: which Arthur really used only to lounge and write in, he just cast his
16894: eyes on the writing-table, and saw that there were several letters and
16895: packets lying there; but he was in the uncomfortable dusty condition of
16896: a man who has had a long hurried journey, and he must really refresh
16897: himself by attending to his toilette a little, before he read his
16898: letters. Pym was there, making everything ready for him, and soon, with
16899: a delightful freshness about him, as if he were prepared to begin a new
16900: day, he went back into his dressing-room to open his letters. The level
16901: rays of the low afternoon sun entered directly at the window, and as
16902: Arthur seated himself in his velvet chair with their pleasant warmth
16903: upon him, he was conscious of that quiet well-being which perhaps you
16904: and I have felt on a sunny afternoon when, in our brightest youth and
16905: health, life has opened a new vista for us, and long to-morrows of
16906: activity have stretched before us like a lovely plain which there was
16907: no need for hurrying to look at, because it was all our own.
16908: 
16909: The top letter was placed with its address upwards: it was in Mr.
16910: Irwine’s handwriting, Arthur saw at once; and below the address was
16911: written, “To be delivered as soon as he arrives.” Nothing could have
16912: been less surprising to him than a letter from Mr. Irwine at that
16913: moment: of course, there was something he wished Arthur to know earlier
16914: than it was possible for them to see each other. At such a time as that
16915: it was quite natural that Irwine should have something pressing to say.
16916: Arthur broke the seal with an agreeable anticipation of soon seeing the
16917: writer.
16918: 
16919: _“I send this letter to meet you on your arrival, Arthur, because I may
16920: then be at Stoniton, whither I am called by the most painful duty it
16921: has ever been given me to perform, and it is right that you should know
16922: what I have to tell you without delay.
16923:     “I will not attempt to add by one word of reproach to the
16924:     retribution that is now falling on you: any other words that I
16925:     could write at this moment must be weak and unmeaning by the side
16926:     of those in which I must tell you the simple fact.
16927:     “Hetty Sorrel is in prison, and will be tried on Friday for the
16928:     crime of child-murder.”..._
16929: 
16930: 
16931: Arthur read no more. He started up from his chair and stood for a
16932: single minute with a sense of violent convulsion in his whole frame, as
16933: if the life were going out of him with horrible throbs; but the next
16934: minute he had rushed out of the room, still clutching the letter—he was
16935: hurrying along the corridor, and down the stairs into the hall. Mills
16936: was still there, but Arthur did not see him, as he passed like a hunted
16937: man across the hall and out along the gravel. The butler hurried out
16938: after him as fast as his elderly limbs could run: he guessed, he knew,
16939: where the young squire was going.
16940: 
16941: When Mills got to the stables, a horse was being saddled, and Arthur
16942: was forcing himself to read the remaining words of the letter. He
16943: thrust it into his pocket as the horse was led up to him, and at that
16944: moment caught sight of Mills’ anxious face in front of him.
16945: 
16946: “Tell them I’m gone—gone to Stoniton,” he said in a muffled tone of
16947: agitation—sprang into the saddle, and set off at a gallop.
16948: 
16949: 
16950: 
16951: 
16952: Chapter XLV
16953: In the Prison
16954: 
16955: 
16956: Near sunset that evening an elderly gentleman was standing with his
16957: back against the smaller entrance-door of Stoniton jail, saying a few
16958: last words to the departing chaplain. The chaplain walked away, but the
16959: elderly gentleman stood still, looking down on the pavement and
16960: stroking his chin with a ruminating air, when he was roused by a sweet
16961: clear woman’s voice, saying, “Can I get into the prison, if you
16962: please?”
16963: 
16964: He turned his head and looked fixedly at the speaker for a few moments
16965: without answering.
16966: 
16967: “I have seen you before,” he said at last. “Do you remember preaching
16968: on the village green at Hayslope in Loamshire?”
16969: 
16970: “Yes, sir, surely. Are you the gentleman that stayed to listen on
16971: horseback?”
16972: 
16973: “Yes. Why do you want to go into the prison?”
16974: 
16975: “I want to go to Hetty Sorrel, the young woman who has been condemned
16976: to death—and to stay with her, if I may be permitted. Have you power in
16977: the prison, sir?”
16978: 
16979: “Yes; I am a magistrate, and can get admittance for you. But did you
16980: know this criminal, Hetty Sorrel?”
16981: 
16982: “Yes, we are kin. My own aunt married her uncle, Martin Poyser. But I
16983: was away at Leeds, and didn’t know of this great trouble in time to get
16984: here before to-day. I entreat you, sir, for the love of our heavenly
16985: Father, to let me go to her and stay with her.”
16986: 
16987: “How did you know she was condemned to death, if you are only just come
16988: from Leeds?”
16989: 
16990: “I have seen my uncle since the trial, sir. He is gone back to his home
16991: now, and the poor sinner is forsaken of all. I beseech you to get leave
16992: for me to be with her.”
16993: 
16994: “What! Have you courage to stay all night in the prison? She is very
16995: sullen, and will scarcely make answer when she is spoken to.”
16996: 
16997: “Oh, sir, it may please God to open her heart still. Don’t let us
16998: delay.”
16999: 
17000: “Come, then,” said the elderly gentleman, ringing and gaining
17001: admission, “I know you have a key to unlock hearts.”
17002: 
17003: Dinah mechanically took off her bonnet and shawl as soon as they were
17004: within the prison court, from the habit she had of throwing them off
17005: when she preached or prayed, or visited the sick; and when they entered
17006: the jailer’s room, she laid them down on a chair unthinkingly. There
17007: was no agitation visible in her, but a deep concentrated calmness, as
17008: if, even when she was speaking, her soul was in prayer reposing on an
17009: unseen support.
17010: 
17011: After speaking to the jailer, the magistrate turned to her and said,
17012: “The turnkey will take you to the prisoner’s cell and leave you there
17013: for the night, if you desire it, but you can’t have a light during the
17014: night—it is contrary to rules. My name is Colonel Townley: if I can
17015: help you in anything, ask the jailer for my address and come to me. I
17016: take some interest in this Hetty Sorrel, for the sake of that fine
17017: fellow, Adam Bede. I happened to see him at Hayslope the same evening I
17018: heard you preach, and recognized him in court to-day, ill as he
17019: looked.”
17020: 
17021: “Ah, sir, can you tell me anything about him? Can you tell me where he
17022: lodges? For my poor uncle was too much weighed down with trouble to
17023: remember.”
17024: 
17025: “Close by here. I inquired all about him of Mr. Irwine. He lodges over
17026: a tinman’s shop, in the street on the right hand as you entered the
17027: prison. There is an old school-master with him. Now, good-bye: I wish
17028: you success.”
17029: 
17030: “Farewell, sir. I am grateful to you.”
17031: 
17032: As Dinah crossed the prison court with the turnkey, the solemn evening
17033: light seemed to make the walls higher than they were by day, and the
17034: sweet pale face in the cap was more than ever like a white flower on
17035: this background of gloom. The turnkey looked askance at her all the
17036: while, but never spoke. He somehow felt that the sound of his own rude
17037: voice would be grating just then. He struck a light as they entered the
17038: dark corridor leading to the condemned cell, and then said in his most
17039: civil tone, “It’ll be pretty nigh dark in the cell a’ready, but I can
17040: stop with my light a bit, if you like.”
17041: 
17042: “Nay, friend, thank you,” said Dinah. “I wish to go in alone.”
17043: 
17044: “As you like,” said the jailer, turning the harsh key in the lock and
17045: opening the door wide enough to admit Dinah. A jet of light from his
17046: lantern fell on the opposite corner of the cell, where Hetty was
17047: sitting on her straw pallet with her face buried in her knees. It
17048: seemed as if she were asleep, and yet the grating of the lock would
17049: have been likely to waken her.
17050: 
17051: The door closed again, and the only light in the cell was that of the
17052: evening sky, through the small high grating—enough to discern human
17053: faces by. Dinah stood still for a minute, hesitating to speak because
17054: Hetty might be asleep, and looking at the motionless heap with a
17055: yearning heart. Then she said, softly, “Hetty!”
17056: 
17057: There was a slight movement perceptible in Hetty’s frame—a start such
17058: as might have been produced by a feeble electrical shock—but she did
17059: not look up. Dinah spoke again, in a tone made stronger by
17060: irrepressible emotion, “Hetty... it’s Dinah.”
17061: 
17062: Again there was a slight startled movement through Hetty’s frame, and
17063: without uncovering her face, she raised her head a little, as if
17064: listening.
17065: 
17066: “Hetty... Dinah is come to you.”
17067: 
17068: After a moment’s pause, Hetty lifted her head slowly and timidly from
17069: her knees and raised her eyes. The two pale faces were looking at each
17070: other: one with a wild hard despair in it, the other full of sad
17071: yearning love. Dinah unconsciously opened her arms and stretched them
17072: out.
17073: 
17074: “Don’t you know me, Hetty? Don’t you remember Dinah? Did you think I
17075: wouldn’t come to you in trouble?”
17076: 
17077: Hetty kept her eyes fixed on Dinah’s face—at first like an animal that
17078: gazes, and gazes, and keeps aloof.
17079: 
17080: “I’m come to be with you, Hetty—not to leave you—to stay with you—to be
17081: your sister to the last.”
17082: 
17083: Slowly, while Dinah was speaking, Hetty rose, took a step forward, and
17084: was clasped in Dinah’s arms.
17085: 
17086: They stood so a long while, for neither of them felt the impulse to
17087: move apart again. Hetty, without any distinct thought of it, hung on
17088: this something that was come to clasp her now, while she was sinking
17089: helpless in a dark gulf; and Dinah felt a deep joy in the first sign
17090: that her love was welcomed by the wretched lost one. The light got
17091: fainter as they stood, and when at last they sat down on the straw
17092: pallet together, their faces had become indistinct.
17093: 
17094: Not a word was spoken. Dinah waited, hoping for a spontaneous word from
17095: Hetty, but she sat in the same dull despair, only clutching the hand
17096: that held hers and leaning her cheek against Dinah’s. It was the human
17097: contact she clung to, but she was not the less sinking into the dark
17098: gulf.
17099: 
17100: Dinah began to doubt whether Hetty was conscious who it was that sat
17101: beside her. She thought suffering and fear might have driven the poor
17102: sinner out of her mind. But it was borne in upon her, as she afterwards
17103: said, that she must not hurry God’s work: we are overhasty to speak—as
17104: if God did not manifest himself by our silent feeling, and make his
17105: love felt through ours. She did not know how long they sat in that way,
17106: but it got darker and darker, till there was only a pale patch of light
17107: on the opposite wall: all the rest was darkness. But she felt the
17108: Divine presence more and more—nay, as if she herself were a part of it,
17109: and it was the Divine pity that was beating in her heart and was
17110: willing the rescue of this helpless one. At last she was prompted to
17111: speak and find out how far Hetty was conscious of the present.
17112: 
17113: “Hetty,” she said gently, “do you know who it is that sits by your
17114: side?”
17115: 
17116: “Yes,” Hetty answered slowly, “it’s Dinah.”
17117: 
17118: “And do you remember the time when we were at the Hall Farm together,
17119: and that night when I told you to be sure and think of me as a friend
17120: in trouble?”
17121: 
17122: “Yes,” said Hetty. Then, after a pause, she added, “But you can do
17123: nothing for me. You can’t make ’em do anything. They’ll hang me o’
17124: Monday—it’s Friday now.”
17125: 
17126: As Hetty said the last words, she clung closer to Dinah, shuddering.
17127: 
17128: “No, Hetty, I can’t save you from that death. But isn’t the suffering
17129: less hard when you have somebody with you, that feels for you—that you
17130: can speak to, and say what’s in your heart?... Yes, Hetty: you lean on
17131: me: you are glad to have me with you.”
17132: 
17133: “You won’t leave me, Dinah? You’ll keep close to me?”
17134: 
17135: “No, Hetty, I won’t leave you. I’ll stay with you to the last.... But,
17136: Hetty, there is some one else in this cell besides me, some one close
17137: to you.”
17138: 
17139: Hetty said, in a frightened whisper, “Who?”
17140: 
17141: “Some one who has been with you through all your hours of sin and
17142: trouble—who has known every thought you have had—has seen where you
17143: went, where you lay down and rose up again, and all the deeds you have
17144: tried to hide in darkness. And on Monday, when I can’t follow you—when
17145: my arms can’t reach you—when death has parted us—He who is with us now,
17146: and knows all, will be with you then. It makes no difference—whether we
17147: live or die, we are in the presence of God.”
17148: 
17149: “Oh, Dinah, won’t nobody do anything for me? _Will_ they hang me for
17150: certain?... I wouldn’t mind if they’d let me live.”
17151: 
17152: “My poor Hetty, death is very dreadful to you. I know it’s dreadful.
17153: But if you had a friend to take care of you after death—in that other
17154: world—some one whose love is greater than mine—who can do
17155: everything?... If God our Father was your friend, and was willing to
17156: save you from sin and suffering, so as you should neither know wicked
17157: feelings nor pain again? If you could believe he loved you and would
17158: help you, as you believe I love you and will help you, it wouldn’t be
17159: so hard to die on Monday, would it?”
17160: 
17161: “But I can’t know anything about it,” Hetty said, with sullen sadness.
17162: 
17163: “Because, Hetty, you are shutting up your soul against him, by trying
17164: to hide the truth. God’s love and mercy can overcome all things—our
17165: ignorance, and weakness, and all the burden of our past wickedness—all
17166: things but our wilful sin, sin that we cling to, and will not give up.
17167: You believe in my love and pity for you, Hetty, but if you had not let
17168: me come near you, if you wouldn’t have looked at me or spoken to me,
17169: you’d have shut me out from helping you. I couldn’t have made you feel
17170: my love; I couldn’t have told you what I felt for you. Don’t shut God’s
17171: love out in that way, by clinging to sin.... He can’t bless you while
17172: you have one falsehood in your soul; his pardoning mercy can’t reach
17173: you until you open your heart to him, and say, ‘I have done this great
17174: wickedness; O God, save me, make me pure from sin.’ While you cling to
17175: one sin and will not part with it, it must drag you down to misery
17176: after death, as it has dragged you to misery here in this world, my
17177: poor, poor Hetty. It is sin that brings dread, and darkness, and
17178: despair: there is light and blessedness for us as soon as we cast it
17179: off. God enters our souls then, and teaches us, and brings us strength
17180: and peace. Cast it off now, Hetty—now: confess the wickedness you have
17181: done—the sin you have been guilty of against your Heavenly Father. Let
17182: us kneel down together, for we are in the presence of God.”
17183: 
17184: Hetty obeyed Dinah’s movement, and sank on her knees. They still held
17185: each other’s hands, and there was long silence. Then Dinah said,
17186: “Hetty, we are before God. He is waiting for you to tell the truth.”
17187: 
17188: Still there was silence. At last Hetty spoke, in a tone of beseeching—
17189: 
17190: “Dinah... help me... I can’t feel anything like you...my heart is
17191: hard.”
17192: 
17193: Dinah held the clinging hand, and all her soul went forth in her voice:
17194: 
17195: “Jesus, thou present Saviour! Thou hast known the depths of all sorrow:
17196: thou hast entered that black darkness where God is not, and hast
17197: uttered the cry of the forsaken. Come Lord, and gather of the fruits of
17198: thy travail and thy pleading. Stretch forth thy hand, thou who art
17199: mighty to save to the uttermost, and rescue this lost one. She is
17200: clothed round with thick darkness. The fetters of her sin are upon her,
17201: and she cannot stir to come to thee. She can only feel her heart is
17202: hard, and she is helpless. She cries to me, thy weak creature....
17203: Saviour! It is a blind cry to thee. Hear it! Pierce the darkness! Look
17204: upon her with thy face of love and sorrow that thou didst turn on him
17205: who denied thee, and melt her hard heart.
17206: 
17207: “See, Lord, I bring her, as they of old brought the sick and helpless,
17208: and thou didst heal them. I bear her on my arms and carry her before
17209: thee. Fear and trembling have taken hold on her, but she trembles only
17210: at the pain and death of the body. Breathe upon her thy life-giving
17211: Spirit, and put a new fear within her—the fear of her sin. Make her
17212: dread to keep the accursed thing within her soul. Make her feel the
17213: presence of the living God, who beholds all the past, to whom the
17214: darkness is as noonday; who is waiting now, at the eleventh hour, for
17215: her to turn to him, and confess her sin, and cry for mercy—now, before
17216: the night of death comes, and the moment of pardon is for ever fled,
17217: like yesterday that returneth not.
17218: 
17219: “Saviour! It is yet time—time to snatch this poor soul from everlasting
17220: darkness. I believe—I believe in thy infinite love. What is _my_ love
17221: or _my_ pleading? It is quenched in thine. I can only clasp her in my
17222: weak arms and urge her with my weak pity. Thou—thou wilt breathe on the
17223: dead soul, and it shall arise from the unanswering sleep of death.
17224: 
17225: “Yea, Lord, I see thee, coming through the darkness, coming, like the
17226: morning, with healing on thy wings. The marks of thy agony are upon
17227: thee—I see, I see thou art able and willing to save—thou wilt not let
17228: her perish for ever. Come, mighty Saviour! Let the dead hear thy voice.
17229: Let the eyes of the blind be opened. Let her see that God encompasses
17230: her. Let her tremble at nothing but at the sin that cuts her off from
17231: him. Melt the hard heart. Unseal the closed lips: make her cry with her
17232: whole soul, ‘Father, I have sinned.’...”
17233: 
17234: “Dinah,” Hetty sobbed out, throwing her arms round Dinah’s neck, “I
17235: will speak... I will tell... I won’t hide it any more.”
17236: 
17237: But the tears and sobs were too violent. Dinah raised her gently from
17238: her knees and seated her on the pallet again, sitting down by her side.
17239: It was a long time before the convulsed throat was quiet, and even then
17240: they sat some time in stillness and darkness, holding each other’s
17241: hands. At last Hetty whispered, “I did do it, Dinah... I buried it in
17242: the wood... the little baby... and it cried... I heard it cry... ever
17243: such a way off... all night... and I went back because it cried.”
17244: 
17245: She paused, and then spoke hurriedly in a louder, pleading tone.
17246: 
17247: “But I thought perhaps it wouldn’t die—there might somebody find it. I
17248: didn’t kill it—I didn’t kill it myself. I put it down there and covered
17249: it up, and when I came back it was gone.... It was because I was so
17250: very miserable, Dinah... I didn’t know where to go... and I tried to
17251: kill myself before, and I couldn’t. Oh, I tried so to drown myself in
17252: the pool, and I couldn’t. I went to Windsor—I ran away—did you know? I
17253: went to find him, as he might take care of me; and he was gone; and
17254: then I didn’t know what to do. I daredn’t go back home again—I couldn’t
17255: bear it. I couldn’t have bore to look at anybody, for they’d have
17256: scorned me. I thought o’ you sometimes, and thought I’d come to you,
17257: for I didn’t think you’d be cross with me, and cry shame on me. I
17258: thought I could tell you. But then the other folks ’ud come to know it
17259: at last, and I couldn’t bear that. It was partly thinking o’ you made
17260: me come toward Stoniton; and, besides, I was so frightened at going
17261: wandering about till I was a beggar-woman, and had nothing; and
17262: sometimes it seemed as if I must go back to the farm sooner than that.
17263: Oh, it was so dreadful, Dinah... I was so miserable... I wished I’d
17264: never been born into this world. I should never like to go into the
17265: green fields again—I hated ’em so in my misery.”
17266: 
17267: Hetty paused again, as if the sense of the past were too strong upon
17268: her for words.
17269: 
17270: “And then I got to Stoniton, and I began to feel frightened that night,
17271: because I was so near home. And then the little baby was born, when I
17272: didn’t expect it; and the thought came into my mind that I might get
17273: rid of it and go home again. The thought came all of a sudden, as I was
17274: lying in the bed, and it got stronger and stronger... I longed so to go
17275: back again... I couldn’t bear being so lonely and coming to beg for
17276: want. And it gave me strength and resolution to get up and dress
17277: myself. I felt I must do it... I didn’t know how... I thought I’d find
17278: a pool, if I could, like that other, in the corner of the field, in the
17279: dark. And when the woman went out, I felt as if I was strong enough to
17280: do anything... I thought I should get rid of all my misery, and go back
17281: home, and never let ’em know why I ran away. I put on my bonnet and
17282: shawl, and went out into the dark street, with the baby under my cloak;
17283: and I walked fast till I got into a street a good way off, and there
17284: was a public, and I got some warm stuff to drink and some bread. And I
17285: walked on and on, and I hardly felt the ground I trod on; and it got
17286: lighter, for there came the moon—oh, Dinah, it frightened me when it
17287: first looked at me out o’ the clouds—it never looked so before; and I
17288: turned out of the road into the fields, for I was afraid o’ meeting
17289: anybody with the moon shining on me. And I came to a haystack, where I
17290: thought I could lie down and keep myself warm all night. There was a
17291: place cut into it, where I could make me a bed, and I lay comfortable,
17292: and the baby was warm against me; and I must have gone to sleep for a
17293: good while, for when I woke it was morning, but not very light, and the
17294: baby was crying. And I saw a wood a little way off... I thought there’d
17295: perhaps be a ditch or a pond there... and it was so early I thought I
17296: could hide the child there, and get a long way off before folks was up.
17297: And then I thought I’d go home—I’d get rides in carts and go home and
17298: tell ’em I’d been to try and see for a place, and couldn’t get one. I
17299: longed so for it, Dinah, I longed so to be safe at home. I don’t know
17300: how I felt about the baby. I seemed to hate it—it was like a heavy
17301: weight hanging round my neck; and yet its crying went through me, and I
17302: daredn’t look at its little hands and face. But I went on to the wood,
17303: and I walked about, but there was no water....”
17304: 
17305: Hetty shuddered. She was silent for some moments, and when she began
17306: again, it was in a whisper.
17307: 
17308: “I came to a place where there was lots of chips and turf, and I sat
17309: down on the trunk of a tree to think what I should do. And all of a
17310: sudden I saw a hole under the nut-tree, like a little grave. And it
17311: darted into me like lightning—I’d lay the baby there and cover it with
17312: the grass and the chips. I couldn’t kill it any other way. And I’d done
17313: it in a minute; and, oh, it cried so, Dinah—I _couldn’t_ cover it quite
17314: up—I thought perhaps somebody ’ud come and take care of it, and then it
17315: wouldn’t die. And I made haste out of the wood, but I could hear it
17316: crying all the while; and when I got out into the fields, it was as if
17317: I was held fast—I couldn’t go away, for all I wanted so to go. And I
17318: sat against the haystack to watch if anybody ’ud come. I was very
17319: hungry, and I’d only a bit of bread left, but I couldn’t go away. And
17320: after ever such a while—hours and hours—the man came—him in a
17321: smock-frock, and he looked at me so, I was frightened, and I made haste
17322: and went on. I thought he was going to the wood and would perhaps find
17323: the baby. And I went right on, till I came to a village, a long way off
17324: from the wood, and I was very sick, and faint, and hungry. I got
17325: something to eat there, and bought a loaf. But I was frightened to
17326: stay. I heard the baby crying, and thought the other folks heard it
17327: too—and I went on. But I was so tired, and it was getting towards dark.
17328: And at last, by the roadside there was a barn—ever such a way off any
17329: house—like the barn in Abbot’s Close, and I thought I could go in there
17330: and hide myself among the hay and straw, and nobody ’ud be likely to
17331: come. I went in, and it was half full o’ trusses of straw, and there
17332: was some hay too. And I made myself a bed, ever so far behind, where
17333: nobody could find me; and I was so tired and weak, I went to sleep....
17334: But oh, the baby’s crying kept waking me, and I thought that man as
17335: looked at me so was come and laying hold of me. But I must have slept a
17336: long while at last, though I didn’t know, for when I got up and went
17337: out of the barn, I didn’t know whether it was night or morning. But it
17338: was morning, for it kept getting lighter, and I turned back the way I’d
17339: come. I couldn’t help it, Dinah; it was the baby’s crying made me
17340: go—and yet I was frightened to death. I thought that man in the
17341: smock-frock ’ud see me and know I put the baby there. But I went on,
17342: for all that. I’d left off thinking about going home—it had gone out o’
17343: my mind. I saw nothing but that place in the wood where I’d buried the
17344: baby... I see it now. Oh Dinah! shall I allays see it?”
17345: 
17346: Hetty clung round Dinah and shuddered again. The silence seemed long
17347: before she went on.
17348: 
17349: “I met nobody, for it was very early, and I got into the wood.... I
17350: knew the way to the place... the place against the nut-tree; and I
17351: could hear it crying at every step.... I thought it was alive.... I
17352: don’t know whether I was frightened or glad... I don’t know what I
17353: felt. I only know I was in the wood and heard the cry. I don’t know
17354: what I felt till I saw the baby was gone. And when I’d put it there, I
17355: thought I should like somebody to find it and save it from dying; but
17356: when I saw it was gone, I was struck like a stone, with fear. I never
17357: thought o’ stirring, I felt so weak. I knew I couldn’t run away, and
17358: everybody as saw me ’ud know about the baby. My heart went like a
17359: stone. I couldn’t wish or try for anything; it seemed like as if I
17360: should stay there for ever, and nothing ’ud ever change. But they came
17361: and took me away.”
17362: 
17363: Hetty was silent, but she shuddered again, as if there was still
17364: something behind; and Dinah waited, for her heart was so full that
17365: tears must come before words. At last Hetty burst out, with a sob,
17366: “Dinah, do you think God will take away that crying and the place in
17367: the wood, now I’ve told everything?”
17368: 
17369: “Let us pray, poor sinner. Let us fall on our knees again, and pray to
17370: the God of all mercy.”
17371: 
17372: 
17373: 
17374: 
17375: Chapter XLVI
17376: The Hours of Suspense
17377: 
17378: 
17379: On Sunday morning, when the church bells in Stoniton were ringing for
17380: morning service, Bartle Massey re-entered Adam’s room, after a short
17381: absence, and said, “Adam, here’s a visitor wants to see you.”
17382: 
17383: Adam was seated with his back towards the door, but he started up and
17384: turned round instantly, with a flushed face and an eager look. His face
17385: was even thinner and more worn than we have seen it before, but he was
17386: washed and shaven this Sunday morning.
17387: 
17388: “Is it any news?” he said.
17389: 
17390: “Keep yourself quiet, my lad,” said Bartle; “keep quiet. It’s not what
17391: you’re thinking of. It’s the young Methodist woman come from the
17392: prison. She’s at the bottom o’ the stairs, and wants to know if you
17393: think well to see her, for she has something to say to you about that
17394: poor castaway; but she wouldn’t come in without your leave, she said.
17395: She thought you’d perhaps like to go out and speak to her. These
17396: preaching women are not so back’ard commonly,” Bartle muttered to
17397: himself.
17398: 
17399: “Ask her to come in,” said Adam.
17400: 
17401: He was standing with his face towards the door, and as Dinah entered,
17402: lifting up her mild grey eyes towards him, she saw at once the great
17403: change that had come since the day when she had looked up at the tall
17404: man in the cottage. There was a trembling in her clear voice as she put
17405: her hand into his and said, “Be comforted, Adam Bede, the Lord has not
17406: forsaken her.”
17407: 
17408: “Bless you for coming to her,” Adam said. “Mr. Massey brought me word
17409: yesterday as you was come.”
17410: 
17411: They could neither of them say any more just yet, but stood before each
17412: other in silence; and Bartle Massey, too, who had put on his
17413: spectacles, seemed transfixed, examining Dinah’s face. But he recovered
17414: himself first, and said, “Sit down, young woman, sit down,” placing the
17415: chair for her and retiring to his old seat on the bed.
17416: 
17417: “Thank you, friend; I won’t sit down,” said Dinah, “for I must hasten
17418: back. She entreated me not to stay long away. What I came for, Adam
17419: Bede, was to pray you to go and see the poor sinner and bid her
17420: farewell. She desires to ask your forgiveness, and it is meet you
17421: should see her to-day, rather than in the early morning, when the time
17422: will be short.”
17423: 
17424: Adam stood trembling, and at last sank down on his chair again.
17425: 
17426: “It won’t be,” he said, “it’ll be put off—there’ll perhaps come a
17427: pardon. Mr. Irwine said there was hope. He said, I needn’t quite give
17428: it up.”
17429: 
17430: “That’s a blessed thought to me,” said Dinah, her eyes filling with
17431: tears. “It’s a fearful thing hurrying her soul away so fast.”
17432: 
17433: “But let what will be,” she added presently. “You will surely come, and
17434: let her speak the words that are in her heart. Although her poor soul
17435: is very dark and discerns little beyond the things of the flesh, she is
17436: no longer hard. She is contrite, she has confessed all to me. The pride
17437: of her heart has given way, and she leans on me for help and desires to
17438: be taught. This fills me with trust, for I cannot but think that the
17439: brethren sometimes err in measuring the Divine love by the sinner’s
17440: knowledge. She is going to write a letter to the friends at the Hall
17441: Farm for me to give them when she is gone, and when I told her you were
17442: here, she said, ‘I should like to say good-bye to Adam and ask him to
17443: forgive me.’ You will come, Adam? Perhaps you will even now come back
17444: with me.”
17445: 
17446: “I can’t,” Adam said. “I can’t say good-bye while there’s any hope. I’m
17447: listening, and listening—I can’t think o’ nothing but that. It can’t be
17448: as she’ll die that shameful death—I can’t bring my mind to it.”
17449: 
17450: He got up from his chair again and looked away out of the window, while
17451: Dinah stood with compassionate patience. In a minute or two he turned
17452: round and said,
17453: 
17454: “I _will_ come, Dinah... to-morrow morning... if it must be. I may have
17455: more strength to bear it, if I know it _must_ be. Tell her, I forgive
17456: her; tell her I will come—at the very last.”
17457: 
17458: “I will not urge you against the voice of your own heart,” said Dinah.
17459: “I must hasten back to her, for it is wonderful how she clings now, and
17460: was not willing to let me out of her sight. She used never to make any
17461: return to my affection before, but now tribulation has opened her
17462: heart. Farewell, Adam. Our heavenly Father comfort you and strengthen
17463: you to bear all things.” Dinah put out her hand, and Adam pressed it in
17464: silence.
17465: 
17466: Bartle Massey was getting up to lift the stiff latch of the door for
17467: her, but before he could reach it, she had said gently, “Farewell,
17468: friend,” and was gone, with her light step down the stairs.
17469: 
17470: “Well,” said Bartle, taking off his spectacles and putting them into
17471: his pocket, “if there must be women to make trouble in the world, it’s
17472: but fair there should be women to be comforters under it; and she’s
17473: one—she’s one. It’s a pity she’s a Methodist; but there’s no getting a
17474: woman without some foolishness or other.”
17475: 
17476: Adam never went to bed that night. The excitement of suspense,
17477: heightening with every hour that brought him nearer the fatal moment,
17478: was too great, and in spite of his entreaties, in spite of his promises
17479: that he would be perfectly quiet, the schoolmaster watched too.
17480: 
17481: “What does it matter to me, lad?” Bartle said: “a night’s sleep more or
17482: less? I shall sleep long enough, by and by, underground. Let me keep
17483: thee company in trouble while I can.”
17484: 
17485: It was a long and dreary night in that small chamber. Adam would
17486: sometimes get up and tread backwards and forwards along the short space
17487: from wall to wall; then he would sit down and hide his face, and no
17488: sound would be heard but the ticking of the watch on the table, or the
17489: falling of a cinder from the fire which the schoolmaster carefully
17490: tended. Sometimes he would burst out into vehement speech,
17491: 
17492: “If I could ha’ done anything to save her—if my bearing anything would
17493: ha’ done any good... but t’ have to sit still, and know it, and do
17494: nothing... it’s hard for a man to bear... and to think o’ what might
17495: ha’ been now, if it hadn’t been for _him_.... O God, it’s the very day
17496: we should ha’ been married.”
17497: 
17498: “Aye, my lad,” said Bartle tenderly, “it’s heavy—it’s heavy. But you
17499: must remember this: when you thought of marrying her, you’d a notion
17500: she’d got another sort of a nature inside her. You didn’t think she
17501: could have got hardened in that little while to do what she’s done.”
17502: 
17503: “I know—I know that,” said Adam. “I thought she was loving and
17504: tender-hearted, and wouldn’t tell a lie, or act deceitful. How could I
17505: think any other way? And if he’d never come near her, and I’d married
17506: her, and been loving to her, and took care of her, she might never ha’
17507: done anything bad. What would it ha’ signified—my having a bit o’
17508: trouble with her? It ’ud ha’ been nothing to this.”
17509: 
17510: “There’s no knowing, my lad—there’s no knowing what might have come.
17511: The smart’s bad for you to bear now: you must have time—you must have
17512: time. But I’ve that opinion of you, that you’ll rise above it all and
17513: be a man again, and there may good come out of this that we don’t see.”
17514: 
17515: “Good come out of it!” said Adam passionately. “That doesn’t alter th’
17516: evil: _her_ ruin can’t be undone. I hate that talk o’ people, as if
17517: there was a way o’ making amends for everything. They’d more need be
17518: brought to see as the wrong they do can never be altered. When a man’s
17519: spoiled his fellow-creatur’s life, he’s no right to comfort himself
17520: with thinking good may come out of it. Somebody else’s good doesn’t
17521: alter her shame and misery.”
17522: 
17523: “Well, lad, well,” said Bartle, in a gentle tone, strangely in contrast
17524: with his usual peremptoriness and impatience of contradiction, “it’s
17525: likely enough I talk foolishness. I’m an old fellow, and it’s a good
17526: many years since I was in trouble myself. It’s easy finding reasons why
17527: other folks should be patient.”
17528: 
17529: “Mr. Massey,” said Adam penitently, “I’m very hot and hasty. I owe you
17530: something different; but you mustn’t take it ill of me.”
17531: 
17532: “Not I, lad—not I.”
17533: 
17534: So the night wore on in agitation till the chill dawn and the growing
17535: light brought the tremulous quiet that comes on the brink of despair.
17536: There would soon be no more suspense.
17537: 
17538: “Let us go to the prison now, Mr. Massey,” said Adam, when he saw the
17539: hand of his watch at six. “If there’s any news come, we shall hear
17540: about it.”
17541: 
17542: The people were astir already, moving rapidly, in one direction,
17543: through the streets. Adam tried not to think where they were going, as
17544: they hurried past him in that short space between his lodging and the
17545: prison gates. He was thankful when the gates shut him in from seeing
17546: those eager people.
17547: 
17548: No; there was no news come—no pardon—no reprieve.
17549: 
17550: Adam lingered in the court half an hour before he could bring himself
17551: to send word to Dinah that he was come. But a voice caught his ear: he
17552: could not shut out the words.
17553: 
17554: “The cart is to set off at half-past seven.”
17555: 
17556: It must be said—the last good-bye: there was no help.
17557: 
17558: In ten minutes from that time, Adam was at the door of the cell. Dinah
17559: had sent him word that she could not come to him; she could not leave
17560: Hetty one moment; but Hetty was prepared for the meeting.
17561: 
17562: He could not see her when he entered, for agitation deadened his
17563: senses, and the dim cell was almost dark to him. He stood a moment
17564: after the door closed behind him, trembling and stupefied.
17565: 
17566: But he began to see through the dimness—to see the dark eyes lifted up
17567: to him once more, but with no smile in them. O God, how sad they
17568: looked! The last time they had met his was when he parted from her with
17569: his heart full of joyous hopeful love, and they looked out with a
17570: tearful smile from a pink, dimpled, childish face. The face was marble
17571: now; the sweet lips were pallid and half-open and quivering; the
17572: dimples were all gone—all but one, that never went; and the eyes—O, the
17573: worst of all was the likeness they had to Hetty’s. They were Hetty’s
17574: eyes looking at him with that mournful gaze, as if she had come back to
17575: him from the dead to tell him of her misery.
17576: 
17577: She was clinging close to Dinah; her cheek was against Dinah’s. It
17578: seemed as if her last faint strength and hope lay in that contact, and
17579: the pitying love that shone out from Dinah’s face looked like a visible
17580: pledge of the Invisible Mercy.
17581: 
17582: When the sad eyes met—when Hetty and Adam looked at each other—she felt
17583: the change in him too, and it seemed to strike her with fresh fear. It
17584: was the first time she had seen any being whose face seemed to reflect
17585: the change in herself: Adam was a new image of the dreadful past and
17586: the dreadful present. She trembled more as she looked at him.
17587: 
17588: “Speak to him, Hetty,” Dinah said; “tell him what is in your heart.”
17589: 
17590: Hetty obeyed her, like a little child.
17591: 
17592: “Adam... I’m very sorry... I behaved very wrong to you... will you
17593: forgive me... before I die?”
17594: 
17595: Adam answered with a half-sob, “Yes, I forgive thee Hetty. I forgave
17596: thee long ago.”
17597: 
17598: It had seemed to Adam as if his brain would burst with the anguish of
17599: meeting Hetty’s eyes in the first moments, but the sound of her voice
17600: uttering these penitent words touched a chord which had been less
17601: strained. There was a sense of relief from what was becoming
17602: unbearable, and the rare tears came—they had never come before, since
17603: he had hung on Seth’s neck in the beginning of his sorrow.
17604: 
17605: Hetty made an involuntary movement towards him, some of the love that
17606: she had once lived in the midst of was come near her again. She kept
17607: hold of Dinah’s hand, but she went up to Adam and said timidly, “Will
17608: you kiss me again, Adam, for all I’ve been so wicked?”
17609: 
17610: Adam took the blanched wasted hand she put out to him, and they gave
17611: each other the solemn unspeakable kiss of a lifelong parting.
17612: 
17613: “And tell him,” Hetty said, in rather a stronger voice, “tell him...
17614: for there’s nobody else to tell him... as I went after him and couldn’t
17615: find him... and I hated him and cursed him once... but Dinah says I
17616: should forgive him... and I try... for else God won’t forgive me.”
17617: 
17618: There was a noise at the door of the cell now—the key was being turned
17619: in the lock, and when the door opened, Adam saw indistinctly that there
17620: were several faces there. He was too agitated to see more—even to see
17621: that Mr. Irwine’s face was one of them. He felt that the last
17622: preparations were beginning, and he could stay no longer. Room was
17623: silently made for him to depart, and he went to his chamber in
17624: loneliness, leaving Bartle Massey to watch and see the end.

17629: Chapter XLVII
17630: The Last Moment
17631: 
17632: 
17633: It was a sight that some people remembered better even than their own
17634: sorrows—the sight in that grey clear morning, when the fatal cart with
17635: the two young women in it was descried by the waiting watching
17636: multitude, cleaving its way towards the hideous symbol of a
17637: deliberately inflicted sudden death.
17638: 
17639: All Stoniton had heard of Dinah Morris, the young Methodist woman who
17640: had brought the obstinate criminal to confess, and there was as much
17641: eagerness to see her as to see the wretched Hetty.
17642: 
17643: But Dinah was hardly conscious of the multitude. When Hetty had caught
17644: sight of the vast crowd in the distance, she had clutched Dinah
17645: convulsively.
17646: 
17647: “Close your eyes, Hetty,” Dinah said, “and let us pray without ceasing
17648: to God.”
17649: 
17650: And in a low voice, as the cart went slowly along through the midst of
17651: the gazing crowd, she poured forth her soul with the wrestling
17652: intensity of a last pleading, for the trembling creature that clung to
17653: her and clutched her as the only visible sign of love and pity.
17654: 
17655: Dinah did not know that the crowd was silent, gazing at her with a sort
17656: of awe—she did not even know how near they were to the fatal spot, when
17657: the cart stopped, and she shrank appalled at a loud shout hideous to
17658: her ear, like a vast yell of demons. Hetty’s shriek mingled with the
17659: sound, and they clasped each other in mutual horror.
17660: 
17661: But it was not a shout of execration—not a yell of exultant cruelty.
17662: 
17663: It was a shout of sudden excitement at the appearance of a horseman
17664: cleaving the crowd at full gallop. The horse is hot and distressed, but
17665: answers to the desperate spurring; the rider looks as if his eyes were
17666: glazed by madness, and he saw nothing but what was unseen by others.
17667: See, he has something in his hand—he is holding it up as if it were a
17668: signal.
17669: 
17670: The Sheriff knows him: it is Arthur Donnithorne, carrying in his hand a
17671: hard-won release from death.

17674: 
17675: 
17676: Chapter XLVIII
17677: Another Meeting in the Wood
17678: 
17679: 
17680: The next day, at evening, two men were walking from opposite points
17681: towards the same scene, drawn thither by a common memory. The scene was
17682: the Grove by Donnithorne Chase: you know who the men were.
17683: 
17684: The old squire’s funeral had taken place that morning, the will had
17685: been read, and now in the first breathing-space, Arthur Donnithorne had
17686: come out for a lonely walk, that he might look fixedly at the new
17687: future before him and confirm himself in a sad resolution. He thought
17688: he could do that best in the Grove.
17689: 
17690: Adam too had come from Stoniton on Monday evening, and to-day he had
17691: not left home, except to go to the family at the Hall Farm and tell
17692: them everything that Mr. Irwine had left untold. He had agreed with the
17693: Poysers that he would follow them to their new neighbourhood, wherever
17694: that might be, for he meant to give up the management of the woods,
17695: and, as soon as it was practicable, he would wind up his business with
17696: Jonathan Burge and settle with his mother and Seth in a home within
17697: reach of the friends to whom he felt bound by a mutual sorrow.
17698: 
17699: “Seth and me are sure to find work,” he said. “A man that’s got our
17700: trade at his finger-ends is at home everywhere; and we must make a new
17701: start. My mother won’t stand in the way, for she’s told me, since I
17702: came home, she’d made up her mind to being buried in another parish, if
17703: I wished it, and if I’d be more comfortable elsewhere. It’s wonderful
17704: how quiet she’s been ever since I came back. It seems as if the very
17705: greatness o’ the trouble had quieted and calmed her. We shall all be
17706: better in a new country, though there’s some I shall be loath to leave
17707: behind. But I won’t part from you and yours, if I can help it, Mr.
17708: Poyser. Trouble’s made us kin.”
17709: 
17710: “Aye, lad,” said Martin. “We’ll go out o’ hearing o’ that man’s name.
17711: But I doubt we shall ne’er go far enough for folks not to find out as
17712: we’ve got them belonging to us as are transported o’er the seas, and
17713: were like to be hanged. We shall have that flyin’ up in our faces, and
17714: our children’s after us.”
17715: 
17716: That was a long visit to the Hall Farm, and drew too strongly on Adam’s
17717: energies for him to think of seeing others, or re-entering on his old
17718: occupations till the morrow. “But to-morrow,” he said to himself, “I’ll
17719: go to work again. I shall learn to like it again some time, maybe; and
17720: it’s right whether I like it or not.”
17721: 
17722: This evening was the last he would allow to be absorbed by sorrow:
17723: suspense was gone now, and he must bear the unalterable. He was
17724: resolved not to see Arthur Donnithorne again, if it were possible to
17725: avoid him. He had no message to deliver from Hetty now, for Hetty had
17726: seen Arthur. And Adam distrusted himself—he had learned to dread the
17727: violence of his own feeling. That word of Mr. Irwine’s—that he must
17728: remember what he had felt after giving the last blow to Arthur in the
17729: Grove—had remained with him.
17730: 
17731: These thoughts about Arthur, like all thoughts that are charged with
17732: strong feeling, were continually recurring, and they always called up
17733: the image of the Grove—of that spot under the overarching boughs where
17734: he had caught sight of the two bending figures, and had been possessed
17735: by sudden rage.
17736: 
17737: “I’ll go and see it again to-night for the last time,” he said; “it’ll
17738: do me good; it’ll make me feel over again what I felt when I’d knocked
17739: him down. I felt what poor empty work it was, as soon as I’d done it,
17740: _before_ I began to think he might be dead.”
17741: 
17742: In this way it happened that Arthur and Adam were walking towards the
17743: same spot at the same time.
17744: 
17745: Adam had on his working-dress again, now, for he had thrown off the
17746: other with a sense of relief as soon as he came home; and if he had had
17747: the basket of tools over his shoulder, he might have been taken, with
17748: his pale wasted face, for the spectre of the Adam Bede who entered the
17749: Grove on that August evening eight months ago. But he had no basket of
17750: tools, and he was not walking with the old erectness, looking keenly
17751: round him; his hands were thrust in his side pockets, and his eyes
17752: rested chiefly on the ground. He had not long entered the Grove, and
17753: now he paused before a beech. He knew that tree well; it was the
17754: boundary mark of his youth—the sign, to him, of the time when some of
17755: his earliest, strongest feelings had left him. He felt sure they would
17756: never return. And yet, at this moment, there was a stirring of
17757: affection at the remembrance of that Arthur Donnithorne whom he had
17758: believed in before he had come up to this beech eight months ago. It
17759: was affection for the dead: _that_ Arthur existed no longer.
17760: 
17761: He was disturbed by the sound of approaching footsteps, but the beech
17762: stood at a turning in the road, and he could not see who was coming
17763: until the tall slim figure in deep mourning suddenly stood before him
17764: at only two yards’ distance. They both started, and looked at each
17765: other in silence. Often, in the last fortnight, Adam had imagined
17766: himself as close to Arthur as this, assailing him with words that
17767: should be as harrowing as the voice of remorse, forcing upon him a just
17768: share in the misery he had caused; and often, too, he had told himself
17769: that such a meeting had better not be. But in imagining the meeting he
17770: had always seen Arthur, as he had met him on that evening in the Grove,
17771: florid, careless, light of speech; and the figure before him touched
17772: him with the signs of suffering. Adam knew what suffering was—he could
17773: not lay a cruel finger on a bruised man. He felt no impulse that he
17774: needed to resist. Silence was more just than reproach. Arthur was the
17775: first to speak.
17776: 
17777: “Adam,” he said, quietly, “it may be a good thing that we have met
17778: here, for I wished to see you. I should have asked to see you
17779: to-morrow.”
17780: 
17781: He paused, but Adam said nothing.
17782: 
17783: “I know it is painful to you to meet me,” Arthur went on, “but it is
17784: not likely to happen again for years to come.”
17785: 
17786: “No, sir,” said Adam, coldly, “that was what I meant to write to you
17787: to-morrow, as it would be better all dealings should be at an end
17788: between us, and somebody else put in my place.”
17789: 
17790: Arthur felt the answer keenly, and it was not without an effort that he
17791: spoke again.
17792: 
17793: “It was partly on that subject I wished to speak to you. I don’t want
17794: to lessen your indignation against me, or ask you to do anything for my
17795: sake. I only wish to ask you if you will help me to lessen the evil
17796: consequences of the past, which is unchangeable. I don’t mean
17797: consequences to myself, but to others. It is but little I can do, I
17798: know. I know the worst consequences will remain; but something may be
17799: done, and you can help me. Will you listen to me patiently?”
17800: 
17801: “Yes, sir,” said Adam, after some hesitation; “I’ll hear what it is. If
17802: I can help to mend anything, I will. Anger ’ull mend nothing, I know.
17803: We’ve had enough o’ that.”
17804: 
17805: “I was going to the Hermitage,” said Arthur. “Will you go there with me
17806: and sit down? We can talk better there.”
17807: 
17808: The Hermitage had never been entered since they left it together, for
17809: Arthur had locked up the key in his desk. And now, when he opened the
17810: door, there was the candle burnt out in the socket; there was the chair
17811: in the same place where Adam remembered sitting; there was the
17812: waste-paper basket full of scraps, and deep down in it, Arthur felt in
17813: an instant, there was the little pink silk handkerchief. It would have
17814: been painful to enter this place if their previous thoughts had been
17815: less painful.
17816: 
17817: They sat down opposite each other in the old places, and Arthur said,
17818: “I’m going away, Adam; I’m going into the army.”
17819: 
17820: Poor Arthur felt that Adam ought to be affected by this
17821: announcement—ought to have a movement of sympathy towards him. But
17822: Adam’s lips remained firmly closed, and the expression of his face
17823: unchanged.
17824: 
17825: “What I want to say to you,” Arthur continued, “is this: one of my
17826: reasons for going away is that no one else may leave Hayslope—may leave
17827: their home on my account. I would do anything, there is no sacrifice I
17828: would not make, to prevent any further injury to others through
17829: my—through what has happened.”
17830: 
17831: Arthur’s words had precisely the opposite effect to that he had
17832: anticipated. Adam thought he perceived in them that notion of
17833: compensation for irretrievable wrong, that self-soothing attempt to
17834: make evil bear the same fruits as good, which most of all roused his
17835: indignation. He was as strongly impelled to look painful facts right in
17836: the face as Arthur was to turn away his eyes from them. Moreover, he
17837: had the wakeful suspicious pride of a poor man in the presence of a
17838: rich man. He felt his old severity returning as he said, “The time’s
17839: past for that, sir. A man should make sacrifices to keep clear of doing
17840: a wrong; sacrifices won’t undo it when it’s done. When people’s
17841: feelings have got a deadly wound, they can’t be cured with favours.”
17842: 
17843: “Favours!” said Arthur, passionately; “no; how can you suppose I meant
17844: that? But the Poysers—Mr. Irwine tells me the Poysers mean to leave the
17845: place where they have lived so many years—for generations. Don’t you
17846: see, as Mr. Irwine does, that if they could be persuaded to overcome
17847: the feeling that drives them away, it would be much better for them in
17848: the end to remain on the old spot, among the friends and neighbours who
17849: know them?”
17850: 
17851: “That’s true,” said Adam coldly. “But then, sir, folks’s feelings are
17852: not so easily overcome. It’ll be hard for Martin Poyser to go to a
17853: strange place, among strange faces, when he’s been bred up on the Hall
17854: Farm, and his father before him; but then it ’ud be harder for a man
17855: with his feelings to stay. I don’t see how the thing’s to be made any
17856: other than hard. There’s a sort o’ damage, sir, that can’t be made up
17857: for.”
17858: 
17859: Arthur was silent some moments. In spite of other feelings dominant in
17860: him this evening, his pride winced under Adam’s mode of treating him.
17861: Wasn’t he himself suffering? Was not he too obliged to renounce his
17862: most cherished hopes? It was now as it had been eight months ago—Adam
17863: was forcing Arthur to feel more intensely the irrevocableness of his
17864: own wrong-doing. He was presenting the sort of resistance that was the
17865: most irritating to Arthur’s eager ardent nature. But his anger was
17866: subdued by the same influence that had subdued Adam’s when they first
17867: confronted each other—by the marks of suffering in a long familiar
17868: face. The momentary struggle ended in the feeling that he could bear a
17869: great deal from Adam, to whom he had been the occasion of bearing so
17870: much; but there was a touch of pleading, boyish vexation in his tone as
17871: he said, “But people may make injuries worse by unreasonable conduct—by
17872: giving way to anger and satisfying that for the moment, instead of
17873: thinking what will be the effect in the future.
17874: 
17875: “If I were going to stay here and act as landlord,” he added presently,
17876: with still more eagerness—“if I were careless about what I’ve done—what
17877: I’ve been the cause of, you would have some excuse, Adam, for going
17878: away and encouraging others to go. You would have some excuse then for
17879: trying to make the evil worse. But when I tell you I’m going away for
17880: years—when you know what that means for me, how it cuts off every plan
17881: of happiness I’ve ever formed—it is impossible for a sensible man like
17882: you to believe that there is any real ground for the Poysers refusing
17883: to remain. I know their feeling about disgrace—Mr. Irwine has told me
17884: all; but he is of opinion that they might be persuaded out of this idea
17885: that they are disgraced in the eyes of their neighbours, and that they
17886: can’t remain on my estate, if you would join him in his efforts—if you
17887: would stay yourself and go on managing the old woods.”
17888: 
17889: Arthur paused a moment and then added, pleadingly, “You know that’s a
17890: good work to do for the sake of other people, besides the owner. And
17891: you don’t know but that they may have a better owner soon, whom you
17892: will like to work for. If I die, my cousin Tradgett will have the
17893: estate and take my name. He is a good fellow.”
17894: 
17895: Adam could not help being moved: it was impossible for him not to feel
17896: that this was the voice of the honest warm-hearted Arthur whom he had
17897: loved and been proud of in old days; but nearer memories would not be
17898: thrust away. He was silent; yet Arthur saw an answer in his face that
17899: induced him to go on, with growing earnestness.
17900: 
17901: “And then, if you would talk to the Poysers—if you would talk the
17902: matter over with Mr. Irwine—he means to see you to-morrow—and then if
17903: you would join your arguments to his to prevail on them not to go.... I
17904: know, of course, that they would not accept any favour from me—I mean
17905: nothing of that kind—but I’m sure they would suffer less in the end.
17906: Irwine thinks so too. And Mr. Irwine is to have the chief authority on
17907: the estate—he has consented to undertake that. They will really be
17908: under no man but one whom they respect and like. It would be the same
17909: with you, Adam, and it could be nothing but a desire to give me worse
17910: pain that could incline you to go.”
17911: 
17912: Arthur was silent again for a little while, and then said, with some
17913: agitation in his voice, “I wouldn’t act so towards you, I know. If you
17914: were in my place and I in yours, I should try to help you to do the
17915: best.”
17916: 
17917: Adam made a hasty movement on his chair and looked on the ground.
17918: Arthur went on, “Perhaps you’ve never done anything you’ve had bitterly
17919: to repent of in your life, Adam; if you had, you would be more
17920: generous. You would know then that it’s worse for me than for you.”
17921: 
17922: Arthur rose from his seat with the last words, and went to one of the
17923: windows, looking out and turning his back on Adam, as he continued,
17924: passionately,
17925: 
17926: “Haven’t _I_ loved her too? Didn’t I see her yesterday? Shan’t I carry
17927: the thought of her about with me as much as you will? And don’t you
17928: think you would suffer more if you’d been in fault?”
17929: 
17930: There was silence for several minutes, for the struggle in Adam’s mind
17931: was not easily decided. Facile natures, whose emotions have little
17932: permanence, can hardly understand how much inward resistance he
17933: overcame before he rose from his seat and turned towards Arthur. Arthur
17934: heard the movement, and turning round, met the sad but softened look
17935: with which Adam said,
17936: 
17937: “It’s true what you say, sir. I’m hard—it’s in my nature. I was too
17938: hard with my father, for doing wrong. I’ve been a bit hard t’ everybody
17939: but _her_. I felt as if nobody pitied her enough—her suffering cut into
17940: me so; and when I thought the folks at the farm were too hard with her,
17941: I said I’d never be hard to anybody myself again. But feeling overmuch
17942: about her has perhaps made me unfair to you. I’ve known what it is in
17943: my life to repent and feel it’s too late. I felt I’d been too harsh to
17944: my father when he was gone from me—I feel it now, when I think of him.
17945: I’ve no right to be hard towards them as have done wrong and repent.”
17946: 
17947: Adam spoke these words with the firm distinctness of a man who is
17948: resolved to leave nothing unsaid that he is bound to say; but he went
17949: on with more hesitation.
17950: 
17951: “I wouldn’t shake hands with you once, sir, when you asked me—but if
17952: you’re willing to do it now, for all I refused then...”
17953: 
17954: Arthur’s white hand was in Adam’s large grasp in an instant, and with
17955: that action there was a strong rush, on both sides, of the old, boyish
17956: affection.
17957: 
17958: “Adam,” Arthur said, impelled to full confession now, “it would never
17959: have happened if I’d known you loved her. That would have helped to
17960: save me from it. And I _did_ struggle: I never meant to injure her. I
17961: deceived you afterwards—and that led on to worse; but I thought it was
17962: forced upon me, I thought it was the best thing I could do. And in that
17963: letter I told her to let me know if she were in any trouble: don’t
17964: think I would not have done everything I could. But I was all wrong
17965: from the very first, and horrible wrong has come of it. God knows, I’d
17966: give my life if I could undo it.”
17967: 
17968: They sat down again opposite each other, and Adam said, tremulously,
17969: “How did she seem when you left her, sir?”
17970: 
17971: “Don’t ask me, Adam,” Arthur said; “I feel sometimes as if I should go
17972: mad with thinking of her looks and what she said to me, and then, that
17973: I couldn’t get a full pardon—that I couldn’t save her from that
17974: wretched fate of being transported—that I can do nothing for her all
17975: those years; and she may die under it, and never know comfort any
17976: more.”
17977: 
17978: “Ah, sir,” said Adam, for the first time feeling his own pain merged in
17979: sympathy for Arthur, “you and me’ll often be thinking o’ the same
17980: thing, when we’re a long way off one another. I’ll pray God to help
17981: you, as I pray him to help me.”
17982: 
17983: “But there’s that sweet woman—that Dinah Morris,” Arthur said, pursuing
17984: his own thoughts and not knowing what had been the sense of Adam’s
17985: words, “she says she shall stay with her to the very last moment—till
17986: she goes; and the poor thing clings to her as if she found some comfort
17987: in her. I could worship that woman; I don’t know what I should do if
17988: she were not there. Adam, you will see her when she comes back. I could
17989: say nothing to her yesterday—nothing of what I felt towards her. Tell
17990: her,” Arthur went on hurriedly, as if he wanted to hide the emotion
17991: with which he spoke, while he took off his chain and watch, “tell her I
17992: asked you to give her this in remembrance of me—of the man to whom she
17993: is the one source of comfort, when he thinks of... I know she doesn’t
17994: care about such things—or anything else I can give her for its own
17995: sake. But she will use the watch—I shall like to think of her using
17996: it.”
17997: 
17998: “I’ll give it to her, sir,” Adam said, “and tell her your words. She
17999: told me she should come back to the people at the Hall Farm.”
18000: 
18001: “And you _will_ persuade the Poysers to stay, Adam?” said Arthur,
18002: reminded of the subject which both of them had forgotten in the first
18003: interchange of revived friendship. “You _will_ stay yourself, and help
18004: Mr. Irwine to carry out the repairs and improvements on the estate?”
18005: 
18006: “There’s one thing, sir, that perhaps you don’t take account of,” said
18007: Adam, with hesitating gentleness, “and that was what made me hang back
18008: longer. You see, it’s the same with both me and the Poysers: if we
18009: stay, it’s for our own worldly interest, and it looks as if we’d put up
18010: with anything for the sake o’ that. I know that’s what they’ll feel,
18011: and I can’t help feeling a little of it myself. When folks have got an
18012: honourable independent spirit, they don’t like to do anything that
18013: might make ’em seem base-minded.”
18014: 
18015: “But no one who knows you will think that, Adam. That is not a reason
18016: strong enough against a course that is really more generous, more
18017: unselfish than the other. And it will be known—it shall be made known,
18018: that both you and the Poysers stayed at my entreaty. Adam, don’t try to
18019: make things worse for me; I’m punished enough without that.”
18020: 
18021: “No, sir, no,” Adam said, looking at Arthur with mournful affection.
18022: “God forbid I should make things worse for you. I used to wish I could
18023: do it, in my passion—but that was when I thought you didn’t feel
18024: enough. I’ll stay, sir, I’ll do the best I can. It’s all I’ve got to
18025: think of now—to do my work well and make the world a bit better place
18026: for them as can enjoy it.”
18027: 
18028: “Then we’ll part now, Adam. You will see Mr. Irwine to-morrow, and
18029: consult with him about everything.”
18030: 
18031: “Are you going soon, sir?” said Adam.
18032: 
18033: “As soon as possible—after I’ve made the necessary arrangements.
18034: Good-bye, Adam. I shall think of you going about the old place.”
18035: 
18036: “Good-bye, sir. God bless you.”
18037: 
18038: The hands were clasped once more, and Adam left the Hermitage, feeling
18039: that sorrow was more bearable now hatred was gone.
18040: 
18041: As soon as the door was closed behind him, Arthur went to the
18042: waste-paper basket and took out the little pink silk handkerchief.

18052: Chapter XLIX
18053: At the Hall Farm
18054: 
18055: 
18056: The first autumnal afternoon sunshine of 1801—more than eighteen months
18057: after that parting of Adam and Arthur in the Hermitage—was on the yard
18058: at the Hall Farm; and the bull-dog was in one of his most excited
18059: moments, for it was that hour of the day when the cows were being
18060: driven into the yard for their afternoon milking. No wonder the patient
18061: beasts ran confusedly into the wrong places, for the alarming din of
18062: the bull-dog was mingled with more distant sounds which the timid
18063: feminine creatures, with pardonable superstition, imagined also to have
18064: some relation to their own movements—with the tremendous crack of the
18065: waggoner’s whip, the roar of his voice, and the booming thunder of the
18066: waggon, as it left the rick-yard empty of its golden load.
18067: 
18068: The milking of the cows was a sight Mrs. Poyser loved, and at this hour
18069: on mild days she was usually standing at the house door, with her
18070: knitting in her hands, in quiet contemplation, only heightened to a
18071: keener interest when the vicious yellow cow, who had once kicked over a
18072: pailful of precious milk, was about to undergo the preventive
18073: punishment of having her hinder-legs strapped.
18074: 
18075: To-day, however, Mrs. Poyser gave but a divided attention to the
18076: arrival of the cows, for she was in eager discussion with Dinah, who
18077: was stitching Mr. Poyser’s shirt-collars, and had borne patiently to
18078: have her thread broken three times by Totty pulling at her arm with a
18079: sudden insistence that she should look at “Baby,” that is, at a large
18080: wooden doll with no legs and a long skirt, whose bald head Totty,
18081: seated in her small chair at Dinah’s side, was caressing and pressing
18082: to her fat cheek with much fervour. Totty is larger by more than two
18083: years’ growth than when you first saw her, and she has on a black frock
18084: under her pinafore. Mrs. Poyser too has on a black gown, which seems to
18085: heighten the family likeness between her and Dinah. In other respects
18086: there is little outward change now discernible in our old friends, or
18087: in the pleasant house-place, bright with polished oak and pewter.
18088: 
18089: “I never saw the like to you, Dinah,” Mrs. Poyser was saying, “when
18090: you’ve once took anything into your head: there’s no more moving you
18091: than the rooted tree. You may say what you like, but I don’t believe
18092: _that’s_ religion; for what’s the Sermon on the Mount about, as you’re
18093: so fond o’ reading to the boys, but doing what other folks ’ud have you
18094: do? But if it was anything unreasonable they wanted you to do, like
18095: taking your cloak off and giving it to ’em, or letting ’em slap you i’
18096: the face, I daresay you’d be ready enough. It’s only when one ’ud have
18097: you do what’s plain common sense and good for yourself, as you’re
18098: obstinate th’ other way.”
18099: 
18100: “Nay, dear Aunt,” said Dinah, smiling slightly as she went on with her
18101: work, “I’m sure your wish ’ud be a reason for me to do anything that I
18102: didn’t feel it was wrong to do.”
18103: 
18104: “Wrong! You drive me past bearing. What is there wrong, I should like
18105: to know, i’ staying along wi’ your own friends, as are th’ happier for
18106: having you with ’em an’ are willing to provide for you, even if your
18107: work didn’t more nor pay ’em for the bit o’ sparrow’s victual y’ eat
18108: and the bit o’ rag you put on? An’ who is it, I should like to know, as
18109: you’re bound t’ help and comfort i’ the world more nor your own flesh
18110: and blood—an’ me th’ only aunt you’ve got above-ground, an’ am brought
18111: to the brink o’ the grave welly every winter as comes, an’ there’s the
18112: child as sits beside you ’ull break her little heart when you go, an’
18113: the grandfather not been dead a twelvemonth, an’ your uncle ’ull miss
18114: you so as never was—a-lighting his pipe an’ waiting on him, an’ now I
18115: can trust you wi’ the butter, an’ have had all the trouble o’ teaching
18116: you, and there’s all the sewing to be done, an’ I must have a strange
18117: gell out o’ Treddles’on to do it—an’ all because you must go back to
18118: that bare heap o’ stones as the very crows fly over an’ won’t stop at.”
18119: 
18120: “Dear Aunt Rachel,” said Dinah, looking up in Mrs. Poyser’s face, “it’s
18121: your kindness makes you say I’m useful to you. You don’t really want me
18122: now, for Nancy and Molly are clever at their work, and you’re in good
18123: health now, by the blessing of God, and my uncle is of a cheerful
18124: countenance again, and you have neighbours and friends not a few—some
18125: of them come to sit with my uncle almost daily. Indeed, you will not
18126: miss me; and at Snowfield there are brethren and sisters in great need,
18127: who have none of those comforts you have around you. I feel that I am
18128: called back to those amongst whom my lot was first cast. I feel drawn
18129: again towards the hills where I used to be blessed in carrying the word
18130: of life to the sinful and desolate.”
18131: 
18132: “You feel! Yes,” said Mrs. Poyser, returning from a parenthetic glance
18133: at the cows, “that’s allays the reason I’m to sit down wi’, when you’ve
18134: a mind to do anything contrairy. What do you want to be preaching for
18135: more than you’re preaching now? Don’t you go off, the Lord knows where,
18136: every Sunday a-preaching and praying? An’ haven’t you got Methodists
18137: enow at Treddles’on to go and look at, if church-folks’s faces are too
18138: handsome to please you? An’ isn’t there them i’ this parish as you’ve
18139: got under hand, and they’re like enough to make friends wi’ Old Harry
18140: again as soon as your back’s turned? There’s that Bessy Cranage—she’ll
18141: be flaunting i’ new finery three weeks after you’re gone, I’ll be
18142: bound. She’ll no more go on in her new ways without you than a dog ’ull
18143: stand on its hind-legs when there’s nobody looking. But I suppose it
18144: doesna matter so much about folks’s souls i’ this country, else you’d
18145: be for staying with your own aunt, for she’s none so good but what you
18146: might help her to be better.”
18147: 
18148: There was a certain something in Mrs. Poyser’s voice just then, which
18149: she did not wish to be noticed, so she turned round hastily to look at
18150: the clock, and said: “See there! It’s tea-time; an’ if Martin’s i’ the
18151: rick-yard, he’ll like a cup. Here, Totty, my chicken, let mother put
18152: your bonnet on, and then you go out into the rick-yard and see if
18153: Father’s there, and tell him he mustn’t go away again without coming t’
18154: have a cup o’ tea; and tell your brothers to come in too.”
18155: 
18156: Totty trotted off in her flapping bonnet, while Mrs. Poyser set out the
18157: bright oak table and reached down the tea-cups.
18158: 
18159: “You talk o’ them gells Nancy and Molly being clever i’ their work,”
18160: she began again; “it’s fine talking. They’re all the same, clever or
18161: stupid—one can’t trust ’em out o’ one’s sight a minute. They want
18162: somebody’s eye on ’em constant if they’re to be kept to their work. An’
18163: suppose I’m ill again this winter, as I was the winter before last?
18164: Who’s to look after ’em then, if you’re gone? An’ there’s that blessed
18165: child—something’s sure t’ happen to her—they’ll let her tumble into the
18166: fire, or get at the kettle wi’ the boiling lard in’t, or some mischief
18167: as ’ull lame her for life; an’ it’ll be all your fault, Dinah.”
18168: 
18169: “Aunt,” said Dinah, “I promise to come back to you in the winter if
18170: you’re ill. Don’t think I will ever stay away from you if you’re in
18171: real want of me. But, indeed, it is needful for my own soul that I
18172: should go away from this life of ease and luxury in which I have all
18173: things too richly to enjoy—at least that I should go away for a short
18174: space. No one can know but myself what are my inward needs, and the
18175: besetments I am most in danger from. Your wish for me to stay is not a
18176: call of duty which I refuse to hearken to because it is against my own
18177: desires; it is a temptation that I must resist, lest the love of the
18178: creature should become like a mist in my soul shutting out the heavenly
18179: light.”
18180: 
18181: “It passes my cunning to know what you mean by ease and luxury,” said
18182: Mrs. Poyser, as she cut the bread and butter. “It’s true there’s good
18183: victual enough about you, as nobody shall ever say I don’t provide
18184: enough and to spare, but if there’s ever a bit o’ odds an’ ends as
18185: nobody else ’ud eat, you’re sure to pick it out... but look there!
18186: There’s Adam Bede a-carrying the little un in. I wonder how it is he’s
18187: come so early.”
18188: 
18189: Mrs. Poyser hastened to the door for the pleasure of looking at her
18190: darling in a new position, with love in her eyes but reproof on her
18191: tongue.
18192: 
18193: “Oh for shame, Totty! Little gells o’ five year old should be ashamed
18194: to be carried. Why, Adam, she’ll break your arm, such a big gell as
18195: that; set her down—for shame!”
18196: 
18197: “Nay, nay,” said Adam, “I can lift her with my hand—I’ve no need to
18198: take my arm to it.”
18199: 
18200: Totty, looking as serenely unconscious of remark as a fat white puppy,
18201: was set down at the door-place, and the mother enforced her reproof
18202: with a shower of kisses.
18203: 
18204: “You’re surprised to see me at this hour o’ the day,” said Adam.
18205: 
18206: “Yes, but come in,” said Mrs. Poyser, making way for him; “there’s no
18207: bad news, I hope?”
18208: 
18209: “No, nothing bad,” Adam answered, as he went up to Dinah and put out
18210: his hand to her. She had laid down her work and stood up,
18211: instinctively, as he approached her. A faint blush died away from her
18212: pale cheek as she put her hand in his and looked up at him timidly.
18213: 
18214: “It’s an errand to you brought me, Dinah,” said Adam, apparently
18215: unconscious that he was holding her hand all the while; “mother’s a bit
18216: ailing, and she’s set her heart on your coming to stay the night with
18217: her, if you’ll be so kind. I told her I’d call and ask you as I came
18218: from the village. She overworks herself, and I can’t persuade her to
18219: have a little girl t’ help her. I don’t know what’s to be done.”
18220: 
18221: Adam released Dinah’s hand as he ceased speaking, and was expecting an
18222: answer, but before she had opened her lips Mrs. Poyser said, “Look
18223: there now! I told you there was folks enow t’ help i’ this parish,
18224: wi’out going further off. There’s Mrs. Bede getting as old and cas’alty
18225: as can be, and she won’t let anybody but you go a-nigh her hardly. The
18226: folks at Snowfield have learnt by this time to do better wi’out you nor
18227: she can.”
18228: 
18229: “I’ll put my bonnet on and set off directly, if you don’t want anything
18230: done first, Aunt,” said Dinah, folding up her work.
18231: 
18232: “Yes, I do want something done. I want you t’ have your tea, child;
18233: it’s all ready—and you’ll have a cup, Adam, if y’ arena in too big a
18234: hurry.”
18235: 
18236: “Yes, I’ll have a cup, please; and then I’ll walk with Dinah. I’m going
18237: straight home, for I’ve got a lot o’ timber valuations to write out.”
18238: 
18239: “Why, Adam, lad, are you here?” said Mr. Poyser, entering warm and
18240: coatless, with the two black-eyed boys behind him, still looking as
18241: much like him as two small elephants are like a large one. “How is it
18242: we’ve got sight o’ you so long before foddering-time?”
18243: 
18244: “I came on an errand for Mother,” said Adam. “She’s got a touch of her
18245: old complaint, and she wants Dinah to go and stay with her a bit.”
18246: 
18247: “Well, we’ll spare her for your mother a little while,” said Mr.
18248: Poyser. “But we wonna spare her for anybody else, on’y her husband.”
18249: 
18250: “Husband!” said Marty, who was at the most prosaic and literal period
18251: of the boyish mind. “Why, Dinah hasn’t got a husband.”
18252: 
18253: “Spare her?” said Mrs. Poyser, placing a seed-cake on the table and
18254: then seating herself to pour out the tea. “But we must spare her, it
18255: seems, and not for a husband neither, but for her own megrims. Tommy,
18256: what are you doing to your little sister’s doll? Making the child
18257: naughty, when she’d be good if you’d let her. You shanna have a morsel
18258: o’ cake if you behave so.”
18259: 
18260: Tommy, with true brotherly sympathy, was amusing himself by turning
18261: Dolly’s skirt over her bald head and exhibiting her truncated body to
18262: the general scorn—an indignity which cut Totty to the heart.
18263: 
18264: “What do you think Dinah’s been a-telling me since dinner-time?” Mrs.
18265: Poyser continued, looking at her husband.
18266: 
18267: “Eh! I’m a poor un at guessing,” said Mr. Poyser.
18268: 
18269: “Why, she means to go back to Snowfield again, and work i’ the mill,
18270: and starve herself, as she used to do, like a creatur as has got no
18271: friends.”
18272: 
18273: Mr. Poyser did not readily find words to express his unpleasant
18274: astonishment; he only looked from his wife to Dinah, who had now seated
18275: herself beside Totty, as a bulwark against brotherly playfulness, and
18276: was busying herself with the children’s tea. If he had been given to
18277: making general reflections, it would have occurred to him that there
18278: was certainly a change come over Dinah, for she never used to change
18279: colour; but, as it was, he merely observed that her face was flushed at
18280: that moment. Mr. Poyser thought she looked the prettier for it: it was
18281: a flush no deeper than the petal of a monthly rose. Perhaps it came
18282: because her uncle was looking at her so fixedly; but there is no
18283: knowing, for just then Adam was saying, with quiet surprise, “Why, I
18284: hoped Dinah was settled among us for life. I thought she’d given up the
18285: notion o’ going back to her old country.”
18286: 
18287: “Thought! Yes,” said Mrs. Poyser, “and so would anybody else ha’
18288: thought, as had got their right end up’ards. But I suppose you must
18289: _be_ a Methodist to know what a Methodist ’ull do. It’s ill guessing
18290: what the bats are flying after.”
18291: 
18292: “Why, what have we done to you. Dinah, as you must go away from us?”
18293: said Mr. Poyser, still pausing over his tea-cup. “It’s like breaking
18294: your word, welly, for your aunt never had no thought but you’d make
18295: this your home.”
18296: 
18297: “Nay, Uncle,” said Dinah, trying to be quite calm. “When I first came,
18298: I said it was only for a time, as long as I could be of any comfort to
18299: my aunt.”
18300: 
18301: “Well, an’ who said you’d ever left off being a comfort to me?” said
18302: Mrs. Poyser. “If you didna mean to stay wi’ me, you’d better never ha’
18303: come. Them as ha’ never had a cushion don’t miss it.”
18304: 
18305: “Nay, nay,” said Mr. Poyser, who objected to exaggerated views. “Thee
18306: mustna say so; we should ha’ been ill off wi’out her, Lady day was a
18307: twelvemont’. We mun be thankful for that, whether she stays or no. But
18308: I canna think what she mun leave a good home for, to go back int’ a
18309: country where the land, most on’t, isna worth ten shillings an acre,
18310: rent and profits.”
18311: 
18312: “Why, that’s just the reason she wants to go, as fur as she can give a
18313: reason,” said Mrs. Poyser. “She says this country’s too comfortable,
18314: an’ there’s too much t’ eat, an’ folks arena miserable enough. And
18315: she’s going next week. I canna turn her, say what I will. It’s allays
18316: the way wi’ them meek-faced people; you may’s well pelt a bag o’
18317: feathers as talk to ’em. But I say it isna religion, to be so
18318: obstinate—is it now, Adam?”
18319: 
18320: Adam saw that Dinah was more disturbed than he had ever seen her by any
18321: matter relating to herself, and, anxious to relieve her, if possible,
18322: he said, looking at her affectionately, “Nay, I can’t find fault with
18323: anything Dinah does. I believe her thoughts are better than our
18324: guesses, let ’em be what they may. I should ha’ been thankful for her
18325: to stay among us, but if she thinks well to go, I wouldn’t cross her,
18326: or make it hard to her by objecting. We owe her something different to
18327: that.”
18328: 
18329: As it often happens, the words intended to relieve her were just too
18330: much for Dinah’s susceptible feelings at this moment. The tears came
18331: into the grey eyes too fast to be hidden and she got up hurriedly,
18332: meaning it to be understood that she was going to put on her bonnet.
18333: 
18334: “Mother, what’s Dinah crying for?” said Totty. “She isn’t a naughty
18335: dell.”
18336: 
18337: “Thee’st gone a bit too fur,” said Mr. Poyser. “We’ve no right t’
18338: interfere with her doing as she likes. An’ thee’dst be as angry as
18339: could be wi’ me, if I said a word against anything she did.”
18340: 
18341: “Because you’d very like be finding fault wi’out reason,” said Mrs.
18342: Poyser. “But there’s reason i’ what I say, else I shouldna say it. It’s
18343: easy talking for them as can’t love her so well as her own aunt does.
18344: An’ me got so used to her! I shall feel as uneasy as a new sheared
18345: sheep when she’s gone from me. An’ to think of her leaving a parish
18346: where she’s so looked on. There’s Mr. Irwine makes as much of her as if
18347: she was a lady, for all her being a Methodist, an’ wi’ that maggot o’
18348: preaching in her head—God forgi’e me if I’m i’ the wrong to call it
18349: so.”
18350: 
18351: “Aye,” said Mr. Poyser, looking jocose; “but thee dostna tell Adam what
18352: he said to thee about it one day. The missis was saying, Adam, as the
18353: preaching was the only fault to be found wi’ Dinah, and Mr. Irwine
18354: says, ‘But you mustn’t find fault with her for that, Mrs. Poyser; you
18355: forget she’s got no husband to preach to. I’ll answer for it, you give
18356: Poyser many a good sermon.’ The parson had thee there,” Mr. Poyser
18357: added, laughing unctuously. “I told Bartle Massey on it, an’ he laughed
18358: too.”
18359: 
18360: “Yes, it’s a small joke sets men laughing when they sit a-staring at
18361: one another with a pipe i’ their mouths,” said Mrs. Poyser. “Give
18362: Bartle Massey his way and he’d have all the sharpness to himself. If
18363: the chaff-cutter had the making of us, we should all be straw, I
18364: reckon. Totty, my chicken, go upstairs to cousin Dinah, and see what
18365: she’s doing, and give her a pretty kiss.”
18366: 
18367: This errand was devised for Totty as a means of checking certain
18368: threatening symptoms about the corners of the mouth; for Tommy, no
18369: longer expectant of cake, was lifting up his eyelids with his
18370: forefingers and turning his eyeballs towards Totty in a way that she
18371: felt to be disagreeably personal.
18372: 
18373: “You’re rare and busy now—eh, Adam?” said Mr. Poyser. “Burge’s getting
18374: so bad wi’ his asthmy, it’s well if he’ll ever do much riding about
18375: again.”
18376: 
18377: “Yes, we’ve got a pretty bit o’ building on hand now,” said Adam, “what
18378: with the repairs on th’ estate, and the new houses at Treddles’on.”
18379: 
18380: “I’ll bet a penny that new house Burge is building on his own bit o’
18381: land is for him and Mary to go to,” said Mr. Poyser. “He’ll be for
18382: laying by business soon, I’ll warrant, and be wanting you to take to it
18383: all and pay him so much by th’ ’ear. We shall see you living on th’
18384: hill before another twelvemont’s over.”
18385: 
18386: “Well,” said Adam, “I should like t’ have the business in my own hands.
18387: It isn’t as I mind much about getting any more money. We’ve enough and
18388: to spare now, with only our two selves and mother; but I should like t’
18389: have my own way about things—I could try plans then, as I can’t do
18390: now.”
18391: 
18392: “You get on pretty well wi’ the new steward, I reckon?” said Mr.
18393: Poyser.
18394: 
18395: “Yes, yes; he’s a sensible man enough; understands farming—he’s
18396: carrying on the draining, and all that, capital. You must go some day
18397: towards the Stonyshire side and see what alterations they’re making.
18398: But he’s got no notion about buildings. You can so seldom get hold of a
18399: man as can turn his brains to more nor one thing; it’s just as if they
18400: wore blinkers like th’ horses and could see nothing o’ one side of ’em.
18401: Now, there’s Mr. Irwine has got notions o’ building more nor most
18402: architects; for as for th’ architects, they set up to be fine fellows,
18403: but the most of ’em don’t know where to set a chimney so as it shan’t
18404: be quarrelling with a door. My notion is, a practical builder that’s
18405: got a bit o’ taste makes the best architect for common things; and I’ve
18406: ten times the pleasure i’ seeing after the work when I’ve made the plan
18407: myself.”
18408: 
18409: Mr. Poyser listened with an admiring interest to Adam’s discourse on
18410: building, but perhaps it suggested to him that the building of his
18411: corn-rick had been proceeding a little too long without the control of
18412: the master’s eye, for when Adam had done speaking, he got up and said,
18413: “Well, lad, I’ll bid you good-bye now, for I’m off to the rick-yard
18414: again.”
18415: 
18416: Adam rose too, for he saw Dinah entering, with her bonnet on and a
18417: little basket in her hand, preceded by Totty.
18418: 
18419: “You’re ready, I see, Dinah,” Adam said; “so we’ll set off, for the
18420: sooner I’m at home the better.”
18421: 
18422: “Mother,” said Totty, with her treble pipe, “Dinah was saying her
18423: prayers and crying ever so.”
18424: 
18425: “Hush, hush,” said the mother, “little gells mustn’t chatter.”
18426: 
18427: Whereupon the father, shaking with silent laughter, set Totty on the
18428: white deal table and desired her to kiss him. Mr. and Mrs. Poyser, you
18429: perceive, had no correct principles of education.
18430: 
18431: “Come back to-morrow if Mrs. Bede doesn’t want you, Dinah,” said Mrs.
18432: Poyser: “but you can stay, you know, if she’s ill.”
18433: 
18434: So, when the good-byes had been said, Dinah and Adam left the Hall Farm
18435: together.
18436: 
18437: 
18438: 
18439: 
18440: Chapter L
18441: In the Cottage
18442: 
18443: 
18444: Adam did not ask Dinah to take his arm when they got out into the lane.
18445: He had never yet done so, often as they had walked together, for he had
18446: observed that she never walked arm-in-arm with Seth, and he thought,
18447: perhaps, that kind of support was not agreeable to her. So they walked
18448: apart, though side by side, and the close poke of her little black
18449: bonnet hid her face from him.
18450: 
18451: “You can’t be happy, then, to make the Hall Farm your home, Dinah?”
18452: Adam said, with the quiet interest of a brother, who has no anxiety for
18453: himself in the matter. “It’s a pity, seeing they’re so fond of you.”
18454: 
18455: “You know, Adam, my heart is as their heart, so far as love for them
18456: and care for their welfare goes, but they are in no present need. Their
18457: sorrows are healed, and I feel that I am called back to my old work, in
18458: which I found a blessing that I have missed of late in the midst of too
18459: abundant worldly good. I know it is a vain thought to flee from the
18460: work that God appoints us, for the sake of finding a greater blessing
18461: to our own souls, as if we could choose for ourselves where we shall
18462: find the fulness of the Divine Presence, instead of seeking it where
18463: alone it is to be found, in loving obedience. But now, I believe, I
18464: have a clear showing that my work lies elsewhere—at least for a time.
18465: In the years to come, if my aunt’s health should fail, or she should
18466: otherwise need me, I shall return.”
18467: 
18468: “You know best, Dinah,” said Adam. “I don’t believe you’d go against
18469: the wishes of them that love you, and are akin to you, without a good
18470: and sufficient reason in your own conscience. I’ve no right to say
18471: anything about my being sorry: you know well enough what cause I have
18472: to put you above every other friend I’ve got; and if it had been
18473: ordered so that you could ha’ been my sister, and lived with us all our
18474: lives, I should ha’ counted it the greatest blessing as could happen to
18475: us now. But Seth tells me there’s no hope o’ that: your feelings are
18476: different, and perhaps I’m taking too much upon me to speak about it.”
18477: 
18478: Dinah made no answer, and they walked on in silence for some yards,
18479: till they came to the stone stile, where, as Adam had passed through
18480: first and turned round to give her his hand while she mounted the
18481: unusually high step, she could not prevent him from seeing her face. It
18482: struck him with surprise, for the grey eyes, usually so mild and grave,
18483: had the bright uneasy glance which accompanies suppressed agitation,
18484: and the slight flush in her cheeks, with which she had come downstairs,
18485: was heightened to a deep rose-colour. She looked as if she were only
18486: sister to Dinah. Adam was silent with surprise and conjecture for some
18487: moments, and then he said, “I hope I’ve not hurt or displeased you by
18488: what I’ve said, Dinah. Perhaps I was making too free. I’ve no wish
18489: different from what you see to be best, and I’m satisfied for you to
18490: live thirty mile off, if you think it right. I shall think of you just
18491: as much as I do now, for you’re bound up with what I can no more help
18492: remembering than I can help my heart beating.”
18493: 
18494: Poor Adam! Thus do men blunder. Dinah made no answer, but she presently
18495: said, “Have you heard any news from that poor young man, since we last
18496: spoke of him?”
18497: 
18498: Dinah always called Arthur so; she had never lost the image of him as
18499: she had seen him in the prison.
18500: 
18501: “Yes,” said Adam. “Mr. Irwine read me part of a letter from him
18502: yesterday. It’s pretty certain, they say, that there’ll be a peace
18503: soon, though nobody believes it’ll last long; but he says he doesn’t
18504: mean to come home. He’s no heart for it yet, and it’s better for others
18505: that he should keep away. Mr. Irwine thinks he’s in the right not to
18506: come. It’s a sorrowful letter. He asks about you and the Poysers, as he
18507: always does. There’s one thing in the letter cut me a good deal: ‘You
18508: can’t think what an old fellow I feel,’ he says; ‘I make no schemes
18509: now. I’m the best when I’ve a good day’s march or fighting before me.’”
18510: 
18511: “He’s of a rash, warm-hearted nature, like Esau, for whom I have always
18512: felt great pity,” said Dinah. “That meeting between the brothers, where
18513: Esau is so loving and generous, and Jacob so timid and distrustful,
18514: notwithstanding his sense of the Divine favour, has always touched me
18515: greatly. Truly, I have been tempted sometimes to say that Jacob was of
18516: a mean spirit. But that is our trial: we must learn to see the good in
18517: the midst of much that is unlovely.”
18518: 
18519: “Ah,” said Adam, “I like to read about Moses best, in th’ Old
18520: Testament. He carried a hard business well through, and died when other
18521: folks were going to reap the fruits. A man must have courage to look at
18522: his life so, and think what’ll come of it after he’s dead and gone. A
18523: good solid bit o’ work lasts: if it’s only laying a floor down,
18524: somebody’s the better for it being done well, besides the man as does
18525: it.”
18526: 
18527: They were both glad to talk of subjects that were not personal, and in
18528: this way they went on till they passed the bridge across the Willow
18529: Brook, when Adam turned round and said, “Ah, here’s Seth. I thought
18530: he’d be home soon. Does he know of you’re going, Dinah?”
18531: 
18532: “Yes, I told him last Sabbath.”
18533: 
18534: Adam remembered now that Seth had come home much depressed on Sunday
18535: evening, a circumstance which had been very unusual with him of late,
18536: for the happiness he had in seeing Dinah every week seemed long to have
18537: outweighed the pain of knowing she would never marry him. This evening
18538: he had his habitual air of dreamy benignant contentment, until he came
18539: quite close to Dinah and saw the traces of tears on her delicate
18540: eyelids and eyelashes. He gave one rapid glance at his brother, but
18541: Adam was evidently quite outside the current of emotion that had shaken
18542: Dinah: he wore his everyday look of unexpectant calm. Seth tried not to
18543: let Dinah see that he had noticed her face, and only said, “I’m
18544: thankful you’re come, Dinah, for Mother’s been hungering after the
18545: sight of you all day. She began to talk of you the first thing in the
18546: morning.”
18547: 
18548: When they entered the cottage, Lisbeth was seated in her arm-chair, too
18549: tired with setting out the evening meal, a task she always performed a
18550: long time beforehand, to go and meet them at the door as usual, when
18551: she heard the approaching footsteps.
18552: 
18553: “Coom, child, thee’t coom at last,” she said, when Dinah went towards
18554: her. “What dost mane by lavin’ me a week an’ ne’er coomin’ a-nigh me?”
18555: 
18556: “Dear friend,” said Dinah, taking her hand, “you’re not well. If I’d
18557: known it sooner, I’d have come.”
18558: 
18559: “An’ how’s thee t’ know if thee dostna coom? Th’ lads on’y know what I
18560: tell ’em. As long as ye can stir hand and foot the men think ye’re
18561: hearty. But I’m none so bad, on’y a bit of a cold sets me achin’. An’
18562: th’ lads tease me so t’ ha’ somebody wi’ me t’ do the work—they make me
18563: ache worse wi’ talkin’. If thee’dst come and stay wi’ me, they’d let me
18564: alone. The Poysers canna want thee so bad as I do. But take thy bonnet
18565: off, an’ let me look at thee.”
18566: 
18567: Dinah was moving away, but Lisbeth held her fast, while she was taking
18568: off her bonnet, and looked at her face as one looks into a newly
18569: gathered snowdrop, to renew the old impressions of purity and
18570: gentleness.
18571: 
18572: “What’s the matter wi’ thee?” said Lisbeth, in astonishment; “thee’st
18573: been a-cryin’.”
18574: 
18575: “It’s only a grief that’ll pass away,” said Dinah, who did not wish
18576: just now to call forth Lisbeth’s remonstrances by disclosing her
18577: intention to leave Hayslope. “You shall know about it shortly—we’ll
18578: talk of it to-night. I shall stay with you to-night.”
18579: 
18580: Lisbeth was pacified by this prospect. And she had the whole evening to
18581: talk with Dinah alone; for there was a new room in the cottage, you
18582: remember, built nearly two years ago, in the expectation of a new
18583: inmate; and here Adam always sat when he had writing to do or plans to
18584: make. Seth sat there too this evening, for he knew his mother would
18585: like to have Dinah all to herself.
18586: 
18587: There were two pretty pictures on the two sides of the wall in the
18588: cottage. On one side there was the broad-shouldered, large-featured,
18589: hardy old woman, in her blue jacket and buff kerchief, with her
18590: dim-eyed anxious looks turned continually on the lily face and the
18591: slight form in the black dress that were either moving lightly about in
18592: helpful activity, or seated close by the old woman’s arm-chair, holding
18593: her withered hand, with eyes lifted up towards her to speak a language
18594: which Lisbeth understood far better than the Bible or the hymn-book.
18595: She would scarcely listen to reading at all to-night. “Nay, nay, shut
18596: the book,” she said. “We mun talk. I want t’ know what thee was cryin’
18597: about. Hast got troubles o’ thy own, like other folks?”
18598: 
18599: On the other side of the wall there were the two brothers so like each
18600: other in the midst of their unlikeness: Adam with knit brows, shaggy
18601: hair, and dark vigorous colour, absorbed in his “figuring”; Seth, with
18602: large rugged features, the close copy of his brother’s, but with thin,
18603: wavy, brown hair and blue dreamy eyes, as often as not looking vaguely
18604: out of the window instead of at his book, although it was a newly
18605: bought book—Wesley’s abridgment of Madame Guyon’s life, which was full
18606: of wonder and interest for him. Seth had said to Adam, “Can I help thee
18607: with anything in here to-night? I don’t want to make a noise in the
18608: shop.”
18609: 
18610: “No, lad,” Adam answered, “there’s nothing but what I must do myself.
18611: Thee’st got thy new book to read.”
18612: 
18613: And often, when Seth was quite unconscious, Adam, as he paused after
18614: drawing a line with his ruler, looked at his brother with a kind smile
18615: dawning in his eyes. He knew “th’ lad liked to sit full o’ thoughts he
18616: could give no account of; they’d never come t’ anything, but they made
18617: him happy,” and in the last year or so, Adam had been getting more and
18618: more indulgent to Seth. It was part of that growing tenderness which
18619: came from the sorrow at work within him.
18620: 
18621: For Adam, though you see him quite master of himself, working hard and
18622: delighting in his work after his inborn inalienable nature, had not
18623: outlived his sorrow—had not felt it slip from him as a temporary
18624: burden, and leave him the same man again. Do any of us? God forbid. It
18625: would be a poor result of all our anguish and our wrestling if we won
18626: nothing but our old selves at the end of it—if we could return to the
18627: same blind loves, the same self-confident blame, the same light
18628: thoughts of human suffering, the same frivolous gossip over blighted
18629: human lives, the same feeble sense of that Unknown towards which we
18630: have sent forth irrepressible cries in our loneliness. Let us rather be
18631: thankful that our sorrow lives in us as an indestructible force, only
18632: changing its form, as forces do, and passing from pain into
18633: sympathy—the one poor word which includes all our best insight and our
18634: best love. Not that this transformation of pain into sympathy had
18635: completely taken place in Adam yet. There was still a great remnant of
18636: pain, and this he felt would subsist as long as _her_ pain was not a
18637: memory, but an existing thing, which he must think of as renewed with
18638: the light of every new morning. But we get accustomed to mental as well
18639: as bodily pain, without, for all that, losing our sensibility to it. It
18640: becomes a habit of our lives, and we cease to imagine a condition of
18641: perfect ease as possible for us. Desire is chastened into submission,
18642: and we are contented with our day when we have been able to bear our
18643: grief in silence and act as if we were not suffering. For it is at such
18644: periods that the sense of our lives having visible and invisible
18645: relations, beyond any of which either our present or prospective self
18646: is the centre, grows like a muscle that we are obliged to lean on and
18647: exert.
18648: 
18649: That was Adam’s state of mind in this second autumn of his sorrow. His
18650: work, as you know, had always been part of his religion, and from very
18651: early days he saw clearly that good carpentry was God’s will—was that
18652: form of God’s will that most immediately concerned him. But now there
18653: was no margin of dreams for him beyond this daylight reality, no
18654: holiday-time in the working-day world, no moment in the distance when
18655: duty would take off her iron glove and breast-plate and clasp him
18656: gently into rest. He conceived no picture of the future but one made up
18657: of hard-working days such as he lived through, with growing contentment
18658: and intensity of interest, every fresh week. Love, he thought, could
18659: never be anything to him but a living memory—a limb lopped off, but not
18660: gone from consciousness. He did not know that the power of loving was
18661: all the while gaining new force within him; that the new sensibilities
18662: bought by a deep experience were so many new fibres by which it was
18663: possible, nay, necessary to him, that his nature should intertwine with
18664: another. Yet he was aware that common affection and friendship were
18665: more precious to him than they used to be—that he clung more to his
18666: mother and Seth, and had an unspeakable satisfaction in the sight or
18667: imagination of any small addition to their happiness. The Poysers,
18668: too—hardly three or four days passed but he felt the need of seeing
18669: them and interchanging words and looks of friendliness with them. He
18670: would have felt this, probably, even if Dinah had not been with them,
18671: but he had only said the simplest truth in telling Dinah that he put
18672: her above all other friends in the world. Could anything be more
18673: natural? For in the darkest moments of memory the thought of her always
18674: came as the first ray of returning comfort. The early days of gloom at
18675: the Hall Farm had been gradually turned into soft moonlight by her
18676: presence; and in the cottage, too, for she had come at every spare
18677: moment to soothe and cheer poor Lisbeth, who had been stricken with a
18678: fear that subdued even her querulousness at the sight of her darling
18679: Adam’s grief-worn face. He had become used to watching her light quiet
18680: movements, her pretty loving ways to the children, when he went to the
18681: Hall Farm; to listen for her voice as for a recurrent music; to think
18682: everything she said and did was just right, and could not have been
18683: better. In spite of his wisdom, he could not find fault with her for
18684: her overindulgence of the children, who had managed to convert Dinah
18685: the preacher, before whom a circle of rough men had often trembled a
18686: little, into a convenient household slave—though Dinah herself was
18687: rather ashamed of this weakness, and had some inward conflict as to her
18688: departure from the precepts of Solomon. Yes, there was one thing that
18689: might have been better; she might have loved Seth and consented to
18690: marry him. He felt a little vexed, for his brother’s sake, and he could
18691: not help thinking regretfully how Dinah, as Seth’s wife, would have
18692: made their home as happy as it could be for them all—how she was the
18693: one being that would have soothed their mother’s last days into
18694: peacefulness and rest.
18695: 
18696: “It’s wonderful she doesn’t love th’ lad,” Adam had said sometimes to
18697: himself, “for anybody ’ud think he was just cut out for her. But her
18698: heart’s so taken up with other things. She’s one o’ those women that
18699: feel no drawing towards having a husband and children o’ their own. She
18700: thinks she should be filled up with her own life then, and she’s been
18701: used so to living in other folks’s cares, she can’t bear the thought of
18702: her heart being shut up from ’em. I see how it is, well enough. She’s
18703: cut out o’ different stuff from most women: I saw that long ago. She’s
18704: never easy but when she’s helping somebody, and marriage ’ud interfere
18705: with her ways—that’s true. I’ve no right to be contriving and thinking
18706: it ’ud be better if she’d have Seth, as if I was wiser than she is—or
18707: than God either, for He made her what she is, and that’s one o’ the
18708: greatest blessings I’ve ever had from His hands, and others besides
18709: me.”
18710: 
18711: This self-reproof had recurred strongly to Adam’s mind when he gathered
18712: from Dinah’s face that he had wounded her by referring to his wish that
18713: she had accepted Seth, and so he had endeavoured to put into the
18714: strongest words his confidence in her decision as right—his resignation
18715: even to her going away from them and ceasing to make part of their life
18716: otherwise than by living in their thoughts, if that separation were
18717: chosen by herself. He felt sure she knew quite well enough how much he
18718: cared to see her continually—to talk to her with the silent
18719: consciousness of a mutual great remembrance. It was not possible she
18720: should hear anything but self-renouncing affection and respect in his
18721: assurance that he was contented for her to go away; and yet there
18722: remained an uneasy feeling in his mind that he had not said quite the
18723: right thing—that, somehow, Dinah had not understood him.
18724: 
18725: Dinah must have risen a little before the sun the next morning, for she
18726: was downstairs about five o’clock. So was Seth, for, through Lisbeth’s
18727: obstinate refusal to have any woman-helper in the house, he had learned
18728: to make himself, as Adam said, “very handy in the housework,” that he
18729: might save his mother from too great weariness; on which ground I hope
18730: you will not think him unmanly, any more than you can have thought the
18731: gallant Colonel Bath unmanly when he made the gruel for his invalid
18732: sister. Adam, who had sat up late at his writing, was still asleep, and
18733: was not likely, Seth said, to be down till breakfast-time. Often as
18734: Dinah had visited Lisbeth during the last eighteen months, she had
18735: never slept in the cottage since that night after Thias’s death, when,
18736: you remember, Lisbeth praised her deft movements and even gave a
18737: modified approval to her porridge. But in that long interval Dinah had
18738: made great advances in household cleverness, and this morning, since
18739: Seth was there to help, she was bent on bringing everything to a pitch
18740: of cleanliness and order that would have satisfied her Aunt Poyser. The
18741: cottage was far from that standard at present, for Lisbeth’s rheumatism
18742: had forced her to give up her old habits of dilettante scouring and
18743: polishing. When the kitchen was to her mind, Dinah went into the new
18744: room, where Adam had been writing the night before, to see what
18745: sweeping and dusting were needed there. She opened the window and let
18746: in the fresh morning air, and the smell of the sweet-brier, and the
18747: bright low-slanting rays of the early sun, which made a glory about her
18748: pale face and pale auburn hair as she held the long brush, and swept,
18749: singing to herself in a very low tone—like a sweet summer murmur that
18750: you have to listen for very closely—one of Charles Wesley’s hymns:
18751: 
18752: Eternal Beam of Light Divine,
18753:     Fountain of unexhausted love,
18754: In whom the Father’s glories shine,
18755:     Through earth beneath and heaven above;
18756: 
18757: Jesus! the weary wanderer’s rest,
18758:     Give me thy easy yoke to bear;
18759: With steadfast patience arm my breast,
18760:     With spotless love and holy fear.
18761: 
18762: Speak to my warring passions, “Peace!”
18763:     Say to my trembling heart, “Be still!”
18764: Thy power my strength and fortress is,
18765:     For all things serve thy sovereign will.
18766: 
18767: 
18768: She laid by the brush and took up the duster; and if you had ever lived
18769: in Mrs. Poyser’s household, you would know how the duster behaved in
18770: Dinah’s hand—how it went into every small corner, and on every ledge in
18771: and out of sight—how it went again and again round every bar of the
18772: chairs, and every leg, and under and over everything that lay on the
18773: table, till it came to Adam’s papers and rulers and the open desk near
18774: them. Dinah dusted up to the very edge of these and then hesitated,
18775: looking at them with a longing but timid eye. It was painful to see how
18776: much dust there was among them. As she was looking in this way, she
18777: heard Seth’s step just outside the open door, towards which her back
18778: was turned, and said, raising her clear treble, “Seth, is your brother
18779: wrathful when his papers are stirred?”
18780: 
18781: “Yes, very, when they are not put back in the right places,” said a
18782: deep strong voice, not Seth’s.
18783: 
18784: It was as if Dinah had put her hands unawares on a vibrating chord. She
18785: was shaken with an intense thrill, and for the instant felt nothing
18786: else; then she knew her cheeks were glowing, and dared not look round,
18787: but stood still, distressed because she could not say good-morning in a
18788: friendly way. Adam, finding that she did not look round so as to see
18789: the smile on his face, was afraid she had thought him serious about his
18790: wrathfulness, and went up to her, so that she was obliged to look at
18791: him.
18792: 
18793: “What! You think I’m a cross fellow at home, Dinah?” he said,
18794: smilingly.
18795: 
18796: “Nay,” said Dinah, looking up with timid eyes, “not so. But you might
18797: be put about by finding things meddled with; and even the man Moses,
18798: the meekest of men, was wrathful sometimes.”
18799: 
18800: “Come, then,” said Adam, looking at her affectionately, “I’ll help you
18801: move the things, and put ’em back again, and then they can’t get wrong.
18802: You’re getting to be your aunt’s own niece, I see, for particularness.”
18803: 
18804: They began their little task together, but Dinah had not recovered
18805: herself sufficiently to think of any remark, and Adam looked at her
18806: uneasily. Dinah, he thought, had seemed to disapprove him somehow
18807: lately; she had not been so kind and open to him as she used to be. He
18808: wanted her to look at him, and be as pleased as he was himself with
18809: doing this bit of playful work. But Dinah did not look at him—it was
18810: easy for her to avoid looking at the tall man—and when at last there
18811: was no more dusting to be done and no further excuse for him to linger
18812: near her, he could bear it no longer, and said, in rather a pleading
18813: tone, “Dinah, you’re not displeased with me for anything, are you? I’ve
18814: not said or done anything to make you think ill of me?”
18815: 
18816: The question surprised her, and relieved her by giving a new course to
18817: her feeling. She looked up at him now, quite earnestly, almost with the
18818: tears coming, and said, “Oh, no, Adam! how could you think so?”
18819: 
18820: “I couldn’t bear you not to feel as much a friend to me as I do to
18821: you,” said Adam. “And you don’t know the value I set on the very
18822: thought of you, Dinah. That was what I meant yesterday, when I said I’d
18823: be content for you to go, if you thought right. I meant, the thought of
18824: you was worth so much to me, I should feel I ought to be thankful, and
18825: not grumble, if you see right to go away. You know I do mind parting
18826: with you, Dinah?”
18827: 
18828: “Yes, dear friend,” said Dinah, trembling, but trying to speak calmly,
18829: “I know you have a brother’s heart towards me, and we shall often be
18830: with one another in spirit; but at this season I am in heaviness
18831: through manifold temptations. You must not mark me. I feel called to
18832: leave my kindred for a while; but it is a trial—the flesh is weak.”
18833: 
18834: Adam saw that it pained her to be obliged to answer.
18835: 
18836: “I hurt you by talking about it, Dinah,” he said. “I’ll say no more.
18837: Let’s see if Seth’s ready with breakfast now.”
18838: 
18839: That is a simple scene, reader. But it is almost certain that you, too,
18840: have been in love—perhaps, even, more than once, though you may not
18841: choose to say so to all your feminine friends. If so, you will no more
18842: think the slight words, the timid looks, the tremulous touches, by
18843: which two human souls approach each other gradually, like two little
18844: quivering rain-streams, before they mingle into one—you will no more
18845: think these things trivial than you will think the first-detected signs
18846: of coming spring trivial, though they be but a faint indescribable
18847: something in the air and in the song of the birds, and the tiniest
18848: perceptible budding on the hedge-row branches. Those slight words and
18849: looks and touches are part of the soul’s language; and the finest
18850: language, I believe, is chiefly made up of unimposing words, such as
18851: “light,” “sound,” “stars,” “music”—words really not worth looking at,
18852: or hearing, in themselves, any more than “chips” or “sawdust.” It is
18853: only that they happen to be the signs of something unspeakably great
18854: and beautiful. I am of opinion that love is a great and beautiful thing
18855: too, and if you agree with me, the smallest signs of it will not be
18856: chips and sawdust to you: they will rather be like those little words,
18857: “light” and “music,” stirring the long-winding fibres of your memory
18858: and enriching your present with your most precious past.
18859: 
18860: 
18861: 
18862: 
18863: Chapter LI
18864: Sunday Morning
18865: 
18866: 
18867: Lisbeth’s touch of rheumatism could not be made to appear serious
18868: enough to detain Dinah another night from the Hall Farm, now she had
18869: made up her mind to leave her aunt so soon, and at evening the friends
18870: must part. “For a long while,” Dinah had said, for she had told Lisbeth
18871: of her resolve.
18872: 
18873: “Then it’ll be for all my life, an’ I shall ne’er see thee again,” said
18874: Lisbeth. “Long while! I’n got no long while t’ live. An’ I shall be
18875: took bad an’ die, an’ thee canst ne’er come a-nigh me, an’ I shall die
18876: a-longing for thee.”
18877: 
18878: That had been the key-note of her wailing talk all day; for Adam was
18879: not in the house, and so she put no restraint on her complaining. She
18880: had tried poor Dinah by returning again and again to the question, why
18881: she must go away; and refusing to accept reasons, which seemed to her
18882: nothing but whim and “contrairiness”; and still more, by regretting
18883: that she “couldna’ ha’ one o’ the lads” and be her daughter.
18884: 
18885: “Thee couldstna put up wi’ Seth,” she said. “He isna cliver enough for
18886: thee, happen, but he’d ha’ been very good t’ thee—he’s as handy as can
18887: be at doin’ things for me when I’m bad, an’ he’s as fond o’ the Bible
18888: an’ chappellin’ as thee art thysen. But happen, thee’dst like a husband
18889: better as isna just the cut o’ thysen: the runnin’ brook isna athirst
18890: for th’ rain. Adam ’ud ha’ done for thee—I know he would—an’ he might
18891: come t’ like thee well enough, if thee’dst stop. But he’s as stubborn
18892: as th’ iron bar—there’s no bending him no way but’s own. But he’d be a
18893: fine husband for anybody, be they who they will, so looked-on an’ so
18894: cliver as he is. And he’d be rare an’ lovin’: it does me good on’y a
18895: look o’ the lad’s eye when he means kind tow’rt me.”
18896: 
18897: Dinah tried to escape from Lisbeth’s closest looks and questions by
18898: finding little tasks of housework that kept her moving about, and as
18899: soon as Seth came home in the evening she put on her bonnet to go. It
18900: touched Dinah keenly to say the last good-bye, and still more to look
18901: round on her way across the fields and see the old woman still standing
18902: at the door, gazing after her till she must have been the faintest
18903: speck in the dim aged eyes. “The God of love and peace be with them,”
18904: Dinah prayed, as she looked back from the last stile. “Make them glad
18905: according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted them, and the years
18906: wherein they have seen evil. It is thy will that I should part from
18907: them; let me have no will but thine.”
18908: 
18909: Lisbeth turned into the house at last and sat down in the workshop near
18910: Seth, who was busying himself there with fitting some bits of turned
18911: wood he had brought from the village into a small work-box, which he
18912: meant to give to Dinah before she went away.
18913: 
18914: “Thee’t see her again o’ Sunday afore she goes,” were her first words.
18915: “If thee wast good for anything, thee’dst make her come in again o’
18916: Sunday night wi’ thee, and see me once more.”
18917: 
18918: “Nay, Mother,” said Seth. “Dinah ’ud be sure to come again if she saw
18919: right to come. I should have no need to persuade her. She only thinks
18920: it ’ud be troubling thee for nought, just to come in to say good-bye
18921: over again.”
18922: 
18923: “She’d ne’er go away, I know, if Adam ’ud be fond on her an’ marry her,
18924: but everything’s so contrairy,” said Lisbeth, with a burst of vexation.
18925: 
18926: Seth paused a moment and looked up, with a slight blush, at his
18927: mother’s face. “What! Has she said anything o’ that sort to thee,
18928: Mother?” he said, in a lower tone.
18929: 
18930: “Said? Nay, she’ll say nothin’. It’s on’y the men as have to wait till
18931: folks say things afore they find ’em out.”
18932: 
18933: “Well, but what makes thee think so, Mother? What’s put it into thy
18934: head?”
18935: 
18936: “It’s no matter what’s put it into my head. My head’s none so hollow as
18937: it must get in, an’ nought to put it there. I know she’s fond on him,
18938: as I know th’ wind’s comin’ in at the door, an’ that’s anoof. An’ he
18939: might be willin’ to marry her if he know’d she’s fond on him, but he’ll
18940: ne’er think on’t if somebody doesna put it into’s head.”
18941: 
18942: His mother’s suggestion about Dinah’s feeling towards Adam was not
18943: quite a new thought to Seth, but her last words alarmed him, lest she
18944: should herself undertake to open Adam’s eyes. He was not sure about
18945: Dinah’s feeling, and he thought he _was_ sure about Adam’s.
18946: 
18947: “Nay, Mother, nay,” he said, earnestly, “thee mustna think o’ speaking
18948: o’ such things to Adam. Thee’st no right to say what Dinah’s feelings
18949: are if she hasna told thee, and it ’ud do nothing but mischief to say
18950: such things to Adam. He feels very grateful and affectionate toward
18951: Dinah, but he’s no thoughts towards her that ’ud incline him to make
18952: her his wife, and I don’t believe Dinah ’ud marry him either. I don’t
18953: think she’ll marry at all.”
18954: 
18955: “Eh,” said Lisbeth, impatiently. “Thee think’st so ’cause she wouldna
18956: ha’ thee. She’ll ne’er marry thee; thee mightst as well like her t’ ha’
18957: thy brother.”
18958: 
18959: Seth was hurt. “Mother,” he said, in a remonstrating tone, “don’t think
18960: that of me. I should be as thankful t’ have her for a sister as thee
18961: wouldst t’ have her for a daughter. I’ve no more thoughts about myself
18962: in that thing, and I shall take it hard if ever thee say’st it again.”
18963: 
18964: “Well, well, then thee shouldstna cross me wi’ sayin’ things arena as I
18965: say they are.”
18966: 
18967: “But, Mother,” said Seth, “thee’dst be doing Dinah a wrong by telling
18968: Adam what thee think’st about her. It ’ud do nothing but mischief, for
18969: it ’ud make Adam uneasy if he doesna feel the same to her. And I’m
18970: pretty sure he feels nothing o’ the sort.”
18971: 
18972: “Eh, donna tell me what thee’t sure on; thee know’st nought about it.
18973: What’s he allays goin’ to the Poysers’ for, if he didna want t’ see
18974: her? He goes twice where he used t’ go once. Happen he knowsna as he
18975: wants t’ see her; he knowsna as I put salt in’s broth, but he’d miss it
18976: pretty quick if it warna there. He’ll ne’er think o’ marrying if it
18977: isna put into’s head, an’ if thee’dst any love for thy mother, thee’dst
18978: put him up to’t an’ not let her go away out o’ my sight, when I might
18979: ha’ her to make a bit o’ comfort for me afore I go to bed to my old man
18980: under the white thorn.”
18981: 
18982: “Nay, Mother,” said Seth, “thee mustna think me unkind, but I should be
18983: going against my conscience if I took upon me to say what Dinah’s
18984: feelings are. And besides that, I think I should give offence to Adam
18985: by speaking to him at all about marrying; and I counsel thee not to
18986: do’t. Thee may’st be quite deceived about Dinah. Nay, I’m pretty sure,
18987: by words she said to me last Sabbath, as she’s no mind to marry.”
18988: 
18989: “Eh, thee’t as contrairy as the rest on ’em. If it war summat I didna
18990: want, it ’ud be done fast enough.”
18991: 
18992: Lisbeth rose from the bench at this, and went out of the workshop,
18993: leaving Seth in much anxiety lest she should disturb Adam’s mind about
18994: Dinah. He consoled himself after a time with reflecting that, since
18995: Adam’s trouble, Lisbeth had been very timid about speaking to him on
18996: matters of feeling, and that she would hardly dare to approach this
18997: tenderest of all subjects. Even if she did, he hoped Adam would not
18998: take much notice of what she said.
18999: 
19000: Seth was right in believing that Lisbeth would be held in restraint by
19001: timidity, and during the next three days, the intervals in which she
19002: had an opportunity of speaking to Adam were too rare and short to cause
19003: her any strong temptation. But in her long solitary hours she brooded
19004: over her regretful thoughts about Dinah, till they had grown very near
19005: that point of unmanageable strength when thoughts are apt to take wing
19006: out of their secret nest in a startling manner. And on Sunday morning,
19007: when Seth went away to chapel at Treddleston, the dangerous opportunity
19008: came.
19009: 
19010: Sunday morning was the happiest time in all the week to Lisbeth, for as
19011: there was no service at Hayslope church till the afternoon, Adam was
19012: always at home, doing nothing but reading, an occupation in which she
19013: could venture to interrupt him. Moreover, she had always a better
19014: dinner than usual to prepare for her sons—very frequently for Adam and
19015: herself alone, Seth being often away the entire day—and the smell of
19016: the roast meat before the clear fire in the clean kitchen, the clock
19017: ticking in a peaceful Sunday manner, her darling Adam seated near her
19018: in his best clothes, doing nothing very important, so that she could go
19019: and stroke her hand across his hair if she liked, and see him look up
19020: at her and smile, while Gyp, rather jealous, poked his muzzle up
19021: between them—all these things made poor Lisbeth’s earthly paradise.
19022: 
19023: The book Adam most often read on a Sunday morning was his large
19024: pictured Bible, and this morning it lay open before him on the round
19025: white deal table in the kitchen; for he sat there in spite of the fire,
19026: because he knew his mother liked to have him with her, and it was the
19027: only day in the week when he could indulge her in that way. You would
19028: have liked to see Adam reading his Bible. He never opened it on a
19029: weekday, and so he came to it as a holiday book, serving him for
19030: history, biography, and poetry. He held one hand thrust between his
19031: waistcoat buttons, and the other ready to turn the pages, and in the
19032: course of the morning you would have seen many changes in his face.
19033: Sometimes his lips moved in semi-articulation—it was when he came to a
19034: speech that he could fancy himself uttering, such as Samuel’s dying
19035: speech to the people; then his eyebrows would be raised, and the
19036: corners of his mouth would quiver a little with sad sympathy—something,
19037: perhaps old Isaac’s meeting with his son, touched him closely; at other
19038: times, over the New Testament, a very solemn look would come upon his
19039: face, and he would every now and then shake his head in serious assent,
19040: or just lift up his hand and let it fall again. And on some mornings,
19041: when he read in the Apocrypha, of which he was very fond, the son of
19042: Sirach’s keen-edged words would bring a delighted smile, though he also
19043: enjoyed the freedom of occasionally differing from an Apocryphal
19044: writer. For Adam knew the Articles quite well, as became a good
19045: churchman.
19046: 
19047: Lisbeth, in the pauses of attending to her dinner, always sat opposite
19048: to him and watched him, till she could rest no longer without going up
19049: to him and giving him a caress, to call his attention to her. This
19050: morning he was reading the Gospel according to St. Matthew, and Lisbeth
19051: had been standing close by him for some minutes, stroking his hair,
19052: which was smoother than usual this morning, and looking down at the
19053: large page with silent wonderment at the mystery of letters. She was
19054: encouraged to continue this caress, because when she first went up to
19055: him, he had thrown himself back in his chair to look at her
19056: affectionately and say, “Why, Mother, thee look’st rare and hearty this
19057: morning. Eh, Gyp wants me t’ look at him. He can’t abide to think I
19058: love thee the best.” Lisbeth said nothing, because she wanted to say so
19059: many things. And now there was a new leaf to be turned over, and it was
19060: a picture—that of the angel seated on the great stone that has been
19061: rolled away from the sepulchre. This picture had one strong association
19062: in Lisbeth’s memory, for she had been reminded of it when she first saw
19063: Dinah, and Adam had no sooner turned the page, and lifted the book
19064: sideways that they might look at the angel, than she said, “That’s
19065: her—that’s Dinah.”
19066: 
19067: Adam smiled, and, looking more intently at the angel’s face, said,
19068: 
19069: “It _is_ a bit like her; but Dinah’s prettier, I think.”
19070: 
19071: “Well, then, if thee think’st her so pretty, why arn’t fond on her?”
19072: 
19073: Adam looked up in surprise. “Why, Mother, dost think I don’t set store
19074: by Dinah?”
19075: 
19076: “Nay,” said Lisbeth, frightened at her own courage, yet feeling that
19077: she had broken the ice, and the waters must flow, whatever mischief
19078: they might do. “What’s th’ use o’ settin’ store by things as are thirty
19079: mile off? If thee wast fond enough on her, thee wouldstna let her go
19080: away.”
19081: 
19082: “But I’ve no right t’ hinder her, if she thinks well,” said Adam,
19083: looking at his book as if he wanted to go on reading. He foresaw a
19084: series of complaints tending to nothing. Lisbeth sat down again in the
19085: chair opposite to him, as she said:
19086: 
19087: “But she wouldna think well if thee wastna so contrairy.” Lisbeth dared
19088: not venture beyond a vague phrase yet.
19089: 
19090: “Contrairy, mother?” Adam said, looking up again in some anxiety. “What
19091: have I done? What dost mean?”
19092: 
19093: “Why, thee’t never look at nothin’, nor think o’ nothin’, but thy
19094: figurin, an’ thy work,” said Lisbeth, half-crying. “An’ dost think thee
19095: canst go on so all thy life, as if thee wast a man cut out o’ timber?
19096: An’ what wut do when thy mother’s gone, an’ nobody to take care on thee
19097: as thee gett’st a bit o’ victual comfortable i’ the mornin’?”
19098: 
19099: “What hast got i’ thy mind, Mother?” said Adam, vexed at this
19100: whimpering. “I canna see what thee’t driving at. Is there anything I
19101: could do for thee as I don’t do?”
19102: 
19103: “Aye, an’ that there is. Thee might’st do as I should ha’ somebody wi’
19104: me to comfort me a bit, an’ wait on me when I’m bad, an’ be good to
19105: me.”
19106: 
19107: “Well, Mother, whose fault is it there isna some tidy body i’ th’ house
19108: t’ help thee? It isna by my wish as thee hast a stroke o’ work to do.
19109: We can afford it—I’ve told thee often enough. It ’ud be a deal better
19110: for us.”
19111: 
19112: “Eh, what’s the use o’ talking o’ tidy bodies, when thee mean’st one o’
19113: th’ wenches out o’ th’ village, or somebody from Treddles’on as I ne’er
19114: set eyes on i’ my life? I’d sooner make a shift an’ get into my own
19115: coffin afore I die, nor ha’ them folks to put me in.”
19116: 
19117: Adam was silent, and tried to go on reading. That was the utmost
19118: severity he could show towards his mother on a Sunday morning. But
19119: Lisbeth had gone too far now to check herself, and after scarcely a
19120: minute’s quietness she began again.
19121: 
19122: “Thee mightst know well enough who ’tis I’d like t’ ha’ wi’ me. It isna
19123: many folks I send for t’ come an’ see me. I reckon. An’ thee’st had the
19124: fetchin’ on her times enow.”
19125: 
19126: “Thee mean’st Dinah, Mother, I know,” said Adam. “But it’s no use
19127: setting thy mind on what can’t be. If Dinah ’ud be willing to stay at
19128: Hayslope, it isn’t likely she can come away from her aunt’s house,
19129: where they hold her like a daughter, and where she’s more bound than
19130: she is to us. If it had been so that she could ha’ married Seth, that
19131: ’ud ha’ been a great blessing to us, but we can’t have things just as
19132: we like in this life. Thee must try and make up thy mind to do without
19133: her.”
19134: 
19135: “Nay, but I canna ma’ up my mind, when she’s just cut out for thee; an’
19136: nought shall ma’ me believe as God didna make her an’ send her there o’
19137: purpose for thee. What’s it sinnify about her bein’ a Methody! It ’ud
19138: happen wear out on her wi’ marryin’.”
19139: 
19140: Adam threw himself back in his chair and looked at his mother. He
19141: understood now what she had been aiming at from the beginning of the
19142: conversation. It was as unreasonable, impracticable a wish as she had
19143: ever urged, but he could not help being moved by so entirely new an
19144: idea. The chief point, however, was to chase away the notion from his
19145: mother’s mind as quickly as possible.
19146: 
19147: “Mother,” he said, gravely, “thee’t talking wild. Don’t let me hear
19148: thee say such things again. It’s no good talking o’ what can never be.
19149: Dinah’s not for marrying; she’s fixed her heart on a different sort o’
19150: life.”
19151: 
19152: “Very like,” said Lisbeth, impatiently, “very like she’s none for
19153: marr’ing, when them as she’d be willin’ t’ marry wonna ax her. I
19154: shouldna ha’ been for marr’ing thy feyther if he’d ne’er axed me; an’
19155: she’s as fond o’ thee as e’er I war o’ Thias, poor fellow.”
19156: 
19157: The blood rushed to Adam’s face, and for a few moments he was not quite
19158: conscious where he was. His mother and the kitchen had vanished for
19159: him, and he saw nothing but Dinah’s face turned up towards his. It
19160: seemed as if there were a resurrection of his dead joy. But he woke up
19161: very speedily from that dream (the waking was chill and sad), for it
19162: would have been very foolish in him to believe his mother’s words—she
19163: could have no ground for them. He was prompted to express his disbelief
19164: very strongly—perhaps that he might call forth the proofs, if there
19165: were any to be offered.
19166: 
19167: “What dost say such things for, Mother, when thee’st got no foundation
19168: for ’em? Thee know’st nothing as gives thee a right to say that.”
19169: 
19170: “Then I knowna nought as gi’es me a right to say as the year’s turned,
19171: for all I feel it fust thing when I get up i’ th’ morning. She isna
19172: fond o’ Seth, I reckon, is she? She doesna want to marry _him?_ But I
19173: can see as she doesna behave tow’rt thee as she daes tow’rt Seth. She
19174: makes no more o’ Seth’s coming a-nigh her nor if he war Gyp, but she’s
19175: all of a tremble when thee’t a-sittin’ down by her at breakfast an’
19176: a-looking at her. Thee think’st thy mother knows nought, but she war
19177: alive afore thee wast born.”
19178: 
19179: “But thee canstna be sure as the trembling means love?” said Adam
19180: anxiously.
19181: 
19182: “Eh, what else should it mane? It isna hate, I reckon. An’ what should
19183: she do but love thee? Thee’t made to be loved—for where’s there a
19184: straighter cliverer man? An’ what’s it sinnify her bein’ a Methody?
19185: It’s on’y the marigold i’ th’ parridge.”
19186: 
19187: Adam had thrust his hands in his pockets, and was looking down at the
19188: book on the table, without seeing any of the letters. He was trembling
19189: like a gold-seeker who sees the strong promise of gold but sees in the
19190: same moment a sickening vision of disappointment. He could not trust
19191: his mother’s insight; she had seen what she wished to see. And yet—and
19192: yet, now the suggestion had been made to him, he remembered so many
19193: things, very slight things, like the stirring of the water by an
19194: imperceptible breeze, which seemed to him some confirmation of his
19195: mother’s words.
19196: 
19197: Lisbeth noticed that he was moved. She went on, “An’ thee’t find out as
19198: thee’t poorly aff when she’s gone. Thee’t fonder on her nor thee
19199: know’st. Thy eyes follow her about, welly as Gyp’s follow thee.”
19200: 
19201: Adam could sit still no longer. He rose, took down his hat, and went
19202: out into the fields.
19203: 
19204: The sunshine was on them: that early autumn sunshine which we should
19205: know was not summer’s, even if there were not the touches of yellow on
19206: the lime and chestnut; the Sunday sunshine too, which has more than
19207: autumnal calmness for the working man; the morning sunshine, which
19208: still leaves the dew-crystals on the fine gossamer webs in the shadow
19209: of the bushy hedgerows.
19210: 
19211: Adam needed the calm influence; he was amazed at the way in which this
19212: new thought of Dinah’s love had taken possession of him, with an
19213: overmastering power that made all other feelings give way before the
19214: impetuous desire to know that the thought was true. Strange, that till
19215: that moment the possibility of their ever being lovers had never
19216: crossed his mind, and yet now, all his longing suddenly went out
19217: towards that possibility. He had no more doubt or hesitation as to his
19218: own wishes than the bird that flies towards the opening through which
19219: the daylight gleams and the breath of heaven enters.
19220: 
19221: The autumnal Sunday sunshine soothed him, but not by preparing him with
19222: resignation to the disappointment if his mother—if he himself—proved to
19223: be mistaken about Dinah. It soothed him by gentle encouragement of his
19224: hopes. Her love was so like that calm sunshine that they seemed to make
19225: one presence to him, and he believed in them both alike. And Dinah was
19226: so bound up with the sad memories of his first passion that he was not
19227: forsaking them, but rather giving them a new sacredness by loving her.
19228: Nay, his love for her had grown out of that past: it was the noon of
19229: that morning.
19230: 
19231: But Seth? Would the lad be hurt? Hardly; for he had seemed quite
19232: contented of late, and there was no selfish jealousy in him; he had
19233: never been jealous of his mother’s fondness for Adam. But had _he_ seen
19234: anything of what their mother talked about? Adam longed to know this,
19235: for he thought he could trust Seth’s observation better than his
19236: mother’s. He must talk to Seth before he went to see Dinah, and, with
19237: this intention in his mind, he walked back to the cottage and said to
19238: his mother, “Did Seth say anything to thee about when he was coming
19239: home? Will he be back to dinner?”
19240: 
19241: “Aye, lad, he’ll be back for a wonder. He isna gone to Treddles’on.
19242: He’s gone somewhere else a-preachin’ and a-prayin’.”
19243: 
19244: “Hast any notion which way he’s gone?” said Adam.
19245: 
19246: “Nay, but he aften goes to th’ Common. Thee know’st more o’s goings nor
19247: I do.”
19248: 
19249: Adam wanted to go and meet Seth, but he must content himself with
19250: walking about the near fields and getting sight of him as soon as
19251: possible. That would not be for more than an hour to come, for Seth
19252: would scarcely be at home much before their dinner-time, which was
19253: twelve o’clock. But Adam could not sit down to his reading again, and
19254: he sauntered along by the brook and stood leaning against the stiles,
19255: with eager intense eyes, which looked as if they saw something very
19256: vividly; but it was not the brook or the willows, not the fields or the
19257: sky. Again and again his vision was interrupted by wonder at the
19258: strength of his own feeling, at the strength and sweetness of this new
19259: love—almost like the wonder a man feels at the added power he finds in
19260: himself for an art which he had laid aside for a space. How is it that
19261: the poets have said so many fine things about our first love, so few
19262: about our later love? Are their first poems their best? Or are not
19263: those the best which come from their fuller thought, their larger
19264: experience, their deeper-rooted affections? The boy’s flutelike voice
19265: has its own spring charm; but the man should yield a richer deeper
19266: music.
19267: 
19268: At last, there was Seth, visible at the farthest stile, and Adam
19269: hastened to meet him. Seth was surprised, and thought something unusual
19270: must have happened, but when Adam came up, his face said plainly enough
19271: that it was nothing alarming.
19272: 
19273: “Where hast been?” said Adam, when they were side by side.
19274: 
19275: “I’ve been to the Common,” said Seth. “Dinah’s been speaking the Word
19276: to a little company of hearers at Brimstone’s, as they call him.
19277: They’re folks as never go to church hardly—them on the Common—but
19278: they’ll go and hear Dinah a bit. She’s been speaking with power this
19279: forenoon from the words, ‘I came not to call the righteous, but sinners
19280: to repentance.’ And there was a little thing happened as was pretty to
19281: see. The women mostly bring their children with ’em, but to-day there
19282: was one stout curly headed fellow about three or four year old, that I
19283: never saw there before. He was as naughty as could be at the beginning
19284: while I was praying, and while we was singing, but when we all sat down
19285: and Dinah began to speak, th’ young un stood stock still all at once,
19286: and began to look at her with’s mouth open, and presently he ran away
19287: from’s mother and went to Dinah, and pulled at her, like a little dog,
19288: for her to take notice of him. So Dinah lifted him up and held th’ lad
19289: on her lap, while she went on speaking; and he was as good as could be
19290: till he went to sleep—and the mother cried to see him.”
19291: 
19292: “It’s a pity she shouldna be a mother herself,” said Adam, “so fond as
19293: the children are of her. Dost think she’s quite fixed against marrying,
19294: Seth? Dost think nothing ’ud turn her?”
19295: 
19296: There was something peculiar in his brother’s tone, which made Seth
19297: steal a glance at his face before he answered.
19298: 
19299: “It ’ud be wrong of me to say nothing ’ud turn her,” he answered. “But
19300: if thee mean’st it about myself, I’ve given up all thoughts as she can
19301: ever be _my_ wife. She calls me her brother, and that’s enough.”
19302: 
19303: “But dost think she might ever get fond enough of anybody else to be
19304: willing to marry ’em?” said Adam rather shyly.
19305: 
19306: “Well,” said Seth, after some hesitation, “it’s crossed my mind
19307: sometimes o’ late as she might; but Dinah ’ud let no fondness for the
19308: creature draw her out o’ the path as she believed God had marked out
19309: for her. If she thought the leading was not from Him, she’s not one to
19310: be brought under the power of it. And she’s allays seemed clear about
19311: that—as her work was to minister t’ others, and make no home for
19312: herself i’ this world.”
19313: 
19314: “But suppose,” said Adam, earnestly, “suppose there was a man as ’ud
19315: let her do just the same and not interfere with her—she might do a good
19316: deal o’ what she does now, just as well when she was married as when
19317: she was single. Other women of her sort have married—that’s to say, not
19318: just like her, but women as preached and attended on the sick and
19319: needy. There’s Mrs. Fletcher as she talks of.”
19320: 
19321: A new light had broken in on Seth. He turned round, and laying his hand
19322: on Adam’s shoulder, said, “Why, wouldst like her to marry _thee_,
19323: brother?”
19324: 
19325: Adam looked doubtfully at Seth’s inquiring eyes and said, “Wouldst be
19326: hurt if she was to be fonder o’ me than o’ thee?”
19327: 
19328: “Nay,” said Seth warmly, “how canst think it? Have I felt thy trouble
19329: so little that I shouldna feel thy joy?”
19330: 
19331: There was silence a few moments as they walked on, and then Seth said,
19332: “I’d no notion as thee’dst ever think of her for a wife.”
19333: 
19334: “But is it o’ any use to think of her?” said Adam. “What dost say?
19335: Mother’s made me as I hardly know where I am, with what she’s been
19336: saying to me this forenoon. She says she’s sure Dinah feels for me more
19337: than common, and ’ud be willing t’ have me. But I’m afraid she speaks
19338: without book. I want to know if thee’st seen anything.”
19339: 
19340: “It’s a nice point to speak about,” said Seth, “and I’m afraid o’ being
19341: wrong; besides, we’ve no right t’ intermeddle with people’s feelings
19342: when they wouldn’t tell ’em themselves.”
19343: 
19344: Seth paused.
19345: 
19346: “But thee mightst ask her,” he said presently. “She took no offence at
19347: _me_ for asking, and thee’st more right than I had, only thee’t not in
19348: the Society. But Dinah doesn’t hold wi’ them as are for keeping the
19349: Society so strict to themselves. She doesn’t mind about making folks
19350: enter the Society, so as they’re fit t’ enter the kingdom o’ God. Some
19351: o’ the brethren at Treddles’on are displeased with her for that.”
19352: 
19353: “Where will she be the rest o’ the day?” said Adam.
19354: 
19355: “She said she shouldn’t leave the farm again to-day,” said Seth,
19356: “because it’s her last Sabbath there, and she’s going t’ read out o’
19357: the big Bible wi’ the children.”
19358: 
19359: Adam thought—but did not say—“Then I’ll go this afternoon; for if I go
19360: to church, my thoughts ’ull be with her all the while. They must sing
19361: th’ anthem without me to-day.”
19362: 
19363: 
19364: 
19365: 
19366: Chapter LII
19367: Adam and Dinah
19368: 
19369: 
19370: It was about three o’clock when Adam entered the farmyard and roused
19371: Alick and the dogs from their Sunday dozing. Alick said everybody was
19372: gone to church “but th’ young missis”—so he called Dinah—but this did
19373: not disappoint Adam, although the “everybody” was so liberal as to
19374: include Nancy the dairymaid, whose works of necessity were not
19375: unfrequently incompatible with church-going.
19376: 
19377: There was perfect stillness about the house. The doors were all closed,
19378: and the very stones and tubs seemed quieter than usual. Adam heard the
19379: water gently dripping from the pump—that was the only sound—and he
19380: knocked at the house door rather softly, as was suitable in that
19381: stillness.
19382: 
19383: The door opened, and Dinah stood before him, colouring deeply with the
19384: great surprise of seeing Adam at this hour, when she knew it was his
19385: regular practice to be at church. Yesterday he would have said to her
19386: without any difficulty, “I came to see you, Dinah: I knew the rest were
19387: not at home.” But to-day something prevented him from saying that, and
19388: he put out his hand to her in silence. Neither of them spoke, and yet
19389: both wished they could speak, as Adam entered, and they sat down. Dinah
19390: took the chair she had just left; it was at the corner of the table
19391: near the window, and there was a book lying on the table, but it was
19392: not open. She had been sitting perfectly still, looking at the small
19393: bit of clear fire in the bright grate. Adam sat down opposite her, in
19394: Mr. Poyser’s three-cornered chair.
19395: 
19396: “Your mother is not ill again, I hope, Adam?” Dinah said, recovering
19397: herself. “Seth said she was well this morning.”
19398: 
19399: “No, she’s very hearty to-day,” said Adam, happy in the signs of
19400: Dinah’s feeling at the sight of him, but shy.
19401: 
19402: “There’s nobody at home, you see,” Dinah said; “but you’ll wait. You’ve
19403: been hindered from going to church to-day, doubtless.”
19404: 
19405: “Yes,” Adam said, and then paused, before he added, “I was thinking
19406: about you: that was the reason.”
19407: 
19408: This confession was very awkward and sudden, Adam felt, for he thought
19409: Dinah must understand all he meant. But the frankness of the words
19410: caused her immediately to interpret them into a renewal of his
19411: brotherly regrets that she was going away, and she answered calmly, “Do
19412: not be careful and troubled for me, Adam. I have all things and abound
19413: at Snowfield. And my mind is at rest, for I am not seeking my own will
19414: in going.”
19415: 
19416: “But if things were different, Dinah,” said Adam, hesitatingly. “If you
19417: knew things that perhaps you don’t know now....”
19418: 
19419: Dinah looked at him inquiringly, but instead of going on, he reached a
19420: chair and brought it near the corner of the table where she was
19421: sitting. She wondered, and was afraid—and the next moment her thoughts
19422: flew to the past: was it something about those distant unhappy ones
19423: that she didn’t know?
19424: 
19425: Adam looked at her. It was so sweet to look at her eyes, which had now
19426: a self-forgetful questioning in them—for a moment he forgot that he
19427: wanted to say anything, or that it was necessary to tell her what he
19428: meant.
19429: 
19430: “Dinah,” he said suddenly, taking both her hands between his, “I love
19431: you with my whole heart and soul. I love you next to God who made me.”
19432: 
19433: Dinah’s lips became pale, like her cheeks, and she trembled violently
19434: under the shock of painful joy. Her hands were cold as death between
19435: Adam’s. She could not draw them away, because he held them fast.
19436: 
19437: “Don’t tell me you can’t love me, Dinah. Don’t tell me we must part and
19438: pass our lives away from one another.”
19439: 
19440: The tears were trembling in Dinah’s eyes, and they fell before she
19441: could answer. But she spoke in a quiet low voice.
19442: 
19443: “Yes, dear Adam, we must submit to another Will. We must part.”
19444: 
19445: “Not if you love me, Dinah—not if you love me,” Adam said passionately.
19446: “Tell me—tell me if you can love me better than a brother?”
19447: 
19448: Dinah was too entirely reliant on the Supreme guidance to attempt to
19449: achieve any end by a deceptive concealment. She was recovering now from
19450: the first shock of emotion, and she looked at Adam with simple sincere
19451: eyes as she said, “Yes, Adam, my heart is drawn strongly towards you;
19452: and of my own will, if I had no clear showing to the contrary, I could
19453: find my happiness in being near you and ministering to you continually.
19454: I fear I should forget to rejoice and weep with others; nay, I fear I
19455: should forget the Divine presence, and seek no love but yours.”
19456: 
19457: Adam did not speak immediately. They sat looking at each other in
19458: delicious silence—for the first sense of mutual love excludes other
19459: feelings; it will have the soul all to itself.
19460: 
19461: “Then, Dinah,” Adam said at last, “how can there be anything contrary
19462: to what’s right in our belonging to one another and spending our lives
19463: together? Who put this great love into our hearts? Can anything be
19464: holier than that? For we can help one another in everything as is good.
19465: I’d never think o’ putting myself between you and God, and saying you
19466: oughtn’t to do this and you oughtn’t to do that. You’d follow your
19467: conscience as much as you do now.”
19468: 
19469: “Yes, Adam,” Dinah said, “I know marriage is a holy state for those who
19470: are truly called to it, and have no other drawing; but from my
19471: childhood upwards I have been led towards another path; all my peace
19472: and my joy have come from having no life of my own, no wants, no wishes
19473: for myself, and living only in God and those of his creatures whose
19474: sorrows and joys he has given me to know. Those have been very blessed
19475: years to me, and I feel that if I was to listen to any voice that would
19476: draw me aside from that path, I should be turning my back on the light
19477: that has shone upon me, and darkness and doubt would take hold of me.
19478: We could not bless each other, Adam, if there were doubts in my soul,
19479: and if I yearned, when it was too late, after that better part which
19480: had once been given me and I had put away from me.”
19481: 
19482: “But if a new feeling has come into your mind, Dinah, and if you love
19483: me so as to be willing to be nearer to me than to other people, isn’t
19484: that a sign that it’s right for you to change your life? Doesn’t the
19485: love make it right when nothing else would?”
19486: 
19487: “Adam, my mind is full of questionings about that; for now, since you
19488: tell me of your strong love towards me, what was clear to me has become
19489: dark again. I felt before that my heart was too strongly drawn towards
19490: you, and that your heart was not as mine; and the thought of you had
19491: taken hold of me, so that my soul had lost its freedom, and was
19492: becoming enslaved to an earthly affection, which made me anxious and
19493: careful about what should befall myself. For in all other affection I
19494: had been content with any small return, or with none; but my heart was
19495: beginning to hunger after an equal love from you. And I had no doubt
19496: that I must wrestle against that as a great temptation, and the command
19497: was clear that I must go away.”
19498: 
19499: “But now, dear, dear Dinah, now you know I love you better than you
19500: love me... it’s all different now. You won’t think o’ going. You’ll
19501: stay, and be my dear wife, and I shall thank God for giving me my life
19502: as I never thanked him before.”
19503: 
19504: “Adam, it’s hard to me to turn a deaf ear... you know it’s hard; but a
19505: great fear is upon me. It seems to me as if you were stretching out
19506: your arms to me, and beckoning me to come and take my ease and live for
19507: my own delight, and Jesus, the Man of Sorrows, was standing looking
19508: towards me, and pointing to the sinful, and suffering, and afflicted. I
19509: have seen that again and again when I have been sitting in stillness
19510: and darkness, and a great terror has come upon me lest I should become
19511: hard, and a lover of self, and no more bear willingly the Redeemer’s
19512: cross.”
19513: 
19514: Dinah had closed her eyes, and a faint shudder went through her.
19515: “Adam,” she went on, “you wouldn’t desire that we should seek a good
19516: through any unfaithfulness to the light that is in us; you wouldn’t
19517: believe that could be a good. We are of one mind in that.”
19518: 
19519: “Yes, Dinah,” said Adam sadly, “I’ll never be the man t’ urge you
19520: against your conscience. But I can’t give up the hope that you may come
19521: to see different. I don’t believe your loving me could shut up your
19522: heart—it’s only adding to what you’ve been before, not taking away from
19523: it. For it seems to me it’s the same with love and happiness as with
19524: sorrow—the more we know of it the better we can feel what other
19525: people’s lives are or might be, and so we shall only be more tender to
19526: ’em, and wishful to help ’em. The more knowledge a man has, the better
19527: he’ll do’s work; and feeling’s a sort o’ knowledge.”
19528: 
19529: Dinah was silent; her eyes were fixed in contemplation of something
19530: visible only to herself. Adam went on presently with his pleading, “And
19531: you can do almost as much as you do now. I won’t ask you to go to
19532: church with me of a Sunday. You shall go where you like among the
19533: people, and teach ’em; for though I like church best, I don’t put my
19534: soul above yours, as if my words was better for you to follow than your
19535: own conscience. And you can help the sick just as much, and you’ll have
19536: more means o’ making ’em a bit comfortable; and you’ll be among all
19537: your own friends as love you, and can help ’em and be a blessing to ’em
19538: till their dying day. Surely, Dinah, you’d be as near to God as if you
19539: was living lonely and away from me.”
19540: 
19541: Dinah made no answer for some time. Adam was still holding her hands
19542: and looking at her with almost trembling anxiety, when she turned her
19543: grave loving eyes on his and said, in rather a sad voice, “Adam there
19544: is truth in what you say, and there’s many of the brethren and sisters
19545: who have greater strength than I have, and find their hearts enlarged
19546: by the cares of husband and kindred. But I have not faith that it would
19547: be so with me, for since my affections have been set above measure on
19548: you, I have had less peace and joy in God. I have felt as it were a
19549: division in my heart. And think how it is with me, Adam. That life I
19550: have led is like a land I have trodden in blessedness since my
19551: childhood; and if I long for a moment to follow the voice which calls
19552: me to another land that I know not, I cannot but fear that my soul
19553: might hereafter yearn for that early blessedness which I had forsaken;
19554: and where doubt enters there is not perfect love. I must wait for
19555: clearer guidance. I must go from you, and we must submit ourselves
19556: entirely to the Divine Will. We are sometimes required to lay our
19557: natural lawful affections on the altar.”
19558: 
19559: Adam dared not plead again, for Dinah’s was not the voice of caprice or
19560: insincerity. But it was very hard for him; his eyes got dim as he
19561: looked at her.
19562: 
19563: “But you may come to feel satisfied... to feel that you may come to me
19564: again, and we may never part, Dinah?”
19565: 
19566: “We must submit ourselves, Adam. With time, our duty will be made
19567: clear. It may be when I have entered on my former life, I shall find
19568: all these new thoughts and wishes vanish, and become as things that
19569: were not. Then I shall know that my calling is not towards marriage.
19570: But we must wait.”
19571: 
19572: “Dinah,” said Adam mournfully, “you can’t love me so well as I love
19573: you, else you’d have no doubts. But it’s natural you shouldn’t, for I’m
19574: not so good as you. I can’t doubt it’s right for me to love the best
19575: thing God’s ever given me to know.”
19576: 
19577: “Nay, Adam. It seems to me that my love for you is not weak, for my
19578: heart waits on your words and looks, almost as a little child waits on
19579: the help and tenderness of the strong on whom it depends. If the
19580: thought of you took slight hold of me, I should not fear that it would
19581: be an idol in the temple. But you will strengthen me—you will not
19582: hinder me in seeking to obey to the uttermost.”
19583: 
19584: “Let us go out into the sunshine, Dinah, and walk together. I’ll speak
19585: no word to disturb you.”
19586: 
19587: They went out and walked towards the fields, where they would meet the
19588: family coming from church. Adam said, “Take my arm, Dinah,” and she
19589: took it. That was the only change in their manner to each other since
19590: they were last walking together. But no sadness in the prospect of her
19591: going away—in the uncertainty of the issue—could rob the sweetness from
19592: Adam’s sense that Dinah loved him. He thought he would stay at the Hall
19593: Farm all that evening. He would be near her as long as he could.
19594: 
19595: “Hey-day! There’s Adam along wi’ Dinah,” said Mr. Poyser, as he opened
19596: the far gate into the Home Close. “I couldna think how he happened away
19597: from church. Why,” added good Martin, after a moment’s pause, “what
19598: dost think has just jumped into my head?”
19599: 
19600: “Summat as hadna far to jump, for it’s just under our nose. You mean as
19601: Adam’s fond o’ Dinah.”
19602: 
19603: “Aye! hast ever had any notion of it before?”
19604: 
19605: “To be sure I have,” said Mrs. Poyser, who always declined, if
19606: possible, to be taken by surprise. “I’m not one o’ those as can see the
19607: cat i’ the dairy an’ wonder what she’s come after.”
19608: 
19609: “Thee never saidst a word to me about it.”
19610: 
19611: “Well, I aren’t like a bird-clapper, forced to make a rattle when the
19612: wind blows on me. I can keep my own counsel when there’s no good i’
19613: speaking.”
19614: 
19615: “But Dinah ’ll ha’ none o’ him. Dost think she will?”
19616: 
19617: “Nay,” said Mrs. Poyser, not sufficiently on her guard against a
19618: possible surprise, “she’ll never marry anybody, if he isn’t a Methodist
19619: and a cripple.”
19620: 
19621: “It ’ud ha’ been a pretty thing though for ’em t’ marry,” said Martin,
19622: turning his head on one side, as if in pleased contemplation of his new
19623: idea. “Thee’dst ha’ liked it too, wouldstna?”
19624: 
19625: “Ah! I should. I should ha’ been sure of her then, as she wouldn’t go
19626: away from me to Snowfield, welly thirty mile off, and me not got a
19627: creatur to look to, only neighbours, as are no kin to me, an’ most of
19628: ’em women as I’d be ashamed to show my face, if _my_ dairy things war
19629: like their’n. There may well be streaky butter i’ the market. An’ I
19630: should be glad to see the poor thing settled like a Christian woman,
19631: with a house of her own over her head; and we’d stock her well wi’
19632: linen and feathers, for I love her next to my own children. An’ she
19633: makes one feel safer when she’s i’ the house, for she’s like the driven
19634: snow: anybody might sin for two as had her at their elbow.”
19635: 
19636: “Dinah,” said Tommy, running forward to meet her, “mother says you’ll
19637: never marry anybody but a Methodist cripple. What a silly you must be!”
19638: a comment which Tommy followed up by seizing Dinah with both arms, and
19639: dancing along by her side with incommodious fondness.
19640: 
19641: “Why, Adam, we missed you i’ the singing to-day,” said Mr. Poyser. “How
19642: was it?”
19643: 
19644: “I wanted to see Dinah—she’s going away so soon,” said Adam.
19645: 
19646: “Ah, lad! Can you persuade her to stop somehow? Find her a good husband
19647: somewhere i’ the parish. If you’ll do that, we’ll forgive you for
19648: missing church. But, anyway, she isna going before the harvest supper
19649: o’ Wednesday, and you must come then. There’s Bartle Massey comin’, an’
19650: happen Craig. You’ll be sure an’ come, now, at seven? The missis wunna
19651: have it a bit later.”
19652: 
19653: “Aye,” said Adam, “I’ll come if I can. But I can’t often say what I’ll
19654: do beforehand, for the work often holds me longer than I expect. You’ll
19655: stay till the end o’ the week, Dinah?”
19656: 
19657: “Yes, yes!” said Mr. Poyser. “We’ll have no nay.”
19658: 
19659: “She’s no call to be in a hurry,” observed Mrs. Poyser. “Scarceness o’
19660: victual ’ull keep: there’s no need to be hasty wi’ the cooking. An’
19661: scarceness is what there’s the biggest stock of i’ that country.”
19662: 
19663: Dinah smiled, but gave no promise to stay, and they talked of other
19664: things through the rest of the walk, lingering in the sunshine to look
19665: at the great flock of geese grazing, at the new corn-ricks, and at the
19666: surprising abundance of fruit on the old pear-tree; Nancy and Molly
19667: having already hastened home, side by side, each holding, carefully
19668: wrapped in her pocket-handkerchief, a prayer-book, in which she could
19669: read little beyond the large letters and the Amens.
19670: 
19671: Surely all other leisure is hurry compared with a sunny walk through
19672: the fields from “afternoon church”—as such walks used to be in those
19673: old leisurely times, when the boat, gliding sleepily along the canal,
19674: was the newest locomotive wonder; when Sunday books had most of them
19675: old brown-leather covers, and opened with remarkable precision always
19676: in one place. Leisure is gone—gone where the spinning-wheels are gone,
19677: and the pack-horses, and the slow waggons, and the pedlars, who brought
19678: bargains to the door on sunny afternoons. Ingenious philosophers tell
19679: you, perhaps, that the great work of the steam-engine is to create
19680: leisure for mankind. Do not believe them: it only creates a vacuum for
19681: eager thought to rush in. Even idleness is eager now—eager for
19682: amusement; prone to excursion-trains, art museums, periodical
19683: literature, and exciting novels; prone even to scientific theorizing
19684: and cursory peeps through microscopes. Old Leisure was quite a
19685: different personage. He only read one newspaper, innocent of leaders,
19686: and was free from that periodicity of sensations which we call
19687: post-time. He was a contemplative, rather stout gentleman, of excellent
19688: digestion; of quiet perceptions, undiseased by hypothesis; happy in his
19689: inability to know the causes of things, preferring the things
19690: themselves. He lived chiefly in the country, among pleasant seats and
19691: homesteads, and was fond of sauntering by the fruit-tree wall and
19692: scenting the apricots when they were warmed by the morning sunshine, or
19693: of sheltering himself under the orchard boughs at noon, when the summer
19694: pears were falling. He knew nothing of weekday services, and thought
19695: none the worse of the Sunday sermon if it allowed him to sleep from the
19696: text to the blessing; liking the afternoon service best, because the
19697: prayers were the shortest, and not ashamed to say so; for he had an
19698: easy, jolly conscience, broad-backed like himself, and able to carry a
19699: great deal of beer or port-wine, not being made squeamish by doubts and
19700: qualms and lofty aspirations. Life was not a task to him, but a
19701: sinecure. He fingered the guineas in his pocket, and ate his dinners,
19702: and slept the sleep of the irresponsible, for had he not kept up his
19703: character by going to church on the Sunday afternoons?
19704: 
19705: Fine old Leisure! Do not be severe upon him, and judge him by our
19706: modern standard. He never went to Exeter Hall, or heard a popular
19707: preacher, or read _Tracts for the Times_ or _Sartor Resartus_.

19712: Chapter LIII
19713: The Harvest Supper
19714: 
19715: 
19716: As Adam was going homeward, on Wednesday evening, in the six o’clock
19717: sunlight, he saw in the distance the last load of barley winding its
19718: way towards the yard-gate of the Hall Farm, and heard the chant of
19719: “Harvest Home!” rising and sinking like a wave. Fainter and fainter,
19720: and more musical through the growing distance, the falling dying sound
19721: still reached him, as he neared the Willow Brook. The low westering sun
19722: shone right on the shoulders of the old Binton Hills, turning the
19723: unconscious sheep into bright spots of light; shone on the windows of
19724: the cottage too, and made them a-flame with a glory beyond that of
19725: amber or amethyst. It was enough to make Adam feel that he was in a
19726: great temple, and that the distant chant was a sacred song.
19727: 
19728: “It’s wonderful,” he thought, “how that sound goes to one’s heart
19729: almost like a funeral bell, for all it tells one o’ the joyfullest time
19730: o’ the year, and the time when men are mostly the thankfullest. I
19731: suppose it’s a bit hard to us to think anything’s over and gone in our
19732: lives; and there’s a parting at the root of all our joys. It’s like
19733: what I feel about Dinah. I should never ha’ come to know that her love
19734: ’ud be the greatest o’ blessings to me, if what I counted a blessing
19735: hadn’t been wrenched and torn away from me, and left me with a greater
19736: need, so as I could crave and hunger for a greater and a better
19737: comfort.”
19738: 
19739: He expected to see Dinah again this evening, and get leave to accompany
19740: her as far as Oakbourne; and then he would ask her to fix some time
19741: when he might go to Snowfield, and learn whether the last best hope
19742: that had been born to him must be resigned like the rest. The work he
19743: had to do at home, besides putting on his best clothes, made it seven
19744: before he was on his way again to the Hall Farm, and it was
19745: questionable whether, with his longest and quickest strides, he should
19746: be there in time even for the roast beef, which came after the plum
19747: pudding, for Mrs. Poyser’s supper would be punctual.
19748: 
19749: Great was the clatter of knives and pewter plates and tin cans when
19750: Adam entered the house, but there was no hum of voices to this
19751: accompaniment: the eating of excellent roast beef, provided free of
19752: expense, was too serious a business to those good farm-labourers to be
19753: performed with a divided attention, even if they had had anything to
19754: say to each other—which they had not. And Mr. Poyser, at the head of
19755: the table, was too busy with his carving to listen to Bartle Massey’s
19756: or Mr. Craig’s ready talk.
19757: 
19758: “Here, Adam,” said Mrs. Poyser, who was standing and looking on to see
19759: that Molly and Nancy did their duty as waiters, “here’s a place kept
19760: for you between Mr. Massey and the boys. It’s a poor tale you couldn’t
19761: come to see the pudding when it was whole.”
19762: 
19763: Adam looked anxiously round for a fourth woman’s figure, but Dinah was
19764: not there. He was almost afraid of asking about her; besides, his
19765: attention was claimed by greetings, and there remained the hope that
19766: Dinah was in the house, though perhaps disinclined to festivities on
19767: the eve of her departure.
19768: 
19769: It was a goodly sight—that table, with Martin Poyser’s round
19770: good-humoured face and large person at the head of it helping his
19771: servants to the fragrant roast beef and pleased when the empty plates
19772: came again. Martin, though usually blest with a good appetite, really
19773: forgot to finish his own beef to-night—it was so pleasant to him to
19774: look on in the intervals of carving and see how the others enjoyed
19775: their supper; for were they not men who, on all the days of the year
19776: except Christmas Day and Sundays, ate their cold dinner, in a makeshift
19777: manner, under the hedgerows, and drank their beer out of wooden
19778: bottles—with relish certainly, but with their mouths towards the
19779: zenith, after a fashion more endurable to ducks than to human bipeds.
19780: Martin Poyser had some faint conception of the flavour such men must
19781: find in hot roast beef and fresh-drawn ale. He held his head on one
19782: side and screwed up his mouth, as he nudged Bartle Massey, and watched
19783: half-witted Tom Tholer, otherwise known as “Tom Saft,” receiving his
19784: second plateful of beef. A grin of delight broke over Tom’s face as the
19785: plate was set down before him, between his knife and fork, which he
19786: held erect, as if they had been sacred tapers. But the delight was too
19787: strong to continue smouldering in a grin—it burst out the next instant
19788: in a long-drawn “haw, haw!” followed by a sudden collapse into utter
19789: gravity, as the knife and fork darted down on the prey. Martin Poyser’s
19790: large person shook with his silent unctuous laugh. He turned towards
19791: Mrs. Poyser to see if she too had been observant of Tom, and the eyes
19792: of husband and wife met in a glance of good-natured amusement.
19793: 
19794: “Tom Saft” was a great favourite on the farm, where he played the part
19795: of the old jester, and made up for his practical deficiencies by his
19796: success in repartee. His hits, I imagine, were those of the flail,
19797: which falls quite at random, but nevertheless smashes an insect now and
19798: then. They were much quoted at sheep-shearing and haymaking times, but
19799: I refrain from recording them here, lest Tom’s wit should prove to be
19800: like that of many other bygone jesters eminent in their day—rather of a
19801: temporary nature, not dealing with the deeper and more lasting
19802: relations of things.
19803: 
19804: Tom excepted, Martin Poyser had some pride in his servants and
19805: labourers, thinking with satisfaction that they were the best worth
19806: their pay of any set on the estate. There was Kester Bale, for example
19807: (Beale, probably, if the truth were known, but he was called Bale, and
19808: was not conscious of any claim to a fifth letter), the old man with the
19809: close leather cap and the network of wrinkles on his sun-browned face.
19810: Was there any man in Loamshire who knew better the “natur” of all
19811: farming work? He was one of those invaluable labourers who can not only
19812: turn their hand to everything, but excel in everything they turn their
19813: hand to. It is true Kester’s knees were much bent outward by this time,
19814: and he walked with a perpetual curtsy, as if he were among the most
19815: reverent of men. And so he was; but I am obliged to admit that the
19816: object of his reverence was his own skill, towards which he performed
19817: some rather affecting acts of worship. He always thatched the ricks—for
19818: if anything were his forte more than another, it was thatching—and when
19819: the last touch had been put to the last beehive rick, Kester, whose
19820: home lay at some distance from the farm, would take a walk to the
19821: rick-yard in his best clothes on a Sunday morning and stand in the
19822: lane, at a due distance, to contemplate his own thatching, walking
19823: about to get each rick from the proper point of view. As he curtsied
19824: along, with his eyes upturned to the straw knobs imitative of golden
19825: globes at the summits of the beehive ricks, which indeed were gold of
19826: the best sort, you might have imagined him to be engaged in some pagan
19827: act of adoration. Kester was an old bachelor and reputed to have
19828: stockings full of coin, concerning which his master cracked a joke with
19829: him every pay-night: not a new unseasoned joke, but a good old one,
19830: that had been tried many times before and had worn well. “Th’ young
19831: measter’s a merry mon,” Kester frequently remarked; for having begun
19832: his career by frightening away the crows under the last Martin Poyser
19833: but one, he could never cease to account the reigning Martin a young
19834: master. I am not ashamed of commemorating old Kester. You and I are
19835: indebted to the hard hands of such men—hands that have long ago mingled
19836: with the soil they tilled so faithfully, thriftily making the best they
19837: could of the earth’s fruits, and receiving the smallest share as their
19838: own wages.
19839: 
19840: Then, at the end of the table, opposite his master, there was Alick,
19841: the shepherd and head-man, with the ruddy face and broad shoulders, not
19842: on the best terms with old Kester; indeed, their intercourse was
19843: confined to an occasional snarl, for though they probably differed
19844: little concerning hedging and ditching and the treatment of ewes, there
19845: was a profound difference of opinion between them as to their own
19846: respective merits. When Tityrus and Meliboeus happen to be on the same
19847: farm, they are not sentimentally polite to each other. Alick, indeed,
19848: was not by any means a honeyed man. His speech had usually something of
19849: a snarl in it, and his broad-shouldered aspect something of the
19850: bull-dog expression—“Don’t you meddle with me, and I won’t meddle with
19851: you.” But he was honest even to the splitting of an oat-grain rather
19852: than he would take beyond his acknowledged share, and as “close-fisted”
19853: with his master’s property as if it had been his own—throwing very
19854: small handfuls of damaged barley to the chickens, because a large
19855: handful affected his imagination painfully with a sense of profusion.
19856: Good-tempered Tim, the waggoner, who loved his horses, had his grudge
19857: against Alick in the matter of corn. They rarely spoke to each other,
19858: and never looked at each other, even over their dish of cold potatoes;
19859: but then, as this was their usual mode of behaviour towards all
19860: mankind, it would be an unsafe conclusion that they had more than
19861: transient fits of unfriendliness. The bucolic character at Hayslope,
19862: you perceive, was not of that entirely genial, merry, broad-grinning
19863: sort, apparently observed in most districts visited by artists. The
19864: mild radiance of a smile was a rare sight on a field-labourer’s face,
19865: and there was seldom any gradation between bovine gravity and a laugh.
19866: Nor was every labourer so honest as our friend Alick. At this very
19867: table, among Mr. Poyser’s men, there is that big Ben Tholoway, a very
19868: powerful thresher, but detected more than once in carrying away his
19869: master’s corn in his pockets—an action which, as Ben was not a
19870: philosopher, could hardly be ascribed to absence of mind. However, his
19871: master had forgiven him, and continued to employ him, for the Tholoways
19872: had lived on the Common time out of mind, and had always worked for the
19873: Poysers. And on the whole, I daresay, society was not much the worse
19874: because Ben had not six months of it at the treadmill, for his views of
19875: depredation were narrow, and the House of Correction might have
19876: enlarged them. As it was, Ben ate his roast beef to-night with a serene
19877: sense of having stolen nothing more than a few peas and beans as seed
19878: for his garden since the last harvest supper, and felt warranted in
19879: thinking that Alick’s suspicious eye, for ever upon him, was an injury
19880: to his innocence.
19881: 
19882: But _now_ the roast beef was finished and the cloth was drawn, leaving
19883: a fair large deal table for the bright drinking-cans, and the foaming
19884: brown jugs, and the bright brass candlesticks, pleasant to behold.
19885: _Now_, the great ceremony of the evening was to begin—the harvest-song,
19886: in which every man must join. He might be in tune, if he liked to be
19887: singular, but he must not sit with closed lips. The movement was
19888: obliged to be in triple time; the rest was _ad libitum_.
19889: 
19890: As to the origin of this song—whether it came in its actual state from
19891: the brain of a single rhapsodist, or was gradually perfected by a
19892: school or succession of rhapsodists, I am ignorant. There is a stamp of
19893: unity, of individual genius upon it, which inclines me to the former
19894: hypothesis, though I am not blind to the consideration that this unity
19895: may rather have arisen from that consensus of many minds which was a
19896: condition of primitive thought, foreign to our modern consciousness.
19897: Some will perhaps think that they detect in the first quatrain an
19898: indication of a lost line, which later rhapsodists, failing in
19899: imaginative vigour, have supplied by the feeble device of iteration.
19900: Others, however, may rather maintain that this very iteration is an
19901: original felicity, to which none but the most prosaic minds can be
19902: insensible.
19903: 
19904: The ceremony connected with the song was a drinking ceremony. (That is
19905: perhaps a painful fact, but then, you know, we cannot reform our
19906: forefathers.) During the first and second quatrain, sung decidedly
19907: _forte_, no can was filled.
19908: 
19909: “Here’s a health unto our master,
19910:     The founder of the feast;
19911: Here’s a health unto our master
19912:     And to our mistress!
19913: 
19914: And may his doings prosper,
19915:     Whate’er he takes in hand,
19916: For we are all his servants,
19917:     And are at his command.”
19918: 
19919: 
19920: But now, immediately before the third quatrain or chorus, sung
19921: _fortissimo_, with emphatic raps of the table, which gave the effect of
19922: cymbals and drum together, Alick’s can was filled, and he was bound to
19923: empty it before the chorus ceased.
19924: 
19925: “Then drink, boys, drink!
19926:     And see ye do not spill,
19927: For if ye do, ye shall drink two,
19928:     For ’tis our master’s will.”
19929: 
19930: 
19931: When Alick had gone successfully through this test of steady-handed
19932: manliness, it was the turn of old Kester, at his right hand—and so on,
19933: till every man had drunk his initiatory pint under the stimulus of the
19934: chorus. Tom Saft—the rogue—took care to spill a little by accident; but
19935: Mrs. Poyser (too officiously, Tom thought) interfered to prevent the
19936: exaction of the penalty.
19937: 
19938: To any listener outside the door it would have been the reverse of
19939: obvious why the “Drink, boys, drink!” should have such an immediate and
19940: often-repeated encore; but once entered, he would have seen that all
19941: faces were at present sober, and most of them serious—it was the
19942: regular and respectable thing for those excellent farm-labourers to do,
19943: as much as for elegant ladies and gentlemen to smirk and bow over their
19944: wine-glasses. Bartle Massey, whose ears were rather sensitive, had gone
19945: out to see what sort of evening it was at an early stage in the
19946: ceremony, and had not finished his contemplation until a silence of
19947: five minutes declared that “Drink, boys, drink!” was not likely to
19948: begin again for the next twelvemonth. Much to the regret of the boys
19949: and Totty: on them the stillness fell rather flat, after that glorious
19950: thumping of the table, towards which Totty, seated on her father’s
19951: knee, contributed with her small might and small fist.
19952: 
19953: When Bartle re-entered, however, there appeared to be a general desire
19954: for solo music after the choral. Nancy declared that Tim the waggoner
19955: knew a song and was “allays singing like a lark i’ the stable,”
19956: whereupon Mr. Poyser said encouragingly, “Come, Tim, lad, let’s hear
19957: it.” Tim looked sheepish, tucked down his head, and said he couldn’t
19958: sing, but this encouraging invitation of the master’s was echoed all
19959: round the table. It was a conversational opportunity: everybody could
19960: say, “Come, Tim,” except Alick, who never relaxed into the frivolity of
19961: unnecessary speech. At last, Tim’s next neighbour, Ben Tholoway, began
19962: to give emphasis to his speech by nudges, at which Tim, growing rather
19963: savage, said, “Let me alooan, will ye? Else I’ll ma’ ye sing a toon ye
19964: wonna like.” A good-tempered waggoner’s patience has limits, and Tim
19965: was not to be urged further.
19966: 
19967: “Well, then, David, ye’re the lad to sing,” said Ben, willing to show
19968: that he was not discomfited by this check. “Sing ‘My loove’s a roos
19969: wi’out a thorn.’”
19970: 
19971: The amatory David was a young man of an unconscious abstracted
19972: expression, which was due probably to a squint of superior intensity
19973: rather than to any mental characteristic; for he was not indifferent to
19974: Ben’s invitation, but blushed and laughed and rubbed his sleeve over
19975: his mouth in a way that was regarded as a symptom of yielding. And for
19976: some time the company appeared to be much in earnest about the desire
19977: to hear David’s song. But in vain. The lyricism of the evening was in
19978: the cellar at present, and was not to be drawn from that retreat just
19979: yet.
19980: 
19981: Meanwhile the conversation at the head of the table had taken a
19982: political turn. Mr. Craig was not above talking politics occasionally,
19983: though he piqued himself rather on a wise insight than on specific
19984: information. He saw so far beyond the mere facts of a case that really
19985: it was superfluous to know them.
19986: 
19987: “I’m no reader o’ the paper myself,” he observed to-night, as he filled
19988: his pipe, “though I might read it fast enough if I liked, for there’s
19989: Miss Lyddy has ’em and ’s done with ’em i’ no time. But there’s Mills,
19990: now, sits i’ the chimney-corner and reads the paper pretty nigh from
19991: morning to night, and when he’s got to th’ end on’t he’s more
19992: addle-headed than he was at the beginning. He’s full o’ this peace now,
19993: as they talk on; he’s been reading and reading, and thinks he’s got to
19994: the bottom on’t. ‘Why, Lor’ bless you, Mills,’ says I, ‘you see no more
19995: into this thing nor you can see into the middle of a potato. I’ll tell
19996: you what it is: you think it’ll be a fine thing for the country. And
19997: I’m not again’ it—mark my words—I’m not again’ it. But it’s my opinion
19998: as there’s them at the head o’ this country as are worse enemies to us
19999: nor Bony and all the mounseers he’s got at ’s back; for as for the
20000: mounseers, you may skewer half-a-dozen of ’em at once as if they war
20001: frogs.’”
20002: 
20003: “Aye, aye,” said Martin Poyser, listening with an air of much
20004: intelligence and edification, “they ne’er ate a bit o’ beef i’ their
20005: lives. Mostly sallet, I reckon.”
20006: 
20007: “And says I to Mills,” continued Mr. Craig, “‘Will _you_ try to make me
20008: believe as furriners like them can do us half th’ harm them ministers
20009: do with their bad government? If King George ’ud turn ’em all away and
20010: govern by himself, he’d see everything righted. He might take on Billy
20011: Pitt again if he liked; but I don’t see myself what we want wi’ anybody
20012: besides King and Parliament. It’s that nest o’ ministers does the
20013: mischief, I tell you.’”
20014: 
20015: “Ah, it’s fine talking,” observed Mrs. Poyser, who was now seated near
20016: her husband, with Totty on her lap—“it’s fine talking. It’s hard work
20017: to tell which is Old Harry when everybody’s got boots on.”
20018: 
20019: “As for this peace,” said Mr. Poyser, turning his head on one side in a
20020: dubitative manner and giving a precautionary puff to his pipe between
20021: each sentence, “I don’t know. Th’ war’s a fine thing for the country,
20022: an’ how’ll you keep up prices wi’out it? An’ them French are a wicked
20023: sort o’ folks, by what I can make out. What can you do better nor fight
20024: ’em?”
20025: 
20026: “Ye’re partly right there, Poyser,” said Mr. Craig, “but I’m not again’
20027: the peace—to make a holiday for a bit. We can break it when we like,
20028: an’ _I’m_ in no fear o’ Bony, for all they talk so much o’ his
20029: cliverness. That’s what I says to Mills this morning. Lor’ bless you,
20030: he sees no more through Bony!... why, I put him up to more in three
20031: minutes than he gets from’s paper all the year round. Says I, ‘Am I a
20032: gardener as knows his business, or arn’t I, Mills? Answer me that.’ ‘To
20033: be sure y’ are, Craig,’ says he—he’s not a bad fellow, Mills isn’t, for
20034: a butler, but weak i’ the head. ‘Well,’ says I, ‘you talk o’ Bony’s
20035: cliverness; would it be any use my being a first-rate gardener if I’d
20036: got nought but a quagmire to work on?’ ‘No,’ says he. ‘Well,’ I says,
20037: ‘that’s just what it is wi’ Bony. I’ll not deny but he may be a bit
20038: cliver—he’s no Frenchman born, as I understand—but what’s he got at’s
20039: back but mounseers?’”
20040: 
20041: Mr. Craig paused a moment with an emphatic stare after this triumphant
20042: specimen of Socratic argument, and then added, thumping the table
20043: rather fiercely, “Why, it’s a sure thing—and there’s them ’ull bear
20044: witness to’t—as i’ one regiment where there was one man a-missing, they
20045: put the regimentals on a big monkey, and they fit him as the shell fits
20046: the walnut, and you couldn’t tell the monkey from the mounseers!”
20047: 
20048: “Ah! Think o’ that, now!” said Mr. Poyser, impressed at once with the
20049: political bearings of the fact and with its striking interest as an
20050: anecdote in natural history.
20051: 
20052: “Come, Craig,” said Adam, “that’s a little too strong. You don’t
20053: believe that. It’s all nonsense about the French being such poor
20054: sticks. Mr. Irwine’s seen ’em in their own country, and he says they’ve
20055: plenty o’ fine fellows among ’em. And as for knowledge, and
20056: contrivances, and manufactures, there’s a many things as we’re a fine
20057: sight behind ’em in. It’s poor foolishness to run down your enemies.
20058: Why, Nelson and the rest of ’em ’ud have no merit i’ beating ’em, if
20059: they were such offal as folks pretend.”
20060: 
20061: Mr. Poyser looked doubtfully at Mr. Craig, puzzled by this opposition
20062: of authorities. Mr. Irwine’s testimony was not to be disputed; but, on
20063: the other hand, Craig was a knowing fellow, and his view was less
20064: startling. Martin had never “heard tell” of the French being good for
20065: much. Mr. Craig had found no answer but such as was implied in taking a
20066: long draught of ale and then looking down fixedly at the proportions of
20067: his own leg, which he turned a little outward for that purpose, when
20068: Bartle Massey returned from the fireplace, where he had been smoking
20069: his first pipe in quiet, and broke the silence by saying, as he thrust
20070: his forefinger into the canister, “Why, Adam, how happened you not to
20071: be at church on Sunday? Answer me that, you rascal. The anthem went
20072: limping without you. Are you going to disgrace your schoolmaster in his
20073: old age?”
20074: 
20075: “No, Mr. Massey,” said Adam. “Mr. and Mrs. Poyser can tell you where I
20076: was. I was in no bad company.”
20077: 
20078: “She’s gone, Adam—gone to Snowfield,” said Mr. Poyser, reminded of
20079: Dinah for the first time this evening. “I thought you’d ha’ persuaded
20080: her better. Nought ’ud hold her, but she must go yesterday forenoon.
20081: The missis has hardly got over it. I thought she’d ha’ no sperrit for
20082: th’ harvest supper.”
20083: 
20084: Mrs. Poyser had thought of Dinah several times since Adam had come in,
20085: but she had had “no heart” to mention the bad news.
20086: 
20087: “What!” said Bartle, with an air of disgust. “Was there a woman
20088: concerned? Then I give you up, Adam.”
20089: 
20090: “But it’s a woman you’n spoke well on, Bartle,” said Mr. Poyser. “Come
20091: now, you canna draw back; you said once as women wouldna ha’ been a bad
20092: invention if they’d all been like Dinah.”
20093: 
20094: “I meant her voice, man—I meant her voice, that was all,” said Bartle.
20095: “I can bear to hear her speak without wanting to put wool in my ears.
20096: As for other things, I daresay she’s like the rest o’ the women—thinks
20097: two and two ’ll come to make five, if she cries and bothers enough
20098: about it.”
20099: 
20100: “Aye, aye!” said Mrs. Poyser; “one ’ud think, an’ hear some folks talk,
20101: as the men war ’cute enough to count the corns in a bag o’ wheat wi’
20102: only smelling at it. They can see through a barn-door, _they_ can.
20103: Perhaps that’s the reason they can see so little o’ this side on’t.”
20104: 
20105: Martin Poyser shook with delighted laughter and winked at Adam, as much
20106: as to say the schoolmaster was in for it now.
20107: 
20108: “Ah!” said Bartle sneeringly, “the women are quick enough—they’re quick
20109: enough. They know the rights of a story before they hear it, and can
20110: tell a man what his thoughts are before he knows ’em himself.”
20111: 
20112: “Like enough,” said Mrs. Poyser, “for the men are mostly so slow, their
20113: thoughts overrun ’em, an’ they can only catch ’em by the tail. I can
20114: count a stocking-top while a man’s getting’s tongue ready an’ when he
20115: outs wi’ his speech at last, there’s little broth to be made on’t. It’s
20116: your dead chicks take the longest hatchin’. Howiver, I’m not denyin’
20117: the women are foolish: God Almighty made ’em to match the men.”
20118: 
20119: “Match!” said Bartle. “Aye, as vinegar matches one’s teeth. If a man
20120: says a word, his wife ’ll match it with a contradiction; if he’s a mind
20121: for hot meat, his wife ’ll match it with cold bacon; if he laughs,
20122: she’ll match him with whimpering. She’s such a match as the horse-fly
20123: is to th’ horse: she’s got the right venom to sting him with—the right
20124: venom to sting him with.”
20125: 
20126: “Yes,” said Mrs. Poyser, “I know what the men like—a poor soft, as ’ud
20127: simper at ’em like the picture o’ the sun, whether they did right or
20128: wrong, an’ say thank you for a kick, an’ pretend she didna know which
20129: end she stood uppermost, till her husband told her. That’s what a man
20130: wants in a wife, mostly; he wants to make sure o’ one fool as ’ull tell
20131: him he’s wise. But there’s some men can do wi’out that—they think so
20132: much o’ themselves a’ready. An’ that’s how it is there’s old
20133: bachelors.”
20134: 
20135: “Come, Craig,” said Mr. Poyser jocosely, “you mun get married pretty
20136: quick, else you’ll be set down for an old bachelor; an’ you see what
20137: the women ’ull think on you.”
20138: 
20139: “Well,” said Mr. Craig, willing to conciliate Mrs. Poyser and setting a
20140: high value on his own compliments, “_I_ like a cleverish woman—a woman
20141: o’ sperrit—a managing woman.”
20142: 
20143: “You’re out there, Craig,” said Bartle, dryly; “you’re out there. You
20144: judge o’ your garden-stuff on a better plan than that. You pick the
20145: things for what they can excel in—for what they can excel in. You don’t
20146: value your peas for their roots, or your carrots for their flowers.
20147: Now, that’s the way you should choose women. Their cleverness ’ll never
20148: come to much—never come to much—but they make excellent simpletons,
20149: ripe and strong-flavoured.”
20150: 
20151: “What dost say to that?” said Mr. Poyser, throwing himself back and
20152: looking merrily at his wife.
20153: 
20154: “Say!” answered Mrs. Poyser, with dangerous fire kindling in her eye.
20155: “Why, I say as some folks’ tongues are like the clocks as run on
20156: strikin’, not to tell you the time o’ the day, but because there’s
20157: summat wrong i’ their own inside...”
20158: 
20159: Mrs. Poyser would probably have brought her rejoinder to a further
20160: climax, if every one’s attention had not at this moment been called to
20161: the other end of the table, where the lyricism, which had at first only
20162: manifested itself by David’s _sotto voce_ performance of “My love’s a
20163: rose without a thorn,” had gradually assumed a rather deafening and
20164: complex character. Tim, thinking slightly of David’s vocalization, was
20165: impelled to supersede that feeble buzz by a spirited commencement of
20166: “Three Merry Mowers,” but David was not to be put down so easily, and
20167: showed himself capable of a copious crescendo, which was rendering it
20168: doubtful whether the rose would not predominate over the mowers, when
20169: old Kester, with an entirely unmoved and immovable aspect, suddenly set
20170: up a quavering treble—as if he had been an alarum, and the time was
20171: come for him to go off.
20172: 
20173: The company at Alick’s end of the table took this form of vocal
20174: entertainment very much as a matter of course, being free from musical
20175: prejudices; but Bartle Massey laid down his pipe and put his fingers in
20176: his ears; and Adam, who had been longing to go ever since he had heard
20177: Dinah was not in the house, rose and said he must bid good-night.
20178: 
20179: “I’ll go with you, lad,” said Bartle; “I’ll go with you before my ears
20180: are split.”
20181: 
20182: “I’ll go round by the Common and see you home, if you like, Mr.
20183: Massey,” said Adam.
20184: 
20185: “Aye, aye!” said Bartle; “then we can have a bit o’ talk together. I
20186: never get hold of you now.”
20187: 
20188: “Eh! It’s a pity but you’d sit it out,” said Martin Poyser. “They’ll
20189: all go soon, for th’ missis niver lets ’em stay past ten.”
20190: 
20191: But Adam was resolute, so the good-nights were said, and the two
20192: friends turned out on their starlight walk together.
20193: 
20194: “There’s that poor fool, Vixen, whimpering for me at home,” said
20195: Bartle. “I can never bring her here with me for fear she should be
20196: struck with Mrs. Poyser’s eye, and the poor bitch might go limping for
20197: ever after.”
20198: 
20199: “I’ve never any need to drive Gyp back,” said Adam, laughing. “He
20200: always turns back of his own head when he finds out I’m coming here.”
20201: 
20202: “Aye, aye,” said Bartle. “A terrible woman!—made of needles, made of
20203: needles. But I stick to Martin—I shall always stick to Martin. And he
20204: likes the needles, God help him! He’s a cushion made on purpose for
20205: ’em.”
20206: 
20207: “But she’s a downright good-natur’d woman, for all that,” said Adam,
20208: “and as true as the daylight. She’s a bit cross wi’ the dogs when they
20209: offer to come in th’ house, but if they depended on her, she’d take
20210: care and have ’em well fed. If her tongue’s keen, her heart’s tender:
20211: I’ve seen that in times o’ trouble. She’s one o’ those women as are
20212: better than their word.”
20213: 
20214: “Well, well,” said Bartle, “I don’t say th’ apple isn’t sound at the
20215: core; but it sets my teeth on edge—it sets my teeth on edge.”
20216:

20219: 
20220: Chapter LIV
20221: The Meeting on the Hill
20222: 
20223: 
20224: Adam understood Dinah’s haste to go away, and drew hope rather than
20225: discouragement from it. She was fearful lest the strength of her
20226: feeling towards him should hinder her from waiting and listening
20227: faithfully for the ultimate guiding voice from within.
20228: 
20229: “I wish I’d asked her to write to me, though,” he thought. “And yet
20230: even that might disturb her a bit, perhaps. She wants to be quite quiet
20231: in her old way for a while. And I’ve no right to be impatient and
20232: interrupting her with my wishes. She’s told me what her mind is, and
20233: she’s not a woman to say one thing and mean another. I’ll wait
20234: patiently.”
20235: 
20236: That was Adam’s wise resolution, and it throve excellently for the
20237: first two or three weeks on the nourishment it got from the remembrance
20238: of Dinah’s confession that Sunday afternoon. There is a wonderful
20239: amount of sustenance in the first few words of love. But towards the
20240: middle of October the resolution began to dwindle perceptibly, and
20241: showed dangerous symptoms of exhaustion. The weeks were unusually long:
20242: Dinah must surely have had more than enough time to make up her mind.
20243: Let a woman say what she will after she has once told a man that she
20244: loves him, he is a little too flushed and exalted with that first
20245: draught she offers him to care much about the taste of the second. He
20246: treads the earth with a very elastic step as he walks away from her,
20247: and makes light of all difficulties. But that sort of glow dies out:
20248: memory gets sadly diluted with time, and is not strong enough to revive
20249: us. Adam was no longer so confident as he had been. He began to fear
20250: that perhaps Dinah’s old life would have too strong a grasp upon her
20251: for any new feeling to triumph. If she had not felt this, she would
20252: surely have written to him to give him some comfort; but it appeared
20253: that she held it right to discourage him. As Adam’s confidence waned,
20254: his patience waned with it, and he thought he must write himself. He
20255: must ask Dinah not to leave him in painful doubt longer than was
20256: needful. He sat up late one night to write her a letter, but the next
20257: morning he burnt it, afraid of its effect. It would be worse to have a
20258: discouraging answer by letter than from her own lips, for her presence
20259: reconciled him to her will.
20260: 
20261: You perceive how it was: Adam was hungering for the sight of Dinah, and
20262: when that sort of hunger reaches a certain stage, a lover is likely to
20263: still it though he may have to put his future in pawn.
20264: 
20265: But what harm could he do by going to Snowfield? Dinah could not be
20266: displeased with him for it. She had not forbidden him to go. She must
20267: surely expect that he would go before long. By the second Sunday in
20268: October this view of the case had become so clear to Adam that he was
20269: already on his way to Snowfield, on horseback this time, for his hours
20270: were precious now, and he had borrowed Jonathan Burge’s good nag for
20271: the journey.
20272: 
20273: What keen memories went along the road with him! He had often been to
20274: Oakbourne and back since that first journey to Snowfield, but beyond
20275: Oakbourne the greystone walls, the broken country, the meagre trees,
20276: seemed to be telling him afresh the story of that painful past which he
20277: knew so well by heart. But no story is the same to us after a lapse of
20278: time—or rather, we who read it are no longer the same interpreters—and
20279: Adam this morning brought with him new thoughts through that grey
20280: country, thoughts which gave an altered significance to its story of
20281: the past.
20282: 
20283: That is a base and selfish, even a blasphemous, spirit which rejoices
20284: and is thankful over the past evil that has blighted or crushed
20285: another, because it has been made a source of unforeseen good to
20286: ourselves. Adam could never cease to mourn over that mystery of human
20287: sorrow which had been brought so close to him; he could never thank God
20288: for another’s misery. And if I were capable of that narrow-sighted joy
20289: in Adam’s behalf, I should still know he was not the man to feel it for
20290: himself. He would have shaken his head at such a sentiment and said,
20291: “Evil’s evil, and sorrow’s sorrow, and you can’t alter it’s natur by
20292: wrapping it up in other words. Other folks were not created for my
20293: sake, that I should think all square when things turn out well for me.”
20294: 
20295: But it is not ignoble to feel that the fuller life which a sad
20296: experience has brought us is worth our own personal share of pain.
20297: Surely it is not possible to feel otherwise, any more than it would be
20298: possible for a man with cataract to regret the painful process by which
20299: his dim blurred sight of men as trees walking had been exchanged for
20300: clear outline and effulgent day. The growth of higher feeling within us
20301: is like the growth of faculty, bringing with it a sense of added
20302: strength. We can no more wish to return to a narrower sympathy than a
20303: painter or a musician can wish to return to his cruder manner, or a
20304: philosopher to his less complete formula.
20305: 
20306: Something like this sense of enlarged being was in Adam’s mind this
20307: Sunday morning, as he rode along in vivid recollection of the past. His
20308: feeling towards Dinah, the hope of passing his life with her, had been
20309: the distant unseen point towards which that hard journey from Snowfield
20310: eighteen months ago had been leading him. Tender and deep as his love
20311: for Hetty had been—so deep that the roots of it would never be torn
20312: away—his love for Dinah was better and more precious to him, for it was
20313: the outgrowth of that fuller life which had come to him from his
20314: acquaintance with deep sorrow. “It’s like as if it was a new strength
20315: to me,” he said to himself, “to love her and know as she loves me. I
20316: shall look t’ her to help me to see things right. For she’s better than
20317: I am—there’s less o’ self in her, and pride. And it’s a feeling as
20318: gives you a sort o’ liberty, as if you could walk more fearless, when
20319: you’ve more trust in another than y’ have in yourself. I’ve always been
20320: thinking I knew better than them as belonged to me, and that’s a poor
20321: sort o’ life, when you can’t look to them nearest to you t’ help you
20322: with a bit better thought than what you’ve got inside you a’ready.”
20323: 
20324: It was more than two o’clock in the afternoon when Adam came in sight
20325: of the grey town on the hill-side and looked searchingly towards the
20326: green valley below, for the first glimpse of the old thatched roof near
20327: the ugly red mill. The scene looked less harsh in the soft October
20328: sunshine than it had in the eager time of early spring, and the one
20329: grand charm it possessed in common with all wide-stretching woodless
20330: regions—that it filled you with a new consciousness of the overarching
20331: sky—had a milder, more soothing influence than usual, on this almost
20332: cloudless day. Adam’s doubts and fears melted under this influence as
20333: the delicate weblike clouds had gradually melted away into the clear
20334: blue above him. He seemed to see Dinah’s gentle face assuring him, with
20335: its looks alone, of all he longed to know.
20336: 
20337: He did not expect Dinah to be at home at this hour, but he got down
20338: from his horse and tied it at the little gate, that he might ask where
20339: she was gone to-day. He had set his mind on following her and bringing
20340: her home. She was gone to Sloman’s End, a hamlet about three miles off,
20341: over the hill, the old woman told him—had set off directly after
20342: morning chapel, to preach in a cottage there, as her habit was. Anybody
20343: at the town would tell him the way to Sloman’s End. So Adam got on his
20344: horse again and rode to the town, putting up at the old inn and taking
20345: a hasty dinner there in the company of the too chatty landlord, from
20346: whose friendly questions and reminiscences he was glad to escape as
20347: soon as possible and set out towards Sloman’s End. With all his haste
20348: it was nearly four o’clock before he could set off, and he thought that
20349: as Dinah had gone so early, she would perhaps already be near
20350: returning. The little, grey, desolate-looking hamlet, unscreened by
20351: sheltering trees, lay in sight long before he reached it, and as he
20352: came near he could hear the sound of voices singing a hymn. “Perhaps
20353: that’s the last hymn before they come away,” Adam thought. “I’ll walk
20354: back a bit and turn again to meet her, farther off the village.” He
20355: walked back till he got nearly to the top of the hill again, and seated
20356: himself on a loose stone, against the low wall, to watch till he should
20357: see the little black figure leaving the hamlet and winding up the hill.
20358: He chose this spot, almost at the top of the hill, because it was away
20359: from all eyes—no house, no cattle, not even a nibbling sheep near—no
20360: presence but the still lights and shadows and the great embracing sky.
20361: 
20362: She was much longer coming than he expected. He waited an hour at least
20363: watching for her and thinking of her, while the afternoon shadows
20364: lengthened and the light grew softer. At last he saw the little black
20365: figure coming from between the grey houses and gradually approaching
20366: the foot of the hill. Slowly, Adam thought, but Dinah was really
20367: walking at her usual pace, with a light quiet step. Now she was
20368: beginning to wind along the path up the hill, but Adam would not move
20369: yet; he would not meet her too soon; he had set his heart on meeting
20370: her in this assured loneliness. And now he began to fear lest he should
20371: startle her too much. “Yet,” he thought, “she’s not one to be
20372: overstartled; she’s always so calm and quiet, as if she was prepared
20373: for anything.”
20374: 
20375: What was she thinking of as she wound up the hill? Perhaps she had
20376: found complete repose without him, and had ceased to feel any need of
20377: his love. On the verge of a decision we all tremble: hope pauses with
20378: fluttering wings.
20379: 
20380: But now at last she was very near, and Adam rose from the stone wall.
20381: It happened that just as he walked forward, Dinah had paused and turned
20382: round to look back at the village—who does not pause and look back in
20383: mounting a hill? Adam was glad, for, with the fine instinct of a lover,
20384: he felt that it would be best for her to hear his voice before she saw
20385: him. He came within three paces of her and then said, “Dinah!” She
20386: started without looking round, as if she connected the sound with no
20387: place. “Dinah!” Adam said again. He knew quite well what was in her
20388: mind. She was so accustomed to think of impressions as purely spiritual
20389: monitions that she looked for no material visible accompaniment of the
20390: voice.
20391: 
20392: But this second time she looked round. What a look of yearning love it
20393: was that the mild grey eyes turned on the strong dark-eyed man! She did
20394: not start again at the sight of him; she said nothing, but moved
20395: towards him so that his arm could clasp her round.
20396: 
20397: And they walked on so in silence, while the warm tears fell. Adam was
20398: content, and said nothing. It was Dinah who spoke first.
20399: 
20400: “Adam,” she said, “it is the Divine Will. My soul is so knit to yours
20401: that it is but a divided life I live without you. And this moment, now
20402: you are with me, and I feel that our hearts are filled with the same
20403: love. I have a fulness of strength to bear and do our heavenly Father’s
20404: Will that I had lost before.”
20405: 
20406: Adam paused and looked into her sincere eyes.
20407: 
20408: “Then we’ll never part any more, Dinah, till death parts us.”
20409: 
20410: And they kissed each other with a deep joy.
20411: 
20412: What greater thing is there for two human souls than to feel that they
20413: are joined for life—to strengthen each other in all labour, to rest on
20414: each other in all sorrow, to minister to each other in all pain, to be
20415: one with each other in silent unspeakable memories at the moment of the
20416: last parting?

20421: Chapter LV

20423: 
20424: 
20425: In little more than a month after that meeting on the hill—on a rimy
20426: morning in departing November—Adam and Dinah were married.
20427: 
20428: It was an event much thought of in the village. All Mr. Burge’s men had
20429: a holiday, and all Mr. Poyser’s, and most of those who had a holiday
20430: appeared in their best clothes at the wedding. I think there was hardly
20431: an inhabitant of Hayslope specially mentioned in this history and still
20432: resident in the parish on this November morning who was not either in
20433: church to see Adam and Dinah married, or near the church door to greet
20434: them as they came forth. Mrs. Irwine and her daughters were waiting at
20435: the churchyard gates in their carriage (for they had a carriage now) to
20436: shake hands with the bride and bridegroom and wish them well; and in
20437: the absence of Miss Lydia Donnithorne at Bath, Mrs. Best, Mr. Mills,
20438: and Mr. Craig had felt it incumbent on them to represent “the family”
20439: at the Chase on the occasion. The churchyard walk was quite lined with
20440: familiar faces, many of them faces that had first looked at Dinah when
20441: she preached on the Green. And no wonder they showed this eager
20442: interest on her marriage morning, for nothing like Dinah and the
20443: history which had brought her and Adam Bede together had been known at
20444: Hayslope within the memory of man.
20445: 
20446: Bessy Cranage, in her neatest cap and frock, was crying, though she did
20447: not exactly know why; for, as her cousin Wiry Ben, who stood near her,
20448: judiciously suggested, Dinah was not going away, and if Bessy was in
20449: low spirits, the best thing for her to do was to follow Dinah’s example
20450: and marry an honest fellow who was ready to have her. Next to Bessy,
20451: just within the church door, there were the Poyser children, peeping
20452: round the corner of the pews to get a sight of the mysterious ceremony;
20453: Totty’s face wearing an unusual air of anxiety at the idea of seeing
20454: cousin Dinah come back looking rather old, for in Totty’s experience no
20455: married people were young.
20456: 
20457: I envy them all the sight they had when the marriage was fairly ended
20458: and Adam led Dinah out of church. She was not in black this morning,
20459: for her Aunt Poyser would by no means allow such a risk of incurring
20460: bad luck, and had herself made a present of the wedding dress, made all
20461: of grey, though in the usual Quaker form, for on this point Dinah could
20462: not give way. So the lily face looked out with sweet gravity from under
20463: a grey Quaker bonnet, neither smiling nor blushing, but with lips
20464: trembling a little under the weight of solemn feelings. Adam, as he
20465: pressed her arm to his side, walked with his old erectness and his head
20466: thrown rather backward as if to face all the world better. But it was
20467: not because he was particularly proud this morning, as is the wont of
20468: bridegrooms, for his happiness was of a kind that had little reference
20469: to men’s opinion of it. There was a tinge of sadness in his deep joy;
20470: Dinah knew it, and did not feel aggrieved.
20471: 
20472: There were three other couples, following the bride and bridegroom:
20473: first, Martin Poyser, looking as cheery as a bright fire on this rimy
20474: morning, led quiet Mary Burge, the bridesmaid; then came Seth serenely
20475: happy, with Mrs. Poyser on his arm; and last of all Bartle Massey, with
20476: Lisbeth—Lisbeth in a new gown and bonnet, too busy with her pride in
20477: her son and her delight in possessing the one daughter she had desired
20478: to devise a single pretext for complaint.
20479: 
20480: Bartle Massey had consented to attend the wedding at Adam’s earnest
20481: request, under protest against marriage in general and the marriage of
20482: a sensible man in particular. Nevertheless, Mr. Poyser had a joke
20483: against him after the wedding dinner, to the effect that in the vestry
20484: he had given the bride one more kiss than was necessary.
20485: 
20486: Behind this last couple came Mr. Irwine, glad at heart over this good
20487: morning’s work of joining Adam and Dinah. For he had seen Adam in the
20488: worst moments of his sorrow; and what better harvest from that painful
20489: seed-time could there be than this? The love that had brought hope and
20490: comfort in the hour of despair, the love that had found its way to the
20491: dark prison cell and to poor Hetty’s darker soul—this strong gentle
20492: love was to be Adam’s companion and helper till death.
20493: 
20494: There was much shaking of hands mingled with “God bless you’s” and
20495: other good wishes to the four couples, at the churchyard gate, Mr.
20496: Poyser answering for the rest with unwonted vivacity of tongue, for he
20497: had all the appropriate wedding-day jokes at his command. And the
20498: women, he observed, could never do anything but put finger in eye at a
20499: wedding. Even Mrs. Poyser could not trust herself to speak as the
20500: neighbours shook hands with her, and Lisbeth began to cry in the face
20501: of the very first person who told her she was getting young again.
20502: 
20503: Mr. Joshua Rann, having a slight touch of rheumatism, did not join in
20504: the ringing of the bells this morning, and, looking on with some
20505: contempt at these informal greetings which required no official
20506: co-operation from the clerk, began to hum in his musical bass, “Oh what
20507: a joyful thing it is,” by way of preluding a little to the effect he
20508: intended to produce in the wedding psalm next Sunday.
20509: 
20510: “That’s a bit of good news to cheer Arthur,” said Mr. Irwine to his
20511: mother, as they drove off. “I shall write to him the first thing when
20512: we get home.”
20513: 
20514: 
20515: 
20516: 
20517: Epilogue
20518: 
20519: 
20520: It is near the end of June, in 1807. The workshops have been shut up
20521: half an hour or more in Adam Bede’s timber-yard, which used to be
20522: Jonathan Burge’s, and the mellow evening light is falling on the
20523: pleasant house with the buff walls and the soft grey thatch, very much
20524: as it did when we saw Adam bringing in the keys on that June evening
20525: nine years ago.
20526: 
20527: There is a figure we know well, just come out of the house, and shading
20528: her eyes with her hands as she looks for something in the distance, for
20529: the rays that fall on her white borderless cap and her pale auburn hair
20530: are very dazzling. But now she turns away from the sunlight and looks
20531: towards the door.
20532: 
20533: We can see the sweet pale face quite well now: it is scarcely at all
20534: altered—only a little fuller, to correspond to her more matronly
20535: figure, which still seems light and active enough in the plain black
20536: dress.
20537: 
20538: “I see him, Seth,” Dinah said, as she looked into the house. “Let us go
20539: and meet him. Come, Lisbeth, come with Mother.”
20540: 
20541: The last call was answered immediately by a small fair creature with
20542: pale auburn hair and grey eyes, little more than four years old, who
20543: ran out silently and put her hand into her mother’s.
20544: 
20545: “Come, Uncle Seth,” said Dinah.
20546: 
20547: “Aye, aye, we’re coming,” Seth answered from within, and presently
20548: appeared stooping under the doorway, being taller than usual by the
20549: black head of a sturdy two-year-old nephew, who had caused some delay
20550: by demanding to be carried on uncle’s shoulder.
20551: 
20552: “Better take him on thy arm, Seth,” said Dinah, looking fondly at the
20553: stout black-eyed fellow. “He’s troublesome to thee so.”
20554: 
20555: “Nay, nay: Addy likes a ride on my shoulder. I can carry him so for a
20556: bit.” A kindness which young Addy acknowledged by drumming his heels
20557: with promising force against Uncle Seth’s chest. But to walk by Dinah’s
20558: side, and be tyrannized over by Dinah’s and Adam’s children, was Uncle
20559: Seth’s earthly happiness.
20560: 
20561: “Where didst see him?” asked Seth, as they walked on into the adjoining
20562: field. “I can’t catch sight of him anywhere.”
20563: 
20564: “Between the hedges by the roadside,” said Dinah. “I saw his hat and
20565: his shoulder. There he is again.”
20566: 
20567: “Trust thee for catching sight of him if he’s anywhere to be seen,”
20568: said Seth, smiling. “Thee’t like poor mother used to be. She was always
20569: on the look out for Adam, and could see him sooner than other folks,
20570: for all her eyes got dim.”
20571: 
20572: “He’s been longer than he expected,” said Dinah, taking Arthur’s watch
20573: from a small side pocket and looking at it; “it’s nigh upon seven now.”
20574: 
20575: “Aye, they’d have a deal to say to one another,” said Seth, “and the
20576: meeting ’ud touch ’em both pretty closish. Why, it’s getting on towards
20577: eight years since they parted.”
20578: 
20579: “Yes,” said Dinah, “Adam was greatly moved this morning at the thought
20580: of the change he should see in the poor young man, from the sickness he
20581: has undergone, as well as the years which have changed us all. And the
20582: death of the poor wanderer, when she was coming back to us, has been
20583: sorrow upon sorrow.”
20584: 
20585: “See, Addy,” said Seth, lowering the young one to his arm now and
20586: pointing, “there’s Father coming—at the far stile.”
20587: 
20588: Dinah hastened her steps, and little Lisbeth ran on at her utmost speed
20589: till she clasped her father’s leg. Adam patted her head and lifted her
20590: up to kiss her, but Dinah could see the marks of agitation on his face
20591: as she approached him, and he put her arm within his in silence.
20592: 
20593: “Well, youngster, must I take you?” he said, trying to smile, when Addy
20594: stretched out his arms—ready, with the usual baseness of infancy, to
20595: give up his Uncle Seth at once, now there was some rarer patronage at
20596: hand.
20597: 
20598: “It’s cut me a good deal, Dinah,” Adam said at last, when they were
20599: walking on.
20600: 
20601: “Didst find him greatly altered?” said Dinah.
20602: 
20603: “Why, he’s altered and yet not altered. I should ha’ known him
20604: anywhere. But his colour’s changed, and he looks sadly. However, the
20605: doctors say he’ll soon be set right in his own country air. He’s all
20606: sound in th’ inside; it’s only the fever shattered him so. But he
20607: speaks just the same, and smiles at me just as he did when he was a
20608: lad. It’s wonderful how he’s always had just the same sort o’ look when
20609: he smiles.”
20610: 
20611: “I’ve never seen him smile, poor young man,” said Dinah.
20612: 
20613: “But thee _wilt_ see him smile, to-morrow,” said Adam. “He asked after
20614: thee the first thing when he began to come round, and we could talk to
20615: one another. ‘I hope she isn’t altered,’ he said, ‘I remember her face
20616: so well.’ I told him ‘no,’” Adam continued, looking fondly at the eyes
20617: that were turned towards his, “only a bit plumper, as thee’dst a right
20618: to be after seven year. ‘I may come and see her to-morrow, mayn’t I?’
20619: he said; ‘I long to tell her how I’ve thought of her all these years.’”
20620: 
20621: “Didst tell him I’d always used the watch?” said Dinah.
20622: 
20623: “Aye; and we talked a deal about thee, for he says he never saw a woman
20624: a bit like thee. ‘I shall turn Methodist some day,’ he said, ‘when she
20625: preaches out of doors, and go to hear her.’ And I said, ‘Nay, sir, you
20626: can’t do that, for Conference has forbid the women preaching, and she’s
20627: given it up, all but talking to the people a bit in their houses.’”
20628: 
20629: “Ah,” said Seth, who could not repress a comment on this point, “and a
20630: sore pity it was o’ Conference; and if Dinah had seen as I did, we’d
20631: ha’ left the Wesleyans and joined a body that ’ud put no bonds on
20632: Christian liberty.”
20633: 
20634: “Nay, lad, nay,” said Adam, “she was right and thee wast wrong. There’s
20635: no rules so wise but what it’s a pity for somebody or other. Most o’
20636: the women do more harm nor good with their preaching—they’ve not got
20637: Dinah’s gift nor her sperrit—and she’s seen that, and she thought it
20638: right to set th’ example o’ submitting, for she’s not held from other
20639: sorts o’ teaching. And I agree with her, and approve o’ what she did.”
20640: 
20641: Seth was silent. This was a standing subject of difference rarely
20642: alluded to, and Dinah, wishing to quit it at once, said, “Didst
20643: remember, Adam, to speak to Colonel Donnithorne the words my uncle and
20644: aunt entrusted to thee?”
20645: 
20646: “Yes, and he’s going to the Hall Farm with Mr. Irwine the day after
20647: to-morrow. Mr. Irwine came in while we were talking about it, and he
20648: would have it as the Colonel must see nobody but thee to-morrow. He
20649: said—and he’s in the right of it—as it’ll be bad for him t’ have his
20650: feelings stirred with seeing many people one after another. ‘We must
20651: get you strong and hearty,’ he said, ‘that’s the first thing to be done
20652: Arthur, and then you shall have your own way. But I shall keep you
20653: under your old tutor’s thumb till then.’ Mr. Irwine’s fine and joyful
20654: at having him home again.”
20655: 
20656: Adam was silent a little while, and then said, “It was very cutting
20657: when we first saw one another. He’d never heard about poor Hetty till
20658: Mr. Irwine met him in London, for the letters missed him on his
20659: journey. The first thing he said to me, when we’d got hold o’ one
20660: another’s hands was, ‘I could never do anything for her, Adam—she lived
20661: long enough for all the suffering—and I’d thought so of the time when I
20662: might do something for her. But you told me the truth when you said to
20663: me once, “There’s a sort of wrong that can never be made up for.”’”
20664: 
20665: “Why, there’s Mr. and Mrs. Poyser coming in at the yard gate,” said
20666: Seth.
20667: 
20668: “So there is,” said Dinah. “Run, Lisbeth, run to meet Aunt Poyser. Come
20669: in, Adam, and rest; it has been a hard day for thee.”
