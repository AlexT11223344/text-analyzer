12: CHAPTER I
13: 
14: 
15: The time of my end approaches. I have lately been subject to attacks of
16: _angina pectoris_; and in the ordinary course of things, my physician
17: tells me, I may fairly hope that my life will not be protracted
18: many months. Unless, then, I am cursed with an exceptional physical
19: constitution, as I am cursed with an exceptional mental character, I
20: shall not much longer groan under the wearisome burthen of this earthly
21: existence. If it were to be otherwise--if I were to live on to the age
22: most men desire and provide for--I should for once have known whether
23: the miseries of delusive expectation can outweigh the miseries of true
24: prevision. For I foresee when I shall die, and everything that will
25: happen in my last moments.
26: 
27: Just a month from this day, on September 20, 1850, I shall be sitting
28: in this chair, in this study, at ten o'clock at night, longing to die,
29: weary of incessant insight and foresight, without delusions and without
30: hope. Just as I am watching a tongue of blue flame rising in the fire,
31: and my lamp is burning low, the horrible contraction will begin at my
32: chest. I shall only have time to reach the bell, and pull it violently,
33: before the sense of suffocation will come. No one will answer my bell.
34: I know why. My two servants are lovers, and will have quarrelled. My
35: housekeeper will have rushed out of the house in a fury, two hours
36: before, hoping that Perry will believe she has gone to drown herself.
37: Perry is alarmed at last, and is gone out after her. The little
38: scullery-maid is asleep on a bench: she never answers the bell; it does
39: not wake her. The sense of suffocation increases: my lamp goes out with
40: a horrible stench: I make a great effort, and snatch at the bell again.
41: I long for life, and there is no help. I thirsted for the unknown:
42: the thirst is gone. O God, let me stay with the known, and be weary
43: of it: I am content. Agony of pain and suffocation--and all the while
44: the earth, the fields, the pebbly brook at the bottom of the rookery,
45: the fresh scent after the rain, the light of the morning through my
46: chamber-window, the warmth of the hearth after the frosty air--will
47: darkness close over them for ever?
48: 
49: Darkness--darkness--no pain--nothing but darkness: but I am passing
50: on and on through the darkness: my thought stays in the darkness, but
51: always with a sense of moving onward . . .
52: 
53: Before that time comes, I wish to use my last hours of ease and
54: strength in telling the strange story of my experience. I have never
55: fully unbosomed myself to any human being; I have never been encouraged
56: to trust much in the sympathy of my fellow-men. But we have all a
57: chance of meeting with some pity, some tenderness, some charity, when
58: we are dead: it is the living only who cannot be forgiven--the living
59: only from whom men's indulgence and reverence are held off, like the
60: rain by the hard east wind. While the heart beats, bruise it--it is
61: your only opportunity; while the eye can still turn towards you with
62: moist, timid entreaty, freeze it with an icy unanswering gaze; while
63: the ear, that delicate messenger to the inmost sanctuary of the soul,
64: can still take in the tones of kindness, put it off with hard civility,
65: or sneering compliment, or envious affectation of indifference; while
66: the creative brain can still throb with the sense of injustice,
67: with the yearning for brotherly recognition--make haste--oppress it
68: with your ill-considered judgements, your trivial comparisons, your
69: careless misrepresentations. The heart will by and by be still--"ubi
70: saeva indignatio ulterius cor lacerare nequit"; the eye will cease to
71: entreat; the ear will be deaf; the brain will have ceased from all
72: wants as well as from all work. Then your charitable speeches may find
73: vent; then you may remember and pity the toil and the struggle and the
74: failure; then you may give due honour to the work achieved; then you
75: may find extenuation for errors, and may consent to bury them.
76: 
77: That is a trivial schoolboy text; why do I dwell on it? It has little
78: reference to me, for I shall leave no works behind me for men to
79: honour. I have no near relatives who will make up, by weeping over my
80: grave, for the wounds they inflicted on me when I was among them. It is
81: only the story of my life that will perhaps win a little more sympathy
82: from strangers when I am dead, than I ever believed it would obtain
83: from my friends while I was living.
84: 
85: My childhood perhaps seems happier to me than it really was, by
86: contrast with all the after-years. For then the curtain of the future
87: was as impenetrable to me as to other children: I had all their delight
88: in the present hour, their sweet indefinite hopes for the morrow; and
89: I had a tender mother: even now, after the dreary lapse of long years,
90: a slight trace of sensation accompanies the remembrance of her caress
91: as she held me on her knee--her arms round my little body, her cheek
92: pressed on mine. I had a complaint of the eyes that made me blind for a
93: little while, and she kept me on her knee from morning till night. That
94: unequalled love soon vanished out of my life, and even to my childish
95: consciousness it was as if that life had become more chill. I rode my
96: little white pony with the groom by my side as before, but there were
97: no loving eyes looking at me as I mounted, no glad arms opened to me
98: when I came back. Perhaps I missed my mother's love more than most
99: children of seven or eight would have done, to whom the other pleasures
100: of life remained as before; for I was certainly a very sensitive child.
101: I remember still the mingled trepidation and delicious excitement with
102: which I was affected by the tramping of the horses on the pavement
103: in the echoing stables, by the loud resonance of the groom's voices,
104: by the booming bark of the dogs as my father's carriage thundered
105: under the archway of the courtyard, by the din of the gong as it gave
106: notice of luncheon and dinner. The measured tramp of soldiery which I
107: sometimes heard--for my father's house lay near a county town where
108: there were large barracks--made me sob and tremble; and yet when they
109: were gone past, I longed for them to come back again.
110: 
111: I fancy my father thought me an odd child, and had little fondness for
112: me; though he was very careful in fulfilling what he regarded as a
113: parent's duties. But he was already past the middle of life, and I was
114: not his only son. My mother had been his second wife, and he was five-
115: and-forty when he married her. He was a firm, unbending, intensely
116: orderly man, in root and stem a banker, but with a flourishing graft
117: of the active landholder, aspiring to county influence: one of those
118: people who are always like themselves from day to day, who are
119: uninfluenced by the weather, and neither know melancholy nor high
120: spirits. I held him in great awe, and appeared more timid and sensitive
121: in his presence than at other times; a circumstance which, perhaps,
122: helped to confirm him in the intention to educate me on a different
123: plan from the prescriptive one with which he had complied in the case
124: of my elder brother, already a tall youth at Eton. My brother was to
125: be his representative and successor; he must go to Eton and Oxford,
126: for the sake of making connexions, of course: my father was not a man
127: to underrate the bearing of Latin satirists or Greek dramatists on the
128: attainment of an aristocratic position. But, intrinsically, he had
129: slight esteem for "those dead but sceptred spirits"; having qualified
130: himself for forming an independent opinion by reading Potter's
131: _AEschylus_, and dipping into Francis's _Horace_. To this negative
132: view he added a positive one, derived from a recent connexion with
133: mining speculations; namely, that a scientific education was the really
134: useful training for a younger son. Moreover, it was clear that a shy,
135: sensitive boy like me was not fit to encounter the rough experience
136: of a public school. Mr. Letherall had said so very decidedly. Mr.
137: Letherall was a large man in spectacles, who one day took my small
138: head between his large hands, and pressed it here and there in an
139: exploratory, auspicious manner--then placed each of his great thumbs on
140: my temples, and pushed me a little way from him, and stared at me with
141: glittering spectacles. The contemplation appeared to displease him, for
142: he frowned sternly, and said to my father, drawing his thumbs across my
143: eyebrows--
144: 
145: "The deficiency is there, sir--there; and here," he added, touching the
146: upper sides of my head, "here is the excess. That must be brought out,
147: sir, and this must be laid to sleep."
148: 
149: I was in a state of tremor, partly at the vague idea that I was
150: the object of reprobation, partly in the agitation of my first
151: hatred--hatred of this big, spectacled man, who pulled my head about as
152: if he wanted to buy and cheapen it.
153: 
154: I am not aware how much Mr. Letherall had to do with the system
155: afterwards adopted towards me, but it was presently clear that private
156: tutors, natural history, science, and the modern languages, were the
157: appliances by which the defects of my organization were to be remedied.
158: I was very stupid about machines, so I was to be greatly occupied
159: with them; I had no memory for classification, so it was particularly
160: necessary that I should study systematic zoology and botany; I was
161: hungry for human deeds and humane motions, so I was to be plentifully
162: crammed with the mechanical powers, the elementary bodies, and the
163: phenomena of electricity and magnetism. A better-constituted boy
164: would certainly have profited under my intelligent tutors, with their
165: scientific apparatus; and would, doubtless, have found the phenomena
166: of electricity and magnetism as fascinating as I was, every Thursday,
167: assured they were. As it was, I could have paired off, for ignorance
168: of whatever was taught me, with the worst Latin scholar that was ever
169: turned out of a classical academy. I read Plutarch, and Shakespeare,
170: and Don Quixote by the sly, and supplied myself in that way with
171: wandering thoughts, while my tutor was assuring me that "an improved
172: man, as distinguished from an ignorant one, was a man who knew the
173: reason why water ran downhill." I had no desire to be this improved
174: man; I was glad of the running water; I could watch it and listen to it
175: gurgling among the pebbles, and bathing the bright green water-plants,
176: by the hour together. I did not want to know _why_ it ran; I had
177: perfect confidence that there were good reasons for what was so very
178: beautiful.
179: 
180: There is no need to dwell on this part of my life. I have said enough
181: to indicate that my nature was of the sensitive, unpractical order,
182: and that it grew up in an uncongenial medium, which could never foster
183: it into happy, healthy development. When I was sixteen I was sent to
184: Geneva to complete my course of education; and the change was a very
185: happy one to me, for the first sight of the Alps, with the setting
186: sun on them, as we descended the Jura, seemed to me like an entrance
187: into heaven; and the three years of my life there were spent in a
188: perpetual sense of exaltation, as if from a draught of delicious wine,
189: at the presence of Nature in all her awful loveliness. You will think,
190: perhaps, that I must have been a poet, from this early sensibility to
191: Nature. But my lot was not so happy as that. A poet pours forth his
192: song and _believes_ in the listening ear and answering soul, to which
193: his song will be floated sooner or later. But the poet's sensibility
194: without his voice--the poet's sensibility that finds no vent but in
195: silent tears on the sunny bank, when the noonday light sparkles on the
196: water, or in an inward shudder at the sound of harsh human tones, the
197: sight of a cold human eye--this dumb passion brings with it a fatal
198: solitude of soul in the society of one's fellow-men. My least solitary
199: moments were those in which I pushed off in my boat, at evening,
200: towards the centre of the lake; it seemed to me that the sky, and the
201: glowing mountain-tops, and the wide blue water, surrounded me with a
202: cherishing love such as no human face had shed on me since my mother's
203: love had vanished out of my life. I used to do as Jean Jacques did--lie
204: down in my boat and let it glide where it would, while I looked up at
205: the departing glow leaving one mountain-top after the other, as if the
206: prophet's chariot of fire were passing over them on its way to the home
207: of light. Then, when the white summits were all sad and corpse-like,
208: I had to push homeward, for I was under careful surveillance, and was
209: allowed no late wanderings. This disposition of mine was not favourable
210: to the formation of intimate friendships among the numerous youths of
211: my own age who are always to be found studying at Geneva. Yet I made
212: _one_ such friendship; and, singularly enough, it was with a youth
213: whose intellectual tendencies were the very reverse of my own. I shall
214: call him Charles Meunier; his real surname--an English one, for he
215: was of English extraction--having since become celebrated. He was an
216: orphan, who lived on a miserable pittance while he pursued the medical
217: studies for which he had a special genius. Strange! that with my vague
218: mind, susceptible and unobservant, hating inquiry and given up to
219: contemplation, I should have been drawn towards a youth whose strongest
220: passion was science. But the bond was not an intellectual one; it came
221: from a source that can happily blend the stupid with the brilliant, the
222: dreamy with the practical: it came from community of feeling. Charles
223: was poor and ugly, derided by Genevese _gamins_, and not acceptable
224: in drawing-rooms. I saw that he was isolated, as I was, though from a
225: different cause, and, stimulated by a sympathetic resentment, I made
226: timid advances towards him. It is enough to say that there sprang up
227: as much comradeship between us as our different habits would allow;
228: and in Charles's rare holidays we went up the Saleve together, or
229: took the boat to Vevay, while I listened dreamily to the monologues
230: in which he unfolded his bold conceptions of future experiment and
231: discovery. I mingled them confusedly in my thought with glimpses of
232: blue water and delicate floating cloud, with the notes of birds and
233: the distant glitter of the glacier. He knew quite well that my mind
234: was half absent, yet he liked to talk to me in this way; for don't we
235: talk of our hopes and our projects even to dogs and birds, when they
236: love us? I have mentioned this one friendship because of its connexion
237: with a strange and terrible scene which I shall have to narrate in my
238: subsequent life.
239: 
240: This happier life at Geneva was put an end to by a severe illness,
241: which is partly a blank to me, partly a time of dimly-remembered
242: suffering, with the presence of my father by my bed from time to time.
243: Then came the languid monotony of convalescence, the days gradually
244: breaking into variety and distinctness as my strength enabled me to
245: take longer and longer drives. On one of these more vividly remembered
246: days, my father said to me, as he sat beside my sofa--
247: 
248: "When you are quite well enough to travel, Latimer, I shall take you
249: home with me. The journey will amuse you and do you good, for I shall
250: go through the Tyrol and Austria, and you will see many new places. Our
251: neighbours, the Filmores, are come; Alfred will join us at Basle, and
252: we shall all go together to Vienna, and back by Prague" . . .
253: 
254: My father was called away before he had finished his sentence, and
255: he left my mind resting on the word _Prague_, with a strange sense
256: that a new and wondrous scene was breaking upon me: a city under the
257: broad sunshine, that seemed to me as if it were the summer sunshine
258: of a long-past century arrested in its course--unrefreshed for ages
259: by dews of night, or the rushing rain-cloud; scorching the dusty,
260: weary, time-eaten grandeur of a people doomed to live on in the stale
261: repetition of memories, like deposed and superannuated kings in their
262: regal gold-inwoven tatters. The city looked so thirsty that the broad
263: river seemed to me a sheet of metal; and the blackened statues, as I
264: passed under their blank gaze, along the unending bridge, with their
265: ancient garments and their saintly crowns, seemed to me the real
266: inhabitants and owners of this place, while the busy, trivial men
267: and women, hurrying to and fro, were a swarm of ephemeral visitants
268: infesting it for a day. It is such grim, stony beings as these, I
269: thought, who are the fathers of ancient faded children, in those tanned
270: time-fretted dwellings that crowd the steep before me; who pay their
271: court in the worn and crumbling pomp of the palace which stretches its
272: monotonous length on the height; who worship wearily in the stifling
273: air of the churches, urged by no fear or hope, but compelled by their
274: doom to be ever old and undying, to live on in the rigidity of habit,
275: as they live on in perpetual midday, without the repose of night or the
276: new birth of morning.
277: 
278: A stunning clang of metal suddenly thrilled through me, and I became
279: conscious of the objects in my room again: one of the fire-irons had
280: fallen as Pierre opened the door to bring me my draught. My heart was
281: palpitating violently, and I begged Pierre to leave my draught beside
282: me; I would take it presently.
283: 
284: As soon as I was alone again, I began to ask myself whether I had been
285: sleeping. Was this a dream--this wonderfully distinct vision--minute
286: in its distinctness down to a patch of rainbow light on the pavement,
287: transmitted through a coloured lamp in the shape of a star--of a
288: strange city, quite unfamiliar to my imagination? I had seen no picture
289: of Prague: it lay in my mind as a mere name, with vaguely-remembered
290: historical associations--ill-defined memories of imperial grandeur and
291: religious wars.
292: 
293: Nothing of this sort had ever occurred in my dreaming experience
294: before, for I had often been humiliated because my dreams were only
295: saved from being utterly disjointed and commonplace by the frequent
296: terrors of nightmare. But I could not believe that I had been asleep,
297: for I remembered distinctly the gradual breaking-in of the vision
298: upon me, like the new images in a dissolving view, or the growing
299: distinctness of the landscape as the sun lifts up the veil of the
300: morning mist. And while I was conscious of this incipient vision, I
301: was also conscious that Pierre came to tell my father Mr. Filmore was
302: waiting for him, and that my father hurried out of the room. No, it was
303: not a dream; was it--the thought was full of tremulous exultation--was
304: it the poet's nature in me, hitherto only a troubled yearning
305: sensibility, now manifesting itself suddenly as spontaneous creation?
306: Surely it was in this way that Homer saw the plain of Troy, that Dante
307: saw the abodes of the departed, that Milton saw the earthward flight of
308: the Tempter. Was it that my illness had wrought some happy change in
309: my organization--given a firmer tension to my nerves--carried off some
310: dull obstruction? I had often read of such effects--in works of fiction
311: at least. Nay; in genuine biographies I had read of the subtilizing
312: or exalting influence of some diseases on the mental powers. Did
313: not Novalis feel his inspiration intensified under the progress of
314: consumption?
315: 
316: When my mind had dwelt for some time on this blissful idea, it seemed
317: to me that I might perhaps test it by an exertion of my will. The
318: vision had begun when my father was speaking of our going to Prague.
319: I did not for a moment believe it was really a representation of that
320: city; I believed--I hoped it was a picture that my newly liberated
321: genius had painted in fiery haste, with the colours snatched from lazy
322: memory. Suppose I were to fix my mind on some other place--Venice, for
323: example, which was far more familiar to my imagination than Prague:
324: perhaps the same sort of result would follow. I concentrated my
325: thoughts on Venice; I stimulated my imagination with poetic memories,
326: and strove to feel myself present in Venice, as I had felt myself
327: present in Prague. But in vain. I was only colouring the Canaletto
328: engravings that hung in my old bedroom at home; the picture was a
329: shifting one, my mind wandering uncertainly in search of more vivid
330: images; I could see no accident of form or shadow without conscious
331: labour after the necessary conditions. It was all prosaic effort, not
332: rapt passivity, such as I had experienced half an hour before. I was
333: discouraged; but I remembered that inspiration was fitful.
334: 
335: For several days I was in a state of excited expectation, watching for
336: a recurrence of my new gift. I sent my thoughts ranging over my world
337: of knowledge, in the hope that they would find some object which would
338: send a reawakening vibration through my slumbering genius. But no; my
339: world remained as dim as ever, and that flash of strange light refused
340: to come again, though I watched for it with palpitating eagerness.
341: 
342: My father accompanied me every day in a drive, and a gradually
343: lengthening walk as my powers of walking increased; and one evening he
344: had agreed to come and fetch me at twelve the next day, that we might
345: go together to select a musical box, and other purchases rigorously
346: demanded of a rich Englishman visiting Geneva. He was one of the most
347: punctual of men and bankers, and I was always nervously anxious to be
348: quite ready for him at the appointed time. But, to my surprise, at a
349: quarter past twelve he had not appeared. I felt all the impatience of a
350: convalescent who has nothing particular to do, and who has just taken
351: a tonic in the prospect of immediate exercise that would carry off the
352: stimulus.
353: 
354: Unable to sit still and reserve my strength, I walked up and down the
355: room, looking out on the current of the Rhone, just where it leaves the
356: dark-blue lake; but thinking all the while of the possible causes that
357: could detain my father.
358: 
359: Suddenly I was conscious that my father was in the room, but not alone:
360: there were two persons with him. Strange! I had heard no footstep, I
361: had not seen the door open; but I saw my father, and at his right hand
362: our neighbour Mrs. Filmore, whom I remembered very well, though I had
363: not seen her for five years. She was a commonplace middle-aged woman,
364: in silk and cashmere; but the lady on the left of my father was not
365: more than twenty, a tall, slim, willowy figure, with luxuriant blond
366: hair, arranged in cunning braids and folds that looked almost too
367: massive for the slight figure and the small-featured, thin-lipped face
368: they crowned. But the face had not a girlish expression: the features
369: were sharp, the pale grey eyes at once acute, restless, and sarcastic.
370: They were fixed on me in half-smiling curiosity, and I felt a painful
371: sensation as if a sharp wind were cutting me. The pale-green dress,
372: and the green leaves that seemed to form a border about her pale blond
373: hair, made me think of a Water-Nixie--for my mind was full of German
374: lyrics, and this pale, fatal-eyed woman, with the green weeds, looked
375: like a birth from some cold sedgy stream, the daughter of an aged river.
376: 
377: "Well, Latimer, you thought me long," my father said . . .
378: 
379: But while the last word was in my ears, the whole group vanished, and
380: there was nothing between me and the Chinese printed folding-screen
381: that stood before the door. I was cold and trembling; I could only
382: totter forward and throw myself on the sofa. This strange new power had
383: manifested itself again . . . But _was_ it a power? Might it not rather
384: be a disease--a sort of intermittent delirium, concentrating my energy
385: of brain into moments of unhealthy activity, and leaving my saner hours
386: all the more barren? I felt a dizzy sense of unreality in what my eye
387: rested on; I grasped the bell convulsively, like one trying to free
388: himself from nightmare, and rang it twice. Pierre came with a look of
389: alarm in his face.
390: 
391: "Monsieur ne se trouve pas bien?" he said anxiously.
392: 
393: "I'm tired of waiting, Pierre," I said, as distinctly and emphatically
394: as I could, like a man determined to be sober in spite of wine; "I'm
395: afraid something has happened to my father--he's usually so punctual.
396: Run to the Hotel des Bergues and see if he is there."
397: 
398: Pierre left the room at once, with a soothing "Bien, Monsieur"; and I
399: felt the better for this scene of simple, waking prose. Seeking to calm
400: myself still further, I went into my bedroom, adjoining the _salon_,
401: and opened a case of eau-de-Cologne; took out a bottle; went through
402: the process of taking out the cork very neatly, and then rubbed the
403: reviving spirit over my hands and forehead, and under my nostrils,
404: drawing a new delight from the scent because I had procured it by slow
405: details of labour, and by no strange sudden madness. Already I had
406: begun to taste something of the horror that belongs to the lot of a
407: human being whose nature is not adjusted to simple human conditions.
408: 
409: Still enjoying the scent, I returned to the salon, but it was not
410: unoccupied, as it had been before I left it. In front of the Chinese
411: folding-screen there was my father, with Mrs. Filmore on his right
412: hand, and on his left--the slim, blond-haired girl, with the keen face
413: and the keen eyes fixed on me in half-smiling curiosity.
414: 
415: "Well, Latimer, you thought me long," my father said . . .
416: 
417: I heard no more, felt no more, till I became conscious that I was lying
418: with my head low on the sofa, Pierre, and my father by my side. As soon
419: as I was thoroughly revived, my father left the room, and presently
420: returned, saying--
421: 
422: "I've been to tell the ladies how you are, Latimer. They were waiting
423: in the next room. We shall put off our shopping expedition to-day."
424: 
425: Presently he said, "That young lady is Bertha Grant, Mrs. Filmore's
426: orphan niece. Filmore has adopted her, and she lives with them, so
427: you will have her for a neighbour when we go home--perhaps for a near
428: relation; for there is a tenderness between her and Alfred, I suspect,
429: and I should be gratified by the match, since Filmore means to provide
430: for her in every way as if she were his daughter. It had not occurred
431: to me that you knew nothing about her living with the Filmores."
432: 
433: He made no further allusion to the fact of my having fainted at the
434: moment of seeing her, and I would not for the world have told him the
435: reason: I shrank from the idea of disclosing to any one what might be
436: regarded as a pitiable peculiarity, most of all from betraying it to my
437: father, who would have suspected my sanity ever after.
438: 
439: I do not mean to dwell with particularity on the details of my
440: experience. I have described these two cases at length, because they
441: had definite, clearly traceable results in my after-lot.
442: 
443: Shortly after this last occurrence--I think the very next day--I began
444: to be aware of a phase in my abnormal sensibility, to which, from
445: the languid and slight nature of my intercourse with others since my
446: illness, I had not been alive before. This was the obtrusion on my
447: mind of the mental process going forward in first one person, and
448: then another, with whom I happened to be in contact: the vagrant,
449: frivolous ideas and emotions of some uninteresting acquaintance--Mrs.
450: Filmore, for example--would force themselves on my consciousness like
451: an importunate, ill-played musical instrument, or the loud activity
452: of an imprisoned insect. But this unpleasant sensibility was fitful,
453: and left me moments of rest, when the souls of my companions were once
454: more shut out from me, and I felt a relief such as silence brings to
455: wearied nerves. I might have believed this importunate insight to be
456: merely a diseased activity of the imagination, but that my prevision of
457: incalculable words and actions proved it to have a fixed relation to
458: the mental process in other minds. But this superadded consciousness,
459: wearying and annoying enough when it urged on me the trivial experience
460: of indifferent people, became an intense pain and grief when it seemed
461: to be opening to me the souls of those who were in a close relation to
462: me--when the rational talk, the graceful attentions, the wittily-turned
463: phrases, and the kindly deeds, which used to make the web of their
464: characters, were seen as if thrust asunder by a microscopic vision,
465: that showed all the intermediate frivolities, all the suppressed
466: egoism, all the struggling chaos of puerilities, meanness, vague
467: capricious memories, and indolent make-shift thoughts, from which human
468: words and deeds emerge like leaflets covering a fermenting heap.
469: 
470: At Basle we were joined by my brother Alfred, now a handsome,
471: self-confident man of six-and-twenty--a thorough contrast to my
472: fragile, nervous, ineffectual self. I believe I was held to have a sort
473: of half-womanish, half-ghostly beauty; for the portrait-painters,
474: who are thick as weeds at Geneva, had often asked me to sit to them,
475: and I had been the model of a dying minstrel in a fancy picture. But
476: I thoroughly disliked my own physique and nothing but the belief that
477: it was a condition of poetic genius would have reconciled me to it.
478: That brief hope was quite fled, and I saw in my face now nothing but
479: the stamp of a morbid organization, framed for passive suffering--too
480: feeble for the sublime resistance of poetic production. Alfred, from
481: whom I had been almost constantly separated, and who, in his present
482: stage of character and appearance, came before me as a perfect
483: stranger, was bent on being extremely friendly and brother-like to me.
484: He had the superficial kindness of a good-humoured, self-satisfied
485: nature, that fears no rivalry, and has encountered no contrarieties.
486: I am not sure that my disposition was good enough for me to have been
487: quite free from envy towards him, even if our desires had not clashed,
488: and if I had been in the healthy human condition which admits of
489: generous confidence and charitable construction. There must always have
490: been an antipathy between our natures. As it was, he became in a few
491: weeks an object of intense hatred to me; and when he entered the room,
492: still more when he spoke, it was as if a sensation of grating metal had
493: set my teeth on edge. My diseased consciousness was more intensely and
494: continually occupied with his thoughts and emotions, than with those of
495: any other person who came in my way. I was perpetually exasperated with
496: the petty promptings of his conceit and his love of patronage, with
497: his self-complacent belief in Bertha Grant's passion for him, with his
498: half-pitying contempt for me--seen not in the ordinary indications of
499: intonation and phrase and slight action, which an acute and suspicious
500: mind is on the watch for, but in all their naked skinless complication.
501: 
502: For we were rivals, and our desires clashed, though he was not aware
503: of it. I have said nothing yet of the effect Bertha Grant produced in
504: me on a nearer acquaintance. That effect was chiefly determined by
505: the fact that she made the only exception, among all the human beings
506: about me, to my unhappy gift of insight. About Bertha I was always
507: in a state of uncertainty: I could watch the expression of her face,
508: and speculate on its meaning; I could ask for her opinion with the
509: real interest of ignorance; I could listen for her words and watch
510: for her smile with hope and fear: she had for me the fascination of
511: an unravelled destiny. I say it was this fact that chiefly determined
512: the strong effect she produced on me: for, in the abstract, no womanly
513: character could seem to have less affinity for that of a shrinking,
514: romantic, passionate youth than Bertha's. She was keen, sarcastic,
515: unimaginative, prematurely cynical, remaining critical and unmoved
516: in the most impressive scenes, inclined to dissect all my favourite
517: poems, and especially contemptous towards the German lyrics which
518: were my pet literature at that time. To this moment I am unable to
519: define my feeling towards her: it was not ordinary boyish admiration,
520: for she was the very opposite, even to the colour of her hair, of the
521: ideal woman who still remained to me the type of loveliness; and she
522: was without that enthusiasm for the great and good, which, even at
523: the moment of her strongest dominion over me, I should have declared
524: to be the highest element of character. But there is no tyranny more
525: complete than that which a self-centred negative nature exercises over
526: a morbidly sensitive nature perpetually craving sympathy and support.
527: The most independent people feel the effect of a man's silence in
528: heightening their value for his opinion--feel an additional triumph in
529: conquering the reverence of a critic habitually captious and satirical:
530: no wonder, then, that an enthusiastic self-distrusting youth should
531: watch and wait before the closed secret of a sarcastic woman's face, as
532: if it were the shrine of the doubtfully benignant deity who ruled his
533: destiny. For a young enthusiast is unable to imagine the total negation
534: in another mind of the emotions which are stirring his own: they may
535: be feeble, latent, inactive, he thinks, but they are there--they may
536: be called forth; sometimes, in moments of happy hallucination, he
537: believes they may be there in all the greater strength because he sees
538: no outward sign of them. And this effect, as I have intimated, was
539: heightened to its utmost intensity in me, because Bertha was the only
540: being who remained for me in the mysterious seclusion of soul that
541: renders such youthful delusion possible. Doubtless there was another
542: sort of fascination at work--that subtle physical attraction which
543: delights in cheating our psychological predictions, and in compelling
544: the men who paint sylphs, to fall in love with some _bonne et brave
545: femme_, heavy-heeled and freckled.
546: 
547: Bertha's behaviour towards me was such as to encourage all my
548: illusions, to heighten my boyish passion, and make me more and more
549: dependent on her smiles. Looking back with my present wretched
550: knowledge, I conclude that her vanity and love of power were intensely
551: gratified by the belief that I had fainted on first seeing her purely
552: from the strong impression her person had produced on me. The most
553: prosaic woman likes to believe herself the object of a violent, a
554: poetic passion; and without a grain of romance in her, Bertha had that
555: spirit of intrigue which gave piquancy to the idea that the brother of
556: the man she meant to marry was dying with love and jealousy for her
557: sake. That she meant to marry my brother, was what at that time I did
558: not believe; for though he was assiduous in his attentions to her, and
559: I knew well enough that both he and my father had made up their minds
560: to this result, there was not yet an understood engagement--there had
561: been no explicit declaration; and Bertha habitually, while she flirted
562: with my brother, and accepted his homage in a way that implied to him a
563: thorough recognition of its intention, made me believe, by the subtlest
564: looks and phrases--feminine nothings which could never be quoted
565: against her--that he was really the object of her secret ridicule; that
566: she thought him, as I did, a coxcomb, whom she would have pleasure
567: in disappointing. Me she openly petted in my brother's presence, as
568: if I were too young and sickly ever to be thought of as a lover; and
569: that was the view he took of me. But I believe she must inwardly have
570: delighted in the tremors into which she threw me by the coaxing way in
571: which she patted my curls, while she laughed at my quotations. Such
572: caresses were always given in the presence of our friends; for when we
573: were alone together, she affected a much greater distance towards me,
574: and now and then took the opportunity, by words or slight actions, to
575: stimulate my foolish timid hope that she really preferred me. And why
576: should she not follow her inclination? I was not in so advantageous a
577: position as my brother, but I had fortune, I was not a year younger
578: than she was, and she was an heiress, who would soon be of age to
579: decide for herself.
580: 
581: The fluctuations of hope and fear, confined to this one channel, made
582: each day in her presence a delicious torment. There was one deliberate
583: act of hers which especially helped to intoxicate me. When we were at
584: Vienna her twentieth birthday occurred, and as she was very fond of
585: ornaments, we all took the opportunity of the splendid jewellers' shops
586: in that Teutonic Paris to purchase her a birthday present of jewellery.
587: Mine, naturally, was the least expensive; it was an opal ring--the opal
588: was my favourite stone, because it seems to blush and turn pale as if
589: it had a soul. I told Bertha so when I gave it her, and said that it
590: was an emblem of the poetic nature, changing with the changing light
591: of heaven and of woman's eyes. In the evening she appeared elegantly
592: dressed, and wearing conspicuously all the birthday presents except
593: mine. I looked eagerly at her fingers, but saw no opal. I had no
594: opportunity of noticing this to her during the evening; but the next
595: day, when I found her seated near the window alone, after breakfast,
596: I said, "You scorn to wear my poor opal. I should have remembered
597: that you despised poetic natures, and should have given you coral, or
598: turquoise, or some other opaque unresponsive stone." "Do I despise it?"
599: she answered, taking hold of a delicate gold chain which she always
600: wore round her neck and drawing out the end from her bosom with my ring
601: hanging to it; "it hurts me a little, I can tell you," she said, with
602: her usual dubious smile, "to wear it in that secret place; and since
603: your poetical nature is so stupid as to prefer a more public position,
604: I shall not endure the pain any longer."
605: 
606: She took off the ring from the chain and put it on her finger, smiling
607: still, while the blood rushed to my cheeks, and I could not trust
608: myself to say a word of entreaty that she would keep the ring where it
609: was before.
610: 
611: I was completely fooled by this, and for two days shut myself up in my
612: own room whenever Bertha was absent, that I might intoxicate myself
613: afresh with the thought of this scene and all it implied.
614: 
615: I should mention that during these two months--which seemed a long
616: life to me from the novelty and intensity of the pleasures and pains
617: I underwent--my diseased anticipation in other people's consciousness
618: continued to torment me; now it was my father, and now my brother,
619: now Mrs. Filmore or her husband, and now our German courier, whose
620: stream of thought rushed upon me like a ringing in the ears not to be
621: got rid of, though it allowed my own impulses and ideas to continue
622: their uninterrupted course. It was like a preternaturally heightened
623: sense of hearing, making audible to one a roar of sound where others
624: find perfect stillness. The weariness and disgust of this involuntary
625: intrusion into other souls was counteracted only by my ignorance
626: of Bertha, and my growing passion for her; a passion enormously
627: stimulated, if not produced, by that ignorance. She was my oasis of
628: mystery in the dreary desert of knowledge. I had never allowed my
629: diseased condition to betray itself, or to drive me into any unusual
630: speech or action, except once, when, in a moment of peculiar bitterness
631: against my brother, I had forestalled some words which I knew he was
632: going to utter--a clever observation, which he had prepared beforehand.
633: He had occasionally a slightly affected hesitation in his speech,
634: and when he paused an instant after the second word, my impatience
635: and jealousy impelled me to continue the speech for him, as if it
636: were something we had both learned by rote. He coloured and looked
637: astonished, as well as annoyed; and the words had no sooner escaped
638: my lips than I felt a shock of alarm lest such an anticipation of
639: words--very far from being words of course, easy to divine--should
640: have betrayed me as an exceptional being, a sort of quiet energumen,
641: whom every one, Bertha above all, would shudder at and avoid. But I
642: magnified, as usual, the impression any word or deed of mine could
643: produce on others; for no one gave any sign of having noticed my
644: interruption as more than a rudeness, to be forgiven me on the score of
645: my feeble nervous condition.
646: 
647: While this superadded consciousness of the actual was almost constant
648: with me, I had never had a recurrence of that distinct prevision which
649: I have described in relation to my first interview with Bertha; and I
650: was waiting with eager curiosity to know whether or not my vision of
651: Prague would prove to have been an instance of the same kind. A few
652: days after the incident of the opal ring, we were paying one of our
653: frequent visits to the Lichtenberg Palace. I could never look at many
654: pictures in succession; for pictures, when they are at all powerful,
655: affect me so strongly that one or two exhaust all my capability of
656: contemplation. This morning I had been looking at Giorgione's picture
657: of the cruel-eyed woman, said to be a likeness of Lucrezia Borgia. I
658: had stood long alone before it, fascinated by the terrible reality
659: of that cunning, relentless face, till I felt a strange poisoned
660: sensation, as if I had long been inhaling a fatal odour, and was just
661: beginning to be conscious of its effects. Perhaps even then I should
662: not have moved away, if the rest of the party had not returned to this
663: room, and announced that they were going to the Belvedere Gallery to
664: settle a bet which had arisen between my brother and Mr. Filmore about
665: a portrait. I followed them dreamily, and was hardly alive to what
666: occurred till they had all gone up to the gallery, leaving me below;
667: for I refused to come within sight of another picture that day. I made
668: my way to the Grand Terrace, since it was agreed that we should saunter
669: in the gardens when the dispute had been decided. I had been sitting
670: here a short space, vaguely conscious of trim gardens, with a city and
671: green hills in the distance, when, wishing to avoid the proximity of
672: the sentinel, I rose and walked down the broad stone steps, intending
673: to seat myself farther on in the gardens. Just as I reached the
674: gravel-walk, I felt an arm slipped within mine, and a light hand gently
675: pressing my wrist. In the same instant a strange intoxicating numbness
676: passed over me, like the continuance or climax of the sensation I was
677: still feeling from the gaze of Lucrezia Borgia. The gardens, the summer
678: sky, the consciousness of Bertha's arm being within mine, all vanished,
679: and I seemed to be suddenly in darkness, out of which there gradually
680: broke a dim firelight, and I felt myself sitting in my father's leather
681: chair in the library at home. I knew the fireplace--the dogs for
682: the wood-fire--the black marble chimney-piece with the white marble
683: medallion of the dying Cleopatra in the centre. Intense and hopeless
684: misery was pressing on my soul; the light became stronger, for Bertha
685: was entering with a candle in her hand--Bertha, my wife--with cruel
686: eyes, with green jewels and green leaves on her white ball-dress; every
687: hateful thought within her present to me . . . "Madman, idiot! why
688: don't you kill yourself, then?" It was a moment of hell. I saw into
689: her pitiless soul--saw its barren worldliness, its scorching hate--and
690: felt it clothe me round like an air I was obliged to breathe. She came
691: with her candle and stood over me with a bitter smile of contempt;
692: I saw the great emerald brooch on her bosom, a studded serpent with
693: diamond eyes. I shuddered--I despised this woman with the barren soul
694: and mean thoughts; but I felt helpless before her, as if she clutched
695: my bleeding heart, and would clutch it till the last drop of life-blood
696: ebbed away. She was my wife, and we hated each other. Gradually the
697: hearth, the dim library, the candle-light disappeared--seemed to melt
698: away into a background of light, the green serpent with the diamond
699: eyes remaining a dark image on the retina. Then I had a sense of my
700: eyelids quivering, and the living daylight broke in upon me; I saw
701: gardens, and heard voices; I was seated on the steps of the Belvedere
702: Terrace, and my friends were round me.
703: 
704: The tumult of mind into which I was thrown by this hideous vision made
705: me ill for several days, and prolonged our stay at Vienna. I shuddered
706: with horror as the scene recurred to me; and it recurred constantly,
707: with all its minutiae, as if they had been burnt into my memory; and
708: yet, such is the madness of the human heart under the influence of
709: its immediate desires, I felt a wild hell-braving joy that Bertha was
710: to be mine; for the fulfilment of my former prevision concerning her
711: first appearance before me, left me little hope that this last hideous
712: glimpse of the future was the mere diseased play of my own mind, and
713: had no relation to external realities. One thing alone I looked towards
714: as a possible means of casting doubt on my terrible conviction--the
715: discovery that my vision of Prague had been false--and Prague was the
716: next city on our route.
717: 
718: Meanwhile, I was no sooner in Bertha's society again than I was as
719: completely under her sway as before. What if I saw into the heart of
720: Bertha, the matured woman--Bertha, my wife? Bertha, the _girl_, was
721: a fascinating secret to me still: I trembled under her touch; I felt
722: the witchery of her presence; I yearned to be assured of her love.
723: The fear of poison is feeble against the sense of thirst. Nay, I was
724: just as jealous of my brother as before--just as much irritated by his
725: small patronizing ways; for my pride, my diseased sensibility, were
726: there as they had always been, and winced as inevitably under every
727: offence as my eye winced from an intruding mote. The future, even when
728: brought within the compass of feeling by a vision that made me shudder,
729: had still no more than the force of an idea, compared with the force
730: of present emotion--of my love for Bertha, of my dislike and jealousy
731: towards my brother.
732: 
733: It is an old story, that men sell themselves to the tempter, and sign a
734: bond with their blood, because it is only to take effect at a distant
735: day; then rush on to snatch the cup their souls thirst after with an
736: impulse not the less savage because there is a dark shadow beside them
737: for evermore. There is no short cut, no patent tram-road, to wisdom:
738: after all the centuries of invention, the soul's path lies through
739: the thorny wilderness which must be still trodden in solitude, with
740: bleeding feet, with sobs for help, as it was trodden by them of old
741: time.
742: 
743: My mind speculated eagerly on the means by which I should become my
744: brother's successful rival, for I was still too timid, in my ignorance
745: of Bertha's actual feeling, to venture on any step that would urge
746: from her an avowal of it. I thought I should gain confidence even for
747: this, if my vision of Prague proved to have been veracious; and yet,
748: the horror of that certitude! Behind the slim girl Bertha, whose words
749: and looks I watched for, whose touch was bliss, there stood continually
750: that Bertha with the fuller form, the harder eyes, the more rigid
751: mouth--with the barren, selfish soul laid bare; no longer a fascinating
752: secret, but a measured fact, urging itself perpetually on my unwilling
753: sight. Are you unable to give me your sympathy--you who read this? Are
754: you unable to imagine this double consciousness at work within me,
755: flowing on like two parallel streams which never mingle their waters
756: and blend into a common hue? Yet you must have known something of the
757: presentiments that spring from an insight at war with passion; and my
758: visions were only like presentiments intensified to horror. You have
759: known the powerlessness of ideas before the might of impulse; and my
760: visions, when once they had passed into memory, were mere ideas--pale
761: shadows that beckoned in vain, while my hand was grasped by the living
762: and the loved.
763: 
764: In after-days I thought with bitter regret that if I had foreseen
765: something more or something different--if instead of that hideous
766: vision which poisoned the passion it could not destroy, or if even
767: along with it I could have had a foreshadowing of that moment when I
768: looked on my brother's face for the last time, some softening influence
769: would have been shed over my feeling towards him: pride and hatred
770: would surely have been subdued into pity, and the record of those
771: hidden sins would have been shortened. But this is one of the vain
772: thoughts with which we men flatter ourselves. We try to believe that
773: the egoism within us would have easily been melted, and that it was
774: only the narrowness of our knowledge which hemmed in our generosity,
775: our awe, our human piety, and hindered them from submerging our hard
776: indifference to the sensations and emotions of our fellows. Our
777: tenderness and self-renunciation seem strong when our egoism has had
778: its day--when, after our mean striving for a triumph that is to be
779: another's loss, the triumph comes suddenly, and we shudder at it,
780: because it is held out by the chill hand of death.
781: 
782: Our arrival in Prague happened at night, and I was glad of this, for
783: it seemed like a deferring of a terribly decisive moment, to be in
784: the city for hours without seeing it. As we were not to remain long
785: in Prague, but to go on speedily to Dresden, it was proposed that we
786: should drive out the next morning and take a general view of the place,
787: as well as visit some of its specially interesting spots, before the
788: heat became oppressive--for we were in August, and the season was hot
789: and dry. But it happened that the ladies were rather late at their
790: morning toilet, and to my father's politely-repressed but perceptible
791: annoyance, we were not in the carriage till the morning was far
792: advanced. I thought with a sense of relief, as we entered the Jews'
793: quarter, where we were to visit the old synagogue, that we should be
794: kept in this flat, shut-up part of the city, until we should all be
795: too tired and too warm to go farther, and so we should return without
796: seeing more than the streets through which we had already passed. That
797: would give me another day's suspense--suspense, the only form in which
798: a fearful spirit knows the solace of hope. But, as I stood under the
799: blackened, groined arches of that old synagogue, made dimly visible by
800: the seven thin candles in the sacred lamp, while our Jewish cicerone
801: reached down the Book of the Law, and read to us in its ancient
802: tongue--I felt a shuddering impression that this strange building,
803: with its shrunken lights, this surviving withered remnant of medieval
804: Judaism, was of a piece with my vision. Those darkened dusty Christian
805: saints, with their loftier arches and their larger candles, needed the
806: consolatory scorn with which they might point to a more shrivelled
807: death-in-life than their own.
808: 
809: As I expected, when we left the Jews' quarter the elders of our party
810: wished to return to the hotel. But now, instead of rejoicing in this,
811: as I had done beforehand, I felt a sudden overpowering impulse to go
812: on at once to the bridge, and put an end to the suspense I had been
813: wishing to protract. I declared, with unusual decision, that I would
814: get out of the carriage and walk on alone; they might return without
815: me. My father, thinking this merely a sample of my usual "poetic
816: nonsense," objected that I should only do myself harm by walking in
817: the heat; but when I persisted, he said angrily that I might follow my
818: own absurd devices, but that Schmidt (our courier) must go with me. I
819: assented to this, and set off with Schmidt towards the bridge. I had no
820: sooner passed from under the archway of the grand old gate leading on
821: to the bridge, than a trembling seized me, and I turned cold under the
822: midday sun; yet I went on; I was in search of something--a small detail
823: which I remembered with special intensity as part of my vision. There
824: it was--the patch of rainbow light on the pavement transmitted through
825: a lamp in the shape of a star.
826: 
827: 
828: 
829: 
830: CHAPTER II
831: 
832: 
833: Before the autumn was at an end, and while the brown leaves still stood
834: thick on the beeches in our park, my brother and Bertha were engaged to
835: each other, and it was understood that their marriage was to take place
836: early in the next spring. In spite of the certainty I had felt from
837: that moment on the bridge at Prague, that Bertha would one day be my
838: wife, my constitutional timidity and distrust had continued to benumb
839: me, and the words in which I had sometimes premeditated a confession of
840: my love, had died away unuttered. The same conflict had gone on within
841: me as before--the longing for an assurance of love from Bertha's lips,
842: the dread lest a word of contempt and denial should fall upon me like a
843: corrosive acid. What was the conviction of a distant necessity to me?
844: I trembled under a present glance, I hungered after a present joy, I
845: was clogged and chilled by a present fear. And so the days passed on:
846: I witnessed Bertha's engagement and heard her marriage discussed as if
847: I were under a conscious nightmare--knowing it was a dream that would
848: vanish, but feeling stifled under the grasp of hard-clutching fingers.
849: 
850: When I was not in Bertha's presence--and I was with her very often,
851: for she continued to treat me with a playful patronage that wakened
852: no jealousy in my brother--I spent my time chiefly in wandering, in
853: strolling, or taking long rides while the daylight lasted, and then
854: shutting myself up with my unread books; for books had lost the power
855: of chaining my attention. My self-consciousness was heightened to that
856: pitch of intensity in which our own emotions take the form of a drama
857: which urges itself imperatively on our contemplation, and we begin to
858: weep, less under the sense of our suffering than at the thought of it.
859: I felt a sort of pitying anguish over the pathos of my own lot: the
860: lot of a being finely organized for pain, but with hardly any fibres
861: that responded to pleasure--to whom the idea of future evil robbed the
862: present of its joy, and for whom the idea of future good did not still
863: the uneasiness of a present yearning or a present dread. I went dumbly
864: through that stage of the poet's suffering, in which he feels the
865: delicious pang of utterance, and makes an image of his sorrows.
866: 
867: I was left entirely without remonstrance concerning this dreamy wayward
868: life: I knew my father's thought about me: "That lad will never be good
869: for anything in life: he may waste his years in an insignificant way on
870: the income that falls to him: I shall not trouble myself about a career
871: for him."
872: 
873: One mild morning in the beginning of November, it happened that I was
874: standing outside the portico patting lazy old Caesar, a Newfoundland
875: almost blind with age, the only dog that ever took any notice of
876: me--for the very dogs shunned me, and fawned on the happier people
877: about me--when the groom brought up my brother's horse which was to
878: carry him to the hunt, and my brother himself appeared at the door,
879: florid, broad-chested, and self-complacent, feeling what a good-natured
880: fellow he was not to behave insolently to us all on the strength of his
881: great advantages.
882: 
883: "Latimer, old boy," he said to me in a tone of compassionate
884: cordiality, "what a pity it is you don't have a run with the hounds now
885: and then! The finest thing in the world for low spirits!"
886: 
887: "Low spirits!" I thought bitterly, as he rode away; "that is the
888: sort of phrase with which coarse, narrow natures like yours think to
889: describe experience of which you can know no more than your horse
890: knows. It is to such as you that the good of this world falls: ready
891: dulness, healthy selfishness, good-tempered conceit--these are the keys
892: to happiness."
893: 
894: The quick thought came, that my selfishness was even stronger than
895: his--it was only a suffering selfishness instead of an enjoying one.
896: But then, again, my exasperating insight into Alfred's self-complacent
897: soul, his freedom from all the doubts and fears, the unsatisfied
898: yearnings, the exquisite tortures of sensitiveness, that had made the
899: web of my life, seemed to absolve me from all bonds towards him. This
900: man needed no pity, no love; those fine influences would have been as
901: little felt by him as the delicate white mist is felt by the rock it
902: caresses. There was no evil in store for _him_: if he was not to marry
903: Bertha, it would be because he had found a lot pleasanter to himself.
904: 
905: Mr. Filmore's house lay not more than half a mile beyond our own gates,
906: and whenever I knew my brother was gone in another direction, I went
907: there for the chance of finding Bertha at home. Later on in the day
908: I walked thither. By a rare accident she was alone, and we walked
909: out in the grounds together, for she seldom went on foot beyond the
910: trimly-swept gravel-walks. I remember what a beautiful sylph she looked
911: to me as the low November sun shone on her blond hair, and she tripped
912: along teasing me with her usual light banter, to which I listened half
913: fondly, half moodily; it was all the sign Bertha's mysterious inner
914: self ever made to me. To-day perhaps, the moodiness predominated, for
915: I had not yet shaken off the access of jealous hate which my brother
916: had raised in me by his parting patronage. Suddenly I interrupted and
917: startled her by saying, almost fiercely, "Bertha, how can you love
918: Alfred?"
919: 
920: She looked at me with surprise for a moment, but soon her light smile
921: came again, and she answered sarcastically, "Why do you suppose I love
922: him?"
923: 
924: "How can you ask that, Bertha?"
925: 
926: "What! your wisdom thinks I must love the man I'm going to marry? The
927: most unpleasant thing in the world. I should quarrel with him; I should
928: be jealous of him; our _menage_ would be conducted in a very ill-bred
929: manner. A little quiet contempt contributes greatly to the elegance of
930: life."
931: 
932: "Bertha, that is not your real feeling. Why do you delight in trying to
933: deceive me by inventing such cynical speeches?"
934: 
935: "I need never take the trouble of invention in order to deceive you,
936: my small Tasso"--(that was the mocking name she usually gave me). "The
937: easiest way to deceive a poet is to tell him the truth."
938: 
939: She was testing the validity of her epigram in a daring way, and for
940: a moment the shadow of my vision--the Bertha whose soul was no secret
941: to me--passed between me and the radiant girl, the playful sylph whose
942: feelings were a fascinating mystery. I suppose I must have shuddered,
943: or betrayed in some other way my momentary chill of horror.
944: 
945: "Tasso!" she said, seizing my wrist, and peeping round into my face,
946: "are you really beginning to discern what a heartless girl I am? Why,
947: you are not half the poet I thought you were; you are actually capable
948: of believing the truth about me."
949: 
950: The shadow passed from between us, and was no longer the object nearest
951: to me. The girl whose light fingers grasped me, whose elfish charming
952: face looked into mine--who, I thought, was betraying an interest in my
953: feelings that she would not have directly avowed,--this warm breathing
954: presence again possessed my senses and imagination like a returning
955: siren melody which had been overpowered for an instant by the roar of
956: threatening waves. It was a moment as delicious to me as the waking
957: up to a consciousness of youth after a dream of middle age. I forgot
958: everything but my passion, and said with swimming eyes--
959: 
960: "Bertha, shall you love me when we are first married? I wouldn't mind
961: if you really loved me only for a little while."
962: 
963: Her look of astonishment, as she loosed my hand and started away from
964: me, recalled me to a sense of my strange, my criminal indiscretion.
965: 
966: "Forgive me," I said, hurriedly, as soon as I could speak again; "I did
967: not know what I was saying."
968: 
969: "Ah, Tasso's mad fit has come on, I see," she answered quietly, for she
970: had recovered herself sooner than I had. "Let him go home and keep his
971: head cool. I must go in, for the sun is setting."
972: 
973: I left her--full of indignation against myself. I had let slip words
974: which, if she reflected on them, might rouse in her a suspicion of my
975: abnormal mental condition--a suspicion which of all things I dreaded.
976: And besides that, I was ashamed of the apparent baseness I had
977: committed in uttering them to my brother's betrothed wife. I wandered
978: home slowly, entering our park through a private gate instead of by
979: the lodges. As I approached the house, I saw a man dashing off at full
980: speed from the stable-yard across the park. Had any accident happened
981: at home? No; perhaps it was only one of my father's peremptory business
982: errands that required this headlong haste.
983: 
984: Nevertheless I quickened my pace without any distinct motive, and was
985: soon at the house. I will not dwell on the scene I found there. My
986: brother was dead--had been pitched from his horse, and killed on the
987: spot by a concussion of the brain.
988: 
989: I went up to the room where he lay, and where my father was seated
990: beside him with a look of rigid despair. I had shunned my father more
991: than any one since our return home, for the radical antipathy between
992: our natures made my insight into his inner self a constant affliction
993: to me. But now, as I went up to him, and stood beside him in sad
994: silence, I felt the presence of a new element that blended us as we had
995: never been blent before. My father had been one of the most successful
996: men in the money-getting world: he had had no sentimental sufferings,
997: no illness. The heaviest trouble that had befallen him was the death
998: of his first wife. But he married my mother soon after; and I remember
999: he seemed exactly the same, to my keen childish observation, the week
1000: after her death as before. But now, at last, a sorrow had come--the
1001: sorrow of old age, which suffers the more from the crushing of its
1002: pride and its hopes, in proportion as the pride and hope are narrow and
1003: prosaic. His son was to have been married soon--would probably have
1004: stood for the borough at the next election. That son's existence was
1005: the best motive that could be alleged for making new purchases of land
1006: every year to round off the estate. It is a dreary thing to live on
1007: doing the same things year after year, without knowing why we do them.
1008: Perhaps the tragedy of disappointed youth and passion is less piteous
1009: than the tragedy of disappointed age and worldliness.
1010: 
1011: As I saw into the desolation of my father's heart, I felt a movement of
1012: deep pity towards him, which was the beginning of a new affection--an
1013: affection that grew and strengthened in spite of the strange bitterness
1014: with which he regarded me in the first month or two after my brother's
1015: death. If it had not been for the softening influence of my compassion
1016: for him--the first deep compassion I had ever felt--I should have been
1017: stung by the perception that my father transferred the inheritance of
1018: an eldest son to me with a mortified sense that fate had compelled him
1019: to the unwelcome course of caring for me as an important being. It was
1020: only in spite of himself that he began to think of me with anxious
1021: regard. There is hardly any neglected child for whom death has made
1022: vacant a more favoured place, who will not understand what I mean.
1023: 
1024: Gradually, however, my new deference to his wishes, the effect of that
1025: patience which was born of my pity for him, won upon his affection,
1026: and he began to please himself with the endeavour to make me fill any
1027: brother's place as fully as my feebler personality would admit. I saw
1028: that the prospect which by and by presented itself of my becoming
1029: Bertha's husband was welcome to him, and he even contemplated in
1030: my case what he had not intended in my brother's--that his son and
1031: daughter-in-law should make one household with him. My softened
1032: feelings towards my father made this the happiest time I had known
1033: since childhood;--these last months in which I retained the delicious
1034: illusion of loving Bertha, of longing and doubting and hoping that
1035: she might love me. She behaved with a certain new consciousness and
1036: distance towards me after my brother's death; and I too was under a
1037: double constraint--that of delicacy towards my brother's memory and
1038: of anxiety as to the impression my abrupt words had left on her mind.
1039: But the additional screen this mutual reserve erected between us only
1040: brought me more completely under her power: no matter how empty the
1041: adytum, so that the veil be thick enough. So absolute is our soul's
1042: need of something hidden and uncertain for the maintenance of that
1043: doubt and hope and effort which are the breath of its life, that if
1044: the whole future were laid bare to us beyond to-day, the interest of
1045: all mankind would be bent on the hours that lie between; we should
1046: pant after the uncertainties of our one morning and our one afternoon;
1047: we should rush fiercely to the Exchange for our last possibility of
1048: speculation, of success, of disappointment: we should have a glut of
1049: political prophets foretelling a crisis or a no-crisis within the only
1050: twenty-four hours left open to prophecy. Conceive the condition of the
1051: human mind if all propositions whatsoever were self-evident except one,
1052: which was to become self-evident at the close of a summer's day, but
1053: in the meantime might be the subject of question, of hypothesis, of
1054: debate. Art and philosophy, literature and science, would fasten like
1055: bees on that one proposition which had the honey of probability in it,
1056: and be the more eager because their enjoyment would end with sunset.
1057: Our impulses, our spiritual activities, no more adjust themselves to
1058: the idea of their future nullity, than the beating of our heart, or the
1059: irritability of our muscles.
1060: 
1061: Bertha, the slim, fair-haired girl, whose present thoughts and emotions
1062: were an enigma to me amidst the fatiguing obviousness of the other
1063: minds around me, was as absorbing to me as a single unknown to-day--as
1064: a single hypothetic proposition to remain problematic till sunset; and
1065: all the cramped, hemmed-in belief and disbelief, trust and distrust, of
1066: my nature, welled out in this one narrow channel.
1067: 
1068: And she made me believe that she loved me. Without ever quitting her
1069: tone of _badinage_ and playful superiority, she intoxicated me with
1070: the sense that I was necessary to her, that she was never at ease,
1071: unless I was near her, submitting to her playful tyranny. It costs
1072: a woman so little effort to beset us in this way! A half-repressed
1073: word, a moment's unexpected silence, even an easy fit of petulance on
1074: our account, will serve us as _hashish_ for a long while. Out of the
1075: subtlest web of scarcely perceptible signs, she set me weaving the
1076: fancy that she had always unconsciously loved me better than Alfred,
1077: but that, with the ignorant fluttered sensibility of a young girl, she
1078: had been imposed on by the charm that lay for her in the distinction
1079: of being admired and chosen by a man who made so brilliant a figure in
1080: the world as my brother. She satirized herself in a very graceful way
1081: for her vanity and ambition. What was it to me that I had the light of
1082: my wretched provision on the fact that now it was I who possessed at
1083: least all but the personal part of my brother's advantages? Our sweet
1084: illusions are half of them conscious illusions, like effects of colour
1085: that we know to be made up of tinsel, broken glass, and rags.
1086: 
1087: We were married eighteen months after Alfred's death, one cold, clear
1088: morning in April, when there came hail and sunshine both together; and
1089: Bertha, in her white silk and pale-green leaves, and the pale hues of
1090: her hair and face, looked like the spirit of the morning. My father was
1091: happier than he had thought of being again: my marriage, he felt sure,
1092: would complete the desirable modification of my character, and make me
1093: practical and worldly enough to take my place in society among sane
1094: men. For he delighted in Bertha's tact and acuteness, and felt sure
1095: she would be mistress of me, and make me what she chose: I was only
1096: twenty-one, and madly in love with her. Poor father! He kept that hope
1097: a little while after our first year of marriage, and it was not quite
1098: extinct when paralysis came and saved him from utter disappointment.
1099: 
1100: I shall hurry through the rest of my story, not dwelling so much as
1101: I have hitherto done on my inward experience. When people are well
1102: known to each other, they talk rather of what befalls them externally,
1103: leaving their feelings and sentiments to be inferred.
1104: 
1105: We lived in a round of visits for some time after our return home,
1106: giving splendid dinner-parties, and making a sensation in our
1107: neighbourhood by the new lustre of our equipage, for my father had
1108: reserved this display of his increased wealth for the period of his
1109: son's marriage; and we gave our acquaintances liberal opportunity for
1110: remarking that it was a pity I made so poor a figure as an heir and a
1111: bridegroom. The nervous fatigue of this existence, the insincerities
1112: and platitudes which I had to live through twice over--through my inner
1113: and outward sense--would have been maddening to me, if I had not had
1114: that sort of intoxicated callousness which came from the delights of a
1115: first passion. A bride and bridegroom, surrounded by all the appliances
1116: of wealth, hurried through the day by the whirl of society, filling
1117: their solitary moments with hastily-snatched caresses, are prepared
1118: for their future life together as the novice is prepared for the
1119: cloister--by experiencing its utmost contrast.
1120: 
1121: Through all these crowded excited months, Bertha's inward self remained
1122: shrouded from me, and I still read her thoughts only through the
1123: language of her lips and demeanour: I had still the human interest of
1124: wondering whether what I did and said pleased her, of longing to hear
1125: a word of affection, of giving a delicious exaggeration of meaning to
1126: her smile. But I was conscious of a growing difference in her manner
1127: towards me; sometimes strong enough to be called haughty coldness,
1128: cutting and chilling me as the hail had done that came across the
1129: sunshine on our marriage morning; sometimes only perceptible in the
1130: dexterous avoidance of a _tete-a-tete_ walk or dinner to which I had
1131: been looking forward. I had been deeply pained by this--had even felt
1132: a sort of crushing of the heart, from the sense that my brief day of
1133: happiness was near its setting; but still I remained dependent on
1134: Bertha, eager for the last rays of a bliss that would soon be gone for
1135: ever, hoping and watching for some after-glow more beautiful from the
1136: impending night.
1137: 
1138: I remember--how should I not remember?--the time when that dependence
1139: and hope utterly left me, when the sadness I had felt in Bertha's
1140: growing estrangement became a joy that I looked back upon with
1141: longing as a man might look back on the last pains in a paralysed
1142: limb. It was just after the close of my father's last illness, which
1143: had necessarily withdrawn us from society and thrown us more on each
1144: other. It was the evening of father's death. On that evening the veil
1145: which had shrouded Bertha's soul from me--had made me find in her
1146: alone among my fellow-beings the blessed possibility of mystery, and
1147: doubt, and expectation--was first withdrawn. Perhaps it was the first
1148: day since the beginning of my passion for her, in which that passion
1149: was completely neutralized by the presence of an absorbing feeling of
1150: another kind. I had been watching by my father's deathbed: I had been
1151: witnessing the last fitful yearning glance his soul had cast back on
1152: the spent inheritance of life--the last faint consciousness of love he
1153: had gathered from the pressure of my hand. What are all our personal
1154: loves when we have been sharing in that supreme agony? In the first
1155: moments when we come away from the presence of death, every other
1156: relation to the living is merged, to our feeling, in the great relation
1157: of a common nature and a common destiny.
1158: 
1159: In that state of mind I joined Bertha in her private sitting-room. She
1160: was seated in a leaning posture on a settee, with her back towards the
1161: door; the great rich coils of her pale blond hair surmounting her small
1162: neck, visible above the back of the settee. I remember, as I closed
1163: the door behind me, a cold tremulousness seizing me, and a vague sense
1164: of being hated and lonely--vague and strong, like a presentiment. I
1165: know how I looked at that moment, for I saw myself in Bertha's thought
1166: as she lifted her cutting grey eyes, and looked at me: a miserable
1167: ghost-seer, surrounded by phantoms in the noonday, trembling under a
1168: breeze when the leaves were still, without appetite for the common
1169: objects of human desires, but pining after the moon-beams. We were
1170: front to front with each other, and judged each other. The terrible
1171: moment of complete illumination had come to me, and I saw that the
1172: darkness had hidden no landscape from me, but only a blank prosaic
1173: wall: from that evening forth, through the sickening years which
1174: followed, I saw all round the narrow room of this woman's soul--saw
1175: petty artifice and mere negation where I had delighted to believe in
1176: coy sensibilities and in wit at war with latent feeling--saw the light
1177: floating vanities of the girl defining themselves into the systematic
1178: coquetry, the scheming selfishness, of the woman--saw repulsion and
1179: antipathy harden into cruel hatred, giving pain only for the sake of
1180: wreaking itself.
1181: 
1182: For Bertha too, after her kind, felt the bitterness of disillusion.
1183: She had believed that my wild poet's passion for her would make me her
1184: slave; and that, being her slave, I should execute her will in all
1185: things. With the essential shallowness of a negative, unimaginative
1186: nature, she was unable to conceive the fact that sensibilities were
1187: anything else than weaknesses. She had thought my weaknesses would
1188: put me in her power, and she found them unmanageable forces. Our
1189: positions were reversed. Before marriage she had completely mastered
1190: my imagination, for she was a secret to me; and I created the unknown
1191: thought before which I trembled as if it were hers. But now that her
1192: soul was laid open to me, now that I was compelled to share the privacy
1193: of her motives, to follow all the petty devices that preceded her words
1194: and acts, she found herself powerless with me, except to produce in me
1195: the chill shudder of repulsion-- powerless, because I could be acted
1196: on by no lever within her reach. I was dead to worldly ambitions, to
1197: social vanities, to all the incentives within the compass of her narrow
1198: imagination, and I lived under influences utterly invisible to her.
1199: 
1200: She was really pitiable to have such a husband, and so all the world
1201: thought. A graceful, brilliant woman, like Bertha, who smiled on
1202: morning callers, made a figure in ball-rooms, and was capable of that
1203: light repartee which, from such a woman, is accepted as wit, was secure
1204: of carrying off all sympathy from a husband who was sickly, abstracted,
1205: and, as some suspected, crack-brained. Even the servants in our house
1206: gave her the balance of their regard and pity. For there were no
1207: audible quarrels between us; our alienation, our repulsion from each
1208: other, lay within the silence of our own hearts; and if the mistress
1209: went out a great deal, and seemed to dislike the master's society, was
1210: it not natural, poor thing? The master was odd. I was kind and just to
1211: my dependants, but I excited in them a shrinking, half-contemptuous
1212: pity; for this class of men and women are but slightly determined in
1213: their estimate of others by general considerations, or even experience,
1214: of character. They judge of persons as they judge of coins, and value
1215: those who pass current at a high rate.
1216: 
1217: After a time I interfered so little with Bertha's habits that it might
1218: seem wonderful how her hatred towards me could grow so intense and
1219: active as it did. But she had begun to suspect, by some involuntary
1220: betrayal of mine, that there was an abnormal power of penetration in
1221: me--that fitfully, at least, I was strangely cognizant of her thoughts
1222: and intentions, and she began to be haunted by a terror of me, which
1223: alternated every now and then with defiance. She meditated continually
1224: how the incubus could be shaken off her life--how she could be freed
1225: from this hateful bond to a being whom she at once despised as an
1226: imbecile, and dreaded as an inquisitor. For a long while she lived in
1227: the hope that my evident wretchedness would drive me to the commission
1228: of suicide; but suicide was not in my nature. I was too completely
1229: swayed by the sense that I was in the grasp of unknown forces, to
1230: believe in my power of self-release. Towards my own destiny I had
1231: become entirely passive; for my one ardent desire had spent itself, and
1232: impulse no longer predominated over knowledge. For this reason I never
1233: thought of taking any steps towards a complete separation, which would
1234: have made our alienation evident to the world. Why should I rush for
1235: help to a new course, when I was only suffering from the consequences
1236: of a deed which had been the act of my intensest will? That would have
1237: been the logic of one who had desires to gratify, and I had no desires.
1238: But Bertha and I lived more and more aloof from each other. The rich
1239: find it easy to live married and apart.
1240: 
1241: That course of our life which I have indicated in a few sentences
1242: filled the space of years. So much misery--so slow and hideous a growth
1243: of hatred and sin, may be compressed into a sentence! And men judge
1244: of each other's lives through this summary medium. They epitomize the
1245: experience of their fellow-mortal, and pronounce judgment on him in
1246: neat syntax, and feel themselves wise and virtuous--conquerors over
1247: the temptations they define in well-selected predicates. Seven years
1248: of wretchedness glide glibly over the lips of the man who has never
1249: counted them out in moments of chill disappointment, of head and heart
1250: throbbings, of dread and vain wrestling, of remorse and despair. We
1251: learn _words_ by rote, but not their meaning; _that_ must be paid for
1252: with our life-blood, and printed in the subtle fibres of our nerves.
1253: 
1254: But I will hasten to finish my story. Brevity is justified at once to
1255: those who readily understand, and to those who will never understand.
1256: 
1257: Some years after my father's death, I was sitting by the dim firelight
1258: in my library one January evening--sitting in the leather chair that
1259: used to be my father's--when Bertha appeared at the door, with a
1260: candle in her hand, and advanced towards me. I knew the ball-dress she
1261: had on--the white ball-dress, with the green jewels, shone upon by
1262: the light of the wax candle which lit up the medallion of the dying
1263: Cleopatra on the mantelpiece. Why did she come to me before going
1264: out? I had not seen her in the library, which was my habitual place,
1265: for months. Why did she stand before me with the candle in her hand,
1266: with her cruel contemptuous eyes fixed on me, and the glittering
1267: serpent, like a familiar demon, on her breast? For a moment I thought
1268: this fulfilment of my vision at Vienna marked some dreadful crisis
1269: in my fate, but I saw nothing in Bertha's mind, as she stood before
1270: me, except scorn for the look of overwhelming misery with which I
1271: sat before her . . . "Fool, idiot, why don't you kill yourself,
1272: then?"--that was her thought. But at length her thoughts reverted to
1273: her errand, and she spoke aloud. The apparently indifferent nature of
1274: the errand seemed to make a ridiculous anticlimax to my prevision and
1275: my agitation.
1276: 
1277: "I have had to hire a new maid. Fletcher is going to be married, and
1278: she wants me to ask you to let her husband have the public-house and
1279: farm at Molton. I wish him to have it. You must give the promise now,
1280: because Fletcher is going to-morrow morning--and quickly, because I'm
1281: in a hurry."
1282: 
1283: "Very well; you may promise her," I said, indifferently, and Bertha
1284: swept out of the library again.
1285: 
1286: I always shrank from the sight of a new person, and all the more when
1287: it was a person whose mental life was likely to weary my reluctant
1288: insight with worldly ignorant trivialities. But I shrank especially
1289: from the sight of this new maid, because her advent had been announced
1290: to me at a moment to which I could not cease to attach some fatality:
1291: I had a vague dread that I should find her mixed up with the dreary
1292: drama of my life--that some new sickening vision would reveal her to
1293: me as an evil genius. When at last I did unavoidably meet her, the
1294: vague dread was changed into definite disgust. She was a tall, wiry,
1295: dark-eyed woman, this Mrs. Archer, with a face handsome enough to
1296: give her coarse hard nature the odious finish of bold, self-confident
1297: coquetry. That was enough to make me avoid her, quite apart from the
1298: contemptuous feeling with which she contemplated me. I seldom saw her;
1299: but I perceived that she rapidly became a favourite with her mistress,
1300: and, after the lapse of eight or nine months, I began to be aware that
1301: there had arisen in Bertha's mind towards this woman a mingled feeling
1302: of fear and dependence, and that this feeling was associated with
1303: ill-defined images of candle-light scenes in her dressing-room, and the
1304: locking-up of something in Bertha's cabinet. My interviews with my wife
1305: had become so brief and so rarely solitary, that I had no opportunity
1306: of perceiving these images in her mind with more definiteness. The
1307: recollections of the past become contracted in the rapidity of thought
1308: till they sometimes bear hardly a more distinct resemblance to the
1309: external reality than the forms of an oriental alphabet to the objects
1310: that suggested them.
1311: 
1312: Besides, for the last year or more a modification had been going
1313: forward in my mental condition, and was growing more and more marked.
1314: My insight into the minds of those around me was becoming dimmer
1315: and more fitful, and the ideas that crowded my double consciousness
1316: became less and less dependent on any personal contact. All that was
1317: personal in me seemed to be suffering a gradual death, so that I was
1318: losing the organ through which the personal agitations and projects
1319: of others could affect me. But along with this relief from wearisome
1320: insight, there was a new development of what I concluded--as I have
1321: since found rightly--to be a prevision of external scenes. It was
1322: as if the relation between me and my fellow-men was more and more
1323: deadened, and my relation to what we call the inanimate was quickened
1324: into new life. The more I lived apart from society, and in proportion
1325: as my wretchedness subsided from the violent throb of agonized passion
1326: into the dulness of habitual pain, the more frequent and vivid became
1327: such visions as that I had had of Prague--of strange cities, of sandy
1328: plains, of gigantic ruins, of midnight skies with strange bright
1329: constellations, of mountain-passes, of grassy nooks flecked with the
1330: afternoon sunshine through the boughs: I was in the midst of such
1331: scenes, and in all of them one presence seemed to weigh on me in all
1332: these mighty shapes--the presence of something unknown and pitiless.
1333: For continual suffering had annihilated religious faith within me:
1334: to the utterly miserable--the unloving and the unloved--there is no
1335: religion possible, no worship but a worship of devils. And beyond all
1336: these, and continually recurring, was the vision of my death--the
1337: pangs, the suffocation, the last struggle, when life would be grasped
1338: at in vain.
1339: 
1340: Things were in this state near the end of the seventh year. I had
1341: become entirely free from insight, from my abnormal cognizance of any
1342: other consciousness than my own, and instead of intruding involuntarily
1343: into the world of other minds, was living continually in my own
1344: solitary future. Bertha was aware that I was greatly changed. To my
1345: surprise she had of late seemed to seek opportunities of remaining
1346: in my society, and had cultivated that kind of distant yet familiar
1347: talk which is customary between a husband and wife who live in polite
1348: and irrevocable alienation. I bore this with languid submission, and
1349: without feeling enough interest in her motives to be roused into keen
1350: observation; yet I could not help perceiving something triumphant and
1351: excited in her carriage and the expression of her face--something too
1352: subtle to express itself in words or tones, but giving one the idea
1353: that she lived in a state of expectation or hopeful suspense. My chief
1354: feeling was satisfaction that her inner self was once more shut out
1355: from me; and I almost revelled for the moment in the absent melancholy
1356: that made me answer her at cross purposes, and betray utter ignorance
1357: of what she had been saying. I remember well the look and the smile
1358: with which she one day said, after a mistake of this kind on my part:
1359: "I used to think you were a clairvoyant, and that was the reason why
1360: you were so bitter against other clairvoyants, wanting to keep your
1361: monopoly; but I see now you have become rather duller than the rest of
1362: the world."
1363: 
1364: I said nothing in reply. It occurred to me that her recent obtrusion
1365: of herself upon me might have been prompted by the wish to test my
1366: power of detecting some of her secrets; but I let the thought drop
1367: again at once: her motives and her deeds had no interest for me, and
1368: whatever pleasures she might be seeking, I had no wish to baulk her.
1369: There was still pity in my soul for every living thing, and Bertha was
1370: living--was surrounded with possibilities of misery.
1371: 
1372: Just at this time there occurred an event which roused me somewhat from
1373: my inertia, and gave me an interest in the passing moment that I had
1374: thought impossible for me. It was a visit from Charles Meunier, who had
1375: written me word that he was coming to England for relaxation from too
1376: strenuous labour, and would like to see me. Meunier had now a European
1377: reputation; but his letter to me expressed that keen remembrance of
1378: an early regard, an early debt of sympathy, which is inseparable from
1379: nobility of character: and I too felt as if his presence would be to me
1380: like a transient resurrection into a happier pre-existence.
1381: 
1382: He came, and as far as possible, I renewed our old pleasure of making
1383: _tete-a-tete_ excursions, though, instead of mountains and glacers
1384: and the wide blue lake, we had to content ourselves with mere slopes
1385: and ponds and artificial plantations. The years had changed us both,
1386: but with what different result! Meunier was now a brilliant figure
1387: in society, to whom elegant women pretended to listen, and whose
1388: acquaintance was boasted of by noblemen ambitious of brains. He
1389: repressed with the utmost delicacy all betrayal of the shock which
1390: I am sure he must have received from our meeting, or of a desire to
1391: penetrate into my condition and circumstances, and sought by the
1392: utmost exertion of his charming social powers to make our reunion
1393: agreeable. Bertha was much struck by the unexpected fascinations of a
1394: visitor whom she had expected to find presentable only on the score of
1395: his celebrity, and put forth all her coquetries and accomplishments.
1396: Apparently she succeeded in attracting his admiration, for his
1397: manner towards her was attentive and flattering. The effect of his
1398: presence on me was so benignant, especially in those renewals of our
1399: old _tete-a-tete_ wanderings, when he poured forth to me wonderful
1400: narratives of his professional experience, that more than once, when
1401: his talk turned on the psychological relations of disease, the thought
1402: crossed my mind that, if his stay with me were long enough, I might
1403: possibly bring myself to tell this man the secrets of my lot. Might
1404: there not lie some remedy for me, too, in his science? Might there
1405: not at least lie some comprehension and sympathy ready for me in his
1406: large and susceptible mind? But the thought only flickered feebly now
1407: and then, and died out before it could become a wish. The horror I had
1408: of again breaking in on the privacy of another soul, made me, by an
1409: irrational instinct, draw the shroud of concealment more closely around
1410: my own, as we automatically perform the gesture we feel to be wanting
1411: in another.
1412: 
1413: When Meunier's visit was approaching its conclusion, there happened
1414: an event which caused some excitement in our household, owing to
1415: the surprisingly strong effect it appeared to produce on Bertha--on
1416: Bertha, the self-possessed, who usually seemed inaccessible to feminine
1417: agitations, and did even her hate in a self-restrained hygienic manner.
1418: This event was the sudden severe illness of her maid, Mrs. Archer.
1419: I have reserved to this moment the mention of a circumstance which
1420: had forced itself on my notice shortly before Meunier's arrival,
1421: namely, that there had been some quarrel between Bertha and this
1422: maid, apparently during a visit to a distant family, in which she had
1423: accompanied her mistress. I had overheard Archer speaking in a tone of
1424: bitter insolence, which I should have thought an adequate reason for
1425: immediate dismissal. No dismissal followed; on the contrary, Bertha
1426: seemed to be silently putting up with personal inconveniences from
1427: the exhibitions of this woman's temper. I was the more astonished to
1428: observe that her illness seemed a cause of strong solicitude to Bertha;
1429: that she was at the bedside night and day, and would allow no one else
1430: to officiate as head-nurse. It happened that our family doctor was
1431: out on a holiday, an accident which made Meunier's presence in the
1432: house doubly welcome, and he apparently entered into the case with an
1433: interest which seemed so much stronger than the ordinary professional
1434: feeling, that one day when he had fallen into a long fit of silence
1435: after visiting her, I said to him--
1436: 
1437: "Is this a very peculiar case of disease, Meunier?"
1438: 
1439: "No," he answered, "it is an attack of peritonitis, which will be
1440: fatal, but which does not differ physically from many other cases that
1441: have come under my observation. But I'll tell you what I have on my
1442: mind. I want to make an experiment on this woman, if you will give me
1443: permission. It can do her no harm--will give her no pain--for I shall
1444: not make it until life is extinct to all purposes of sensation. I want
1445: to try the effect of transfusing blood into her arteries after the
1446: heart has ceased to beat for some minutes. I have tried the experiment
1447: again and again with animals that have died of this disease, with
1448: astounding results, and I want to try it on a human subject. I have the
1449: small tubes necessary, in a case I have with me, and the rest of the
1450: apparatus could be prepared readily. I should use my own blood--take
1451: it from my own arm. This woman won't live through the night, I'm
1452: convinced, and I want you to promise me your assistance in making the
1453: experiment. I can't do without another hand, but it would perhaps not
1454: be well to call in a medical assistant from among your provincial
1455: doctors. A disagreeable foolish version of the thing might get abroad."
1456: 
1457: "Have you spoken to my wife on the subject?" I said, "because she
1458: appears to be peculiarly sensitive about this woman: she has been a
1459: favourite maid."
1460: 
1461: "To tell you the truth," said Meunier, "I don't want her to know about
1462: it. There are always insuperable difficulties with women in these
1463: matters, and the effect on the supposed dead body may be startling. You
1464: and I will sit up together, and be in readiness. When certain symptoms
1465: appear I shall take you in, and at the right moment we must manage to
1466: get every one else out of the room."
1467: 
1468: I need not give our farther conversation on the subject. He entered
1469: very fully into the details, and overcame my repulsion from them, by
1470: exciting in me a mingled awe and curiosity concerning the possible
1471: results of his experiment.
1472: 
1473: We prepared everything, and he instructed me in my part as assistant.
1474: He had not told Bertha of his absolute conviction that Archer would not
1475: survive through the night, and endeavoured to persuade her to leave the
1476: patient and take a night's rest. But she was obstinate, suspecting the
1477: fact that death was at hand, and supposing that he wished merely to
1478: save her nerves. She refused to leave the sick-room. Meunier and I sat
1479: up together in the library, he making frequent visits to the sick-room,
1480: and returning with the information that the case was taking precisely
1481: the course he expected. Once he said to me, "Can you imagine any cause
1482: of ill-feeling this woman has against her mistress, who is so devoted
1483: to her?"
1484: 
1485: "I think there was some misunderstanding between them before her
1486: illness. Why do you ask?"
1487: 
1488: "Because I have observed for the last five or six hours--since, I
1489: fancy, she has lost all hope of recovery--there seems a strange
1490: prompting in her to say something which pain and failing strength
1491: forbid her to utter; and there is a look of hideous meaning in her
1492: eyes, which she turns continually towards her mistress. In this disease
1493: the mind often remains singularly clear to the last."
1494: 
1495: "I am not surprised at an indication of malevolent feeling in her,"
1496: I said. "She is a woman who has always inspired me with distrust and
1497: dislike, but she managed to insinuate herself into her mistress's
1498: favour." He was silent after this, looking at the fire with an air of
1499: absorption, till he went upstairs again. He stayed away longer than
1500: usual, and on returning, said to me quietly, "Come now."
1501: 
1502: I followed him to the chamber where death was hovering. The dark
1503: hangings of the large bed made a background that gave a strong relief
1504: to Bertha's pale face as I entered. She started forward as she saw me
1505: enter, and then looked at Meunier with an expression of angry inquiry;
1506: but he lifted up his hand as if to impose silence, while he fixed his
1507: glance on the dying woman and felt her pulse. The face was pinched
1508: and ghastly, a cold perspiration was on the forehead, and the eyelids
1509: were lowered so as to conceal the large dark eyes. After a minute or
1510: two, Meunier walked round to the other side of the bed where Bertha
1511: stood, and with his usual air of gentle politeness towards her begged
1512: her to leave the patient under our care--everything should be done for
1513: her--she was no longer in a state to be conscious of an affectionate
1514: presence. Bertha was hesitating, apparently almost willing to believe
1515: his assurance and to comply. She looked round at the ghastly dying
1516: face, as if to read the confirmation of that assurance, when for a
1517: moment the lowered eyelids were raised again, and it seemed as if the
1518: eyes were looking towards Bertha, but blankly. A shudder passed through
1519: Bertha's frame, and she returned to her station near the pillow,
1520: tacitly implying that she would not leave the room.
1521: 
1522: The eyelids were lifted no more. Once I looked at Bertha as she watched
1523: the face of the dying one. She wore a rich _peignoir_, and her blond
1524: hair was half covered by a lace cap: in her attire she was, as always,
1525: an elegant woman, fit to figure in a picture of modern aristocratic
1526: life: but I asked myself how that face of hers could ever have seemed
1527: to me the face of a woman born of woman, with memories of childhood,
1528: capable of pain, needing to be fondled? The features at that moment
1529: seemed so preternaturally sharp, the eyes were so hard and eager--she
1530: looked like a cruel immortal, finding her spiritual feast in the
1531: agonies of a dying race. For across those hard features there came
1532: something like a flash when the last hour had been breathed out, and
1533: we all felt that the dark veil had completely fallen. What secret was
1534: there between Bertha and this woman? I turned my eyes from her with a
1535: horrible dread lest my insight should return, and I should be obliged
1536: to see what had been breeding about two unloving women's hearts. I felt
1537: that Bertha had been watching for the moment of death as the sealing of
1538: her secret: I thanked Heaven it could remain sealed for me.
1539: 
1540: Meunier said quietly, "She is gone." He then gave his arm to Bertha,
1541: and she submitted to be led out of the room.
1542: 
1543: I suppose it was at her order that two female attendants came into
1544: the room, and dismissed the younger one who had been present before.
1545: When they entered, Meunier had already opened the artery in the long
1546: thin neck that lay rigid on the pillow, and I dismissed them, ordering
1547: them to remain at a distance till we rang: the doctor, I said, had an
1548: operation to perform--he was not sure about the death. For the next
1549: twenty minutes I forgot everything but Meunier and the experiment in
1550: which he was so absorbed, that I think his senses would have been
1551: closed against all sounds or sights which had no relation to it. It
1552: was my task at first to keep up the artificial respiration in the body
1553: after the transfusion had been effected, but presently Meunier relieved
1554: me, and I could see the wondrous slow return of life; the breast began
1555: to heave, the inspirations became stronger, the eyelids quivered,
1556: and the soul seemed to have returned beneath them. The artificial
1557: respiration was withdrawn: still the breathing continued, and there was
1558: a movement of the lips.
1559: 
1560: Just then I heard the handle of the door moving: I suppose Bertha had
1561: heard from the women that they had been dismissed: probably a vague
1562: fear had arisen in her mind, for she entered with a look of alarm. She
1563: came to the foot of the bed and gave a stifled cry.
1564: 
1565: The dead woman's eyes were wide open, and met hers in full
1566: recognition-- the recognition of hate. With a sudden strong effort, the
1567: hand that Bertha had thought for ever still was pointed towards her,
1568: and the haggard face moved. The gasping eager voice said--
1569: 
1570: "You mean to poison your husband . . . the poison is in the black
1571: cabinet . . . I got it for you . . . you laughed at me, and told lies
1572: about me behind my back, to make me disgusting . . . because you were
1573: jealous . . . are you sorry . . . now?"
1574: 
1575: The lips continued to murmur, but the sounds were no longer distinct.
1576: Soon there was no sound--only a slight movement: the flame had leaped
1577: out, and was being extinguished the faster. The wretched woman's
1578: heart-strings had been set to hatred and vengeance; the spirit of
1579: life had swept the chords for an instant, and was gone again for ever.
1580: Great God! Is this what it is to live again . . . to wake up with our
1581: unstilled thirst upon us, with our unuttered curses rising to our lips,
1582: with our muscles ready to act out their half-committed sins?
1583: 
1584: Bertha stood pale at the foot of the bed, quivering and helpless,
1585: despairing of devices, like a cunning animal whose hiding-places are
1586: surrounded by swift-advancing flame. Even Meunier looked paralysed;
1587: life for that moment ceased to be a scientific problem to him. As for
1588: me, this scene seemed of one texture with the rest of my existence:
1589: horror was my familiar, and this new revelation was only like an old
1590: pain recurring with new circumstances.
1591: 
1592:        *       *       *       *       *
1593: 
1594: Since then Bertha and I have lived apart--she in her own neighbourhood,
1595: the mistress of half our wealth, I as a wanderer in foreign countries,
1596: until I came to this Devonshire nest to die. Bertha lives pitied and
1597: admired; for what had I against that charming woman, whom every one but
1598: myself could have been happy with? There had been no witness of the
1599: scene in the dying room except Meunier, and while Meunier lived his
1600: lips were sealed by a promise to me.

1602: Once or twice, weary of wandering, I rested in a favourite spot, and my

1605: approach of my old insight--driven away to live continually with the
1606: one Unknown Presence revealed and yet hidden by the moving curtain of
1607: the earth and sky. Till at last disease took hold of me and forced me
1608: to rest here--forced me to live in dependence on my servants. And then
1609: the curse of insight--of my double consciousness, came again, and has
1610: never left me. I know all their narrow thoughts, their feeble regard,
1611: their half-wearied pity.

1614: 
1615: It is the 20th of September, 1850. I know these figures I have just
1616: written, as if they were a long familiar inscription. I have seen them
1617: on this page in my desk unnumbered times, when the scene of my dying
1618: struggle has opened upon me . . .
